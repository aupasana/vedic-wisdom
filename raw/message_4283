They are based on the sense of\nduality. The Self=\r\n is as It is. There is neither dvaita nor advaita, I AM\nTHAT I AM. Simple B=\r\ne-ing is the Self.(Talks, 433).\n\nThose who do not know themselves to be the=\r\n one (non-dual) Self will perish\ndaily, vainly suffering in fear (because o=\r\nf seeing the world as something\nother than themselves). (Therefore) destroy=\r\ning the notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99,\nthe root (of all misery), b=\r\ny gaining the firm knowledge of your real Self,\nattain the state of non-dua=\r\nlity (advaita).   ( GVK - 955)\n\nAdvaita should be in bhava, in the disposit=\r\nion of the mind; it will not do\nfor outside, worldly affairs. You are asked=\r\n to look at everything with\nequality (sama drishti) but can we eat the same=\r\n food that a dog eats? A\nhandful of grain will do for a bird but will that =\r\ndo for us? We eat a\ncertain quantity of food but will that be enough for an=\r\n elephant? So you\nshould have the attitude of Advaita only in bhava, in the=\r\n mind, but you\nshould follow the world in other matters.  - Letter 41\n\n-- \n=\r\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\n\nOn Sun, May 2, 2010 at 3:08 AM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@ch=\r\narter.net&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nice writeup. As long as one rema=\r\nins in duality, there is always a chance\n&gt; of being deluded. However, with =\r\ndue respect, I wish to make a *critical*\n&gt; note with my 2 cents on various =\r\nrealted and unrelated issues. Please allow\n&gt; me.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Because of the igno=\r\nrance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference\n&gt; &gt; [bheda-buddhi] in =\r\nSelf, [even] great devas are disturbed by fear.\n&gt; &gt; [Therefore] it is wise =\r\nto remain without fear in the supreme state of\n&gt; &gt; non-duality, having atta=\r\nined the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through\n&gt; negation\n&gt; &gt; [of the no=\r\nn-Self].\n&gt;\n&gt; It is certainly wise to &quot;remain without fear in the supreme st=\r\nate of\n&gt; non-duality&quot;. However, as you pointed out, &quot;[even] great devas are=\r\n disturbed\n&gt; by fear&quot;. Then how easy can it be for other beings, including =\r\nmembers of\n&gt; this list, to &quot;remain without fear in the supreme state of non=\r\n-duality&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; Please don&#39;t get me wrong. I am not against adwaita or non-d=\r\nuality at all,\n&gt; as those familiar with my writings should know by now. But=\r\n I accept the fact\n&gt; that a huge majority of spiritual seekers are meant to=\r\n remain in duality for\n&gt; many many more lives. A message other than &quot;attain=\r\n the supreme state of\n&gt; non-duality&quot; may be more useful to them at their cu=\r\nrrent stage!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; A great cricket batsman may not ma=\r\nke the greatest coach. Hitting the ball\n&gt; may seem so easy to him and he ma=\r\ny simply say, &quot;look at the ball and hit\n&gt; it.&quot; That much instruction is cer=\r\ntainly not enough for a budding player to\n&gt; start playing like that great p=\r\nlayer.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another gifted coach may observe faults in the technique of the =\r\nbudding\n&gt; player and give some tips. That may turn out to be more useful th=\r\nan the\n&gt; inspiring words from the great player! Of course, no matter how go=\r\nod\n&gt; instructions one gets, the budding player may not play like that great=\r\n\n&gt; player anytime soon! Nevertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Some great teachers, especially of the Adwaita=\r\n philosophy, are like the\n&gt; great cricket batsman in the above analogy. The=\r\ny tell you what is obvious\n&gt; and natural to *them*. Their words are very in=\r\nspiring.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some other teachers fine-tune their message for an audience. T=\r\nhey show a\n&gt; real path (instead of a lofty target) using which one can star=\r\nt making\n&gt; progress. One may or may not reach a supreme state anytime soon,=\r\n but one\n&gt; will start making progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Differen=\r\nt spiritual teachers come for different purposes. The role played\n&gt; by each=\r\n one is important in its own right. Ramana maharshi was undoubtedly a\n&gt; gre=\r\nat master. However, when it comes to the second category of teachers I\n&gt; me=\r\nntioned above, one name that strikes to me instantly is that of\n&gt; Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa. He was a master at fine-tuning his message for the\n&gt; indivi=\r\ndual. While most great masters were adepts in one path (jnaana yoga or\n&gt; bh=\r\nakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga), he was unique in that he\n&gt; experienc=\r\ned the supreme through each path and was equally comfortable\n&gt; guiding peop=\r\nle in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Krishna bhakti, Kaali\n&gt; bhakti, Shiva =\r\nbhakti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, tantra etc, having\n&gt; experienced a=\r\nll. He even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic sadhanas and\n&gt; experienced Jesus=\r\n Christ. He is a unique teacher in the last few millennia.\n&gt; Many other mas=\r\nters take disciples on the path they walked. Having walked all\n&gt; paths to t=\r\nhe summit, Ramakrishna guided disciples on different paths based\n&gt; on their=\r\n aptitude.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Though upanishads and Bhagavad Gita =\r\nare teaching Adwaita clearly, some\n&gt; great masters came in the last few mil=\r\nlennia who taught variations in the\n&gt; Upanishadic philosophy veering toward=\r\ns duality to various degrees. I think\n&gt; this happened for a purpose. As tru=\r\ne Adwaita as taught by Upanishads and\n&gt; Bhagavad Gita becomes more and more=\r\n inappropriate and difficult for the\n&gt; masses, a simpler message that they =\r\ncan understand and that can guide their\n&gt; spiritual lives is needed. I thin=\r\nk the coming of various masters who taught\n&gt; different philosophies is for =\r\nthat reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; The title of the mail was &quot;Fearles=\r\nsness Comes In The Supreme State Of\n&gt; Non-duality&quot;. However, the question i=\r\ns: Does non-duality bring fearlessness\n&gt; or vice versa?\n&gt;\n&gt; A realization o=\r\nf non-dual Self may suddenly happen oneday for some rare\n&gt; persons. For mos=\r\nt, it happens as a result of sadhana done over many\n&gt; years/lives. Thus, qu=\r\nalities like dispassion, fearlessness (which are\n&gt; associated with the supr=\r\neme state) need to be cultivated actively. As they\n&gt; become more and more p=\r\nerfected, one gets closer and closer to\n&gt; Self-realization.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose one=\r\n sees a beautiful/ugly object (or a desirable/undesirable\n&gt; object). When o=\r\nne feels attraction/aversion, one should remind oneself &quot;all\n&gt; is god (Self=\r\n). There is no need for feeling attraction/aversion towards\n&gt; anything.&quot; Wh=\r\nen one feels fear, one should remind oneself &quot;all is god\n&gt; (Self). There is=\r\n no need for be afraid of *anything*&quot;. As one practices\n&gt; this, one&#39;s dispa=\r\nssion and fearlessness increase. Incidents of delusion\n&gt; becomes smaller an=\r\nd less frequent. Eventually, one overcomes.\n&gt;\n&gt; But the tricky part is that=\r\n one needs to perform the actions one is meant\n&gt; to perform and work out th=\r\ne kaarmik debts, before one realizes Self. It is\n&gt; very difficult to perfor=\r\nm actions without feeling even small amounts of\n&gt; attachment, attraction, a=\r\nversion, passion, fear etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; A simple formula is: Give all you can and e=\r\nxpect nothing (and accept\n&gt; whatever you get) in return. In the beginning, =\r\nany\n&gt; attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you feel should be with regard to wh=\r\nat are\n&gt; giving to others and not with regard to what you are expecting fro=\r\nm others.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; It is all easy to write and read theo=\r\nry. The problem comes when one is\n&gt; tested in real life. For example, I cho=\r\nked when eating something once when I\n&gt; was alone and could not breathe. I =\r\nbecame anxious and it made it worse.\n&gt; Suddenly, the thought came to me &quot;wh=\r\nat are you afraid of? Death? This will\n&gt; mostly result in a little sufferin=\r\ng for a couple of minutes and no more.\n&gt; EVEN IF it results in death, what =\r\nis the big deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh\n&gt; (each being who is born is sure=\r\n of deatth). Is there anything I wanted to do\n&gt; and could not do? Well, the=\r\nre may be, but someone else can do it. Why should\n&gt; only Narasimha do it? W=\r\norld will run perfectly fine even if I am not here.\n&gt; If I indeed die now, =\r\nwhy don&#39;t I meditate and focus my mind on god, instead\n&gt; of focusing on my =\r\nlife and getting anxious?&quot; I relaxed and meditated for a\n&gt; few minutes with=\r\n Gayatri mantra. My anxiety went away and I felt nice after\n&gt; a while.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAs one detects and actively suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more,\n=\r\n&gt; such thoughts will become less and less frequent and eventually be\n&gt; supp=\r\nressed by the mind even in the seed/formatory state. Later, causes of\n&gt; tho=\r\nse seeds themselves will be wiped out from the sub-conscious mind. This\n&gt; i=\r\ns how conditioning of the mind is slowly overcome. It is certainly a long\n&gt;=\r\n process for most of us, but one loses nothing by starting and trying to ma=\r\nke\n&gt; progress. Sadhanas like homam and japam aid one in this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please no=\r\nte that even Ramana maharshi and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa did\n&gt; intense sadh=\r\nana for many years, before they could reach the supreme state.\n&gt; No matter =\r\nwho you are, some sadhana is needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; While on t=\r\nhe topic of Adwaita, I want to make one more point. It poses two\n&gt; dangers.=\r\n While the Ultimate Reality is indeed non-dual, *half-baked*\n&gt; understandin=\r\ng of Adwaita philosophy can make one *trivialize* duality on one\n&gt; extreme =\r\nor *glorify* ignorance on the other extreme. Let me explain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Reading th=\r\nat the ultimate reality behind all that we see is the non-dual\n&gt; Self can m=\r\nake some people trivialize the duality that we normally\n&gt; experience. If du=\r\nality is &quot;mithya&quot; (an illusion), how does it matter and how\n&gt; do our action=\r\ns within it matter? It is all, after all, an illusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, a tru=\r\ne student of vedanta will know that the layer of illusion\n&gt; is quite import=\r\nant and cannot be ignored simply because it is an &quot;illusion&quot;.\n&gt; If one&#39;s co=\r\nnsciousness is veiled by the layer of illusion, actions within\n&gt; that layer=\r\n of illusion are required for removing it. It will not magically\n&gt; disappea=\r\nr. After all, yoga vaasishtham emphasizes &quot;actions&quot; in the dual\n&gt; world for=\r\n realizing non-dual Self. Action and knowledge as the two wings\n&gt; with whic=\r\nh the bird of individualized consciousness rises from the ground of\n&gt; duali=\r\nty to reach the sky of true Self.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other extreme,\n&gt;\n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;\n&gt; Enough for now. I have not gone anywhere and still reading the=\r\n list\n&gt; regularly. But I did not have motivation to reply to any recent mai=\r\nls.\n&gt; Basically, if I have no useful or meaningful comment/reply, I keep qu=\r\niet.\n&gt;\n&gt; Intellectual exchanges are interesting, but the thing that matters=\r\n at the\n&gt; end of the day is whether we are doing sincere sadhana or not and=\r\n whether we\n&gt; are progressing or not. It seems to me like several people ar=\r\ne sincerely\n&gt; doing homam/japam and sincerely trying to make progress. Seve=\r\nral more people\n&gt; are about to do the same. THAT is what really matters. Wh=\r\nat we think or say\n&gt; about the world, duality and non-duality is irrelevant=\r\n really. What matters\n&gt; is whether our attitude is changing for the better.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me give one more quick analogy before I st=\r\nop for now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose one is sleeping and seeing an elaborate dream. Supp=\r\nose one is fully\n&gt; absorbed in the dream and weeping in pain when something=\r\n bad happens in the\n&gt; dream and laughing in elation when something good hap=\r\npens in the dream. One\n&gt; can tell that it is bad.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose another perso=\r\nn has read *in the dream* that what one is\n&gt; experiencing is called a &quot;drea=\r\nm&quot; and will end soon and what happens in the\n&gt; dream is irrelevant. Suppose=\r\n one intellectually understands all that and yet\n&gt; weeps in pain when somet=\r\nhing bad happens in the dream and laughs in elation\n&gt; when something good h=\r\nappens in the dream. Is that any better? Of course not.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the other ha=\r\nnd, if one is slowly getting control over the mind and not\n&gt; weeping as oft=\r\nen and not laughing as often, one is perhaps making progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Do whatever your conscience tells you to do. But expect noth=\r\ning in return\n&gt; and accept whatever comes to you as a result. As your accep=\r\ntance increases,\n&gt; the clarity with which your conscience shows you the pat=\r\nh you should take\n&gt; (with regard to your actions) will become better and be=\r\ntter. If your actions\n&gt; were bad in the past (due to unclear guidelines fro=\r\nm conscience or not\n&gt; following your conscience) and you are receiving bad =\r\nfruits, you can still\n&gt; overcome it by learning to accept what comes. As yo=\r\nur acceptance is\n&gt; perfected, your conscience and will power will become pu=\r\nre and your actions\n&gt; will become pure. As actions become pure, newer fruit=\r\ns will be pure.\n&gt; Eventually, you start making progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;       =\r\n           http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;     Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotish=\r\nWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;  Becau=\r\nse of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference\n&gt; &gt; [bhe=\r\nda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fear.\n&gt; &gt; [Therefor=\r\ne] it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of\n&gt; &gt; non-dualit=\r\ny, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through\n&gt; negation\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; [of the non-Self].\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sadhu Om: The nature of jiva is to think tha=\r\nt fear will be removed only\n&gt; when\n&gt; &gt; there is some other person with him.=\r\n But this idea is foolish. How can\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; be cause for fear in the sta=\r\nte of Self, where no other thing exists?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Only in a state where ther=\r\ne exists something other than oneself is it\n&gt; &gt; possible for one either to =\r\nhave desire for that thing or to have fear of\n&gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, true fea=\r\nrlessness can be attained only in the non-dual state\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Self, where n=\r\no other thing exists.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To illustrate how fearlessness can be attaine=\r\nd only when one attains the\n&gt; &gt; state of Self, Sri Bhagavan used to narrate=\r\n the following story:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After Lord Vishnu had killed Hiranya, Hiranya=\r\n=E2=80=99s son Prahlada was happily\n&gt; &gt; ruling the kingdom.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But aft=\r\ner some time, a fear arose in Prahlada. =E2=80=9CBecause Lord Vishnu is\n&gt; k=\r\nind\n&gt; &gt; to me, I am living safely. But if one day He becomes angry with me,=\r\n He\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; kill me just as He killed my father,=E2=80=9D thought Prahla=\r\nda.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Being a great devotee of Lord Vishnu, Prahlada had no one else =\r\nto turn\n&gt; to,\n&gt; &gt; so he\n&gt; &gt; prayed to Him. The Lord immediately appeared be=\r\nfore Prahlada,who then\n&gt; &gt; explained his fear and prayed for the state of f=\r\nearlessness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said Lord Vishnu, =E2=80=9CYou =\r\nare correct. By seeing me like this in name\n&gt; &gt; and form, you cannot be fre=\r\ne from fear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You must see me within yourself.

As =\r\nlong as one remains in duality, there is always a chance of being deluded. =\r\nHowever, with due respect, I wish to make a *critical* note with my 2 cents=\r\n on various realted and unrelated issues. Please allow me.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of differen=\r\nce&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [bheda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fea=\r\nr.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [Therefore] it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme st=\r\nate of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; non-duality, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own=\r\n Self, through negation&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [of the non-Self].&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is certainl=\r\ny wise to &quot;remain without fear in the supreme state of non-duality&quo=\r\nt;. However, as you pointed out, &quot;[even] great devas are disturbed by =\r\nfear&quot;. Then how easy can it be for other beings, including members of =\r\nthis list, to &quot;remain without fear in the supreme state of non-duality=\r\n&quot;?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlease don&#39;t get me wrong. I am not against adwaita =\r\nor non-duality at all, as those familiar with my writings should know by no=\r\nw. But I accept the fact that a huge majority of spiritual seekers are mean=\r\nt to remain in duality for many many more lives. A message other than &quot=\r\n;attain the supreme state of non-duality&quot; may be more useful to them a=\r\nt their current stage!&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nA great cricket batsman may not make the greate=\r\nst coach. Hitting the ball may seem so easy to him and he may simply say, &=\r\nquot;look at the ball and hit it.&quot; That much instruction is certainly =\r\nnot enough for a budding player to start playing like that great player.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnother gifted coach may observe faults in the technique of the bu=\r\ndding player and give some tips. That may turn out to be more useful than t=\r\nhe inspiring words from the great player! Of course, no matter how good ins=\r\ntructions one gets, the budding player may not play like that great player =\r\nanytime soon! Nevertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSome=\r\n great teachers, especially of the Adwaita philosophy, are like the great c=\r\nricket batsman in the above analogy. They tell you what is obvious and natu=\r\nral to *them*. Their words are very inspiring.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSome other teachers=\r\n fine-tune their message for an audience. They show a real path (instead of=\r\n a lofty target) using which one can start making progress. One may or may =\r\nnot reach a supreme state anytime soon, but one will start making progress.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nDifferent spiritual teachers come for different purposes. The role pl=\r\nayed by each one is important in its own right. Ramana maharshi was undoubt=\r\nedly a great master. However, when it comes to the second category of teach=\r\ners I mentioned above, one name that strikes to me instantly is that of Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramahamsa. He was a master at fine-tuning his message for the in=\r\ndividual. While most great masters were adepts in one path (jnaana yoga or =\r\nbhakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga), he was unique in that he experienc=\r\ned the supreme through each path and was equally comfortable guiding people=\r\n in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Krishna bhakti, Kaali bhakti, Shiva bhak=\r\nti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, tantra etc, having experienced all. He=\r\n even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic sadhanas and experienced Jesus Christ.=\r\n He is a unique teacher in the last few millennia. Many other masters take =\r\ndisciples on the path they walked. Having walked all paths to the summit, R=\r\namakrishna guided disciples on different paths based on their aptitude.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nThough upanishads and Bhagavad Gita are teaching Adwaita clearly, some gr=\r\neat masters came in the last few millennia who taught variations in the Upa=\r\nnishadic philosophy veering towards duality to various degrees. I think thi=\r\ns happened for a purpose. As true Adwaita as taught by Upanishads and Bhaga=\r\nvad Gita becomes more and more inappropriate and difficult for the masses, =\r\na simpler message that they can understand and that can guide their spiritu=\r\nal lives is needed. I think the coming of various masters who taught differ=\r\nent philosophies is for that reason.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe title of the mail was &quot;=\r\nFearlessness Comes In The Supreme State Of Non-duality&quot;. However, the =\r\nquestion is: Does non-duality bring fearlessness or vice versa?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nA =\r\nrealization of non-dual Self may suddenly happen oneday for some rare perso=\r\nns. For most, it happens as a result of sadhana done over many years/lives.=\r\n Thus, qualities like dispassion, fearlessness (which are associated with t=\r\nhe supreme state) need to be cultivated actively. As they become more and m=\r\nore perfected, one gets closer and closer to Self-realization.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nS=\r\nuppose one sees a beautiful/ugly object (or a desirable/undesirable object)=\r\n. When one feels attraction/aversion, one should remind oneself &quot;all i=\r\ns god (Self). There is no need for feeling attraction/aversion towards anyt=\r\nhing.&quot; When one feels fear, one should remind oneself &quot;all is god=\r\n (Self). There is no need for be afraid of *anything*&quot;. As one practic=\r\nes this, one&#39;s dispassion and fearlessness increase. Incidents of delus=\r\nion becomes smaller and less frequent. Eventually, one overcomes.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nBut the tricky part is that one needs to perform the actions one is meant=\r\n to perform and work out the kaarmik debts, before one realizes Self. It is=\r\n very difficult to perform actions without feeling even small amounts of at=\r\ntachment, attraction, aversion, passion, fear etc.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nA simple form=\r\nula is: Give all you can and expect nothing (and accept whatever you get) i=\r\nn return. In the beginning, any attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you feel s=\r\nhould be with regard to what are giving to others and not with regard to wh=\r\nat you are expecting from others.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*=\r\n =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt is all easy to write and read the=\r\nory. The problem comes when one is tested in real life. For example, I chok=\r\ned when eating something once when I was alone and could not breathe. I bec=\r\name anxious and it made it worse. Suddenly, the thought came to me &quot;wh=\r\nat are you afraid of? Death? This will mostly result in a little suffering =\r\nfor a couple of minutes and no more. EVEN IF it results in death, what is t=\r\nhe big deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh (each being who is born is sure of de=\r\natth). Is there anything I wanted to do and could not do? Well, there may b=\r\ne, but someone else can do it. Why should only Narasimha do it? World will =\r\nrun perfectly fine even if I am not here. If I indeed die now, why don&#39;=\r\nt I meditate and focus my mind on god, instead of focusing on my life and g=\r\netting anxious?&quot; I relaxed and meditated for a few minutes with Gayatr=\r\ni mantra. My anxiety went away and I felt nice after a while.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs=\r\n one detects and actively suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more, su=\r\nch thoughts will become less and less frequent and eventually be suppressed=\r\n by the mind even in the seed/formatory state. Later, causes of those seeds=\r\n themselves will be wiped out from the sub-conscious mind. This is how cond=\r\nitioning of the mind is slowly overcome. It is certainly a long process for=\r\n most of us, but one loses nothing by starting and trying to make progress.=\r\n Sadhanas like homam and japam aid one in this.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlease note that=\r\n even Ramana maharshi and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa did intense sadhana for m=\r\nany years, before they could reach the supreme state. No matter who you are=\r\n, some sadhana is needed.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhile on the topic of Adwaita, I want to mak=\r\ne one more point. It poses two dangers. While the Ultimate Reality is indee=\r\nd non-dual, *half-baked* understanding of Adwaita philosophy can make one *=\r\ntrivialize* duality on one extreme or *glorify* ignorance on the other extr=\r\neme. Let me explain.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nReading that the ultimate reality behind al=\r\nl that we see is the non-dual Self can make some people trivialize the dual=\r\nity that we normally experience. If duality is &quot;mithya&quot; (an illus=\r\nion), how does it matter and how do our actions within it matter? It is all=\r\n, after all, an illusion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nOf course, a true student of vedanta w=\r\nill know that the layer of illusion is quite important and cannot be ignore=\r\nd simply because it is an &quot;illusion&quot;. If one&#39;s consciousness =\r\nis veiled by the layer of illusion, actions within that layer of illusion a=\r\nre required for removing it. It will not magically disappear. After all, yo=\r\nga vaasishtham emphasizes &quot;actions&quot; in the dual world for realizi=\r\nng non-dual Self. Action and knowledge as the two wings with which the bird=\r\n of individualized consciousness rises from the ground of duality to reach =\r\nthe sky of true Self.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn the other extreme,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nEnough for now.=\r\n I have not gone anywhere and still reading the list regularly. But I did n=\r\not have motivation to reply to any recent mails. Basically, if I have no us=\r\neful or meaningful comment/reply, I keep quiet.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIntellectual excha=\r\nnges are interesting, but the thing that matters at the end of the day is w=\r\nhether we are doing sincere sadhana or not and whether we are progressing o=\r\nr not. It seems to me like several people are sincerely doing homam/japam a=\r\nnd sincerely trying to make progress. Several more people are about to do t=\r\nhe same. THAT is what really matters. What we think or say about the world,=\r\n duality and non-duality is irrelevant really. What matters is whether our =\r\nattitude is changing for the better.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLet me give one more quick analo=\r\ngy before I stop for now.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSuppose one is sleeping and seeing an el=\r\naborate dream. Suppose one is fully absorbed in the dream and weeping in pa=\r\nin when something bad happens in the dream and laughing in elation when som=\r\nething good happens in the dream. One can tell that it is bad.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nS=\r\nuppose another person has read *in the dream* that what one is experiencing=\r\n is called a &quot;dream&quot; and will end soon and what happens in the dr=\r\neam is irrelevant. Suppose one intellectually understands all that and yet =\r\nweeps in pain when something bad happens in the dream and laughs in elation=\r\n when something good happens in the dream. Is that any better? Of course no=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn the other hand, if one is slowly getting control over the =\r\nmind and not weeping as often and not laughing as often, one is perhaps mak=\r\ning progress.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0*&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDo whatever your conscience tells you to do. But expect no=\r\nthing in return and accept whatever comes to you as a result. As your accep=\r\ntance increases, the clarity with which your conscience shows you the path =\r\nyou should take (with regard to your actions) will become better and better=\r\n. If your actions were bad in the past (due to unclear guidelines from cons=\r\ncience or not following your conscience) and you are receiving bad fruits, =\r\nyou can still overcome it by learning to accept what comes. As your accepta=\r\nnce is perfected, your conscience and will power will become pure and your =\r\nactions will become pure. As actions become pure, newer fruits will be pure=\r\n.

H=\r\now can there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be cause for fear in the state of Self, where no othe=\r\nr thing exists?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Only in a state where there exists someth=\r\ning other than oneself is it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; possible for one either to have desir=\r\ne for that thing or to have fear of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Therefore, true fearlessne=\r\nss can be attained only in the non-dual state of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Self, where no ot=\r\nher thing exists.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To illustrate how fearlessness can be a=\r\nttained only when one attains the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; state of Self, Sri Bhagavan used=\r\n to narrate the following story:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; After Lord Vishnu had ki=\r\nlled Hiranya, Hiranya=E2=80=99s son Prahlada was happily&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ruling th=\r\ne kingdom.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But after some time, a fear arose in Prahlada.=\r\n =E2=80=9CBecause Lord Vishnu is kind&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to me, I am living safely. B=\r\nut if one day He becomes angry with me, He will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kill me just as He=\r\n killed my father,=E2=80=9D thought Prahlada.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Being a gre=\r\nat devotee of Lord Vishnu, Prahlada had no one else to turn to,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; so=\r\n he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; prayed to Him. The Lord immediately appeared before Prahlada,w=\r\nho then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; explained his fear and prayed for the state of fearlessnes=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said Lord Vishnu, =E2=80=9CYou =\r\nare correct. By seeing me like this in name&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and form, you cannot b=\r\ne free from fear.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You must see me within yourself. Only w=\r\nhen you thus realize me to be not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; different from yourself, will yo=\r\nu attain the state of fearlessness=E2=80=9D. Then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the Lord taught =\r\nhim the path of Self-enquiry. When Prahlada followed the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord=E2=\r\n=80=99s instructions and realized Self, he attained the state of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; f=\r\nearlessness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This story thus illustrates that even God ca=\r\nnnot serve as permanent refuge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from fear so long as one retains th=\r\ne sense of difference [bheda-buddhi].&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Only by attaining the non-du=\r\nal Self can one become truly and permanently&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; free from fear.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Source: GURU VACHAKA KOVAI The Light of Supreme Truth or THE C=\r\nOLLECTION OF&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; GURU=E2=80=99S SAYINGS translated from original Tamil=\r\n By Sadhu Om and Michael James&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Guru Vachaka Kovai is the =\r\nbiggest collection of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s spoken teachings&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that was=\r\n thoroughly checked and revised by him during his lifetime.
