Reading Vishnu&#39;s 1000 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n names can NEVER harm you. NEVER. It may increase good results or decrease =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; bad results, but never increase bad results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly, the sy=\r\nmptoms you are describing sound a lot like some movement of \n&gt; &gt; praana (li=\r\nfe force) in some of the upper chakras. This is not a bad thing at \n&gt; &gt; all=\r\n. If some other pieces of the puzzle fall in place, this can actually \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhelp your spiritual progress considerably.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of telling you =\r\nto stop Vishnu sahasranaam, I will suggest increasing \n&gt; &gt; the number of ti=\r\nmes you read it. If you spend an hour in the morning and an \n&gt; &gt; hour in th=\r\ne evening, it will be awesome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, if it is possible, doing a=\r\n homam every morning with Vishnu \n&gt; &gt; sahasranaam will accelerate the progr=\r\ness.
