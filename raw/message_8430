It is weird to se=\r\ne how the body loses all importance the moment it dies. It is also strange =\r\nhow a dead body looks just like an empty house...exactly like someone just =\r\nleft. It certainly makes one think that there must be something more to us =\r\nthan this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattractive in old age, fill=\r\ned with appalling miseries in serious illness, and hideous in death. \n\nIt i=\r\ns interesting to think about what one can do to help the sick and dying, wh=\r\nen they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch som=\r\neone die while feeling utterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n\nSivananda u=\r\nsed to have great faith in the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;.=\r\n While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used t=\r\no say that, Namapathy was an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us=\r\n on all levels- physical, mental and spiritual. \n\nWhile he said all names o=\r\nf God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Maha=\r\nmrityunjaya mantra specially for healing purposes. And especially for those=\r\n who are very sick or dying.\n\nHe says &quot;Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra will remove =\r\naccidents, incurable diseases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a=\r\n Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n\nI visited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattam=\r\nadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there,=\r\n start the day with chanting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for=\r\n their patients, each other and the whole world. I believe it is the same w=\r\nith the little Ashram hospital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start =\r\nthe day.....repeating mantras with your colleagues. \n\nI wanted to mention t=\r\nhe power of this mantra for anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously =\r\nill (or indeed, if you yourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to =\r\ninvoke the blessing of God to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering bet=\r\nter. Basically saying &quot;Thy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of =\r\ncourse it is NOT asking for a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the W=\r\nill of God). \n\nAt any point in time, there are several human beings, animal=\r\ns and various creatures who are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly =\r\nduring the process of dying. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra=\r\n a few times daily to reduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I be=\r\nlieve them. \n \nHere is a link for those who are interested in learning more=\r\n about this great mantra. The article is written by a disciple of Swami Sat=\r\nyananda, a saint of very recent times. \n\nhttp://www.yogamag.net/archives/20=\r\n07/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
