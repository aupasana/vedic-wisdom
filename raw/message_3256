The chart of AP formation given below clearly shows the in amicab=\r\nle dasa and antar dasa periods i.e. (Saturn the lord of 8th house depicts t=\r\nrouble, sun the antar dasa lord in debilitated position). And the transit p=\r\nosition of Saturn with lagna lord and the debilitated mars in lagna (which =\r\nis in 8th house in natal) causing instability in government. And in Decembe=\r\nr when Jupiter enters Aquarius i.e. 6th house from natal moon & 8th from la=\r\ngna the situation will be more in amicable for the state, which may lead fo=\r\nr separation. One more thing is the differences between center and state go=\r\nvernment is due to the Sun dasa period of India and Saturn-sun dasa period =\r\nof AP state. \n\nFormation: 01-11-1956,\nTime :00:00:00\nPlace: hyderabad\n\nWith=\r\n regards,\nraj\n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
