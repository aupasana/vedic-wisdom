Even if one does not think \n&gt; in those terms, it =\r\nstill happens. It is incorrect to say that one can \n&gt; realize the highest t=\r\nruths without Kundalini awakened. A more accurate \n&gt; statement would be tha=\r\nt one can realize the highest truths without engaging \n&gt; in any specific pr=\r\nactices geared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people followin=\r\ng the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha \n&gt; yoga paths specific=\r\nally try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices are \n&gt; not at all nee=\r\nded for awakening Kundalini. People belonging to various \n&gt; traditions and =\r\npaths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience Kundalini \n&gt; awakening,=\r\n without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. There \n&gt; are a l=\r\not of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Kundali=\r\nni is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and \n&gt; raised=\r\n kundalini implies a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the lo=\r\nwest level, we bind our selves to specific bodies and our \n&gt; self-awareness=\r\n is limited to a body, a name and other things associated with \n&gt; the body =\r\nand name. This experience of self as a body corresponds to \n&gt; Kundalini sle=\r\neping at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the \n&gt; undifferentiated S=\r\nelf, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This \n&gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self =\r\ncorresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As \n&gt; self-awareness goes from the f=\r\normer to the latter, it may traverse through \n&gt; many stages in between. Cor=\r\nrespondingly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nKundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first time, like =\r\na \n&gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down again and th=\r\ne \n&gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work =\r\nits \n&gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable \n&gt;=\r\n conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the time of=\r\n \n&gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high throu=\r\ngh \n&gt; the impurities. This may manifest physically as a powerful experience=\r\n \n&gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are thousa=\r\nnds of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path taken \n&gt; by Kundalini =\r\nas it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may change from \n&gt; person t=\r\no person, based on the impurities in various nadis. The exact \n&gt; &quot;experienc=\r\ne&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed and the final point \n&gt; reached=\r\n by self-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt; \n&gt; I actually know one=\r\n person who had kundalini awakening, rise to Sahasrara \n&gt; and samadhi for 7=\r\n days, all happening at the same time. His nadis had \n&gt; already been purifi=\r\ned. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went into \n&gt; samadhi, stayed there=\r\n for 7 days and came back as a fully realized person. \n&gt; But it is a much l=\r\nonger journey for most.\n&gt; \n&gt; Saying &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini aw=\r\nakening&quot; is difficult. The \n&gt; exact experience changes from person to perso=\r\nn, depending on the path \n&gt; traversed the final point reached by Kundalini.=\r\n However, I can say one thing \n&gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens =\r\nand rises, one will not have any \n&gt; confusion about what happened. But, unt=\r\nil kundalini awakening occurs, one \n&gt; may confuse various other experiences=\r\n (such as some movement of vayu in \n&gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement=\r\n and wrongly think that kundalini is \n&gt; awakened.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head a=\r\nre NOT \n&gt; due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little v=\r\naayu \n&gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a=\r\n \n&gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the \n&gt; =\r\nsensation of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sensation =\r\n\n&gt; of having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting normally in=\r\n \n&gt; reality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; \n&gt; As a reference, I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He w=\r\nas \n&gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few m=\r\nonths \n&gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, h=\r\ne had \n&gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninformed a=\r\nbout \n&gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specific raj=\r\na/hatha \n&gt; yoga practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect and ey=\r\nes closed \n&gt; and meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini=\r\n awakening, he \n&gt; started experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru t=\r\nold him not to be \n&gt; distracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra=\r\n and try to forget \n&gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on an expe=\r\nrience, it gets stuck \n&gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt; \n&gt; When he was medit=\r\nating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely focused \n&gt; on the mantra=\r\n and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly he became \n&gt; aware of his =\r\nbody. It felt like there was a really tremendous explosion at \n&gt; the base o=\r\nf his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of electric current \n&gt; was goi=\r\nng up his spine from the base. Then it felt like he was not a body \n&gt; but a=\r\n small point. Then it felt like he was going up like a rocket at a \n&gt; treme=\r\nndous speed. Then it felt like there was a tremendously bright white \n&gt; lig=\r\nht and there was nothing else. It felt like he was not a small point in \n&gt; =\r\nthat light, but he was the light itself. There was an undescribable sense o=\r\nf \n&gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is t=\r\nhis? \n&gt; What happened to my body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he b=\r\necame \n&gt; aware of himself as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left poo=\r\nja room \n&gt; and went out, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For=\r\n example, a \n&gt; serial was coming on TV and characters in the serial that he=\r\n normally \n&gt; disliked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like re=\r\nal people and \n&gt; he had great love and compassion for those TV serial chara=\r\ncters (and other \n&gt; real people too). That state of love and compassion las=\r\nted a while and then \n&gt; he was normal.\n&gt; \n&gt; This short experience was only =\r\nthe beginning of a journey. He experienced \n&gt; many things later on. These e=\r\nxperiences were different from each other. As I \n&gt; said earlier, the experi=\r\nence varies based on the path traversed and the \n&gt; point reached by the sel=\r\nf-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions, \n&gt; kundalini rose and he saw=\r\n several sights and several beings within and heard \n&gt; several sounds, incl=\r\nuding veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; \n&gt; He realized the tr=\r\nansientness of a lot that we cling on to and the existence \n&gt; of something =\r\nfar higher and more permanent.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this slowly started to change his a=\r\nttitude. His senses turned inwards \n&gt; and he critically started to analyze =\r\nhis own thoughts and motives and worked \n&gt; on correcting his attitude. The =\r\nimpact of what was happening around him, \n&gt; what others did and said starte=\r\nd to make lesser and lesser impact on him. \n&gt; Luckily, he had a guru who pu=\r\nt things in perspective and said that kundalini \n&gt; awakening was just a beg=\r\ninning and the real work was ahead. Depending on \n&gt; one&#39;s readiness, that r=\r\neal work can take many many years or even lives.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the ris=\r\ne of \n&gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of p=\r\neople \n&gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself.=\r\n Very few \n&gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after, but end up gettin=\r\ng stuck there. \n&gt; Very very few make it to higher chakras. And a very small=\r\n minority actually \n&gt; realise self.\n&gt; \n&gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sth=\r\nita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna in \n&gt; BhagavadGita is the only real =\r\nend goal of sadhana, whether you are into raja \n&gt; yoga or karma yoga or bha=\r\nkti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical \n&gt; experience can only dist=\r\nract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, especially \n&gt; those who respect m=\r\ny advice, to forget about kundalini and chakras and just \n&gt; keep doing homa=\r\nm and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep \n&gt; purifying themselv=\r\nes with sadhana, keep working on their attitude and \n&gt; thought process and =\r\nkeep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes \n&gt; purified and one =\r\novercomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini WILL \n&gt; happen autom=\r\natically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and mystical \n&gt; experien=\r\nces is a big deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; sadhana. =\r\nInstead of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate the \n&gt; way you=\r\nr mind works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will \n&gt; automatically=\r\n follow.

How c=\r\nan i \n&gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience=\r\n of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality i=\r\ns effaced such that the deity&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadh=\r\nak experiences himself as that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There then aris=\r\nes no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain thi=\r\nng to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which appe=\r\nars to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; devatas ma=\r\nke the person care almost for nothing himself, so self \n&gt; &gt; &gt; identificatio=\r\nn is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me which is black magic.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher sha=\r\nkti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then you=\r\nr power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). Aft=\r\ner the death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deit=\r\ny or if he was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm =\r\nreserved for these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the =\r\nfull bearing of karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some peopl=\r\ne may realise this to their detriment( \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Na=\r\nth burying the city of Patan with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake).=\r\n Some people may even equate this with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is on=\r\nly action and reaction.(Bit like you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you=\r\n will get a result of this from that same Atma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe=\r\n 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identify=\r\ning with the universe and has very few karmas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Univers=\r\ne itself attacks you, because your attack is not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but=\r\n on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in=\r\n using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is =\r\nonly a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds=\r\n and intellects will not be free of identification with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and=\r\n so their actions are those which are generally termed as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magi=\r\nc. These people usually join the same spirits which they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; been u=\r\nsing after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if som=\r\nebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; even in this=\r\n birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheiv=\r\ne after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort).=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime m=\r\nay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and m=\r\nay not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of =\r\nthe pudding is in the eating, so let me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; re=\r\nititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As li=\r\nttle movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your incl=\r\nination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not ju=\r\nst the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 h=\r\nrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you star=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Long and=\r\n short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sad=\r\nhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pos=\r\nsible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being di=\r\nscussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may p=\r\nost this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that thi=\r\ns is suitable.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
