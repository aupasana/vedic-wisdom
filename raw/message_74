Its always good to meet fel=\r\nlow \ntravellers on the way and say hi, or namaste or whatever.\n\nFor some ye=\r\nars now i try to do sadhana regularly...not expecting \nanything in particul=\r\nar...just trying to be in the present and live \neach moment with awareness.=\r\n\n\nApart from the practices it is the following shlokas / mantras which \nhav=\r\ne helped, i think...\n\n&quot;Sahana vavatu....&quot;\n&quot;Asato Maa....&quot;\n&quot;Om namo bhagvate=\r\n vasudevaya....&quot;\n\nThe first two are part of the practices. the third is wha=\r\nt goes on in \nthe mind sometimes....without much prompting.\n\nyesterday i re=\r\nad something about Rahu-Jupiter connection that set me \nthinking. i know th=\r\nis is not an astrology forum and studying charts \nare a no, no. I also know=\r\n that when we are on the path of sadhana, \nastrology should not distract us=\r\n. But some distraction did occur when \ni read about what rahu does to jupit=\r\ner.\n\nMy guru says that we should have no expectations....if something \nhapp=\r\nens its good....if nothing happens it may be even better...\n\nsomethings hav=\r\ne happened that i am aware of....some things may be \nhappening that i am no=\r\nt aware of....\n\nbut what i read about the Rahu-jupiter connection is that s=\r\nometimes \nrahu eats up jupiter...i dont know what that means.\n\ni have rahu =\r\nin 8th with Mars in Saggi opposed by Sun-Jupiter-Mercury \ncombo in 2nd. The=\r\nre is a constant battle between Rahu and Jupiter \nthat i am conscious of in=\r\n my mind....because i dont know the reality.\n\ni also know that no astrologi=\r\ncal answer holds the key. but still i \nwould like to ask what such an oppos=\r\nition signifies...\n\nits also ok if i dont get a response since this is not =\r\nan astro forum.\n\nLet us all think that nomatter what Jupiter&#39;s light will a=\r\nlways shine.\n\nBest regards,\n\nVinita\n\n\n(birth particulars for those astrolog=\r\nically inclined...3rd July 1954; \n2.43 a.m.; Lucknow, India)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
