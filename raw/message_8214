However, in my opinion,\nit is not a pre-requisite for homa or any other spiritual practice.\n\nWhat I know is that homa is helping me develop a sense of spirituality, and\nis teaching me the true meaning of scriptures (without having to &quot;study&quot;\nthem). Sanskrit has helped me, but those who do homa with zero sanskrit\nknowledge will progress just fine.\n\nAs a result of saying that homa is a powerful spiritual practice, some\npeople have become scared of it. Homa is a simple, regular, normal, everday\nspiritual karma that is extremely &quot;light&quot; and safe for those who are doing\nit as a spiritual practice. After all, shastra has told us that everyone\nshould do it, starting from a very young age.\n\n\n&gt; Many words in samskrita (not &#39;sanskrit&#39;)\n\n\nWhen I speak in English, I say and write Sanskrit. When I speak in\nSanskrit, I say and write &quot;samskritam&quot;. In English, it *is* Sanskrit, in\nspite of what the current &#39;speak samskritam&#39; movement has to say about it.\nAnd anyways, this has nothing whatsoever to do with our discussion :-)\n\n\n&gt; Many words in samskrita have multiple layers of meanings\n\n\nWhat a wonderful language. One of my favorite mantras is the popular mantra\nthat is recited as a prayer to the earth &quot;pRthvi tvayA ...&quot;. Actually, this\nis known as the &quot;Asana-mahAmantra&quot;, and it is quite a nice\nmahAmantra. People who use it should try focusing on it, rather than just\nquickly reciting it while their body is not still.
