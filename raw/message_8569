Is it simply a self-indulgent past =\r\ntime that I should put aside for more important things?&#39; Why am I doing thi=\r\ns when no one is ready to listen to my CRY and longing for my MAHADEV. All =\r\nthey want is their family, their children, knee pain, stomach pain, marriag=\r\ne, children, money =85the list is endless. Is the ego flaring up its ugly h=\r\nead =96 causing me to face my inner demons and doubts, to face my fears and=\r\n stories. I can see it - my alter ego, the other me that likes colors, laug=\r\nhter and light just like a dressed up child in her mother&#39;s clothes.\n\nSo th=\r\nis is my check up time with my mother - I am asking her all these questions=\r\n - why exactly is she making me spend time on certain things ( clearly the =\r\nego does too) =96 be it writing, reading, eating, running, watching tv, com=\r\nplaining, working etc=85 Or should I even be asking HER this question. A pa=\r\nrt of me says if I don&#39;t ask my mother then who can I ask. Who will hold me=\r\n in her lap and make sure I walk in all three or four stages, thinking of h=\r\ner only , waking sleeping and meditating.\n\nWhy do I write? I write to allow=\r\n my inner thoughts to unfold, release, and be free, the bottleneck that app=\r\nears because of my love for HER once I purge, SHE appears. I purge my self =\r\nand share my connection with HER with all of you.  HERE I am hiding in a co=\r\nrner but I can reveal my deep thoughts to you Unlimited by the doubt that t=\r\nakes over when I try to express my thoughts through the limits of sound, th=\r\nroat, time and voice=85. My insecurities are unfettered by the written word=\r\n, less restricted than my throat and uncertain, meek voice. I write to upli=\r\nft, I write to uplift, I write to sing her beauty, and I write to allow for=\r\n space and freedom. \n\nThen I know that this is where I need to spend my tim=\r\ne =96 it is not self-absorbed, it is self-giving and in turn self-receiving=\r\n=85 The more I give the more I get from HER, that is what keeps me going fo=\r\nr more. This is my gift of love to all; that which inspires and creates spa=\r\nce for my true self. I write to open up my heart and when my heart needs to=\r\n shut down the sadness, the uncertainty; I write. I write to clear space in=\r\n my mind for the bank of inspired ideas that seem to have no end =96 space =\r\ncreated in order for my mind not to shut down in protest, exhaustion =96 to=\r\n prevent it from saying there is no more room at the inn, no more deposits =\r\nto be made, I am full up. Purging the ideas and thoughts from my heart and =\r\nsoul=85 creating room for breathe, for clarity =96 allowing more inspired e=\r\nnergy to flow through me =96 I am simply the vessel, these ideas are not un=\r\nique to me, I am merely the channel through which they flow. These words ha=\r\nve been written over and over again.  \n\nI write because then I am able to S=\r\nHARE HER with you, at times I do not wish to share I am good at it and terr=\r\nible, all in one, broken sentence. Because at times I have so much to say t=\r\nhat it overwhelms me.  I write my own emotions scare me =96 I feel the need=\r\n to share this minor and major insights/truths/revelation that I have appea=\r\nred in front of me. I write because then SHE splendor becomes clear to me. =\r\nI see HER appear in front of me through these words.\n\nTHEN SHE SAYS TO ME -=\r\n keep going, walk you must and walk alone. She says - keep going =96 yin an=\r\nd yang balance in your life, forcing the self-assuredness that at times wav=\r\ners. SHIV SHIV SHIV. Let go of fear and take a hold of your life =96 you ar=\r\ne the one responsible, no one else.  My SHIV has created a space with me wh=\r\nere no one resides but HIM. MY SHIV Allow me to go home, guide me to my hom=\r\ne.\n\nOm\n\nRajyalaxmi\n\n\n"}}
