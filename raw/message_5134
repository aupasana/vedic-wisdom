While many ethical syst=\r\nems espouse some form of non-violent ethic or another, what makes the Vedic=\r\n practice of ahimsa radically unique from other systems is the universal sc=\r\nope of its concern. For most ethical schools of thought, the concept of eth=\r\nical concern extends no further than the human race. The criteria for wheth=\r\ner or not a being is worthy of being the object of compassion is determined=\r\n by the species of the being involved. For Dharmis (followers of Sanatana D=\r\nharma), on the other hand, all living creatures are worthy of respect, comp=\r\nassion and ethical concern, regardless of whether they are human or non-hum=\r\nan.  The entire realm of living beings thus falls within the scope of moral=\r\n concern. It is in keeping with this ethic of valuing all life that thought=\r\nful Dharmis follow a strict vegetarian diet, a diet which seeks to reduce s=\r\nuffering to its minimal level....&quot;\n\n\nVISIT HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS AR=\r\nTICLE:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/forum/content.php?101-Sanatana-Dharma-=\r\nVegetarianism\n\n\nPlease forward this to all sincere spiritual seekers.
