Moreover, it is tough to capture \nsome of these ideas=\r\n in words, as words convey slightly different meaning to \ndifferent people,=\r\n based on their life experiences and predispositions.\n\nYes, there is no for=\r\nmula that ensures self-realization in a certain amount of \ntime and it come=\r\ns to one through the grace of God. However, grace of God does \nnot come to =\r\njust about anyone - it comes to one who is *ready* to receive it. \nOne beco=\r\nmes ready to receive it, through the effort put in this life and all \nprevi=\r\nous lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditioning. So effort and sadhana \n=\r\nare not useless. The effort we are talking about here is not effort to acqu=\r\nire \nsomething, but effort to give up something.\n\nThough it is not incorrec=\r\nt, the view that things are given only by God&#39;s grace \ncan, when misunderst=\r\nood, promote inaction. God&#39;s grace does not come to a lazy \nperson doing no=\r\nthing and waiting for God&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace does not work \narbitrarily. =\r\nGod&#39;s grace comes to one who has perfect surrender to God. Perfect \nsurrend=\r\ner does not come automatically. Though effort and sadhana do not \nguarantee=\r\n perfect surrender in a certain amount of time, they do bring it \neventuall=\r\ny.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; whatever one does it is based on past karmas only\n\nFruits of p=\r\nast karmas decide one&#39;s current situation and constrain one&#39;s current \nkarm=\r\nas (actions). But they do not completely decide one&#39;s current karmas. One&#39;s=\r\n \ncurrent karma is in one&#39;s hands (within the constraints).\n\nOf course, one=\r\n can ask: Does one have a free will that acts or does an \nall-pervading sha=\r\nkti act through one? I am quoting a small portion from \nvedic-wisdom messag=\r\ne 5009 \n(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:\n\nA=\r\nll pervading shakti works through all of us and expresses through all of ou=\r\nr \ndesires, actions and knowledge. But then, some universal rules of action=\r\n and \nreaction govern how this works. Under the push of one&#39;s own previous =\r\nkarmas, one \nis placed in situations that are conducive to certain desires,=\r\n actions and \nawareness. The current karmas in those situations may further=\r\n modify the \nmomentum of the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though =\r\none&#39;s current \ndesires, actions and awareness are actually the work of the =\r\nall pervading \nshakti, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It depends on how=\r\n we look at it and \nhow we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ga=\r\nnges water in a small \ncup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges=\r\n water in a cup in freezing \nweather are all Ganges water, they are differe=\r\nnt too. One is more, one is less, \none is warm and one is icy. Similarly, t=\r\nhe work of all pervading shakti is\ndifferent when expressed through differe=\r\nnt vessels (people) in different \nsituations.\n\nAs long as one actually feel=\r\ns internally (despite what one may say or pretend \nexternally) that one&#39;s d=\r\nesires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s own, one is \nperforming karmas and =\r\nis bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. Only when the\nrealization that=\r\n it is all the work of the all pervading shakti becomes full and \ncompletel=\r\ny internalized, does one become free from the cycle of actions and \nreactio=\r\nns. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through one to give appropriate \n=\r\nreactions to actions one thinks one is performing.\n\n* * *\n\nIn astrological =\r\nterms, horoscope is the sum total of previous karmas, whose \nfruits one wil=\r\nl have to face. They show the circumstances faced by one. They do \nnot and =\r\ncannot determine what actions one engages in, though certain actions are \nm=\r\nore likely in certain circumstances.\n\nDestiny is the sum total of the react=\r\nions to the actions committed by one&#39;s free \nwill. Today&#39;s actions of free =\r\nwill become destiny tomorrow (i.e. on a future \ndate or in a future life).\n=\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish text=\r\nbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyo=\r\ntish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n\n---- hramalingam@... wr=\r\note: \n&gt; Samadi state is not like getting a degree by hardwork It comes to c=\r\nertain \n&gt;people by the Grace of GOD Till GOD or Soul decides to reveal the =\r\nSamadi state \n&gt;whatever one does it is based on past karmas only\n&gt; Ramanapa=\r\ntham\n&gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Netw=\r\nork.

However, we \n&gt;cannot compare ourselves with special beings and we sh=\r\nould follow rules and \n&gt;austerities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may sc=\r\nore a century with a terrible \n&gt;backache, but we should not walk out to bat=\r\n with a backache and should try to be \n&gt;healthy. After all, we may not be a=\r\nble to score runs well even when in perfect \n&gt;health!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; By th=\r\ne way, it must be realized that external rules are only meant as a \n&gt;*catal=\r\nyst* in enabling internal transformation. The goal of all sadhana - \n&gt;medit=\r\nation, japam, homam, bhajan, service to others etc - is internal \n&gt;transfor=\r\nmation. If the internal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet \n&gt;t=\r\no work.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; If a room has a window outside of which there is he=\r\navy wind that is constantly \n&gt;blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweeping=\r\n the room with a broom does not \n&gt;eliminate dirt. First close the window or=\r\n stop the wind. Similarly, praanaayaama \n&gt;is not enough to purify the nadis=\r\n and give mental purity, if mind (room) is \n&gt;attached to the objects percei=\r\nved by senses (window).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; If one reads scriptures and teachin=\r\ngs of saints, contemplates on them, \n&gt;constantly analyzes inner motives beh=\r\nind various actions by oneself and tries to \n&gt;change one&#39;s own thinking slo=\r\nwly, this process of contemplation and \n&gt;introspection will augment one&#39;s e=\r\nxternal sadhana (such as meditation, japam, \n&gt;homam, bhajan, service etc) a=\r\nnd purifies one faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, it is useless to think =\r\nin terms of Kundalini, awakening Kundalini \n&gt;and raising Kundalini. Such th=\r\noughts are almost guaranteed to either block \n&gt;Kundalini from rising or fro=\r\nm reaching the highest it can.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbo=\r\nl of one&#39;s own self-awareness. Though \n&gt;one is the infinite Self (Purusha),=\r\n one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited object in the \n&gt;field of duality (Shakti) spri=\r\nnging in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why Kundalini \n&gt;shakti is worshipped as a =\r\nform of the divine Mother (Shakti). This \n&gt;self-awareness is normally &quot;slee=\r\nping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is so and so \n&gt;person and so and so body w=\r\nithout questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is why Kundalini \n&gt;is portrayed as slee=\r\nping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka or physical realm). As \n&gt;Kundalini awake=\r\nns and rises to other chakras (other lokas or realms of \n&gt;awareness), one&#39;s=\r\n understanding of who one is gets refined. When Kundalini \n&gt;reaches sahasra=\r\nra, one is aware of true Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is=\r\n a Kundalini shakti at so and so point \n&gt;in this body. It should now rise t=\r\no so and so point in this body&quot;, it will focus \n&gt;and limit one&#39;s self-aware=\r\nness to the *physical body* and hence one&#39;s Kundalini \n&gt;will remain in mool=\r\naadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise, one needs to \n&gt;completely forget abo=\r\nut the physical body and stop thinking in terms of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, *ve=\r\nry few* people actually experience Kundalini in higher chakras, \n&gt;though ma=\r\nny talk about it. Kundalini is in Moolaadhaara chakra or atmost \n&gt;Swadhisht=\r\nhana chakra in most yogis, even advanced and awakened ones. When praana \n&gt;v=\r\naayu flows in some higher chakras, that too can result in a powerful \n&gt;expe=\r\nrience. Some may mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want a g=\r\nood score in the examination, study well. Stop thinking too much \n&gt;about (a=\r\nnd anticipating) the examination and focus on the subject instead. \n&gt;Study,=\r\n study, study. Similarly, forget about kundalini, forget about chakras, \n&gt;f=\r\norget about the body even. Do sadhana, do sadhana and do sadhana. Read \n&gt;sc=\r\nriptures and teachings of great saints. Instead of looking externally and \n=\r\n&gt;judging others, observe your own actions and thoughts, analyze what is dri=\r\nving \n&gt;them and consciously try to eliminate wrong motives that stem from f=\r\nalse ego, \n&gt;adharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonn=\r\ness, jealosy), \n&gt;i.e. put to use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachi=\r\nngs of saints. Oneday, \n&gt;Kundalini will rise automatically.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,=\r\n\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sar=\r\naswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-astro=\r\nlogy@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &quot;For instance, without a vegetarian diet, asana siddhi is im=\r\npossible.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Nothing is impossible.

Mo=\r\nreover, it is tough to capture some of these ideas in words, as words conve=\r\ny slightly different meaning to different people, based on their life exper=\r\niences and predispositions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, there is no formula that ensures se=\r\nlf-realization in a certain amount of time and it comes to one through the =\r\ngrace of God. However, grace of God does not come to just about anyone - it=\r\n comes to one who is *ready* to receive it. One becomes ready to receive it=\r\n, through the effort put in this life and all previous lives, to overcome w=\r\neaknesses and conditioning. So effort and sadhana are not useless. The effo=\r\nrt we are talking about here is not effort to acquire something, but effort=\r\n to give up something.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though it is not incorrect, the view that thi=\r\nngs are given only by God&#39;s grace can, when misunderstood, promote inaction=\r\n. God&#39;s grace does not come to a lazy person doing nothing and waiting for\n=\r\n God&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace does not work arbitrarily. God&#39;s grace comes to o=\r\nne who has perfect surrender to God. Perfect surrender does not come automa=\r\ntically. Though effort and sadhana do not guarantee perfect surrender in a =\r\ncertain amount of time, they do bring it eventually.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; whatever one does it is based on past karmas only&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fruits of past =\r\nkarmas decide one&#39;s current situation and constrain one&#39;s current karmas (a=\r\nctions). But they do not completely decide one&#39;s current karmas. One&#39;s curr=\r\nent karma is in one&#39;s hands (within the constraints).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, one=\r\n can ask: Does one have a free will that acts or does an all-pervading shak=\r\nti act through one? I am quoting a small portion from vedic-wisdom message =\r\n5009 (&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/5009&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/me=\r\nssage/5009&lt;/A&gt;) below:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All pervading shakti works through all of us\n=\r\n and expresses through all of our desires, actions and knowledge. But then,=\r\n some universal rules of action and reaction govern how this works. Under t=\r\nhe push of one&#39;s own previous karmas, one is placed in situations that are =\r\nconducive to certain desires, actions and awareness. The current karmas in =\r\nthose situations may further modify the momentum of the push (reaction) fro=\r\nm previous actions. Though one&#39;s current desires, actions and awareness are=\r\n actually the work of the all pervading shakti, they are also one&#39;s work in=\r\n a way. It depends on how we look at it and how we abstract it. Though Gang=\r\nes water in a bucket, Ganges water in a small cup, Ganges water in a cup in=\r\n hot weather and Ganges water in a cup in freezing weather are all Ganges w=\r\nater, they are different too. One is more, one is less, one is warm and one=\r\n is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading shakti is&lt;BR&gt;different when e=\r\nxpressed through different vessels (people) in different\n situations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;As long as one actually feels internally (despite what one may say or pre=\r\ntend externally) that one&#39;s desires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s own, o=\r\nne is performing karmas and is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. On=\r\nly when the&lt;BR&gt;realization that it is all the work of the all pervading sha=\r\nkti becomes full and completely internalized, does one become free from the=\r\n cycle of actions and reactions. Until then, all pervading shakti acts thro=\r\nugh one to give appropriate reactions to actions one thinks one is performi=\r\nng.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum total o=\r\nf previous karmas, whose fruits one will have to face. They show the circum=\r\nstances faced by one. They do not and cannot determine what actions one eng=\r\nages in, though certain actions are more likely in certain circumstances.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Destiny is the sum total of the reactions to the actions committed by=\r\n one&#39;s free will. Today&#39;s actions of free will\n become destiny tomorrow (i.=\r\ne. on a future date or in a future life).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;Free &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil=\r\nms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:hramalingam%40gmail.com&quot;\n target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:hramalingam%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;hramalingam@=\r\ngmail.com&lt;/A&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Samadi state is not like getting a degree by =\r\nhardwork It comes to certain people by the Grace of GOD Till GOD or Soul de=\r\ncides to reveal the Samadi state whatever one does it is based on past karm=\r\nas only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramanapatham&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Relia=\r\nnce Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Network.

However, we cannot=\r\n compare ourselves with special beings and we should follow rules and auste=\r\nrities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may score a century with a terrible=\r\n backache, but we should not walk out to bat with a backache and should try=\r\n to be healthy. After all, we may not be able to score runs well even when =\r\nin perfect health!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; By the way, it m=\r\nust be realized that external rules are only meant as a *catalyst* in enabl=\r\ning internal transformation. The goal of all sadhana - meditation, japam, h=\r\nomam, bhajan, service to others etc - is internal transformation. If the in=\r\nternal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet to work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If a room has a window outside of which there =\r\nis heavy wind that is constantly blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweep=\r\ning the room with a broom does not eliminate dirt. First\n close the window =\r\nor stop the wind. Similarly, praanaayaama is not enough to purify the nadis=\r\n and give mental purity, if mind (room) is attached to the objects perceive=\r\nd by senses (window).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one reads =\r\nscriptures and teachings of saints, contemplates on them, constantly analyz=\r\nes inner motives behind various actions by oneself and tries to change one&#39;=\r\ns own thinking slowly, this process of contemplation and introspection will=\r\n augment one&#39;s external sadhana (such as meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, =\r\nservice etc) and purifies one faster.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; By the way, it is useless to think in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kund=\r\nalini and raising Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost guaranteed to either =\r\nblock Kundalini from rising or from reaching the highest it can.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Kundalini shakti is essentially a symbol of one&#39;s own self-awareness=\r\n. Though one is the infinite Self (Purusha), one\n is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited o=\r\nbject in the field of duality (Shakti) springing in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is=\r\n why Kundalini shakti is worshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti)=\r\n. This self-awareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is =\r\nso and so person and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is=\r\n why Kundalini is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka or ph=\r\nysical realm). As Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras (other lokas=\r\n or realms of awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who one is gets refined. W=\r\nhen Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at so and so p=\r\noint in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in this body&quot;, it =\r\nwill focus and limit one&#39;s self-awareness to the *physical body* and hence =\r\none&#39;s Kundalini will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise, o=\r\nne needs to completely forget about the\n physical body and stop thinking in=\r\n terms of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; By the way, *very few* people actually exper=\r\nience Kundalini in higher chakras, though many talk about it. Kundalini is =\r\nin Moolaadhaara chakra or atmost Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even a=\r\ndvanced and awakened ones. When praana vaayu flows in some higher chakras, =\r\nthat too can result in a powerful experience. Some may mistaken it for Kund=\r\nalini.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you want a good score in =\r\nthe examination, study well. Stop thinking too much about (and anticipating=\r\n) the examination and focus on the subject instead. Study, study, study. Si=\r\nmilarly, forget about kundalini, forget about chakras, forget about the bod=\r\ny even. Do sadhana, do sadhana and do sadhana. Read scriptures and teaching=\r\ns of great saints. Instead of looking externally and judging others, observ=\r\ne your own actions and thoughts, analyze what is driving them and conscious=\r\nly try to eliminate wrong motives\n that stem from false ego, adharma and ar=\r\nishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness, jealosy), i.e. put to=\r\n use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachings of saints. Oneday, Kunda=\r\nlini will rise automatically.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a =\r\ndifference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A\n hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrolog=\r\ny@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;For instance, without a v=\r\negetarian diet, asana siddhi is impossible.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Nothing is impossible.
