I have moved from one deity to another in the last few years=\r\n (more so due to different states I found myself in in material terms- care=\r\ner problem, delayed marriage, dispute with familial relationships, which so=\r\nmehow inspired/deluded me to change the object of my worship for smooth mat=\r\nerial existence- hence a very selfish motive/purpose) and many times I did =\r\nexperience peace of mind while worshipping a particular deity, but still sh=\r\nifted due to reasons explained above. Now, I find myself worshipping many d=\r\neities daily (although quality of time/devotion to each would be less than =\r\nif praying to only one deity), but I somehow feel good about it everyday, a=\r\nnd have started to connect with a few out of many. Some could say, maybe I =\r\nam moving ahead in my journey, and one fine day, I will relate most emphati=\r\ncally with only one deity, and then progress thereon. While, another way to=\r\n look at it could be that I am relating to some deity due to my long-term c=\r\nonnection (worship to) with that deity, while connecting with another deity=\r\n as that could be my saviour at present times? (I somehow feel that after I=\r\n started to worship a particular deity in the not-so-distant past, and felt=\r\n positive, energized and hopeful during my worship, my situation improved m=\r\naterially after a really long period of time, but maybe it is temporary?) I=\r\n apologize if all this sounds foolish or if I am not making sense. I really=\r\n wish to understand from more elevated beings, such as you. Apart from my e=\r\nxample, Mr. Nagraj Kota has also mentioned in this same thread that he also=\r\n worships multiple deities as part of his daily sadhana and does not find i=\r\nt confusing that one form is different form another. With Mother&#39;s grace, h=\r\ne is seemingly at a better place than I am (spiritually speaking) and I wis=\r\nh and pray his beautiful journey continues and culminates ever more beautif=\r\nully. For a confused person like me, how could one explain this from the di=\r\namond analogy?\n\nJust one more question, in the diamond analogy thread, you =\r\nhave mentioned that Vishnu represents the Sattva quality of the Supreme Cos=\r\nmic Being, so by that concept, Vashnavi (Maa Lakshmi) would also represent =\r\nthe Sattva quality of the Divine Mother? However, yesterday I read someplac=\r\ne while reading about the Divine Mother (since I wanted to read more to sui=\r\ntably prepare/energize myself for the Navratris that started today) that du=\r\nring the Navratris, at some places (seemingly in South India), the first th=\r\nree days are devoted to Maa Kali, the next three days to Maa Lakshmi, and t=\r\nhe last three days to Maa Saraswati, and that this is how, the divine energ=\r\ny works within us, i.e, first it destroys the evil tendencies within us (ta=\r\nmasic represented by Maa Kali), then it provides us with spiritual wealth, =\r\nabundance and prosperity (rajasic represented by Maa Lakshmi), and finally =\r\nit grants the truly liberating Supreme self knowledge leading to Moksha (sa=\r\nttvic represented by Maa Saraswati) In this concept, the divine energy repr=\r\nesenting the sattvic quality differs from the one deduced from the diamond =\r\nexample. Could you please throw some light on this as well? \n\nThe above may=\r\n sound superficial questions, and not really relevant to a more evolved sad=\r\nhaka, however, given my current stage, I will be able to satisfypacify thes=\r\ne questions/doubts and move forward in my journey more peacefully.\n\nHope th=\r\ne Divine Mother grants you all that you wish for, provided, there is anythi=\r\nng you wish for, but also (selfishly) hope that by then you would have shar=\r\ned your insights and illuminated many more around you.\n\nKind regards,\nManis=\r\nh\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Never mind. I gave more thought to it in the night and I understood wh=\r\nat you meant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say one facet is the roopam of Lord Vishnu, once I=\r\n move beyond the facet, I will realize him beyond his roopam as &quot;the Vishnu=\r\n&quot;(meaning of which is all pervading). Same with Narayana (Parama purusha), =\r\nSadaShiva (not sure what sadashiva means?), Devi (all pervading energy), Ra=\r\ndhaKrsna (the all attractive with pleasure potency) etc. These are all the =\r\nattributes of the One, the Supreme; the subset of which I get to experience=\r\n with my conditioned existence in deity form and that is the facet. Once th=\r\ne facet or that attribute is totally assimilated / understood deeply, one m=\r\noves beyond it to understand the powerset, ie. all the attributes. Not sure=\r\n if that is merging stage or awareness stage !\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope my understanding i=\r\ns correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your r=\r\nesponse. I have seen the diamond example, but not the other inputs before.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Unlike the diamond example, here is another facet I learnt. Lord K=\r\nrsna has 64 qualities while Lord Narayana has 60 qualities only. Brahman is=\r\n the effulgence of LordKrsna and the ones who follow advaita get into a sit=\r\nuation of no birth, no death and merge in the brahma jyothi. This is under =\r\nthe rulership of Lord SadaShiva (the supreme to all Sivas). The devotees of=\r\n Lord Krsna (let us take it as dvaita) can have an eternal relationship wit=\r\nh Lord serving them (Lord is never alone, his hladini shakti as Radharani i=\r\ns always with him) either as a cow or lotus plant or kadamba tree. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Even in the example you have given, the facets of diamond are fine. But w=\r\nhy do we need to attribute one facet&#39;s relation with the other. So, either =\r\nthe relations are just an allegory or they are real. If they are real, then=\r\n the relations have to respected as is. It also can mean, the supreme who h=\r\nas expanded himself or created the rest of the facets. If it is the latter,=\r\n there is only one supreme and the next question is, who is that original ?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyways, I am just thinking loud as the stories / allegories look=\r\n good to some extent, beyond which it is tough to imagine some scenarios.

Sapta Sati, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tough as it seemed in the beginning, became a lot more easier for m=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to chant now (that was the objective with which I have taken up=\r\n this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 108 times pArAyaNam) and some day I plan to memorize all th=\r\nat. On \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this occasion, I have a question for Shri Narasimha Garu. =\r\nI have come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; across a writing somewhere on Sapta Sati as to how it=\r\n can be a mantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sastra. The second verse &quot;SavarniH Soorya TanayO=\r\nH .....&quot; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpreted to as &quot;Hreem..&quot; beejakshara mantra. Do w=\r\ne have a book \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that explains all of the SaptaSati in several conte=\r\nxts, the literal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; meaning, esoteric meaning, the several mantras t=\r\nhat the verses \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; represent etc.? If there is no book like that, I w=\r\nould request Shri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; PVR to author such a book because of his deep i=\r\nnsights into the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject/language and the advanced sadhaka that h=\r\ne is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMai=\r\nl.openComposeWindow(&#39;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &lt;http://docs.y=\r\nahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
