My comments on=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that is:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta =\r\nhas no innate power to\n&gt; &gt; Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else h=\r\nas an unreal and\n&gt; &gt; derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate =\r\nwith each other, and\n&gt; &gt; not control each other.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born =\r\nchild or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his\n&gt; &gt; sense-consciou=\r\nsness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness\n&gt; &gt; derived from =\r\nManas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminatin=\r\ng faculty to interact with manas\n&gt; &gt; (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what =\r\nto do - as you have proposed. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; Manas co-ordinates the senses due t=\r\no its own sense of I-ness, not due to\n&gt; &gt; Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this c=\r\nlarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciou=\r\nsness, which\n&gt; &gt; one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, =\r\nit is ahamkaraka\n&gt; &gt; or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticis=\r\nm or\n&gt; &gt; praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and=\r\n only a\n&gt; &gt; name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distan=\r\nce (as\n&gt; &gt; opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s cons=\r\nciousness\n&gt; &gt; may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards =\r\nthe caller. As\n&gt; &gt; in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itse=\r\nlf to more than a\n&gt; &gt; body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while =\r\nsleeping. One may have forgotten totally\n&gt; &gt; about the physical body in the=\r\n dream! One may think of something else as\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see =\r\noneself as a different body or may not even\n&gt; &gt; &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one=\r\n may have the sense that so and so thing is\n&gt; &gt; happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even=\r\n when the mind is drawn away from the physical\n&gt; &gt; body, there is still a n=\r\notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is\n&gt; &gt; ahamkara or I-ness or=\r\n ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physi=\r\ncal body is absolutely\n&gt; &gt; unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond =\r\nthe physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni d=\r\no not have ahamkara (I-ness)\n&gt; &gt; because they do not have physical bodies i=\r\ns incorrect. Of course, Agni does\n&gt; &gt; have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni =\r\nand this is what I do&quot;. If he did not\n&gt; &gt; have that I-ness, he would not do=\r\n everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of indivi=\r\ndualized consciousness do\n&gt; &gt; interact with each other, whether we use the =\r\nword &quot;control&quot; for some of\n&gt; &gt; those interactions or not. For example, budd=\r\nhi (intellectual/ discriminating\n&gt; &gt; mind) judges various past experiences,=\r\n interacts with manas (sensory-motor\n&gt; &gt; mind) and tells it what to do. The=\r\nn manas interacts with karmendriyas\n&gt; &gt; (organs of action) and makes them d=\r\no various things. My buddhi determined\n&gt; &gt; what to write and my manas told =\r\nmy hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point abo=\r\nut &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally\n&gt; &gt; out of place.=\r\n The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the\n&gt; &gt; logical mind, =\r\nthe sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different\n&gt; &gt; parts of ind=\r\nividualized consciousness and they play different roles while\n&gt; &gt; interacti=\r\nng with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions\n&gt; &gt; may be=\r\n deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologie=\r\ns, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details. Your understanding is fla=\r\nwed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those withou=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara=\r\n like\n&gt; &gt; we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and bud=\r\ndhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the se=\r\nnse of I-ness. That sense of I-ness\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all l=\r\nayers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where d=\r\nid you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the =\r\nsense of I-ness attributed to the\n&gt; &gt; Individual Soul and the sense of I-ne=\r\nss derived through the idea of\n&gt; &gt; Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of =\r\nthe three bodies, the individuality\n&gt; &gt; of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (=\r\nResurrection implies that), while it has\n&gt; &gt; already given up the idea of A=\r\nhamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a c=\r\nausal-bodied being is not due to the idea of\n&gt; &gt; Ahamkara because &quot;What exi=\r\nsts as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea\n&gt; &gt; of Ahamkara, being o=\r\nne of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account\n&gt; &gt; for neither cont=\r\nrols the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of\n&gt; &gt; another, wit=\r\nhout requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your\n&gt; &gt; buddhi woul=\r\nd always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or\n&gt; &gt; the 5 fu=\r\nnctions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 i=\r\ndeas of causal body are the basic causal forces\n&gt; &gt; and are not related as =\r\ncause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent\n&gt; &gt; of the applicatio=\r\nn of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and\n&gt; &gt; Buddhi being =\r\ntwo of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence\n&gt; &gt; is not =\r\n&quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is\n&gt; &gt; ve=\r\nry clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncarrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the v=\r\nery basis of the entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer As=\r\ntral\n&gt; &gt; and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya an=\r\nd see the\n&gt; &gt; human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entir=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) be=\r\ning is\n&gt; &gt; not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An =\r\nAstral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the\n&gt; &gt; very ba=\r\nsis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied b=\r\neing thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as\n&gt; &gt; the very basis of th=\r\ne entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individualit=\r\ny is of the Soul not derived from any idea,\n&gt; &gt; which is why it is not lost=\r\n when the Astral being loses astral consciousness\n&gt; &gt; and reincarnates in t=\r\nhe Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their fi=\r\nner bodies, are able to work\n&gt; &gt; through all the beings in all their physic=\r\nal-bodies simultaneously (like\n&gt; &gt; Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni d=\r\nigests the food, and so on..), never\n&gt; &gt; getting controlled by Ahamkara tha=\r\nt would require them to say that this\n&gt; &gt; particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or t=\r\nhat one is mine - unless they incarnate in\n&gt; &gt; Physical bodies themselves. =\r\nDevatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied\n&gt; &gt; beings, so they would attem=\r\npt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of\n&gt; &gt; the sense-bound worshi=\r\npper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to\n&gt; &gt; possess ones&#39; physical=\r\n body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ou=\r\nt of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sa=\r\nreera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per =\r\nthe resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a\n&gt; &gt; Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas =\r\ncomprising\n&gt; &gt; Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of=\r\n knowledge, 5\n&gt; &gt; functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 id=\r\neas comprising\n&gt; &gt; Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nne or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it=\r\n at\n&gt; &gt; different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifi=\r\ncations,\n&gt; &gt; can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is final=\r\nly dropped -\n&gt; &gt; hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely=\r\n Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variabl=\r\ne, can be developed or undeveloped\n&gt; &gt; irrespective of the other 34. Even i=\r\nlliterate Moodha, through surrender to\n&gt; &gt; their Guru, attain freedom from =\r\nAhamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditione=\r\nd Mind. Chitta does store the\n&gt; &gt; residual impressions of all the past inca=\r\nrnations. However, being\n&gt; &gt; constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any=\r\n inherent ability to act upon\n&gt; &gt; (Rajas) those impressions, just like a co=\r\nntainer containing an inflammable\n&gt; &gt; liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it =\r\ndown. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitt=\r\na, including those of Nidra, Smriti,\n&gt; &gt; Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, corre=\r\nspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta\n&gt; &gt; itself is Satva Guna - hence t=\r\nhe &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther\n&gt; &gt; tattwa (refer my previous=\r\n mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; get conditioned by the=\r\n Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, clear=\r\ned of all residual impressions, only\n&gt; &gt; Satva Guna remains, the intuition =\r\nbecomes coherent and the Soul reflects on\n&gt; &gt; itself as distinct from Satva=\r\n Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its\n&gt; &gt; own nature as Brahman.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigada=\r\nrshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of t=\r\nhe seer with the instrument of\n&gt; &gt; seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instea=\r\nd of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the sens=\r\nes like eyes to\n&gt; &gt; see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography =\r\nof a Yogi)... the\n&gt; &gt; sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-bod=\r\ny and hence doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied being=\r\ns can use thought to\n&gt; &gt; sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egoti=\r\nsm has to be rooted out while the consciousness is\n&gt; &gt; associated with the =\r\nPhysical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbe overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos =\r\nare\n&gt; &gt; permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the=\r\n eye\n&gt; &gt; implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same man=\r\nner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara s=\r\namjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these wh=\r\no have given up their thirst after\n&gt; &gt; objects, either seen or heard, and w=\r\nhich wills to control the objects, is\n&gt; &gt; non-attachment. Vivekananda has c=\r\nommented that Vairagya is the only way to\n&gt; &gt; freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThis is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to\n&gt; &gt; Astral-=\r\nBody and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an\n&gt; &gt; astral-bodied =\r\nbeing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7.

For example, ego or\n&gt; &gt; ahamkaara (=\r\nsense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends\n&gt; &gt; to su=\r\nbtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nody and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta\n&gt; &gt; (rem=\r\nembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas\n&gt; &gt; (sen=\r\nsory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or\n&gt; &gt; thi=\r\nnking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta\n&gt; &gt; (r=\r\nemembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-nes=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individua=\r\nlized\n&gt; &gt; consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scr=\r\niptures have broken down the\n&gt; &gt; individualized consciousness into various =\r\ngroups by functionality, like five\n&gt; &gt; koshas, three sareeras, five praanas=\r\n, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas,\n&gt; &gt; four antahkaranas, six/seven c=\r\nhakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the\n&gt; &gt; very basis of the entire i=\r\nndividualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana=\r\n means different things to different people,\n&gt; &gt; a jnaana yogi pursues Self=\r\n by the path of contemplation and discrimination.\n&gt; &gt; When a jnaana yogi re=\r\naches the final target, all bodies and koshas are\n&gt; &gt; merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; |=\r\n| OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, =\r\nthere are three distinct phases that lead the\n&gt; &gt; sould to rise above Ego, =\r\nMind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies\n&gt; &gt; physical (Sthoola),=\r\n astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ri=\r\nsing above Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical\n&gt; &gt; cosmos\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in =\r\nCausal\n&gt; &gt; cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established=\r\n in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing that path may or may not debate with\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will analyze and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on elimina=\r\nting\n&gt; &gt; things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body h=\r\nas a\n&gt; &gt; beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One intros=\r\npects like\n&gt; &gt; this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds t=\r\nhe true Self.\n&gt; &gt; That is gyaana yoga.
