Pandit bhaya na koi...\nDhai Akhkha=\r\nr Prem ka padhe so pandit hoi!\n\nYou have described aptly my experience and =\r\nnow I know that it&#39;s with many people at some stage. My interest in reading=\r\n books is almost negligible since past 3 years. Only books I read with grea=\r\nt interest recently are Aghora Series.\n\nI think Practical is required now. =\r\nPurpose of books is probably served. As Ramakrishna said to one of his disc=\r\niples that once you read and understood the message written on a piece of p=\r\naper, then there is no need to cling on to the paper!\n\nRegards,\n\nUtpal \t\n\n\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A. Bhatla&quot; &lt;astrologytree@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very well said Utpal ji\n&gt; \n&gt; In start of our journey, we hold on =\r\nto logic and as we move forward, faith start to develop. As we move further=\r\n, percentage of faith increase overtime and that of logic decrease. At one =\r\ntime, you have to leave all the logic. At a stage, During his lessons to M =\r\nShri Ramakrishna Paramahansa told him to leave all reasoning. Shri Ramakris=\r\nhna repeated/highlighted this to him many times.\n&gt; \n&gt; In start of spiritual=\r\nity we find that books are our best guide. They answer our questions very w=\r\nell. But after some time a stage comes when we feel that books are infact &#39;=\r\nover-guiding&#39; us. They are trying to give words to our emotions and trying =\r\nto limitize our feelings. I think it is right time to quit reading. I am al=\r\nso feeling so about myself. But dont know if I am thinking right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some=\r\ntime back someone said to me &quot;I was reading Geeta when Shri Krishna said to=\r\n Arjuna &#39;Oh Arjuna, stop reading all the books...&#39;. I didnt read even Geeta=\r\n from that shloka onwards&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for the links Chandraprakash ji.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; May Lord keep showing the right way to all of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deep regards\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Chandra prakash,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Any intelligent, rational ma=\r\nn is an atheist. Until, of course he &gt;&gt;is initiated into religion.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Pure rational intelligence will be thoroughly logical and would want evid=\r\nences (which can be perceived by physical senses) for anything and everythi=\r\nng. Same goes for existence of God/Nature/Self/etc...so the by product is l=\r\nack of belief in the core essence and purpose of religion i.e. Spirit.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHe/she will naturally lack faith (Shradhdhaa). Whenever, in life, due to bi=\r\ntter experiences and/or past Samskaaraas, Logic takes backseat and Faith is=\r\n born, the person is initiated in to religion. It is actually Initiation in=\r\n to internal religion which may or may not reflect externally. However, it =\r\nis my opinion that, it is better to depend upon Logical mind while inquirin=\r\ng for truth until faith is born  established and even after that in the jou=\r\nrney.\n&gt; &gt; I think, Dr. Atual&#39;s view point matches the above. And you alread=\r\ny know all these!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I am tired of logic as my profession=\r\n is the area of PLCs (i.e. Programmable *Logic* Controllers :) and writing =\r\nProcess *logic* for long. Logic is boring!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Logic-less (with faith)=\r\n regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal and Dr Bhatl=\r\na,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for sharing your &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;innovative&quot; vie=\r\nw of Hindu and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hinduism (Santana Dharma)!
