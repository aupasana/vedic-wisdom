But a=\r\nny \n&gt; ways, i apologize for the same. Why i said so because i have always \n=\r\n&gt; heard this from my elders. Also the many Sanskrit words in our \n&gt; regiona=\r\nl languages also add to that. but i know that is a \n&gt; controversial stateme=\r\nnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding Arabic Teacher - My Company organized classes for learni=\r\nng \n&gt; Arabic language for interested employees. The teacher was a Lebanese =\r\n\n&gt; citizen. I didn&#39;t attend the class. One of my colleagues told me \n&gt; afte=\r\nrwards that One day during some relevant discussion, the teacher \n&gt; made a =\r\ncomment that Basis of Arabic Language is Sanskrit. Some \n&gt; colleagues vehem=\r\nently opposed that in the class the matter ended  \n&gt; there. That is what i =\r\nwas informed. I know nothing more about why \n&gt; the teacher said so.\n&gt; \n&gt; **=\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; Vijay,\n&gt; \n&gt; Your views are not out of place. I also thought that way=\r\n but \n&gt; unfortunately the ambiguity in today&#39;s available Sanskrit literatur=\r\ne \n&gt; have caused many confusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana \n&gt; Rao Pi=\r\nngali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to caution ourselves from ge=\r\ntting into arguments \n&gt; whether \n&gt; &gt; or not Sanskrit is mother of all langu=\r\nages. One Arabic professor \n&gt; &gt; making such claim does not add much credibi=\r\nlity to the argument \n&gt; unless \n&gt; &gt; he has some compelling reasons to make =\r\nsuch statement.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With in India, we find so called scholars arguing =\r\nthat Sanskrit \n&gt; came \n&gt; &gt; from other languages. You go south and will find=\r\n quite a few \n&gt; Tamilians \n&gt; &gt; claim Sanskrit is not moth of Tamil.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I would definitely be interested to see why the Arabic professor \n&gt; felt =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; what he felt; how ever, the more important and basic question \n&gt; Utpal=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; had is: Why is the knowledge written down in such disputable \n&gt; manne=\r\nr. \n&gt; &gt; Why it is not written in simple words.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal, your observa=\r\ntion is true.
