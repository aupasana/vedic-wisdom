They are not evil forces. They are simply unfortunate sou=\r\nls in great misery, troubled by undesirable vasanas. They are not to be hat=\r\ned, but to be pitied and empathized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, beings with evil intentions=\r\n are unlikely to be present at the residence of a saint like like Gopaler M=\r\na.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Is it that such beings/entities cannot be helped or is it just\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; wise to leave them alone if they do not want to be disturbed?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Worl=\r\nd runs on the basis of action and reaction. Any being that is in pain and s=\r\ntuck in a place is so due to some serious blocking karmas. Release of those=\r\n karmas may be difficult. It is not easy to help each and every being. You =\r\ncan only pick some to help and help them, guided by your own kaarmik debts.=\r\n Moreover, you can help someone only if they want to be helped.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is one more thing here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even a self-realiz=\r\ned person is limited in one&#39;s ability to uplift other beings. An object (a =\r\nperson) may overcome its gravity (individual ego and will) and start to fre=\r\nely flow in the wind (flow with divine will) without any resistance. But it=\r\n cannot lift every object around it. A big leaf that is freely floating in =\r\nair can perhaps support a few insects. A big rock that is freely floating i=\r\nn air can perhaps support more beings. A big hill that is freely floating i=\r\nn air can perhaps support far more beings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like that, different being=\r\ns are of different calibers in the field of duality, though all may be the =\r\nsame at the non-dual level. As they become liberated from their conditionin=\r\ng, their ability to uplift others from blocking conditioning varies from yo=\r\ngi to yogi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, I want to emphasize one thing here. A leaf is leaf, =\r\na rock is a rock and a hill is a hill. Leaf cannot become hill or hill cann=\r\not become rock. So, one cannot worry about achieving this or that. Whether =\r\none is a leaf or a rock or a hill, one should try to overcome gravity and f=\r\nreely float. What one does after that is not one&#39;s business, but the busine=\r\nss of divine Will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your questions reminded =\r\nme of a facebook message exchange I saw just a couple of days back. One mem=\r\nber of this group sent a message to Manish and me and Manish replied to him=\r\n. I will quote the facebook message thread, without revealing the identity =\r\nof the member.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Member: &quot;Yesterday night, I was feeling very very depr=\r\nessed for reasons both in the house as well as work place and was mentally =\r\nscolding everyone why this is happening to me. I drifted off to sleep aroun=\r\nd 11 pm and woke up 30 mins later to find a small beggar-like boy with dish=\r\nevelled brown hair looking at me...my first reaction was of fright and fear=\r\n and I shouted &quot;shoo!&quot;. When shouting, I closed my eyes momentarily and whe=\r\nn I opened them, the &#39;boy&#39; was gone. I felt a great wave of sadness engulfi=\r\nng me and thought that the deity (whoever it be)had come to test me and I f=\r\nailed the test. Weird to say but my wife didnt stir during the whole episod=\r\ne despite me shaking her and my mother didnt hear any noise from my bedroom=\r\n...am left wondering if I hallucinated...dont know what to do now.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; M=\r\nanish: &quot;No, it was not a deity, more likely the spirit causing the problems=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Member: &quot;eeks! now I am frightened...tell me what I should do?&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Manish: &quot;Why would you be frightened?, they are just like you, only tho=\r\nda different. If you saw a child on the road like this how would you behave=\r\n? With compassion, I hope.\n&gt; Be like Bholenath, He says, to all the bhoot, =\r\npretas, pisachas, &quot;My children, I know nobody wants you anymore, just sit w=\r\nith Me, nobody will trouble you here.&quot;\n&gt; Be compassionate, nothing in this =\r\nUniverse can touch you unless your own karmas give it the license to do so.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; [Glossary: thoda =3D a little, Bholenath =3D Lord Shiva, bhoot, pre=\r\ntas, pisachas =3D different kinds of spirits]\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;               =\r\n    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- &quot;n_shashi@...&quot; &lt;n_shashi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Recen=\r\ntly I happened to see a few &#39;Paranormal State&#39; episodes and observed that t=\r\nhe so called entities/beings identified or located are left alone mostly ev=\r\nen when there is priest around.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This brought to my mind a similar i=\r\nncident which i remember vaguely of having read long time back in one of &#39;R=\r\namakrishna&#39; books (dont remember the name), where Ramakrishna and Rakhal wa=\r\ns one day staying late at Gopaler Ma&#39;s place and in the night Sri Ramakrish=\r\na was visited by some entity/being in a sad state who came to him and reque=\r\nsted him to leave the place as Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s presence was making the en=\r\ntity/being miserable.
