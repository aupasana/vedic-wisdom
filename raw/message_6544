It does not mean that the sannyasin=\r\n undervalues human society and discards all men without helping them at all=\r\n. As the life of a sannyasin is meant only to reach the highest Reality, an=\r\nd as he has already passed through the lower stages of spiritual evolution,=\r\n he may appear to be not working for the rest of humanity at large; but it =\r\nis to be borne in mind that he exercises a silent and unnoticed but powerfu=\r\nl influence for the good of the public. That itself is the service he is re=\r\nndering to the society and that is the highest and the most beneficent serv=\r\nice that one could ever do to man.
