At the same time, some not-so-well- known tem=\r\nples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; I was very im=\r\npressed with the=C3=82 Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is the=\r\nre), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Raman=\r\na Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in th=\r\nose places. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. =\r\nFor example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali i=\r\ndol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the f=\r\namous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; There was =\r\none small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me =\r\nto visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chand=\r\ni homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seem=\r\ned like a small temple. The name of the=C3=82 form of the divine Mother=C3=\r\n=82 present there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I =\r\ndo not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started m=\r\neditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of=\r\n a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that th=\r\nere was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the nam=\r\ne of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the god=\r\ndess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof c=\r\name down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the god=\r\ndess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and\n left\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\nin a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu pr=\r\nobably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Like this,=\r\n I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence across In=\r\ndia.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of m=\r\ny best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aal=\r\nandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in th=\r\ne underground chamber there.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for medit=\r\nating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with raja=\r\ns and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sat=\r\ntwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but =\r\nmy view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples =\r\nare really good.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months =\r\ndoing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Ti=\r\nruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C3=82 and Narayana=C3=82 vanam (near Tirup=\r\nati)=C3=82 in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C3=82 and Girnar mounta=\r\nins (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north I=\r\nndia and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C3=82 and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; There are many other good places, but the above come to my mind=\r\n. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for several months =\r\nwhile maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like ho=\r\nmam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpan=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings:=\r\n http://groups.. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples et=\r\nc) in today&#39;s time.

Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves =\r\nearth altogether, that energy will linger there.

At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a po=\r\nwerful divine presence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was very=\r\n impressed with the=C3=82&nbsp;Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=\r\ne is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamala=\r\ni (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual ener=\r\ngy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically=\r\n alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the=\r\n Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression =\r\nat the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was=\r\n taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil =\r\nNadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard=\r\n of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;form of the divine Mother=C3=82&nbsp;present there was a Tamil =\r\nlanguage name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name =\r\nnow. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in fr=\r\nont of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose f=\r\nace was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence th=\r\nere. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess,=\r\n but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof=\r\n over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident ea=\r\nch time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roo=\r\nf. Though we\n spent only 5 min and left&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  in a hurry, I was ve=\r\nry pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the nam=\r\ne of the temple and goddess.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Like =\r\nthis, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence acro=\r\nss India.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali tem=\r\nple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the=\r\n Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Mah=\r\naraj is still meditating in the underground chamber there.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for medi=\r\ntating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with raj=\r\nas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sa=\r\nttwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but=\r\n my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples=\r\n are really good.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one has a cha=\r\nnce to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest =\r\nthe following:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshinesh=\r\nwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachala=\r\nm hills)=C3=82&nbsp;and Narayana=C3=82&nbsp;vanam (near Tirupati)=C3=82&nbs=\r\np;in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C3=82&nbsp;and Girnar mountains =\r\n(Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India=\r\n and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C3=82&nbsp;and Ujjain in central India.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many other good places, but =\r\nthe above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying =\r\nthere for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a s=\r\npiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org/ h=\r\nomam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.or=\r\ng/ tarpana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/a&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.or=\r\ng&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt; yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/a&gt; nath.org&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Respected =\r\nNarsimhaji, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to kn=\r\now your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in today&#39;s time.
