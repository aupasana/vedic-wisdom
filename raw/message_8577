In a private communication, Sri Svobo=\r\nda made some points that I liked. I am sharing it with you with his kind pe=\r\nrmission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Instead of focusing on offending gods o=\r\nr any other beings, as some people do, please note that he focused on the p=\r\nrevailing gunas and also on downward movement of apaana vaayu. Focused sadh=\r\nana is meant to make apana move up (Kundalini moves up when praana and apaa=\r\nna meet) and some physical conditions direct apana heavily downward (e.g. f=\r\null bowels, monthly periods, full bladder).\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Of course,=\r\n in the end, when one is dying, one MAY need to focus mind on god and make =\r\napana move up, under equally (if not more) challenging circumstances. But o=\r\nne can make things easy and controlled, when still alive and practicing.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If I may add my 2 cents of perspective to the learn=\r\ned opinion below, please keep in mind that some highly taamasik men may be =\r\ninfluenced by tamas more than some highly saattwik women even in their firs=\r\nt day of periods. Things are relative. Also, many people (men and women) do=\r\n most of their sadhana when their apaana is clearly directed downwards and =\r\ndoes not move up at all. They do not experience anything. Sadhana in such s=\r\ntages is for instilling discipline rather than making apaana move up and me=\r\net with praana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Forwarded Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Rob=\r\nert Svoboda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: Narasimha P.V.R.

The second day i=\r\ns ruled by rajas,\n&gt; &gt; and that devi is red; and the third day is ruled by s=\r\nattva, and that\n&gt; &gt; devi is white. During those first 3 days I believe it i=\r\ns better for a\n&gt; &gt; woman to be away from everybody except other women; bett=\r\ner for them\n&gt; &gt; not to cook, clean &c; and better for them not to involve\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; themselves in ritual. After all, when apana is moving downwards\n&gt; &gt; stro=\r\nngly, why disturb vayu by performing some activity like puja &c\n&gt; &gt; that is=\r\n meant to encourage vayu to move upwards? \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;After\n&gt; &gt; that,=\r\n I think it depends on the woman. Some women are basically\n&gt; &gt; balanced and=\r\n even if they spot for a day or two more, the bleeding is\n&gt; &gt; effectively e=\r\nnded by the third day. Other women bleed heavily for\n&gt; &gt; four or five days,=\r\n during which time apana is clearly still moving\n&gt; &gt; downward; in these cas=\r\nes, I think they are better off waiting until\n&gt; &gt; the main flow ends.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;IMO\n&gt; &gt; during this period a woman can still do japa & internal=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; meditation and naama japa, but in an easy, sahaja, saumya fashion; no\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; kathina prayogas EXCEPT when for certain tantrika rituals, e.g. if\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe centerpiece of the ritual is to offer menstrual blood, it can be\n&gt; &gt; a =\r\nbig help to have an actual menstruating woman present, to invoke\n&gt; &gt; that p=\r\narticular shakti. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Generally\n&gt; &gt; I have found that so long=\r\n as the woman is sufficiently comfortable to\n&gt; &gt; be able to sit up, that th=\r\nere is no problem for her to sit and watch\n&gt; &gt; someone doing a ritual, exce=\r\npt when that ritual is of a type where\n&gt; &gt; the very presence of a menstruat=\r\ning woman can disturb the delicate\n&gt; &gt; shakti that is being invoked. Sadly,=\r\n I have found that most of the\n&gt; &gt; people who claim that a menstruating wom=\r\nan can disturb them are\n&gt; &gt; people who are not as sensitive as they imagine=\r\n themselves to be. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I\n&gt; &gt; often find that when I am myself=\r\n doing homam and a menstruating woman\n&gt; &gt; is sitting at the fire (which I u=\r\nsually permit so long as the woman\n&gt; &gt; understands what she is doing), that=\r\n the fire often doesn&#39;t burn as\n&gt; &gt; well =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; this makes sense =\r\nto me, and so I simply adapt to the\n&gt; &gt; situation (e.g. by having plenty of=\r\n ghee on hand!). Watching homam is\n&gt; &gt; (I have found) generally OK, except =\r\nthat for some sensitive women the\n&gt; &gt; activation of agnitattva heats them u=\r\np in a way that they can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; control. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What\n&gt; &gt; does you=\r\nr heart tells you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Best\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;RS \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

In a private communication, Sri Svoboda ma=\r\nde some points that I liked.

Focused sadhana is meant to make apana move up (Kundalini move=\r\ns up when praana and apaana meet) and some physical conditions direct apana=\r\n heavily downward (e.g. full bowels, monthly periods, full bladder).&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, in the end, when one is dying=\r\n, one MAY need to focus mind on god and make apana move up, under equally (=\r\nif not more) challenging circumstances. But one can make things easy and co=\r\nntrolled, when still alive and practicing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I may add my 2 cents of perspective to the learn=\r\ned opinion below, please keep in mind that some highly taamasik men may be =\r\ninfluenced by tamas more than some highly saattwik women even in their firs=\r\nt day of periods. Things are relative. Also, many people (men and women) do=\r\n most of their sadhana when their apaana is clearly directed downwards and =\r\ndoes not move up at all. They do not experience anything. Sadhana in such s=\r\ntages is for instilling discipline rather than making apaana move up and me=\r\net with praana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ast=\r\nrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- F=\r\norwarded Message -----&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Robert Svoboda&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;To: Narasimha P.V.R.

The second day is ruled by rajas,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and that =\r\ndevi is red; and the third day is ruled by sattva, and that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nevi is white. During those first 3 days I believe it is better for a&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; woman to be away from everybody except other women; better for them=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not to cook, clean &amp;c; and better for them not to involv=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; themselves in ritual. After all, when apana is moving downw=\r\nards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; strongly, why disturb vayu by performing some activity l=\r\nike puja &amp;c&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that is meant to encourage vayu to move upwar=\r\nds?  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;After&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; that, I think it depends on the woman. Some women are basically&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; balanced and even if they spot for a day or two more, the bleedin=\r\ng is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; effectively ended by the third day. Other women bleed he=\r\navily for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; four or five days, during which time apana is clear=\r\nly still moving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; downward; in these cases, I think they are be=\r\ntter off waiting until&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the main flow ends.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;IMO&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; during this period =\r\na woman can still do japa &amp; internal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; meditation and naama=\r\n japa, but in an easy, sahaja, saumya fashion; no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; kathina pra=\r\nyogas EXCEPT when for certain tantrika rituals, e.g. if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the c=\r\nenterpiece of the ritual is to offer menstrual blood, it can be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; a big help to have an actual menstruating woman present, to invoke&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; that particular shakti.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Generally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have found that so long as the wo=\r\nman is sufficiently comfortable to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; be able to sit up, that th=\r\nere is no problem for her to sit and watch&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; someone doing a ri=\r\ntual, except when that ritual is of a type where&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the very pre=\r\nsence of a menstruating woman can disturb the delicate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; shakti=\r\n that is being invoked. Sadly, I have found that most of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npeople who claim that a menstruating woman can disturb them are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; people who are not as sensitive as they imagine themselves to be.  &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; often f=\r\nind that when I am myself doing homam and a menstruating woman&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; is sitting at the fire (which I usually permit so long as the woman&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; understands what she is doing), that the fire often doesn&#39;t burn a=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; well =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; this makes sense to me, and so I simp=\r\nly adapt to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; situation (e.g. by having plenty of ghee on h=\r\nand!). Watching homam is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (I have found) generally OK, except =\r\nthat for some sensitive women the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; activation of agnitattva he=\r\nats them up in a way that they can&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; control.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; does your hea=\r\nrt tells you?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Best&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;RS  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;______________=\r\n__________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.
