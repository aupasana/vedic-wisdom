The real *Selfish* people should start perfor=\r\nming this Pujan once a month. This Pujan is celebrated as a bestower of pro=\r\nsperity & Truthfulness and Real *Selfish spiritualist* needs that in curren=\r\nt times so that they can concentrate better on their Sadhanas.\n\n&#2384; &#2=\r\n344;&#2350;&#2379; &#2349;&#2327;&#2357;&#2340;&#2375; &#2360;&#2340;&#2381=\r\n;&#2351;&#2342;&#2375;&#2357;&#2366;&#2351;&#2404;\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, Vikram Singhvi &lt;vikram_singhvi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected lear=\r\nned members,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; May be a very basic question, but always confuse me, s=\r\no wanted to seek \n&gt; clarification from learned members.=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I want =\r\nto know what is the basic principal and when to observe satyanarayna \n&gt; poo=\r\nja=A0when poornima starts and ends in the middle of day.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; For expamp=\r\nle, this time Poornima=A0 started in Bay area from 05-APR-12 3:50pm PST=A0 =\r\n\n&gt; and ended on 06-APR 12:15pm PST\n&gt; My question is when do we do Satyanara=\r\nyna pooja--=A0 05-APR night or on 06-APR \n&gt; night\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The confusion is =\r\nwhen we look from what tithi the day started with=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n=\r\n&gt; --05-APR started with chaturdasi and 06-APR starts with Poornima,\n&gt; but i=\r\nf we wait till night of 6th april, the tithi changes to pratipada so if we =\r\n\n&gt; do the pooja in evening then it is not poornmia tithi, it is pratipada.\n=\r\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; We performed Satyanarayan pooja on 5th night, since I think tithis =\r\nare based on \n&gt; Moon cycle, and during that time it was poornima tithi, but=\r\n observing fast \n&gt; during daytime\n&gt; when it was chaturdasi didn&#39;t sound cor=\r\nrect.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Let me know if it is correct or should we have done it on 6th=\r\n night as a couple \n&gt; of temples did.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Vikram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
