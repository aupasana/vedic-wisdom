One of my friends bought a house =\r\nrecently and wanted me to perform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But =\r\nsince I did not know how to do a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not in=\r\nclined to get details on Sudarsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Nar=\r\nasimha here before as a homam for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik =\r\nhomam like VishnuHomam and suggested the same. They agreed and we first did=\r\n a Ganapathi Homam and then proceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short br=\r\neak. Indeed it was a great experience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranam=\r\nam and offering Ahutis, the fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foo=\r\nt and half in height with just three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonder=\r\nful sight). This is very similar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahut=\r\nis to navagrahas, do the regular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the &#39;Panch=\r\na Loka Palaka Pooja&#39; and the five stories after the vratam, I find that in =\r\nVishnu homam, all the essentials are still covered. I find that this Homam =\r\nis a good substitute (and takes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if =\r\none is falling short of time! Am I right, Sri Narasimha? \n\n\n\n"}}
