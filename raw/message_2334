Th=\r\ne women of India must grow and develop in the footprints of Sita, and that =\r\nis the only way.\n\nA great landmark in the history of religion is here, the =\r\nideal of love for love&#39;s sake, work for work&#39;s sake, duty for duty&#39;s sake, =\r\nand it for the first time fell from the lips of the greatest of Incarnation=\r\ns, Krishna, and for the first time in the history of humanity, upon the soi=\r\nl of India.=C2=A0The religions of fear and of temptations were gone for eve=\r\nr, and in spite of the fear of hell and temptation of enjoyment in heaven, =\r\ncame the grandest of ideals, love for love&#39;s sake, duty for duty&#39;s sake, wo=\r\nrk for work&#39;s sake.\n\nThere was a book written a year or two ago by a Russia=\r\nn gentleman, who claimed to have found out a very curious life of Jesus Chr=\r\nist, and in one part of the book he says that Christ went to the temple of =\r\nJagannath to study with the Brahmins, but became disgusted with their exclu=\r\nsiveness and their idols, and so he went to the Lamas of Tibet instead, bec=\r\name perfect, and went home.=C2=A0\n\nTo any man who knows anything about Indi=\r\nan history, that very statement proves that the whole thing was a fraud, be=\r\ncause the temple of Jagannath is an old Buddhistic temple.
