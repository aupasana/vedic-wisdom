For example, one may be on \na bus or a train traveling to work or sitting in a conference room waiting \nfor a conference to walking from one place to another or standing in front \nof the stove cooking food or eating some food or whatever. If one&#39;s *mind* \nhas a little *free time*, irrespective what the body is doing, one can chant \none&#39;s mantra (whichever it is).\n\nSitting in one place and doing japa with some rules is definitely better, \nbut, one can *supplement* such sadhana with chanting the mantra while \nwalking or sitting in a train etc, which is also good. It is better than \nmind wandering here and there and gossipping about this and that. Use the \nmantra as a tool to stop the mind from wandering and to focus it on god.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 10:52 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Swami Sivananda Maharaj on Japa Yoga\n\n\nIn this Kali Yuga (iron age) Japa alone is the easy way to the realisation \nof God. The famous author of a commentary on the Gita and of the \nAdvaita-Siddhi, Swami Madhusudana Saraswati, had direct Darsan of Lord \nKrishna through Japa of the Mantra of Lord Krishna. The reputed Swami \nVidyaranya, the author of the Panchadasi had direct Darsan of Mother Gayatri \nthrough Japa of Gayatri Mantra.\n\nAt the present moment many educated persons and college-students have lost \nfaith in the power of Mantra, owing to the morbid influence of the study of \nscience. They have entirely given up Japa. It is highly deplorable indeed. \nWhen the blood is warm they become hot-headed, proud and atheistic. Their \nbrains and minds need a thorough overhauling and drastic flushing.\n\nLife is short. Time is fleeting. The world is full of miseries. Cut the knot \nof Avidya, and drink the Nirvanic Bliss. That day on which you do not \nperform any Japa is simply wasted. Those who simply eat, drink and sleep and \ndo not practise any Japa are horizontal beings only.\n\nA Mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi who gave it to the world; a \nmetre which governs the inflection of the voice; and a Devata or a \nsupernatural being, higher or lower, as its informing power. The Bija, seed, \nis a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a special power. \nSometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with the key-note of the \nindividual using it and varies it with individuals; sometimes this word \nexpresses the essence of the Mantra, and the result of the Mantra is the \nflower springing from this seed. The Sakti is the energy of the form of the \nMantra, i.e., the vibration-forms set up by its sounds. These carry the man \nto the Devata that is worshipped. The Kilaka, the pillar, is that which \nsupports and makes strong the Mantra, or the pin which fastens the Mantra \ntogether; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing of oneself from \nimperfections.\n\nDo not bother yourself about Mantra, Para and Pasyanti, etc. Do Japa of your \nIshta Mantra mentally with its meaning and right Bhava. You will realise the \nspiritual benefits. Why do you waste your time in counting the pebbles on \nthe bank? Take a dip immediately in the Ganges and enjoy the bath. Become \nwise.\n\nAll Mantras have equal potency or power. It is incorrect to say that Om Namo \nNarayanaya is superior to Om Namah Sivaya or Radhesyam or Sri Ram, and so \non. You can attain God-realisation by doing Japa of any Mantra. Valmiki \nattained God-consciousness by repealing even Mara-Mara. Some people think \nthat Om or Soham is superior to Om Namo Narayanaya, or vice versa. This also \nis wrong. The state gained by doing Japa of Om or Soham can be attained by \ndoing Japa of Sri Ram or Radhesyam also.\n\nYou should not doubt the teachings of the scriptures. Flickering faith will \nlead to downfall. A man of weak will, who has no faith in Japa, cannot \nexpect to have progress in the spiritual path. If he says, &quot;I am practicing \n`who am I&#39; enquiry&quot;-this is all wild imagination. Few are fit for &quot;who am I&quot; \nenquiry.\n\nYou must have the Bhava that Atman, Isvara, Devata, Mantra are one. With \nthis Bhava you will have to repeat your Guru Mantra or Ishta Mantra. Then \nalone you will have Mantra Siddhi or God-realisation quickly.\n\nThe Japa of a Mantra can bring to the practitioner realisation of his \nhighest goal though he may not possess knowledge of the meaning of the \nMantra. Such a mechanical Japa may take a little more time in realisation \nthan when it is practiced with a knowledge of the meaning. There is an \nindescribable power or Achintya Sakti in the Mantras. If you repeat the \nMantra with concentration on its meaning, you will attain God-consciousness \nquickly.\n\nForm a strong habit of repeating the Name of the Lord. Then only it will be \neasy for you to remember Him at the time of death.\n\nTo define God is to deny God. You can give the definition of a finite \nobject. How can you define limitless or the Infinite Being who is the source \nand ultimate cause for everything? If you define God you are limiting the \nlimitless one, you are confining Him with concepts of mind. God is beyond \nthe reach of the gross mind, but He can be realised through Japa and \nmeditation with a pure, subtle and one-pointed mind.\n\n\nJapa is the repetition of any mantra or name of the Lord.In this iron age \nJapa is the easiest and surest way for God-realisation.\n\nRepeat 200 malas of Japa daily. Mala or rosary is a whip to goad the mind \ntowards God. Wear a mala on your neck. It is the most precious jewel or \nornament as it reminds you of God.\n\nPractice of Japa removes the impurities of the mind, destroys sins and \nbrings the devotee face to face with God. Japa must become habitual. Be \nregular in your Japa.\n\n\n"}}
