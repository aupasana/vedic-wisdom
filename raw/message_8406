Feeling and heart is more important th=\r\nan counting and numbers.\n\nBut how does feeling come? Though japa! That is t=\r\nhe paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is mechanical sometimes, keep doing =\r\nit. The mind will be purified and one day, feeling will come, devotion will=\r\n arise.\n\nSome of my favourite quotations on the power of japa:\n\nSwami Sivan=\r\nanda\n&quot;Religion Means &#39;To Do.&#39; It is only the one two little acts that you a=\r\nctually do, that constitute religion and spirituality. To rise early and ta=\r\nke the name of the Lord for ten minutes is what real dharma is.&quot;\nMore from =\r\nhim on japa \n\nhttp://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/japayoga.htm\n\nSwami C=\r\nhidananda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)\n&quot;One&#39;s day should start first w=\r\nith purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, making clean! Cleanse, cleanse - by=\r\n uttering God&#39;s Name, by thinking of God. The Name of God is verily God Him=\r\nself. Supreme Divinity is present here. Name and God are not two. They are =\r\none and the same. Name is God!&quot;\n\nAnandamayi Ma\n&quot;Listen! Do not let your tim=\r\ne pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you and do japa; or if this does not=\r\n suit you, at least go on repeating the Name of the Lord regularly and with=\r\nout interruption like the ticking of a clock. There are no rules or restric=\r\ntions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that appeals to you most, for as much=\r\n time as you can--the longer the better. Even if you get tired or lose inte=\r\nrest, administer the Name to yourself like a medicine that has to be taken.=\r\n In this way you will at some auspicious moment discover the rosary of the =\r\nmind, and then you will continually hear within yourself the praises of the=\r\n great Master, the Lord of Creation, like the never ceasing music of the bo=\r\nundless ocean; You will hear the land and the sea, the air and the heavens =\r\nreverberate with the song of His glory. This is called the all--pervading P=\r\nresence of His Name.&quot;\n\nPriyank, thanks very much for the message. Warren Bu=\r\nffet...cool! I will try and do homam more often- I really enjoy it. Will sc=\r\nhedule one for tomorrow evening after work if possible. Good start to the N=\r\navaratri (had never heard about this Navaratri before). \n\nRakesh ji, thanks=\r\n for the message. You are quite right. Even breathing for God...that would =\r\nbe a great state to be in...no idea when I&#39;m going to get there. Anyway pes=\r\nerverence is key. \n\nI think that nobody but God can get us to do Sadhana. I=\r\n believe that God walked every step of the way on the path for the saints..=\r\n. nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ultimately. I know we have to &quot;mak=\r\ne an effort&quot; and meet God halfway, but ultimately it is She and He who get =\r\nus to make the effort. That&#39;s why I said &quot;Damn you Durga&quot;....because You ma=\r\nde some people make that supreme effort....You alone were their Sadhana Sha=\r\nkti....and what about the rest of Your wretched children? What sort of part=\r\nial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, but what a=\r\nbout all of us eh? What sort of game is this? Anyway, it&#39;s Her game, that&#39;s=\r\n the bottom line... what can we do except play along (we have to believe it=\r\n&#39;s ultimately for our own good).\n\nOk chaps, going to do some japa now. Less=\r\n talk and more action hey!\n\nBest wishes, and happy Navaratri (let&#39;s get in =\r\nto high gear as Priyank ji says),\n\nAparna \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hey Aparna, \n&gt; \n&gt; Afte=\r\nr i sent that link mails i got 2 kick-in-face mail that were very apt writi=\r\nng this to you is kind of reaffirming that to myself. i also over intellect=\r\nualize so opportunity to answer myself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Forget all the calculation, th=\r\neories, all literature. \n&gt; \n&gt; Is there any manual good enough to teach love=\r\n and surrender ?

I tried today, and boy, it was hard...failed mostly, to be hon=\r\nest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda=\r\n, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obsessed with =\r\nthis Name business. That means, there must be something to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I rea=\r\nlly want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed with the Name. =\r\nI firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, and the Name he=\r\nlped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long story, but basical=\r\nly, I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like I was dying..=\r\n.and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Name &quot;Keshava ple=\r\nase help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesus out of me, a=\r\nnd each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only=\r\n thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon=\r\n my language), the Name alone is reliable.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m trying to say,=\r\n is I want to devise some practical ways to get serious about this sadhana.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and es=\r\npecially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are sylla=\r\nbles in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 =\r\nlakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling wou=\r\nld result in Darshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be g=\r\nreat! Really wanted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that,=\r\n at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would=\r\n take me till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But hey, I decided to mak=\r\ne a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayan=\r\naya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, wit=\r\nh my mind wandering most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of round=\r\ns with proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to say the=\r\n mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradua=\r\nlly improving but very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonn=\r\na take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take =\r\na 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purascharan=\r\na. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, two things help me get my 11 rounds of japa done every=\r\n day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mention it, if anybody&#39;s intere=\r\nsted, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One is Telephone Japa. I hold my=\r\n mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the phone. While doing this, I stick =\r\nmy hand in my pocket and count the japa on my fingers. I get a couple of ro=\r\nunds done during my working day this way (I check carefully to make sure no=\r\nbody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traffic (while the car is NOT moving=\r\n), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pretend I&#39;m chatting to a friend =\r\non the phone and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The other thing that I fi=\r\nnd useful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to =\r\nescape to do a round or two of japa at work, I excuse myself for a few minu=\r\ntes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter=\r\n the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in c=\r\nase anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a day. This allows me to =\r\ncomplete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my working hours are long. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention this for anyone e=\r\nlse whose work life interferes with their japa. At least, it provides a sol=\r\nution to doing a bit of japa at work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If anybody else has any thou=\r\nghts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
