He came to Sri Ramana in 1928 and got a job with the\nA=\r\nshram. After being closely involved in many construction projects for ten\ny=\r\nears under direct supervision of Sri Ramana, he shifted to Palakottu near\nt=\r\nhe Ashram to live alone and meditate.\n\nIn 1928, a wandering sadhu gave me a=\r\n copy of Upadesa Undiyar by Sri Ramana.\nIt contained a photo of the Maharsh=\r\ni. As soon as I saw the photo I had the\nfeeling that this was my Guru. Simu=\r\nltaneously, an intense desire arose\nwithin me to go and see him.\n\nThat nigh=\r\nt I had a dream in which I saw the Maharshi walking from the lower\nslopes o=\r\nf the hill towards the Ashram. Next morning I decided to go and have\nhis da=\r\nrshan . Having arrived at about 1 p.m., when I approached the hall, a\npart =\r\nof the dream I had repeated itself in real life. I saw Bhagavan walk\ndown t=\r\nhe hill as I had seen in the dream. When I sat down and Bhagavan gazed\nat m=\r\ne in silence for about 10-15 minutes, I had a great feeling of physical\nrel=\r\nief and relaxation. It was like immersing myself in a cool pool after\nbeing=\r\n in the hot sun. I asked for permission to stay, which was granted and\nI go=\r\nt a job as Bhagavan&#39;s attendant. At that time Madhava Swami was doing\nthe j=\r\nob by himself.\n\nAbout ten days after my arrival I asked Bhagavan how I coul=\r\nd attain\nSelf-realisation? He replied, &quot;If you give up identifying with the=\r\n body and\nmeditate on the Self,you can attain Self-realisation.&quot; As I was p=\r\nondering\nover these remarks, Bhagavan surprised me by saying,&quot;I was waiting=\r\n for you.\nI was wondering when you would come.&quot; As a new comer I was too af=\r\nraid to ask\nhim how he knew, or how long he had been waiting. But I was del=\r\nighted to\nhear him speak like this because it seemed to indicate that it wa=\r\ns my\ndestiny to stay with him.\n\nA few days later I asked, &quot;Scientists have =\r\ninvented and produced the\naircraft which can travel at great speeds in the =\r\nsky. Why do you not give us\na spiritual aircraft in which we can quickly an=\r\nd easily cross over the sea\nof samsara?&#39;&#39; Bhagavan replied, &quot;The path of se=\r\nlf-enquiry is the aircraft\nyou need. It is direct, fast,and easy to use. Yo=\r\nu are already travelling\nvery quickly towards realisation. It is only becau=\r\nse of your mind that it\nseems that there is no movement.&quot; In the years that=\r\n followed, I had many\nspiritual talks with Bhagavan but his basic message n=\r\never changed. It was\nalways: &quot;Do self-enquiry, stop identifying with the bo=\r\ndy and try to be aware\nof the Self, which is your real nature.&quot;\n\nWhen I fir=\r\nst came to the Ashram there were still some leopards in the area.\nThey rare=\r\nly came into the Ashram but at night they frequented the place\nwhere Bhagav=\r\nan used to urinate. Once when a leopard appeared he was not in\nthe least af=\r\nraid. He just looked at the leopard and said, =E2=80=98Poda=E2=80=99 [Go aw=\r\nay!]\nand the leopard walked away.\n\nSoon after I came I was given a new name=\r\n by Bhagavan. My original name was\nSellaperumal. One day Bhagavan mentioned=\r\n that I reminded him of Annamalai\nSwami, who had been his attendant at the =\r\nSkandasram. And within a few days\nmy new identity got established.\n\nWhen I =\r\nhad been an attendant for about two weeks,the Collector of Vellore,\nwho cam=\r\ne for Bhagavan&#39;s darshan , brought a large plate of sweets, which I\nwas to =\r\ndistribute to everyone in the Ashram. While I was distributing the\nsweets o=\r\nutside the hall I went to a place where no one could see me and\nsecretly he=\r\nlped myself to about double the quantity that I was serving to\nothers. When=\r\n I went back to the hall and kept the empty plate under\nBhagavan&#39;s sofa, he=\r\n looked at me and said, &quot;Did you take twice as much as\neveryone else?&quot; I wa=\r\ns shocked because I was sure that no one had seen me do\nit. This incident m=\r\nade me realise that it was impossible to hide anything\nfrom Bhagavan.\n\nAfte=\r\nr serving as an attendant for a month, Bhagavan asked me to supervise\nconst=\r\nruction work within the Ashram. My big assignment was supervising the\nconst=\r\nruction of the cowshed. The problem was of funds, which came almost\nunder m=\r\niraculous circumstances.\n\nThe editor of The Sunday Times, Madras, published=\r\n a long complimentary\narticle about Bhagavan after he had his darshan . Thi=\r\ns article came to the\nattention of a prince in North India, who was much im=\r\npressed by Bhagavan.\nSometime later, the prince went for a tiger hunt. He m=\r\nanaged to track down\nthe tiger but when he raised his rifle to shoot, he fe=\r\nlt paralysed by a wave\nof fear. Suddenly he remembered about Bhagavan and p=\r\nrayed saying, &quot;If\nsuccessful, I will not only send you Rs.1000, but also do=\r\nnate the head and\nskin of the tiger.&quot; The paralysis left him and he killed =\r\nthe tiger and saved\nhis own life in the process, as the tiger was within at=\r\ntacking distance.\n\nTwo days after all the quarrels about the size of the co=\r\nwshed, the postman\nappeared with Rs. 1,000. Our finances were always in a p=\r\nrecarious position\nbut we never experienced any real financial crisis. Whil=\r\ne the work was going\non, enough donations would come to cover all costs.\n\nB=\r\nhagavan took a keen interest in the construction work, guiding me at all\nst=\r\nages of the work. In the evening, when I went to him with my daily report,\n=\r\nhe would tell me the work to be done the following day. For any difficult\nj=\r\nobs he would even explain how to go about it.\n\nIn the 1930s Bhagavan alone =\r\ndecided when and where the buildings should be\nbuilt, on what scale and wha=\r\nt material be used. He drew up the plans for\nAshram buildings, and told me =\r\nwhat to do. If instructions were complicated\nhe would sometimes sketch a fe=\r\nw lines on a piece of paper to clarify or\nillustrate what he was saying. Wh=\r\nen he gave me plans he would always say\nthat it was only a suggestion. He n=\r\never presumed to give me orders.\n\nBhagavan himself wrote in Tamil =E2=80=98=\r\nPakasalai=E2=80=99 in big letters on a piece of\npaper. These along with the=\r\n year =E2=80=981938=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Sri Ramanasramam=E2=80=99 in deva=\r\nnagari\nscript, appear today on the top of the eastern wall of the dining ha=\r\nll.\n\nBhagavan would frequently come out to see what we were doing. He bomba=\r\nrded\nus with advice and instructions and would occasionally join in the wor=\r\nk\nhimself. But he would say, &quot;I am not connected with any of the activities=\r\n\nhere. I just witness all that happens=E2=80=9D. We would start projects wh=\r\nen no\nmoney was available to pay, happily ignoring all predictions of immin=\r\nent\nfinancial doom made by the sarvadhikari. Bhagavan never asked anyone fo=\r\nr\nmoney and he forbade the sarvadhikari from asking for donations. Yet some=\r\nhow\nenough donations came to complete every building.\n\nOnce when Bhagavan w=\r\nas very sick, Maurice Frydman gave Rs. 1,000 to the\nsarvadhikari for buying=\r\n fruits for Bhagavan. Knowing that Bhagavan would not\neat fruits unless eve=\r\nryone else was given an equal share, he avoided use of\nthe money for the pu=\r\nrpose. Some months later, Frydman complained to Bhagavan\nthat his donation =\r\nhad not been properly spent. Bhagavan said rather angrily,\n&quot;When you give s=\r\nomething you should regard the matter as closed. Why use\nthis gift to furth=\r\ner your ego?&quot;\n\nAnnamalai Swami moved to Palakottu (a colony abutting the As=\r\nhram) in 1938.\nTill the end of his life in 1995, he lived peacefully and si=\r\nlently in his\nlittle ashram. He also provided spiritual guidance to seekers=\r\n who wanted his\nhelp and guidance.\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.sriramanamaharshi.or=\r\ng/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_October_2010.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636284a34fd51c0049a2f46b2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;(Extracted from =E2=80=98Face t=\r\no Face with Sri Ramana Maharshi=E2=80=99)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style:italic&quot;&gt;Annamalai Swami (1906-1995) since his childhood had a natura=\r\nl inclination towards spirituality.
