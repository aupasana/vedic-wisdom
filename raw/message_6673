All an allopathic medicine will do is produce the artificia=\r\nl chemicals which mimic the brain chemicals and this in turns leads to an d=\r\nependency on the drug.\n\n2.Homeopathy also might not be much useful in this =\r\ncase.Please see if you can visit an really good Ayurvedic physician or if y=\r\nou could visit Pune ( Pune Ayurvedic College which is very reputed ) .Ayurv=\r\nedic consultations are available there.Also there are couple of good Ayurve=\r\ndic hospitals in and around Delhi.Nowadays it has become an big business bu=\r\nt with some research you will find an humane and affordable clinic.\n\n\n3.Mem=\r\nbers have talked about the Concept of Virodha Bhakti. Ravana and others wer=\r\ne highly elevated spiritual souls ( Jaya and Vijaya ) in the last birth who=\r\n took this route to be close to God.Anger is one of the most intense emotio=\r\nns.Nobody can stay angry 24hrs....and if you can manage to even stay angry =\r\nwith god you will be the closest to God.An great southern saint &quot; Ramadasu =\r\n&quot; wrote an bhajan in pain when he was being tortured in the dungeons ...the=\r\n emotion of the bhajan is that god is not helping him out ...he considers g=\r\nod his very own and since his very own is not helping him out...he expresse=\r\ns that anger towards him.\n\nWhat you have right now is not Virodha Bhakti. I=\r\nt can be mistaken that way. What you really need is an calm atmosphere with=\r\n good ayurvedic medicines and inner introspection.\n\nPlease do not worry abo=\r\nut Temples, Spirituality and meditation right now.None of those will work u=\r\nntill the very base ( your mind ) gets some peace. God does not want or nee=\r\nd your fearful prayers....God is not an taskmaster sitting somewhere who de=\r\nmands his share of prayers for whatever good or bad happening with your lif=\r\ne.\n\nGod is also very much present in Nature.Since you seem to live in Himac=\r\nhal pradesh ...I am sure you can take a few weekends off to go spend some p=\r\neaceful time with nature and slowly the external peace will stabilize your =\r\nmind as well.\n\nAlso see if you can cut down completely on Chilli, Onions an=\r\nd garlic and some of the chemical feedback will be cut down as well.\n\nRegar=\r\nds\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;as16475&quot; &lt;a=\r\ns16475@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear sir,\n&gt; namskar\n&gt; There was a time when I didnt =\r\nuse to have my meals before thanking god. I used to remember god 24 hors a =\r\nday. But in 1990 I started fearing god and now I hate him so much so that I=\r\n destroyed my home made temple and his posters. why i did so the reason is =\r\nas below:\n&gt; I am suffering from ocd (Obsessive compulsive disorder) since 1=\r\n990. My problem is that whenever I am doing some work some part of my mind =\r\nsays that if this work gets done I will go to temple but it is not me and I=\r\n counter this thought by saying that I will not go to temple. But at the co=\r\nmpletion of the work I am compelled to go to temple. The problem is that I =\r\nhave to go to temple compulsively and many times again and again. Also the =\r\ntemple which comes to my thoughts has to be visited to satisfy my compulsio=\r\nn. Even a simple thought that if my son answers the question I will go to t=\r\nemple. I am not even able to teach him. I cant cross the road where there i=\r\ns a temple. How can I avoid that. There are temples all around the world. P=\r\nlease help me out. For past 10 yrs I am taking allopathy medicine. For past=\r\n 7 months I am taking homeopathy also. But sometimes it goes out of control=\r\n. Please guide me how can I stop hating GOD. \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Dob :16th apri=\r\nl,1975\n&gt; Place:  kangra (Himachal Pradesh)\n&gt; Time : 8 pm\n&gt; \n&gt; a\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
