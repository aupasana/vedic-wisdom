I have been seeking answers about this for years b=\r\ny asking various scholars in India, but no-one could clarify it like you. M=\r\ny hat off to the depth of your knowledge.\n\nYou mention that the &#39;ka&#39; conson=\r\nant group corresponds to fire (as it does to Mars) and &#39;pa&#39; consonant group=\r\n corresponds to air (Saturn). This fits to Parashara&#39;s assignment of Bhutas=\r\n to the Grahas (BPHS 3. 20 / Ranjan publ.). So my question is: Would it be =\r\nright to assign each element to the consonant groups as per the Graha assig=\r\nned to it (as per Parashara)?\n\nSo would this be correct?:\n&#39;ka&#39; group -&gt; Agn=\r\ni (Mangal)\n&#39;ca&#39; group -&gt; Jala (Shukra)\n&#39;Ta&#39; group -&gt; Bhumi (Budha)\n&#39;ta&#39; gro=\r\nup -&gt; Akasha (Guru)\n&#39;pa&#39; group -&gt; Vayu (Shani)\n\nThe nasal (anunaasika)in ea=\r\nch group represents Akasha, which makes sense as it is all-pervading. Howev=\r\ner, I wonder if it is correct that the &#39;ta&#39; group (Guru) would also be assi=\r\ngned to it.\n\nI don&#39;t mean to go off topic.\nI would love to hear more about =\r\nthe correspondence between the various beeja mantras, their corresponding d=\r\neities, Grahas and the Sanskrit alphabet.\n\nBest regards and thanks,\n\nAndri\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; The ka-group of consonants represents the fire elemen=\r\nt. The pa-varga group of consonants represents the air element. Thus, &quot;n(g)=\r\n&quot; has more fire in it and &quot;m&quot; has more air in it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In each group again=\r\n, the five letters in the group represent the sub-influence of the five ele=\r\nments. The nasal (anunaasika) in each group shows the element of space (aak=\r\naasa). Thus, &quot;n(g)&quot; is a combination of space and fire and &quot;m&quot; is space and=\r\n air. Both are fine and serve different purposes. However, when g becomes e=\r\nxplicit, the space influence becomes less and that is undesirable.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   Dear Narasimha ji,\n=\r\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks a lot for this valuable information.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   You are rig=\r\nht, I have noticed as well that they work differently, and hence I asked th=\r\nis question.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I have felt more intense energy with Shreeng and Hre=\r\neng compared to Sheem and Hreem , I guess I have to practice making sure th=\r\nat &quot;g&quot; is \n&gt;    \n&gt;   not explicit at all.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Thanks again\n&gt;   &lt;delet=\r\ned&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;   Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;   For beejaaksharas, both versions ending with th=\r\ne nasal in ka-group (ng) and the nasal in pa-group (m) are valid. They work=\r\n differently, but both are valid.\n&gt; \n&gt;   However, the problem with the form=\r\ner is that most people cannot pronounce it correctly. The correct pronuncia=\r\ntion is to start saying &quot;hreeng&quot; and stop just when you are about to say &quot;g=\r\n&quot;. The sound &quot;g&quot; should not be explicit at all. To pronounce that nasal &quot;n(=\r\ng)&quot; correctly, you have to think that you are going to say &quot;ng&quot;, but stop j=\r\nust short of &quot;g&quot;. It is not easy. Most people end up pronouncing the &quot;g&quot; so=\r\nund a bit. Instead of making that mistake, it is better to just stick to &quot;h=\r\nreem&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Bottomline: The forms hreem and hreen(g) with a silent g are =\r\nboth fine. But hreeng with an explicit g is a bad idea.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Best regards=\r\n,\n&gt;   Narasimha\n&gt;     ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; \n&gt;     Dear Narsimha,=\r\n\n\n&gt;     Hope you are doing great.\n&gt;     I have a small question.  \n&gt;     So=\r\nmeone said that &quot;Hreeing&quot; is more appropriate than &quot;Hreem&quot;. &gt;     Would you=\r\n agree..?\n&gt;     Thanks\n\n\n"}}
