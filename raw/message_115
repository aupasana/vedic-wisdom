However, compared to fire in regular \nhomam, fire in a deepa homam is restricted and unfree. Thus, a regular homam \nis far more effective than a deepa homam.\n\nBut, if you have no better choice, it can certainly be considered.\n\nSome people living in apartments in USA have performed Mahaganapathi homam, \nbut I am not that familiar with UK.\n\nIf you use dry coconut pieces only (i.e. no wood) and put the right amount \nof ghee, it actually generates hardly any smoke. However, that takes a \nlittle bit of practice. Doing the homam near a window and keeping the window \nopen can also help.\n\nThere is a smoke detector right next to the door (which is always kept open) \nof the room in which I do my daily homam at my house. It goes off very \nrarely.\n\nIf Ganapathi wants you to worship Him in fire, He will show you the way.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Sharat&quot; &lt;gidoc@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, August 19, 2007 7:32 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Ganapati Havan/Homam\n\n\n&gt; ||Namah Shivaya||\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sri Narsimha ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; I follow your teachings and lessons very closely and have been\n&gt; reflecting on beginning the Ganapati havan as per your teching and\n&gt; illustrations.\n&gt; However I live in a modern apartment in UK,with fire/smoke alrams;\n&gt; have no personal open ground or balcony.
