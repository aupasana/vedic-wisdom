So this requires a complicated balancing act on pa=\r\nrt of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very=\r\n complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking =\r\nof agents for their delivery.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; At a=\r\nny time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karma=\r\nphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphal=\r\na in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experi=\r\nenced anytime soon.

Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities =\r\nin terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and hence =\r\nthe pools may be re-arranged.&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n *&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; As one engages in remedial measures =\r\nsuch as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, ch=\r\nange one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (=\r\nincluding planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of ka=\r\nrmaphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of de=\r\nlivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable =\r\nkarmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the=\r\n same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or p=\r\nushed up in order within the same pool.&gt; &gt;&gt;\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Whe=\r\nn someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behind it (th=\r\nis is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arranging kar=\r\nmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people around on=\r\ne, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to giv=\r\ne karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala an=\r\nytime soon may be advanced sooner.&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; Howe=\r\nver, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma t=\r\nhat it is trying to manipulate.

However, even great souls have a lot of negativ=\r\ne karmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive=\r\n karmas in their\n optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and bl=\r\nessings can often make some difference.&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji re=\r\nferred in his point (3).&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the frui=\r\nts of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, wh=\r\no may show favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-a=\r\nspect of God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect=\r\n of God is the power that impartially and impassionately manages the fine b=\r\nalance and order within this play of actions and fruits.

The best we can do with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reord=\r\ner them somewhat. The most important thing is to not add more serious bad k=\r\narmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cau=\r\nse pain or harm to others are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions t=\r\nhat cause pleasure or benefit to others are good karmas.&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline=\r\n of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action=\r\n, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastras, but=\r\n we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action.

The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him\n=\r\n to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them t=\r\no appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed th=\r\nem to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The s=\r\nanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curse=\r\ns that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. A=\r\nt the end of the day, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech=\r\n discharge their tapas shakti through speech.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When it come=\r\ns to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We as=\r\nsume that there is a person, and separate from the person are his many karm=\r\nas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want s=\r\nomeone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the sam=\r\ne thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your\n mind-impression=\r\ns ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. =\r\nOr course, that is easier said than done.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Any moment when =\r\nyour mind becomes quiet is a blessing.

The She-aspect of God is the power that impartial=\r\nly and\n impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play =\r\nof actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of=\r\n evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced d=\r\nelivery of fruits to actions using available agents.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The karmas we committed in the p=\r\nast are already in the pipeline and will give their results sooner or later=\r\n. The best we can do with them, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder the=\r\nm somewhat. The most important thing is to not add more serious bad karmas =\r\nto the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions that cause pai=\r\nn or harm to others are bad karmas and selfless actions and actions that ca=\r\nuse pleasure or benefit to others are good karmas.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When it comes to manipulating the p=\r\nre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effor=\r\nt and current action, yes, it\n is possible and general guidelines are avail=\r\nable in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each=\r\n action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma ha=\r\ns to be commensurate with the karma itself.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You need only small force to push a cat o=\r\nut of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --------&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast=\r\nrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org=\r\n/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --------&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;______________________________=\r\n__&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: ma=\r\nilto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sent:\n Tuesday, =\r\nFebruary 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] few questions&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant =\r\nwas appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was=\r\n possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king.

The beggar&#39;s karma made him a =\r\nking. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the kin=\r\ng. The minister&#39;s karma\n allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the k=\r\ning. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and ac=\r\ncept the result.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Ma=\r\nny of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actual=\r\nly blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amount of p=\r\nurity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to peop=\r\nle and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that=\r\n there is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These=\r\n karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone to=\r\n come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches =\r\nus that a\n &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. An=\r\nd you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other wo=\r\nrds, your vaasanaas are your karmas.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have ch=\r\nanged your karma.

Any moment when your mind becomes agitated=\r\n is a curse.

I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;=\r\ns curse in Aghora trilogy.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, w=\r\nhat happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also co=\r\nme across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwe=\r\ntarka Ganapati =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; what do this items really=\r\n do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =C3=\r\n=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; do they bring forward good karmas or they c=\r\nreate new ones?&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from f=\r\namous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein\n a just widowed l=\r\nady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we =\r\nworship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, =\r\nbut later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next=\r\n birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying=\r\n to recollect this episode from old memory].
