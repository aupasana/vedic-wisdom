Suddenly the sun asked him=\r\n, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming ou=\r\nt to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive =\r\nhim away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love?=\r\n?? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaj=\r\ni&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized =\r\nprofusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is=\r\n the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no=\r\n matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was=\r\n a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the s=\r\nun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage,=\r\n and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gi=\r\nves, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which lead=\r\ns to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s forem=\r\nost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to n=\r\no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, j=\r\nust because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet wh=\r\nat do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\nirths combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this wor=\r\nship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nese days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he=\r\n is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with h=\r\nim, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he =\r\nis lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know thes=\r\ne characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to =\r\nhis chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why=\r\n don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me y=\r\nou forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daught=\r\ner - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh c=\r\nhahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bh=\r\nen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot o=\r\nf people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told yo=\r\nu that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You lov=\r\ne then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask =\r\nfrom God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for =\r\nher. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be de=\r\nlivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become b=\r\nig enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam =\r\nhai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god he=\r\nrself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;=\r\nd rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, dese=\r\nrve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is=\r\n eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have su=\r\nrrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendere=\r\nd, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be =\r\ntotal, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming=\r\n it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, k=\r\nyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, th=\r\ney are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you=\r\n in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever =\r\nneed a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful lif=\r\ne post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet=\r\n house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest me=\r\nn, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained=\r\n be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he s=\r\nees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mas=\r\nter , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with god, and what d=\r\no we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master brings, beca=\r\nuse we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe,=\r\n bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I onl=\r\ny want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are =\r\nyou so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, alw=\r\nays SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji bri=\r\nngs us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that =\r\nmilk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at h=\r\nis thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ab=\r\nout the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the lef=\r\nt handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you. =\r\nThey do to Mr Rao&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentor.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maalik, main she=\r\nhennshaye - e - befkuf aap jaise sant mahagyaani logon\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ke kya jaw=\r\naab doonga, mujhe kuch nahin aata, main gadha hoon aur sada\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rahoo=\r\nnga.

He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you w=\r\nant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man l=\r\nooked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t =\r\nstand him in summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, ju=\r\nst because my body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All =\r\nof us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all t=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man sai=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the =\r\nsun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the m=\r\nan only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; =\r\nThe temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summ=\r\ners we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that=\r\n orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all =\r\nbecause of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen whi=\r\nch leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. With=\r\nout him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no=\r\n mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he =\r\nloves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of u=\r\ns do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship business. =\r\nAnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a =\r\nman loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically=\r\n she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ma=\r\nn her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll t=\r\nell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I=\r\n myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form=\r\n of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask =\r\nof her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorak=\r\nhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, m=\r\neri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe=\r\n who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duni=\r\nya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have=\r\n met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are =\r\nsure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim th=\r\nat somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You=\r\n people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but th=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to kn=\r\now whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.=\r\n  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should co=\r\nme and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer=\r\n that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, becau=\r\nse if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how =\r\ncan then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dek=\r\nhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not part=\r\nial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and sayi=\r\nng what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwa=\r\nan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surr=\r\nender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin =\r\nor a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surr=\r\nender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and=\r\n the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest=\r\n, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. =\r\nA dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master,=\r\n that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring =\r\nhim chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happ=\r\ny, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is =\r\nhappy.
