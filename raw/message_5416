But you are going to the o=\r\nther extreme when suggesting that physical immortality is the highest ideal=\r\n. Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ign=\r\noring the views of a stereotypical psudo-vedantin of today, we can see that=\r\n vedanta in fact does not say physical body is to be ignored. It asks us *r=\r\nealize* that we are not the physical body and we are something else residin=\r\ng in a shell called the physical body. What we truly are, can neither be cr=\r\neated nor be destroyed, though physical body may perish. But, if someone cu=\r\nrrently thinks that one is a physical body, one cannot simply ignore the ph=\r\nysical body. One has to *use* the physical body to eventually realize that =\r\none is not the physical body. A mere intellectual statement of it is not ta=\r\nntamount to its realization.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In Yog=\r\na Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that action (karma) and know=\r\nledge (jnaana) are two wings with which the bird of individualized consciou=\r\nsness flies into the sky of self-realization. Physical body is not to be ig=\r\nnored, but to be used skillfully and carefully to perform the *right action=\r\ns* that can free one.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions w=\r\nithout correct knowledge (that god is the doer of all actions!) is like a p=\r\nerson who is walking around a mountain not realizing that the goal of walki=\r\nng is to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not rea=\r\nch the top. On the other hand, one having the correct knowledge but not per=\r\nforming actions is like someone who knows that reaching the top of the moun=\r\ntain is the goal and keeps staring at the top, without walking. Such a pers=\r\non will remain at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone ar=\r\ne not able to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings=\r\n of a bird. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us=\r\n towards liberation.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Physical bodie=\r\ns of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long time, like centuries =\r\nor millennia. But, eventually, they too may give up physical body. Someone =\r\nmentioned Vallalar, but he gave up physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Actu=\r\nally, to a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortality =\r\nwill sound silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modificatio=\r\nns such as physical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A si=\r\nddha, as long as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in an=\r\n individualized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a p=\r\nhysical body. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge back =\r\nin the ethereal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so o=\r\nn. So, what is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Trilinga =\r\nSwami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bha=\r\ni of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to Varan=\r\nasi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Da=\r\nkshineshwar and taught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga=\r\n Swami. Later, a grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swam=\r\ni a big container full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his impri=\r\nsonment by the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some gu=\r\nards to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the =\r\nsame time. Even when he finally decided to give up his body and his discipl=\r\nes put his body in a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen after =\r\na few minutes to walk on the other side.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; To a realized being with=\r\n a high enough command over duality, creation and destruction of physical b=\r\nody is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One who thinks that a gold coin is special=\r\n and needs to be preserved forever will struggle to do so. One who realizes=\r\n that a gold coin, a gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all ba=\r\nsically the same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate it again. Preserving=\r\n the coin forever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities bec=\r\nause he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The s=\r\name non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realizes non-dual Self or Y reali=\r\nzes non-dual Self, the realization is the same. But, if one retains individ=\r\nual ego-consciousness and interacts with the field of duality, different po=\r\nssibilities are there. One may engage in various actions using a physical b=\r\nody and at the end drop the ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, one=\r\n may engage in various actions using a physical body, then give it up and t=\r\nie the ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and remain in a higher realm f=\r\nor a long time. If so, one may re-enter a physical body from time to time. =\r\nBut, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and evolution in the field of du=\r\nality. Though, all are the same at the non-dual level, different beings hav=\r\ne different caliber in the field of duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha =\r\nor a natha may not be the same as somebody else.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am afraid he lent himself vulnerable =\r\nto misinterpretation when it comes to divinization of matter. I say quite e=\r\nmphatically that physical immortality as an ideal and as the end goal of on=\r\ne&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The only worthy goal is to effac=\r\ne individual ego, realize Self and, if needed, engage with the world with a=\r\n subtle ego and do whatever comes spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning =\r\nis overcome, Nature starts to show one the role one has to play. One should=\r\n just play the role given to one well, instead of asking for this role or t=\r\nhat role.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg \n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The aim=\r\n of my mails is only to free the minds of the reader from biases, caused by=\r\n dominating propaganda of Vedantists - that is to see the Physical body as =\r\nsomething to be ignored for spiritual pursuit.

As I mentioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;earlie=\r\nr, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa proposed to give some siddhis to Vivekananda\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;and the latter rejected them because they would not help him in reali=\r\nzing god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Siddhis and other abilities that come without a consciou=\r\ns pursuit can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;accepted with neither excitement nor regret, but =\r\nthey are not worth pursuing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNo, this is not an issue of afterlife. One can do sadhana and realize\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;Self even when alive and then live as a jeevanmukta flowing with divine=\r\n will.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is that as long as eg=\r\no and individual will are present,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one is moved by the force of in=\r\ndividual will and stuck in the game of actions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and reactions. Once=\r\n they are effaced, one flows with divine will and is out of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the ga=\r\nme of actions and reactions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline i=\r\ns Sense-experience is not different from Ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Phys=\r\nical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSo, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn ab=\r\nout\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the achievements made by all those we can know of=\r\n, irrespective\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of their being recognized as good or bad\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First of all, Ravana is NOT an example of th=\r\ne attainment of the &quot;highest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideal of Aurobindo&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s ideals have been misunderstood by many learned =\r\npeople to mean\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that he was striving for physical immortality. He s=\r\nadly ended up attracting some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wrong people that way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is possible to remove the distinction between manifes=\r\nted things and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Brahman and view them as non-different. But that st=\r\nate is not attainable by even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great yogis. Moreover, that state is=\r\n not achieved by actively pursuing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nbest course of action for any sadhaka is to ignore the physical form,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;overcome the fascination for it and its needs, realize the underlying S=\r\nelf and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;live as a jeevanmukta like a leaf flowing in wind. If one =\r\nis meant to divinize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;physical form like Mahavatar Babaji has done,=\r\n divine will will then make one to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;do so. But, one consciously pur=\r\nsuing it is likely to retain fascination for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;physical form, no=\r\nt realize Self and get nowhere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silenta=\r\ndmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One thing =\r\nis clear that Ravana is not my kin, thus, it could only be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;your im=\r\nagination that I have any sympathies for him or Rama. I am amongst the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;general populace of the world - to me, only the greatness part of the =\r\ntwo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;characters have any meaning, not their faults and fallacies, b=\r\nut I don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;eulogize either of them neither demean them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not a philosopher. What I have tried to stat=\r\ne so far, w.r.t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Success with Mantra&quot; topic, is that No matter how=\r\n hard one tries, Ravanas&#39; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ramas&#39; achievements in the field of &quot;=\r\nduality&quot; cannot be erased by any amount of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;Highest shakti&quot; with o=\r\nr without Ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason lies in what Auro=\r\nbindo states as Sat-chid-ananda as the basis of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;all planes of exis=\r\ntence including Physical plane of existence. Argument of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Impermane=\r\nnce by Advaitins has not so far been able to erase the world of duality\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;from existence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the basis of sense-mind, =\r\nChit is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;basis of Physical consciousness, and Sat is the basis =\r\nof existence of Physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;plane, so lets not argue that there is an=\r\nother reality which is better and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happier than this one, and that =\r\nthis world is a myth. If physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sense-experience is fleeting, it=\r\n is because one has not progressed enough to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;realize why the truth=\r\n of being is expressed in such a way at this plane of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;existence ?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different from Anan=\r\nda, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the f=\r\nield of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfe=\r\nct self-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This question was asked because you were trying to compare apples =\r\nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;oranges, by saying that (egolessness) soul consciousness comp=\r\netes with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness, presuming that they act upon each oth=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Truth of the matter is that Soul is=\r\n not in competition with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness ever, because God is ne=\r\nver in competition with his creation !! If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a liberated soul wants =\r\nto take part in an ego competition (Yada Yada hee\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Dharmasya), it h=\r\nas to have an ego, however high, like that of an avatar. Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;t=\r\nook the wheel of the chariot and tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Other people may differ with me on this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OTOH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than the l=\r\nast\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time. It is understandable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent=\r\n in every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mind-set, because at times, it is not possible to write =\r\nevery little detail for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sake of consistency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the happiness one gets when one achieves something=\r\n in the field &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chi=\r\nd-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo Ghosh has clearly stated:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;...If the immortal and infinite spirit has veiled itself in Matter=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is emerging, the development of a liberated Supramental being=\r\n who shall impose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in Mind, Life and Matter a higher law than that =\r\nof limitation and Division, is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the inevitable conclusion from the =\r\nnature of the cosmic existence. There is no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reason why such a bein=\r\ng should not liberate and make Divine the physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;existence as we=\r\nll as the Mind and Life....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, lets a=\r\nttempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with highest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideal =\r\nof Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done, because its basis is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn about all the achievements mad=\r\ne by all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those we can know of, irrespective of their being recogni=\r\nzed as good or bad by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;limited set of people, for a limited durat=\r\nion of time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are just a few of my=\r\n views based on what I have read so far,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;because I don&#39;t see any r=\r\neason, why an afterlife would bring me greater truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than where I =\r\nam now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arya=\r\nma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You say that &quot;Killing Ra=\r\nvana was not a great deed&quot; and yet look at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;binding the physical b=\r\nody of both Ram and Lakshman&quot; as a &quot;great deed&quot;.

Anyway, I will just make a couple of specific points on=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti, which is a subtle topic and not easy to understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If memory is extended the longest, =\r\nthe most fundamental and first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;memory should say that one is Brahm=\r\nan. If one&#39;s memory extends that far, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;creates the highest Sha=\r\nkti! In other words, self-realization brings the highest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do =\r\n? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great=\r\n question!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any lower shakti is an a=\r\nbility to perform actions with objects in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;field of duality. Wh=\r\ny does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;field=\r\n of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the other.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the field=\r\n of duality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;which is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one is=\r\n pursuing an individual will, one may be swimming with or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;against =\r\nthe divine will. One will have some successes and some failures, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;pleasures and some pains. When one&#39;s individual will has dropped off an=\r\nd one is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;flowing with the rhythm of the divine will, one is in bli=\r\nss no matter what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does. One *can* do anything, but one does on=\r\nly what divine rhythm wills done by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only the fully detached Shiva can beget Shakti in totality a=\r\nnd demons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like Ravana or Mahisha or Shumbha can only get some trap=\r\npings of Shakti but can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;never beget Shakti in totality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A demon like Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kil=\r\nl or imprison a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-realized rishi. It may seem like the demon ha=\r\ns more shakti. But the rishi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is in bliss whether he is alive or be=\r\ning killed, whether he is at his hermitage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or in prison. The happi=\r\nness demons got from their successes were short-lived and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ended la=\r\nter. But the rishi was in constant bliss. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;superior.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like m=\r\nortals, taking help from mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, jus=\r\nt order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the a=\r\nbility to do things in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the field of duality. Just as you do not gi=\r\nve important work to irresponsible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people, any level of shakti nev=\r\ner goes to people who do not know how to handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that level of shak=\r\nti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a rishi wanted, he coul=\r\nd&#39;ve summoned Rudra to finish off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a=\r\n rishi is in bliss no matter what and does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;break divine rhythm=\r\n. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;establish ce=\r\nrtain lessons for future and take care of Ravana, a rishi will let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;that happen and not do anything hasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyo=\r\ntish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and killed Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Killing =\r\nRavana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had done that 10 =\r\ntimes himself, beheading his own head, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the shakti of his sadha=\r\nna was such that he got a new head every time to continue\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sadh=\r\nana. On a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;Physical consciousness, so even that part is not in the hands of a mort=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If=\r\n you still put Ravana above Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quest=\r\nion your understanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mund=\r\nane level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;only aft=\r\ner he was reminded of it. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vidya because of the curse of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the =\r\nability to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;remember the series of actions to be done to effect a c=\r\nause lawfully,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;irrespective of the doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perfec=\r\nt memory by birth, and not by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the association with Rama. Ravana di=\r\ndn&#39;t have perfect memory, else he would have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attempted to kill Vib=\r\nhishana sooner than later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nuse of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ra=\r\nm and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, because even the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;motherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a rope. Me=\r\nghnaad was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Garuda =\r\nusing divine powers, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;result would have been different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhishana reveal=\r\ning the secrets, it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible to kill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of the fi=\r\neld of duality and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of =\r\nability to manipulate objects in the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. The\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; latter represents the highest shakti and Lord Rama =\r\nhad it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest =\r\nshakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ? Why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;then fight like morta=\r\nls, taking help from mortal allies ? Instead, just order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Rudra to =\r\nfinish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egolessness is not a shakti, but a quality of Soul consciousness,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in the same manner as Ego is a quality of Physical creation. It rev=\r\neals a manner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of operating harmoniously with Nature, without creat=\r\ning conflicts, something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;that Ravana didn&#39;t know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much purity is enough and for what purpose ?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different levels of purity can=\r\n generate different results (and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;traps!),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbased on one&#39;s background.

It is a continuum.

The =\r\ninstinct of self-preservation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another=\r\n aspect of ego. A person with ego and pride may suppress\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pride\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and self-importance out of no choice, for self-prese=\r\nrvation. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a chance to e=\r\nxert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-preserv=\r\nation, one may still do so. This is conditional\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;surrender.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s =\r\nlife is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a mess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and one is helpless may s=\r\ntill be conditional surrender. But,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;when the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; surrender is unconditional and one sees god as the controller\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;of all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any conditions attached, irrespec=\r\ntive of whether life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or bad, one=\r\n becomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-control\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A powerless per=\r\nson may also become angry. But, as you said, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;anger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;s self-control increase=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to become angry comes =\r\ndown. That increases one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;power. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pers=\r\non who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infinitely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;Higher the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-control and purity, higher th=\r\ne power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
