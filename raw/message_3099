Do not trust him when he speaks on an=\r\nything else. He does know his Koran well.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Look at this logically=\r\n. Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. If that =\r\nperfected man could not have a directed communion with Allah ever, and need=\r\ned a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermediary,=C2=A0why shou=\r\nld any=C2=A0other muslim ever have a direct connection with Allah? Therefor=\r\ne Islam forbids this idea.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There is one idea in Islam that *Shay=\r\natan* was created from the fire. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Actually as far as I know - I =\r\nmaybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The entities which live =\r\nby fire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They are another class who mostl=\r\ny dwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry informatio=\r\nn from earth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for differ=\r\nent purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hindu termin=\r\nologies for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do actually use J=\r\ninns and work out so called miracles. Maybe they are something like spirits=\r\n or beings of some astral plane. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, one who does Homa nee=\r\nd for a=C2=A0 deity need not worry about these in the least. When a deity l=\r\nike Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothing else will dare interfere.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But the real reason why most muslims have an issue with fire is =\r\nbecause in one Hadith it is mentioned prophet Muhammed disliked fire becaus=\r\ne it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire to them is a symbol of the final times =\r\nwhere the sinners and the kufrs will be thrown by Allah into a huge fire.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180=\r\n degree apart in different directions or actually they try to make it such =\r\nthat they never meet.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. In my readin=\r\ng of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use half trut=\r\nhs when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly and whole=\r\nsomely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - specially H=\r\nindus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C2=A0 An explanation for this=\r\n maybe digressing and long.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But generally, if I were born in a m=\r\nuslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day ou=\r\nt and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as the perf=\r\nected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would consider Z=\r\nakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamental that unle=\r\nss one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there cannot be a =\r\nreconciliation.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing the koran=\r\n for 9 years. At the end of the nine years he started his temple demolishio=\r\nn campaign.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is no wonder that more than 90 percent of muslim you=\r\nth, even those highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a gift of Allah to=\r\n the Ummah and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and &#39;comparitive religions&#39; =\r\nalive on earth. I am speaking from personal interaction. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; At som=\r\ne point I used to get very angry with muslims. Now I don&#39;t. I find them to =\r\nbe a victim more than any one, and a victim who is not even aware of the fa=\r\nct that he is a victim! A victim not of USA=C2=A0 or Zionists or Hindus or =\r\nanyone.

As you can well understand from his p=\r\noetry, his realization was quite different from traditional Islamic learnin=\r\ng. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his time. He was a pacifist =\r\nand a true saint.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Most people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C2=\r\n=A0to be a branch of Islam. My personal view is different. In most of the p=\r\noetry I have read of famous Sufi sants like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=\r\n=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me that their personal realization was q=\r\nuite different from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of the Sufi philosp=\r\nhy like in pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of these areas, speci=\r\nally Persia, after it was over run by Islam, in order to protect their phil=\r\nosophy garbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise they would=\r\n have faced sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self preservation whic=\r\nh in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more sublime p=\r\nath - IMHO -=C2=A0than that which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran pro=\r\nper.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about something similar to=C2=\r\n=A0reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one does talk abo=\r\nut communion with God:\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I searched for God among the Christia=\r\nns and on the Cross and therein I found Him not.\n&gt; &gt; I went into the ancien=\r\nt temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was there.\n&gt; &gt; I entered the mountai=\r\nn cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\n&gt; &gt; Wit=\r\nh set purpose I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only =\r\n&#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.\n&gt; &gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort =\r\nof old and young; God was not there even.\n&gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inqui=\r\nred about him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range.\n&gt; &gt; I fared=\r\n then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestat=\r\nion only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there even =\r\nin that exalted court.\n&gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart and there I =\r\nsaw Him; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Communion with God is an idea =\r\nimpossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always seperate from th=\r\ne creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses Rumi did e=\r\nulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that was an a=\r\nttempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe person who changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C2=A0 =\r\nShams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was=\r\n so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up wi=\r\nth him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;I=\r\nn the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times =\r\nand yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the d=\r\nead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally y=\r\nou cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and e=\r\nxecuted him.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who wa=\r\ns executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. T=\r\nhis statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in Ind=\r\nia. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva f=\r\nor a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Generally, except for the =\r\nfamous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect for most Sufis =\r\nsaint. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a different more subjecti=\r\nve interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars were never =\r\nfooled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even today. And I =\r\ndo not blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadiths with tell=\r\n you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any sort of Go=\r\nd communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my views of what=\r\n ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true, traditiona=\r\nl and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; BTW, Suf=\r\ni ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably=\r\n spiritual higher middle class.
