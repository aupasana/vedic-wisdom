Think of the skirt of severed arms with the hands still att=\r\nached which she sports.

Gayatri, especia=\r\nlly in Homan seems to make things awaken in me, even with a tinge of sexual=\r\n desire, yet still making me more spiritual. Separately, for the past few m=\r\nonths, I have been having this heavy weight of a depressive feeling (due to=\r\n several events/situations in my life) which just hasnt left me, and even t=\r\nhe Gayatri/Homam doesnt relieve except immediately after a Homam for less t=\r\nhan a day. After some reading around and doing some astrology, I finally ar=\r\nrived at a Kali mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye namah, and I have started medita=\r\nting on that every morning, but I still do weekend homams with Savitur Gaya=\r\ntri. But things have changed now. The Kali mantra is very punishing in a me=\r\nntal tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal with mental hardship wi=\r\nthout completely giving up/getting angry/stressed. So I have continued it. =\r\nYet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the Gayatri results seems a bit wea=\r\nker - I have no idea why. Also, if I dont meditate on the Kali mantra later=\r\n on in the same day (i.e. if I try to drop a day of doing Kali mantra), I g=\r\net into conflicts much more easily. Is there some kind of conflict between =\r\nthe two? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
