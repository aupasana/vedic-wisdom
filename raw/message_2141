Veda deals with various aspects of dual a=\r\nnd non-dual self. There are hardly any good translations or commentaries on=\r\n Veda in today&#39;s world. Aurobindo&#39;s commentary (on a small number of riks) =\r\nis the only intelligent commentary I have come across.\n=C2=A0\nJust as Adi S=\r\nankara devoted his life to commenting on some Upanishads, someone like him =\r\nneeds to come and devote life to commenting on Veda, if we are to have a go=\r\nod commentary. Actually, Vivekananda commented on his last day (1902 July 4=\r\n) on the commentaries on Veda. He had his disciples read a verse from Sukla=\r\n Yajur Veda, read the commentary by Mahidhara and said that Mahidhara&#39;s int=\r\nerpretation did not appeal to his mind. He connected the verse to some late=\r\nr day tantra concepts and wished that his disciples would make an attempt a=\r\nt fresh independent interpretation of mantras from Veda, as the existing=C2=\r\n=A0commentaries=C2=A0were not good. This was one of the last few desires ex=\r\npressed by Vivekananda before he gave up his body.\n=C2=A0\nAurobindo said th=\r\nat he had a vision of Vivekananda in his prison cell and that Vivekananda e=\r\nxplained some things to him. It is interesting that Aurobindo came up with =\r\na sublime commentary on some Vedic verses in later years.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nDo not trust any commentary on Veda. More so the one at the we=\r\nbsite you mentioned. I checked out a few verses. The translations given by =\r\nthem are usually quite silly.

It is not merely an in=\r\ntellectual activity requiring scholarship and logical thinking.\n=C2=A0\nI=C2=\r\n=A0cannot give a complete sense of what this verse is saying (will try late=\r\nr), but can give an overall big picture first. The verses around this verse=\r\n alternate between having Pururava as the rishi (seer) and Urvashi as the d=\r\nevata (deity) and having Urvashi as the rishi (deity) and Pururava as the d=\r\nevata (deity). This is an exchange between Pururava and Urvashi as they pur=\r\nsued each other. You can read various puranic stories about Pururava, the g=\r\nreat king from Chandra vamsha, and Urvashi, the beautiful apsara (celestial=\r\n nymph). They were attracted to each other and lived together on earth. The=\r\ny are personifications of some qualities inside us.\n=C2=A0\nUrvashi comes fr=\r\nom ura and vasha. It means one who has the power to control and pull the he=\r\nart. Urvashi is personification of the attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart to=\r\nwards various objects in the field of duality. As a sadhaka does great tapa=\r\nscharya and starts to overcome duality, Urvashi is sent to test one. Urvash=\r\ni successfully seducing a sadhaka and disturbing his tapascharya means that=\r\n the sadhaka succumbed to the power of attraction that pulled his heart tow=\r\nards objects and his heart desired something.\n=C2=A0\nPururava means a cryin=\r\ng a lot or crying majestically. He is a personification of the emotional na=\r\nture and compassion within us. No wonder he is a king in the Chandra vamsha=\r\n. The solar and lunar lineages that are popular in the scriptures have to d=\r\no with the solar and lunar channels - Pingala and Ida (respectively) . Ida =\r\nnadi is the channel of emotions, intuition, feeling, compassion etc. So Pur=\r\nurava is from that lineage.\n=C2=A0\nWhile everyone is charmed by Urvashi - t=\r\nhe power of attraction that binds one&#39;s heart, Urvashi herself was charmed =\r\nby Pururava, the majestic and noble king. Pururava rescued Urvashi from a d=\r\nemon once. The majestic and noble quality of compassion saves the power of =\r\nattraction from having to combine with meaner motives. One&#39;s heart=C2=A0can=\r\n be pulled towards various objects out of the spirit of self-gratification =\r\n(a demon) or out of kindness and compassion (Pururava). When compassion ari=\r\nses in one&#39;s heart, then the heart&#39;s attraction to others is driven by comp=\r\nassion rather than the spirit of self-gratification.\n=C2=A0\nThe verses you =\r\nreferred to are a dialog between the personification of compassion and pers=\r\nonification of the power of attraction that pulls one&#39;s heart towards vario=\r\nus objects. This whole series of verses has to be interpreted in abstract a=\r\nnd internalized terms.
