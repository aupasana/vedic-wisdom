You\n&gt; need to let go of th=\r\ne thought that the fire needs constant attention; it\n&gt; will do what it want=\r\ns to do. Try and develop a healthy, respectful and\n&gt; loving relationship wi=\r\nth the fire. Your situation is not new to me; I&#39;ve\n&gt; faced this quite a few=\r\n times where I get tensed about whether the poornahuti\n&gt; will burn or not. =\r\nSlowly I&#39;ve learnt to let go and flow with the situation.\n&gt; If you use a co=\r\nconut piece as poornahuti, then dip it in ghee before\n&gt; offering...do this =\r\nimmediately after vasordhara...u will see that when\n&gt; vasordharaa starts, t=\r\nhe fire will simply leap up as if in anticipation. If\n&gt; you use a half of a=\r\n dry coconut as poornahuti, then fill that half with\n&gt; ghee, coin, what all=\r\n you offered before and place it carefully in the centre\n&gt; of the havan kun=\r\nd. If you use a full dry coconut as poornahuti, then before\n&gt; the havan, cu=\r\nt it into two parts (where one part is smaller and other is\n&gt; larger), fill=\r\n the larger part with ghee and other offerings, close the\n&gt; coconut and tie=\r\n it up with a string or cloth...then keep it ready for\n&gt; offering.\n&gt; \n&gt; In =\r\nany case, let go and delve deep into medidation trusting the fire to do\n&gt; w=\r\nhat it will do...then watch the magic unfold!\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On Tue, Mar 29, 2011 at 6:28 PM, Jitender Dahiya &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Utpal and KK for such a prompt reply.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; @Utpal--But the problem i face is even if there is unburnt coconut in =\r\nfire\n&gt; &gt; i need too add ghee from time to time otherwise that extra ghee ad=\r\nded before\n&gt; &gt; meditation goes and gets accumulated in the bottom.\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nfire would go off after 5-7 minutes of starting my mediattion if i dont\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n give some attentiion to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @KK-- as far as i doing another homam =\r\nas quickly is possible, i try to do\n&gt; &gt; that everyday.
