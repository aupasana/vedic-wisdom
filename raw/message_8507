They say God gives troubles like illnesses as a blessing t=\r\no those He loves a lot so they remember Him, and attain Him quickly. But I =\r\nknow from my own experience of terrible head-splitting migraines that it is=\r\n not easy to appreciate this type of His &#39;help&#39; without grumbling a little =\r\n(or a lot as in my case!). \n\nWhile saying the Mahamrityunjaya mantra, I wis=\r\nh you a speedy recovery and restoration of your good health.   \n\nBest wishe=\r\ns,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishr=\r\nihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Thanks fo=\r\nr writing this mail for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0In 1999 a Light had appeared in my P=\r\nuja Room for several minutes and then I had very unexpectedly chance to vis=\r\nit Sri Nathdwara for several days which was a very happy experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n have a very difficult physical pain and despite having several times extra=\r\nordinary spiritual experiences, it has not been resolved. Yesterday was one=\r\n of those days and i was very upset due to pain. About midnight I was sayin=\r\ng to Divine Lord who reside in Nathdwara that You do not care and similar t=\r\nhings. Then I went to bed without eating.\n&gt; In the morning when I saw your =\r\nletter I felt Divine Lord looking at me.\n&gt; \n&gt; That window is there so that =\r\nDivine Lord could look at His devotees with Loving gaze, who live in far aw=\r\nay lands and needs His Grace all the time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for writing th=\r\nis timely letter.\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _______________________________=\r\n_\n&gt;  From: Bhaskar &lt;bhaskar_jyotish@...&gt;\n&gt; To: JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 17 July 2012, 4:52\n&gt; Subject: [JyotishGroup] Temple at N=\r\nathdwara....\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; \n&gt; had visited this temple a few y=\r\nears ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; The have kept a windows (Small One) on the far away wall of =\r\nthe temple right opposite the Diety Shreenath ji, so that as per a promise =\r\nmade to Dhruva- it could have a Darshan of the Diety Shreenath ji as soon a=\r\ns the Darshan opened in the morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; This window they say is the windo=\r\nw for Darshans of Shreenathji for Dhruva who was His Ardent devotee. Now if=\r\n the Stars were moving why would they have placed this wondow as such. I am=\r\n wondering, because the temple Creators are much more smarter than all the =\r\nPanchang makers collectively assembled together .\n&gt; \n&gt; Some one please answ=\r\ner this one.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Bhaskar.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
