I\nund=\r\nerstood from the Aghori boks that there are several taboos concerning ANY\nf=\r\nire(never to blow it out, turns one feet towards it etc), and presume these=\r\n\nalso apply to the homam fire after the ritual is completed, but otherwise,=\r\n\nare there other prohibitions one must observe concerning the post-homam fi=\r\nre\nand it uses, could one for instances, warm their hands by it, use it to\n=\r\nlight a candle etc. Any input on this would be appreciated.\n-Aaron K\n\nOn Th=\r\nu, Nov 11, 2010 at 9:43 AM, Ajaya B &lt;laughing29@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste....\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe that making offerings after every shloka reduces so=\r\nme of the\n&gt; likelihood of physical symptoms becoming a problem.

However, it depends\n&gt; on the individ=\r\nual case. In some cases, some physical/material obstacles may\n&gt; have to be =\r\npresented to the sadhaka, in order to make one progress!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the end=\r\n of the day, we have to remember that the goal of sadhana is\n&gt; not physical=\r\n and material well-being. It is to overcome ego and its various\n&gt; aspects, =\r\nincluding attachment to physical and material well-being. However,\n&gt; as we =\r\ndo sadhana using the physical body, which is sensitive to material\n&gt; condit=\r\nions around it, some level of physical and material well-being is\n&gt; necessa=\r\nry for smooth sadhana and progress. However, at some stage or the\n&gt; other, =\r\none needs to overcome those attachments. Depending on one&#39;s readiness\n&gt; and=\r\n the conditioning one has, one may traverse a different path.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As an=\r\n example, I will take the person whose first Kundalini awakening\n&gt; experien=\r\nce was described in:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mes=\r\nsage/1476\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He was being guided by a capable guru, who had actually t=\r\nold him ahead\n&gt; that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. Yet, in the=\r\n month or two\n&gt; after the experience, the person&#39;s health was bad. He was g=\r\netting fever\n&gt; frequently and feeling weak and weird. Now and then, he woul=\r\nd experience\n&gt; flow of electricity in the back, would lose awareness of the=\r\n body and see\n&gt; sights and beings or hear sounds, including mantras and bee=\r\njas, all\n&gt; internally. It would feel very nice. Suddenly, that experience w=\r\nould end and\n&gt; his normal body awareness would return. His attitude and int=\r\nernal reaction\n&gt; to what others said about him changed drastically. He coul=\r\nd see that he was\n&gt; making progress and was generally happy. But his physic=\r\nal health was quite\n&gt; unstable and he was uncomfortable when he was aware o=\r\nf the physical body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though he was worried a little in the beginnin=\r\ng about it, he later\n&gt; stopped bothering about physical health. He told him=\r\nself that this was just\n&gt; one layer of reality and not the most important o=\r\nne and not worth worrying\n&gt; much. His focus turned inwards.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After a=\r\n few months of instability, his health became fine again. His\n&gt; nervous sys=\r\ntem perhaps reached a new equilibrium. His lifestyle changed. He\n&gt; would ea=\r\nt much less food than before and yet feel energetic enough.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one =\r\nexperiences physical problems after taking up a sadhana, one has\n&gt; three op=\r\ntions: (1) stop the sadhana, (2) look for ways to improve the\n&gt; problem, (3=\r\n) try to overcome physical concerns and rise above the body.\n&gt; Differebt pe=\r\nrsons may approach differently, based on their readiness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n- Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Naras=\r\nimha garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure to have=\r\n your &gt;&gt;&gt;learned\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;company here.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you.

As I al=\r\nready wrote in an\n&gt; earlier post, &quot;there will be varied beliefs and opinion=\r\ns ranging from the\n&gt; very rigid traditional extreme to the very liberal and=\r\n casual new-age\n&gt; extreme based on one&#39;s personal affiliations, family and =\r\ncultural\n&gt; influences&quot;. Neither of us is at the liberal/casual extreme nor =\r\nthe very\n&gt; rigid traditional extreme. Both of us seem to be somewhere in th=\r\ne middle\n&gt; though at different points.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;If one reache=\r\ns samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;are fine. But, that =\r\nmay not &gt;&gt;happen. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini can take many\n&gt; different paths and go to d=\r\nifferent places. Depending on the &gt;&gt;&gt;impurities\n&gt; in various nadis, various=\r\n experiences are possible. If a sadhaka is\n&gt; unprepared to handle &gt;&gt;&gt;the ex=\r\nperience, it can create &gt;&gt;&gt;problems. One can\n&gt; experience something nice an=\r\nd become proud and &gt;&gt;&gt;egoistic and get stuck\n&gt; there. One can experience a =\r\nvery fierce form of divine and get scared to\n&gt; death &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or go mad. Many &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;possibilities are there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Excellent point. Here I wil=\r\nl share something from my own experience to\n&gt; illustrate this. Initially I =\r\nwas hesitant to write about it, but decided to\n&gt; go ahead as it might help =\r\nput things in a better perspective. During\n&gt; 1989-1992, I pursued sadhana s=\r\ningle-mindedly as a brahmachari, having given\n&gt; up other secular studies. T=\r\nhose days I used to live mostly in the company of\n&gt; brahmacharis and sanyas=\r\nis. Some of my co-sadhakas of those days went on to\n&gt; become fully ordained=\r\n monks later. Swadhyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional\n&gt; tirthayatras formed th=\r\ne mainstay of my sadhana at this time. Somewhere\n&gt; towards the second half =\r\nof this period I started doing Devi Mahatmya\n&gt; parayana on my own without a=\r\nny initiation. Things were fine and I made some\n&gt; progress probably owing t=\r\no a combination of many factors. After spending\n&gt; three years in spiritual =\r\nstudies and sadhana, I decided to return home and\n&gt; pursue medical studies =\r\nin accordance with my mother&#39;s wish. However I\n&gt; continued with my sadhana =\r\nwhilst pursuing my medical studies too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Around early 95, I star=\r\nted doing Devi Mahatmya parayana with *more*\n&gt; vigour. Within a month I sta=\r\nrted having piercing headaches, my body would be\n&gt; quite hot to touch and m=\r\ny blood pressure would shoot up to around 150/110 on\n&gt; and off. After condu=\r\ncting the standard investigations, Dr. Rao from the Dept\n&gt; of Medicine, who=\r\n had already taken a liking to me, suspected that it *might*\n&gt; have somethi=\r\nng to do with my sadhanas too. Things continued to be the same\n&gt; for some m=\r\nore months, till I got introduced to Swami Sachchidananda in what\n&gt; seemed =\r\nto be a chance meeting. During the course of conversation Swamiji\n&gt; asked m=\r\ne to meet him alone the next day after coming to know about my\n&gt; practice o=\r\nf the Devi mahatmya parayana. After interacting everyday for a\n&gt; week Swami=\r\nji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Chandi path. After a week or\n&gt; so aft=\r\ner the initiation all the symptoms subsided. The blood pressure, jwara\n&gt; an=\r\nd headaches, all normalized. It has been around 15 years since then and\n&gt; n=\r\none of the symptoms have recurred. What&#39;s more, I had some very powerful\n&gt; =\r\ninternal experiences in quick succession during the following week itself\n&gt;=\r\n after initiation. This is my experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(6) If one i=\r\ns not looking for any specific results and doing a\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;mantra just for spi=\r\nritual progress with a &gt;&gt;&gt;sense of surrender, one is\n&gt; safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Right from the start whatever sadhanas I did, were all done largely=\r\n as\n&gt; a spiritual pursuit only with no specific results in mind at least\n&gt; =\r\nconsciously. However the general desire to make progress would have\n&gt; natur=\r\nally been there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (5) Especially if one does not engag=\r\ne in raja yoga/hatha yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;practices that are meant to forcefully &gt;&gt;&gt;aw=\r\naken and raise Kundalini\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;and if one does not consciously think in term=\r\ns of &gt;&gt;&gt;raising Kundalini,\n&gt; one is &gt;&gt;&gt;safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though I=\r\n was not consciously thinking of raising Kundalni or anything\n&gt; like that a=\r\nnd was just focusing on sadhana, you are right about the raja\n&gt; yoga/hatha =\r\nyoga practices. Yogabhyasa was a regular part of my sadhana\n&gt; during 89-92.=\r\n In fact I became a qualified Yogacharya during this time.\n&gt; However Devi M=\r\nahatmya parayana was part of my sadhana along with yogabhyasa\n&gt; since early=\r\n 91-92 during which time things were fine. It was only in 94 that\n&gt; I resum=\r\ned Devi Mahatmya parayana more seriously. Of course I was doing my\n&gt; yogabh=\r\nyasa too at this time. I have already written about the rest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\ny stance regarding the role of initiation stems from my own experience\n&gt; as=\r\n well as the instructions coming down through the guru parampara. However\n&gt;=\r\n I can appreciate your stance as well. Let me add something more here. No t=\r\nwo\n&gt; individuals have the same experience in such matters. Some may experie=\r\nnce\n&gt; nothing significant after initiation and may still be progressing. So=\r\nme may\n&gt; need more guidance due to the nature of the specific practices tha=\r\nt they\n&gt; have got into. Eitherways She will take care.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given this statement, the difference of opinion between us are\n&gt; =\r\nvery subtle.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is better for all of us to focus more=\r\n on the underlying unity of our\n&gt; thought and not on the difference. Moreov=\r\ner overstretching such discussions\n&gt; can deter some sadhakas which is not s=\r\nomething that anyone of us would wish\n&gt; for.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One wor=\r\nd on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a\n&gt; sense of guil=\r\nt, it blocks the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practice from working &gt;&gt;&gt;effectively.\n&gt; Please do what=\r\never sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have\n&gt; the sense =\r\nof guilt, work on overcoming it. If &gt;&gt;&gt;you cannot overcome it, it\n&gt; may be =\r\na good &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea to find a &gt;&gt;&gt;sadhana with which you feel comfortable\n&gt; and =\r\nhave no sense of guilt.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree that there are many go=\r\nod sadhakas doing Sri Sri Chandipath\n&gt; without initiation. There is no need=\r\n for anyone to feel guilty. It is only\n&gt; good samskaras and vasanas that at=\r\ntract a sadhaka to Sri Sri Chandi. One\n&gt; does not need to feel guilty for w=\r\norshipping or loving the Goddess. If you\n&gt; take my own example, initially I=\r\n did the sadhana without initiation. It is\n&gt; only Her Grace that I was init=\r\niated. I didn&#39;t even ask for it. If it is\n&gt; meant to be it will be. Things =\r\nwill happen on their own accord in the\n&gt; natural flow. The main thing is th=\r\nat the sadhaka should leave the rest to\n&gt; the compassionate Goddess and tru=\r\nst that She will take care of everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On this note I sugges=\r\nt that we should wrap up the topic of initiation.\n&gt; From my side I wish to =\r\nsay nothing more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I might be off the list till another fortnigh=\r\nt or so as I am\n&gt; travelling.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All Glories to the Goddess!=\r\n!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to the =\r\nlist and it is a pleasure to have your learned company\n&gt; here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Traditional conventions are not without basis, but I suggest we need\n&gt; =\r\nto understand their motivation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When =\r\none chants long prayers such as Chandipath, Vishnu sahasra naama\n&gt; stotra, =\r\nAditya Hridayam etc, it requires a lot of conscious mental activity.\n&gt; One =\r\nmostly cannot go into samadhi while chanting them (though there can be\n&gt; ex=\r\nceptions).

With repetitive and minimal\n&gt; mental a=\r\nctivity, there is a possibility of momentary cessation of mental\n&gt; activity=\r\n and entering samadhi OR awakening of Kundalini and progress towards\n&gt; sama=\r\ndhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens=\r\n, things are\n&gt; fine. But, that may not happen. Kundalini can take many diff=\r\nerent paths and\n&gt; go to different places. Depending on the impurities in va=\r\nrious nadis,\n&gt; various experiences are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared=\r\n to handle the\n&gt; experience, it can create problems. One can experience som=\r\nething nice and\n&gt; become proud and egoistic and get stuck there.

At most=\r\n, some people will experience an awakening\n&gt; and just a little movement of =\r\nKundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) There are very few gurus who are indeed capable of a=\r\nssessing and\n&gt; guiding a sadhaka well. Most initiations are a mere formalit=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) With the insistence on initiation etc, we may be blocking, i=\r\nn the\n&gt; coming years, the very few sadhakas who MAY actually achieve some p=\r\nrogress\n&gt; with a mantra, from even trying it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) If a sadhaka surr=\r\nenders and has the attitude of &quot;I do not know\n&gt; the right way. I am just do=\r\ning what I am capable of. Please take care of me\n&gt; Mother&quot;, none of the ris=\r\nks I mentioned above will really apply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Especially if one does =\r\nnot engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga\n&gt; practices that are meant to forcefully=\r\n awaken and raise Kundalini and if one\n&gt; does not consciously think in term=\r\ns of raising Kundalini, one is safe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) If one is not looking for =\r\nany specific results and doing a mantra\n&gt; just for spiritual progress with =\r\na sense of surrender, one is safe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ap=\r\nart from assessing the readiness, there are some more functions\n&gt; performed=\r\n by an initiating guru:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) A guru can jumpstart one&#39;s sadh=\r\nana with a mantra and results can\n&gt; come faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, t=\r\nhis expects a guru of some caliber and achievement with the\n&gt; mantra. After=\r\n all, if one wants a one-on-one audience with Sachin Tendulkar\n&gt; or Roger F=\r\nederer or Barack Obama, being introduced to them by someone they\n&gt; know and=\r\n someone that had a one-on-one audience with them earlier can be\n&gt; helpful =\r\n(instead of introducing by oneself). If someone who merely read more\n&gt; abou=\r\nt them but is not any closer to them tries to introduce you to them,\n&gt; will=\r\n it even get their attention?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now-a-days, most people do no=\r\nt have access to gurus who have\n&gt; experienced the divine with a mantra. Suc=\r\nh people are very rare. One&#39;s best\n&gt; bet is to do sadhana by oneself, using=\r\n all the tools given by rishis and\n&gt; various spiritual masters. When one is=\r\n ready (and if it is needed), a guru\n&gt; may come and take one&#39;s sadhana to t=\r\nhe next level.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2) A guru can mould the correct attitude in=\r\n sadhaka before a sadhana\n&gt; is taken up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there are=\r\n sadhakas initiated in powerful mantras and not\n&gt; having the right attitude=\r\n. For example, I know people initiated into\n&gt; Bagalamukhi mantra and trying=\r\n to use it to win litigation. If one does not\n&gt; know that a &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (su=\r\npreme knowledge) is for overcoming conditioning\n&gt; and realizing self and no=\r\nt for winning court cases, one&#39;s initiation is no\n&gt; good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nn the other hand, I know some people not formally initiated into\n&gt; Chandipa=\r\nth, but doing Chandi homam daily with saptashati and also navarna\n&gt; mantra.=\r\n I know that they do not have any specific material goals and are\n&gt; overcom=\r\ning the few desires that were originally there at the back of the\n&gt; mind. T=\r\nhe are making quick progress spiritually and their thinking is\n&gt; getting tr=\r\nansformed nicely. Despite having no formal initiation, aren&#39;t they\n&gt; worshi=\r\npping Chandi as a Mahavidya?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that one can mou=\r\nld one&#39;s own attitude through a formal\n&gt; initiation or through reading scri=\r\nptures, satsanga and constant\n&gt; contemplation. One thing may work better in=\r\n one case and another thing in\n&gt; another case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) A guru c=\r\nan teach the correct procedure of a sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, role =\r\nof procedural correctness in success is a higher in\n&gt; sadhanas for specific=\r\n results than sadhana for spiritual progress. I\n&gt; maintain that the art of =\r\ngetting specific results from sadhanas is being\n&gt; hidden more and more as K=\r\nali progresses, for a reason. I suggest that it is\n&gt; useless to even think =\r\nin those terms and pursue it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantras like navarna mantra c=\r\nan just be meditated on, without any\n&gt; specific procedure. When one is read=\r\ny and pure enough, they can give one an\n&gt; experience of the divine. Mantras=\r\n like Siddha Kunjika stotra, that codify\n&gt; several specific sadhanas to get=\r\n specific results, are anyway inaccessible\n&gt; to most people of this age! Th=\r\ney are only available in codified form and\n&gt; gurus who can decode them will=\r\n keep disappearing more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nor those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without\n&gt; initiation, th=\r\nere is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no need to worry or be confused. ... Please keep doing wha=\r\ntever you\n&gt; are doing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given this statement, the difference=\r\n of opinion between us are very\n&gt; subtle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One word on guilt=\r\n here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a\n&gt; sense of guilt, it bloc=\r\nks the practice from working effectively. Please do\n&gt; whatever sadhana you =\r\ndo, without a sense of guilt. If you have the sense of\n&gt; guilt, work on ove=\r\nrcoming it. If you cannot overcome it, it may be a good\n&gt; idea to find a sa=\r\ndhana with which you feel comfortable and have no sense of\n&gt; guilt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leav=\r\ne\n&gt; the rest to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the compassionate Goddess.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s=\r\n the bottomline. Even if one were initiated, it would be quite\n&gt; difficult =\r\nto not leave things to the Goddess and make things happen as one\n&gt; wanted. =\r\nStart sadhana with some level of surrender. Then, sadhana will help\n&gt; incre=\r\nase the level of surrender.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj ga=\r\nru,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The opinion referred to in your question 2 is not witho=\r\nut basis. But\n&gt; again, we need to understand the motivation to put it in th=\r\ne right\n&gt; perspective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one experiences divine through sa=\r\ndhana with Gayatri mantra (or any\n&gt; mantra), then it is easy for one to exp=\r\nerience divine with another mantra.\n&gt; One can just pick up a mantra, do it =\r\nand experience relatively quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, if one was mere=\r\nly initiated in Gayatri mantra (or any\n&gt; mantra) and did not really make mu=\r\nch spiritual progress with it, that does\n&gt; not place one in any kind of adv=\r\nantage when it comes to sadhana with another\n&gt; mantra. That is my opinion.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Nagraj K=\r\nota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Dr. Satya Prakash,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I do see your points and do understand that Sankara peethams\n&gt; discourag=\r\ne the practise of mahavidyas without the Initiation. But here are a\n&gt; coupl=\r\ne of questions. Since you seem to be deeply knowledgeable, please\n&gt; clarify=\r\n these questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. In the devi mahaatmyam, mother is =\r\nsaying in sloka 11 of chapter\n&gt; 12, that she would be happy if one does thi=\r\ns with or without knowledge.\n&gt; Could you please comment on that. My underst=\r\nanding/interpretation could be\n&gt; wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. I heard from=\r\n one of the pundits that since Gayatri Mantra is\n&gt; considered the greatest =\r\nof all mantras, one who has initiation in Gayatri\n&gt; Mantra (which is given =\r\nas part of upanayanam) need not have any other\n&gt; initiation. You could give=\r\n your valuable opinion on the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroo=\r\nts@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially I ag=\r\nree with Narasimha garu in most matters in this\n&gt; discussion. The only majo=\r\nr point where I disagree is whether one can do Sri\n&gt; Sri Chandi path *witho=\r\nut initiation*. The rest of the confusion on\n&gt; translation of mantras needs=\r\n some clarification as there seems to be some\n&gt; unnecessary confusion. A fe=\r\nw pointers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. There are various sacred chants embedded=\r\n within the Vedas,\n&gt; Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chan=\r\nts can be categorised\n&gt; as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some s=\r\ntotras too are also\n&gt; treated as mahamantras and mantras. The Samhita porti=\r\non of the Vedas too is\n&gt; referred to as mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Und=\r\noubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the\n&gt; original. Reading =\r\na translation is not even comparable to chanting the\n&gt; original chant. So f=\r\nar it is fine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are=\r\n all based on Sabda/Vak,\n&gt; tradition makes a distinction between them.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initi=\r\nated to\n&gt; chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most man=\r\ntras.\n&gt; Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidy=\r\nas etc\n&gt; need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Ve=\r\nda Samhita\n&gt; are not the same as these other mantras that need initiation, =\r\nwhich are\n&gt; generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you c=\r\nall these\n&gt; mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral part=\r\ns of larger\n&gt; and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as =\r\nin the case of\n&gt; Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Vis=\r\nhnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not\n&gt; need initiatio=\r\nn as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama\n&gt; and Devi Mah=\r\natmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts\n&gt; of puranas=\r\n. They have a larger status as integral parts of a Mahavidya\n&gt; sadhana. Cha=\r\nnting them without initiation is not recommended especially when\n&gt; the read=\r\ner combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integral part\n&gt; of th=\r\ne chanting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. I know from personal interaction that ac=\r\nharyas belonging to both\n&gt; Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend =\r\ninitiation for both the\n&gt; sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along wi=\r\nth their respective\n&gt; NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treate=\r\nd as an INTEGRAL LIMB\n&gt; (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these tradi=\r\ntions hold that one needs\n&gt; to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as=\r\n shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Recapping my earlier stance=\r\n, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that\n&gt; has an independent status by itself=\r\n as part of a Mahavidya. It is\n&gt; simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra a=\r\ns well as an Advaitic text in the\n&gt; spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahav=\r\nidya the Navakshari is an integral\n&gt; part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus t=\r\nradition holds that one needs to be\n&gt; initiated to chant it. However if one=\r\n wishes to benefit from the\n&gt; Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the De=\r\nvi Mahatmyam, , reading the\n&gt; sacred myth in the vernacular has been recomm=\r\nended in my write-up, as\n&gt; chanting the original along with the navakshari =\r\namounts to practicing the\n&gt; sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is reco=\r\nmmended to be initiated and\n&gt; go through the specialised sadhanas properly =\r\nunder guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. Arguably if an uninitiated person re=\r\nads the Devi Mahatmyam in\n&gt; the original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik*=\r\n approach and not as a\n&gt; Mahavidya, it has an inherent problem in our times=\r\n. The problem with\n&gt; attempting to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from tex=\r\nts alone (without\n&gt; initiation) is that most readers inadvertently end up a=\r\nlso chanting the\n&gt; Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stot=\r\nram which too\n&gt; contain the bijaksharas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. I you caref=\r\nully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget\n&gt; translating, nowher=\r\ne do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing.\n&gt; Neither have I attemp=\r\nted to write a commentary on it. Translations of\n&gt; mantras do not have the =\r\npower of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak.\n&gt; However it is recommended t=\r\no know the essence or import (artha) of the\n&gt; mantra and its sadhana while =\r\nchanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the\n&gt; essence of `Vak&#39;, not a tr=\r\nanslation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10. For those who are already doing Sri Sri =\r\nChandi path without\n&gt; initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused.=\r\n There has to be a\n&gt; certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri C=\r\nhandi path itself. We\n&gt; all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (in=\r\nitiation or no\n&gt; initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Jus=\r\nt be cautious not\n&gt; to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly poi=\r\nnted out it is better\n&gt; to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favou=\r\nrs or results. That\n&gt; attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential pr=\r\noblem. Things will\n&gt; happen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave =\r\nthe rest to the\n&gt; compassionate Goddess.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope the above=\r\n pointers help in clearing any confusion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; h ramaling=\r\nam &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Maha\n&gt; Sannida=\r\nnam Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Sw=\r\namigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One\n&gt; day all the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned persons male and female alike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requested Swamig=\r\nal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in\n&gt; kannada language\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\no that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swamigal didn&#39;=\r\nt reply to this request which was made early in the\n&gt; morning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nLater in the day after the days pooja etc were over as usual\n&gt; Postman came=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal.

One can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensel=\r\ny. If one is not experiencing anything,\n&gt; it is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likely b=\r\necause one does not have the correct attitude and\n&gt; surrender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific meaning of\n&gt; Ganapathi=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham.

Some important\n&gt; =\r\nlayers are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of =\r\nmeaning are\n&gt; never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only exper=\r\nienced internally.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning=\r\n or not, chant the mantra with a\n&gt; calm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relaxed mind and =\r\nwith devotion and surrender. Many people keep\n&gt; a target\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coun=\r\nt and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of\n&gt; duty. If it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the\n&gt; =\r\ndeity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra =\r\nis calmness of the\n&gt; mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands=\r\n of thoughts and chanting of the\n&gt; mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of thos=\r\ne thousand activities, nothing will happen. If most\n&gt; thoughts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; subside and mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra,\n&gt; that is wh=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ther=\r\ne are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical\n&gt; vibration is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the\n&gt; t=\r\nhoughts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind=\r\n etc. Some\n&gt; mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishi=\r\ns/yogis (essentially beings with\n&gt; very stable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds=\r\n) are designed such that the physical vibration\n&gt; of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; can eventually cause the corresponding imagery in the mind by\n&gt; resonanc=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when other mental activity subsides. Thus, after repeating=\r\n the\n&gt; mantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you can recreate a c=\r\nertain imagery and\n&gt; thought system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your mind. That can pe=\r\nrmanently alter the way your mind\n&gt; workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key is to =\r\nattain a reasonably stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of BhagavadGita and\n&gt; Sant\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power of their own, as\n&gt; t=\r\nhey were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized souls.

When I floated the idea, Manish\n&gt; discouraged me.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could\n&gt;=\r\n be considered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for=\r\n then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that the goal of sadhana=\r\n, such as homam,\n&gt; meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras and prayers, =\r\nis NOT just an intellectual understanding\n&gt; of what they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean=\r\n. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its\n&gt; energy. They are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas,\n&gt;=\r\n who used them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nn intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right\n&gt; mood, right\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra=\r\n\n&gt; that was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds po=\r\nwer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one=\r\n cannot intellectually\n&gt; understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be more effective for=\r\n spiritual progress, than the words of\n&gt; a normal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person that=\r\n one can intellectually understand and appreciate.\n&gt; So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading\n&gt; Sansk=\r\nrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to =\r\ngive an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a\n&gt; batsman may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nread a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to\n&gt; see the bal=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into=\r\n the\n&gt; line of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a straight bat, =\r\nwhen to play front\n&gt; foot and when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. But=\r\n that does not necessarily make one a\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; batsman. If one =\r\npractices, THAT can make one a good player. Of\n&gt; course, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that,\n&gt; practice i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in\n&gt; spir=\r\nituality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, al=\r\nl sadhanas, all\n&gt; paths is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should =\r\novercome the notions that we\n&gt; are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things and realize t=\r\nhat the divine acts through all of us. The\n&gt; divine acts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thro=\r\nugh each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives\n&gt; corresponding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the\n&gt; not=\r\nions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I disl=\r\nike that&quot;\n&gt; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures=\r\n and one knows it, one may be\n&gt; deluded again\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and again. Ther=\r\ne is no magic formula to internalize this\n&gt; understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one does no=\r\nt\n&gt; intellectually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand, that is ok. As long as the bas=\r\nic essence of\n&gt; scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one =\r\nis constantly contemplating and\n&gt; watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own tho=\r\nughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts,\n&gt; one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. =\r\nIt is fine\n&gt; to read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is fine t=\r\no meet spiritual people\n&gt; (physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here=\r\n) and discuss good things. But that will\n&gt; only create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a theo=\r\nretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to\n&gt; govern all of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretic=\r\nal understanding\n&gt; of what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like =\r\na blind person running around a\n&gt; mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of climbi=\r\nng it. One not doing sadhana, but having an\n&gt; excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theor=\r\netical understanfing, is like a person who knows that he\n&gt; needs to climb\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of\n&gt; c=\r\nlimbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is important in\n&gt; tantric pa=\r\nth but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* p=\r\naths or\n&gt; parts of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot =\r\nof inaccurate notions\n&gt; today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is=\r\n not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s\n&gt; attitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results\n&gt; needs to b=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of kar=\r\nmas\n&gt; to affect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires =\r\nsupervision of a\n&gt; good guru and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On=\r\n the other hand, if one is NOT\n&gt; looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific materia=\r\nl results and is looking for spiritual\n&gt; progress, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constr=\r\naints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some may =\r\nsub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is\n&gt; for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for\n&gt; self-realization. T=\r\nhat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant =\r\nManyu\n&gt; sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam =\r\nfor longevity, and so\n&gt; on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik pat=\r\nh may eat a gross substance in\n&gt; an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinf=\r\norce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to\n&gt; remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; men=\r\ntal repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looking for=\r\n a specific\n&gt; material result,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and su=\r\npervision, which not many are\n&gt; capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving today! Inst=\r\nead, if you want spiritual progress and an\n&gt; increase of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your=\r\n surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without\n&gt; initiation or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-minded\n&gt; pe=\r\nople.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to Calcu=\r\ntta, you need clear and\n&gt; precise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directions and some supervi=\r\nsion. If you just want to go to\n&gt; north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can keep wa=\r\nlking towards north. Of course, having supervision\n&gt; helps there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; too, but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016367fb737693b5a0494c6a7fb\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nGreetings to One and All on the Vedic Wisdom group, I am authoring my first=\r\n post here so I trust if it is a question covered in=A0 the past, my oversi=\r\nght will forgiven and someone can direct me to the necessary thread. My que=\r\nry regards the homam tradition, and whether the homa fire itself can be use=\r\nd for mundane purposes after the ritual has been brought to completion. I u=\r\nnderstood from the Aghori boks that there are several taboos concerning ANY=\r\n fire(never to blow it out, turns one feet towards it etc), and presume the=\r\nse also apply to the homam fire after the ritual is completed, but otherwis=\r\ne, are there other prohibitions one must observe concerning the post-homam =\r\nfire and it uses, could one for instances, warm their hands by it, use it t=\r\no light a candle etc. Any input on this would be appreciated. &lt;br&gt;\n-Aaron K=\r\n =A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Thu, Nov 11, 2010 at 9:43 AM, Aj=\r\naya B &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:laughing29@...&quot;&gt;laughin=\r\ng29@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204)=\r\n; padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(25=\r\n5, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n=\r\n      &lt;p&gt;Namaste....&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI believe that making offerings after every s=\r\nhloka reduces some of the likelihood of physical symptoms becoming a proble=\r\nm.

In some cases, some physic=\r\nal/material obstacles may have to be presented to the sadhaka, in order to =\r\nmake one progress!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; At the end of the day, we have to r=\r\nemember that the goal of sadhana is not physical and material well-being. I=\r\nt is to overcome ego and its various aspects, including attachment to physi=\r\ncal and material well-being. However, as we do sadhana using the physical b=\r\nody, which is sensitive to material conditions around it, some level of phy=\r\nsical and material well-being is necessary for smooth sadhana and progress.=\r\n However, at some stage or the other, one needs to overcome those attachmen=\r\nts. Depending on one&#39;s readiness and the conditioning one has, one may =\r\ntraverse a different path.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As an example, I will take =\r\nthe person whose first Kundalini awakening experience was described in:&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mess=\r\nage/1476&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mess=\r\nage/1476&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He was being guided by a capable guru, who=\r\n had actually told him ahead that his time for Kundalini awakening had come=\r\n. Yet, in the month or two after the experience, the person&#39;s health wa=\r\ns bad. He was getting fever frequently and feeling weak and weird. Now and =\r\nthen, he would experience flow of electricity in the back, would lose aware=\r\nness of the body and see sights and beings or hear sounds, including mantra=\r\ns and beejas, all internally. It would feel very nice. Suddenly, that exper=\r\nience would end and his normal body awareness would return. His attitude an=\r\nd internal reaction to what others said about him changed drastically. He c=\r\nould see that he was making progress and was generally happy. But his physi=\r\ncal health was quite unstable and he was uncomfortable when he was aware of=\r\n the physical body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Though he was worried a little in =\r\nthe beginning about it, he later stopped bothering about physical health. H=\r\ne told himself that this was just one layer of reality and not the most imp=\r\nortant one and not worth worrying much. His focus turned inwards.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; After a few months of instability, his health became fine again=\r\n. His nervous system perhaps reached a new equilibrium. His lifestyle chang=\r\ned. He would eat much less food than before and yet feel energetic enough.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If one experiences physical problems after taking up a=\r\n sadhana, one has three options: (1) stop the sadhana, (2) look for ways to=\r\n improve the problem, (3) try to overcome physical concerns and rise above =\r\nthe body. Differebt persons may approach differently, based on their readin=\r\ness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     =\r\n              &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      Films that make a differen=\r\nce: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ---- Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@...&g=\r\nt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha garu,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure =\r\nto have your &gt;&gt;&gt;learned &gt;&gt;&gt;company here.&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you. It is a nice group as I already noted i=\r\nn my first post.  Most importantly it is always a joy to interact with you.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;       &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Traditi=\r\nonal &gt;&gt;&gt;conventions are not without basis, but I suggest &gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;we need to understand their &gt;&gt;&gt;motivation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Both of us share a similar approach here. As I already wrote i=\r\nn an earlier post, &quot;there will be varied beliefs and opinions ranging =\r\nfrom the very rigid traditional extreme to the very liberal and casual new-=\r\nage extreme based on one&#39;s personal affiliations, family and cultural i=\r\nnfluences&quot;.   Neither of us is at the liberal/casual extreme nor the v=\r\nery rigid traditional extreme. Both of us seem to be somewhere in the middl=\r\ne though at different points.   &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;If one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awaken=\r\ns, things &gt;&gt;&gt;are fine. But, that may not &gt;&gt;happen. &gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;Kundalini can take many different paths and go to different places. =\r\nDepending on the &gt;&gt;&gt;impurities in various nadis, various experienc=\r\nes are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to handle &gt;&gt;&gt;the exper=\r\nience, it can create &gt;&gt;&gt;problems. One can experience something nic=\r\ne and become proud and &gt;&gt;&gt;egoistic and get stuck there. One can ex=\r\nperience a very fierce form of divine and get scared to death &gt;&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;or go mad. Many &gt;&gt;&gt;possibilities are there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Excellent point. Here I will shar=\r\ne something from my own experience to illustrate this. Initially I was hesi=\r\ntant to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it might help put things=\r\n in a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sadhana single-minded=\r\nly as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studies. Those days I us=\r\ned to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and sanyasis. Some of my c=\r\no-sadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordained monks later. Swad=\r\nhyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the mainstay of my sad=\r\nhana at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of this period I start=\r\ned doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any initiation. Things we=\r\nre fine and I made some progress probably owing to a combination of many fa=\r\nctors. After spending three years in spiritual studies and sadhana, I decid=\r\ned to return home and pursue medical studies in accordance with my mother&#=\r\n39;s wish. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursuing my medical s=\r\ntudies too.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Around early 95, I started doing =\r\nDevi Mahatmya parayana with *more* vigour. Within a month I started having =\r\npiercing headaches, my body would be quite hot to touch and my blood pressu=\r\nre would shoot up to around 150/110 on and off. After conducting the standa=\r\nrd investigations, Dr. Rao from the Dept of Medicine, who had already taken=\r\n a liking to me, suspected that it *might* have something to do with my sad=\r\nhanas too. Things continued to be the same for some more months, till I got=\r\n introduced to Swami Sachchidananda in what seemed to be a chance meeting. =\r\nDuring the course of conversation Swamiji asked me to meet him alone the ne=\r\nxt day after coming to know about my practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana=\r\n. After interacting everyday for a week Swamiji initiated me properly into =\r\nSri Sri Chandi path.  After a week or so after the initiation all the sympt=\r\noms subsided. The blood pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized. It h=\r\nas been around 15 years since then and none of the symptoms have recurred. =\r\nWhat&#39;s more, I had some very powerful internal experiences in quick suc=\r\ncession during the following week itself after initiation. This is my exper=\r\nience.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;                                  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(6) If one is not looking for any specific results an=\r\nd doing a &gt;&gt;&gt;mantra just for spiritual progress with a &gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;sense of surrender, one is safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Right from the start whatever sadhanas I did, were all d=\r\none largely as a spiritual pursuit only with no specific results in mind at=\r\n least consciously. However the general desire to make progress would have =\r\nnaturally been there.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; (5) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;practices that are meant to forcefully &gt;&gt;&gt;awaken and raise Kun=\r\ndalini &gt;&gt;&gt;and if one does not consciously think in terms of &gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;raising Kundalini, one is &gt;&gt;&gt;safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though I was not consciously thinking o=\r\nf raising Kundalni or anything like that and was just focusing on sadhana, =\r\nyou are right about the raja yoga/hatha yoga practices. Yogabhyasa was a re=\r\ngular part of my sadhana during 89-92. In fact I became a qualified Yogacha=\r\nrya during this time. However Devi Mahatmya parayana was part of my sadhana=\r\n along with yogabhyasa since early 91-92 during which time things were fine=\r\n. It was only in 94 that I resumed Devi Mahatmya parayana more seriously. O=\r\nf course I was doing my yogabhyasa too at this time. I have already written=\r\n about the rest.  &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; My stance regarding the ro=\r\nle of initiation stems from my own experience as well as the instructions c=\r\noming down through the guru parampara. However I can appreciate your stance=\r\n as well. Let me add something more here. No two individuals have the same =\r\nexperience in such matters. Some may experience nothing significant after i=\r\nnitiation and may still be progressing. Some may need more guidance due to =\r\nthe nature of the specific practices that they have got into. Eitherways Sh=\r\ne will take care.  &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given this statement, the difference of opinion b=\r\netween us are very subtle.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is better for all of us to focus more on the underlying unit=\r\ny of our thought and not on the difference. Moreover overstretching such di=\r\nscussions can deter some sadhakas which is not something that anyone of us =\r\nwould wish for.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a sen=\r\nse of guilt, it blocks the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practice from working &gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;effectively. Please do whatever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt.=\r\n If &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have the sense of guilt, work on overcoming it. If =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;you cannot overcome it, it may be a good &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea t=\r\no find a &gt;&gt;&gt;sadhana with which you feel comfortable and have no se=\r\nnse of guilt.&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ag=\r\nree that there are many good sadhakas doing Sri Sri Chandipath without init=\r\niation. There is no need for anyone to feel guilty. It is only good samskar=\r\nas and vasanas that attract a sadhaka to Sri Sri Chandi. One does not need =\r\nto feel guilty for worshipping or loving the Goddess.  If you take my own e=\r\nxample, initially I did the sadhana without initiation. It is only Her Grac=\r\ne that I was initiated. I didn&#39;t even ask for it. If it is meant to be =\r\nit will be. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. The=\r\n main thing is that the sadhaka should leave the rest to the compassionate =\r\nGoddess and trust that She will take care of everything.                   =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On this note I suggest that we should wrap u=\r\np the topic of initiation. From my side I wish to say nothing more. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I might be off the list till another fortnight or so=\r\n as I am travelling.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; All Gl=\r\nories to the Goddess!!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Satya Prakash   &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash garu,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure to have your learn=\r\ned company here.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Traditional conven=\r\ntions are not without basis, but I suggest we need to understand their moti=\r\nvation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one chants long prayers such as Chand=\r\nipath, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra, Aditya Hridayam etc, it requires a lot =\r\nof conscious mental activity. One mostly cannot go into samadhi while chant=\r\ning them (though there can be exceptions). On the other hand, when one chan=\r\nts Gayatri mantra or ashtakshari mantra or dwadasakshari mantra or panchaks=\r\nhari mantra or navarna mantra or various beeja mantras or other small mantr=\r\nas, it requires a minimal amount of conscious mental activity. With repetit=\r\nive and minimal mental activity, there is a possibility of momentary cessat=\r\nion of mental activity and entering samadhi OR awakening of Kundalini and p=\r\nrogress towards samadhi.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one re=\r\naches samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things are fine. But, that m=\r\nay not happen. Kundalini can take many different paths and go to different =\r\nplaces. Depending on the impurities in various nadis, various experiences a=\r\nre possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to handle the experience, it can cr=\r\neate problems. One can experience something nice and become proud and egois=\r\ntic and get stuck there. One can experience a very fierce form of divine an=\r\nd get scared to death or go mad. Many possibilities are there.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, practices that can truly awaken one were=\r\n kept limited to the initiated. Guru would assess the progress and readines=\r\ns of a sadhaka and initiate one when one is ready.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n However, there are a few things that are different in today&#39;s times:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) There are very few people who ar=\r\ne ready to experience something. Most people will just do sadhana, burn som=\r\ne basic blocking karmas and not really experience much. At most, some peopl=\r\ne will experience an awakening and just a little movement of Kundalini.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) There are very few gurus who are indeed capable of ass=\r\nessing and guiding a sadhaka well. Most initiations are a mere formality.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) With the insistence on initiation etc, we may be bloc=\r\nking, in the coming years, the very few sadhakas who MAY actually achieve s=\r\nome progress with a mantra, from even trying it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) If =\r\na sadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of &quot;I do not know the right =\r\nway. I am just doing what I am capable of. Please take care of me Mother&qu=\r\not;, none of the risks I mentioned above will really apply.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (5) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga practice=\r\ns that are meant to forcefully awaken and raise Kundalini and if one does n=\r\not consciously think in terms of raising Kundalini, one is safe.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (6) If one is not looking for any specific results and doing a ma=\r\nntra just for spiritual progress with a sense of surrender, one is safe.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Apart from assessing the readiness, there are some m=\r\nore functions performed by an initiating guru:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; (1) A guru can jumpstart one&#39;s sadhana with a mantra and re=\r\nsults can come faster.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, thi=\r\ns expects a guru of some caliber and achievement with the mantra. After all=\r\n, if one wants a one-on-one audience with Sachin Tendulkar or Roger Federer=\r\n or Barack Obama, being introduced to them by someone they know and someone=\r\n that had a one-on-one audience with them earlier can be helpful (instead o=\r\nf introducing by oneself). If someone who merely read more about them but i=\r\ns not any closer to them tries to introduce you to them, will it even get t=\r\nheir attention?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now-a-days, most p=\r\neople do not have access to gurus who have experienced the divine with a ma=\r\nntra. Such people are very rare. One&#39;s best bet is to do sadhana by one=\r\nself, using all the tools given by rishis and various spiritual masters. Wh=\r\nen one is ready (and if it is needed), a guru may come and take one&#39;s s=\r\nadhana to the next level.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) A gu=\r\nru can mould the correct attitude in sadhaka before a sadhana is taken up.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there are sadhakas initiat=\r\ned in powerful mantras and not having the right attitude. For example, I kn=\r\now people initiated into Bagalamukhi mantra and trying to use it to win lit=\r\nigation. If one does not know that a &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (supreme knowled=\r\nge) is for overcoming conditioning and realizing self and not for winning c=\r\nourt cases, one&#39;s initiation is no good.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; On the other hand, I know some people not formally initiated int=\r\no Chandipath, but doing Chandi homam daily with saptashati and also navarna=\r\n mantra.
