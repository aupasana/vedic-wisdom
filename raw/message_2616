May be it is useful. I haven&#39;t read a lot of JK or even Osho (li=\r\nttle bits and pieces on the web or an occassional article or so). So I cann=\r\not vouch for the truth level of this. You can make your own judgements.\n\n&lt;B=\r\negin Quote&gt;\n\nQuestion: Osho, Can An enlightened person be wrong? This refer=\r\ns to what you told us about J. Krishnamurti, who keeps on saying that one d=\r\noes not Need a Master, which is actually not right please comment.\n\nOsho: P=\r\nrem Pantha, An Enlightened person can never be wrong. Neither J. Krishnamur=\r\nti is wrong, but he never considers the situation in which you are. He cons=\r\niders only the space in which he is, and that freedom is part of enlightenm=\r\nent. The enlightened person has reached the highest peak of consciousness; =\r\nhis abode is on Everest.\n\nNow it is his freedom to speak according to the p=\r\neak, the sunlit peak where he is, or to consider the people who are still i=\r\nn the dark valley, who know nothing about the light, for whom the peak of t=\r\nhe Everest is only a dream, only a perhaps&quot;. This is the freedom of the enl=\r\nightened person. Krishnamurti speaks in terms where he is.\n\nI speak in term=\r\ns where you are, I consider you, because if I am speaking to you, you have =\r\nto be taken in consideration. I have to lead you towards the highest peak, =\r\nbut the journey will begin in the dark valley, in your unconsciousness. If =\r\nI talk about my experience, absolutely inconsiderate of you, I am right, bu=\r\nt I am not useful to you.\n\nAn enlightened person is never wrong, but he can=\r\n be useful or he can be useless. J. Krishnamurti is useless! He is perfectl=\r\ny right; about that there is no question, because I know the peak and what =\r\nhe is saying is certainly true -- from the vision of the peak. Those who ha=\r\nve arrived, for them the journey becomes almost a dream phenomenon. For tho=\r\nse who have not arrived the journey is real, the goal is just a dream. They=\r\n are living in two different worlds. When you are talking to a madman you h=\r\nave to consider him; if you don&#39;t consider him you cannot help him.\n\nOnce a=\r\n madman was brought to me. He had this crazy idea that one afternoon when h=\r\ne was sleeping, a fly has entered his mouth. And because he used to sleep w=\r\nith open mouth, nobody can deny the possibility. And since then he was very=\r\n much disturbed because the fly was roaming inside him, jumping inside him,=\r\n moving in his belly, going to his bladder, circulating in his bloodstream,=\r\n sometimes in his head, sometimes in his feet. And of course he could not d=\r\no anything because he was continuously occupied, obsessed with the fly.\n\nHe=\r\n was taken to the psychoanalysts and they said, &quot;This is just in your mind =\r\n-- there is no fly! And no fly can move in your bloodstream, there is no po=\r\nssibility. Even if a fly has entered it must have died! And now six months =\r\nhave passed; it cannot be alive inside you.&quot;\n\nHe listened, but he could not=\r\n believe it because his experience was far more solid. He was taken to the =\r\ndoctors and everybody examined him and they did everything, but finally the=\r\ny will say, &quot;It is just a mental thing. You are imagining.&quot; He will listen =\r\nwhat they were saying, but he could not trust because his experience was fa=\r\nr more certain than their words.\n\nHis family brought him to me as a last re=\r\nsort. The man was looking very tired because he was being taken to one pers=\r\non, then to another, then all kinds of physicians -- allopaths and homeopat=\r\nhs and naturopaths -- and he was really tired. In the first place the fly w=\r\nas tiring him, and now all these &quot;pathies&quot;, medicines. And everybody was in=\r\nsulting him -- that was his feeling, that they were saying that he was just=\r\n imagining. Is he a fool or he is mad, that he will imagine such a thing? T=\r\nhey were all humiliating him -- that was his feeling.\n\nI looked at the man =\r\nand I said, &quot;It is so clear that the fly is inside!&quot;\nFor a moment he was pu=\r\nzzled. He could not believe me, because nobody has said that to him -- beca=\r\nuse nobody has considered him. And they ALL were right and I was wrong -- t=\r\nhere was no fly, but the madman has to be considered.\n\nAnd I said, &quot;All tho=\r\nse fools are just wasting your time; you should have come first here. It is=\r\n such a simple thing to bring the fly out; there is no need to bother. Medi=\r\ncines won&#39;t help -- you are not ill. Psycholanalysis will not help -- you a=\r\nre not crazy.&quot;\n\nAnd immediately he was a changed man! He looked at his wife=\r\n and said, &quot;Now what do you say? This is the right man,&quot; he said, &quot;who real=\r\nly knows. And all those fools were trying to convince me that there is no f=\r\nly. It is there!&quot;\nI said to him that, &quot;It is simple -- we will take it out.=\r\n You lie down.&quot;\n\nI covered him with a blanket and told him to keep his eyes=\r\n closed and &quot;I will do some mantra, some magic, and we will bring the fly o=\r\nut. You just keep quiet so that the fly sits somewhere. Otherwise the fly i=\r\ns continuously running -- where to catch it?&quot;\n\nHe said, &quot;That looks logical=\r\n. I will keep absolutely still!&quot;\nAnd I said, &quot;Don&#39;t open your eyes. Just re=\r\nmain silent, breathe slowly, so the fly settles somewhere, so we can catch =\r\nhold of it!&quot;\n\nThen I rushed into the house to find a fly. It was a little b=\r\nit difficult because for the first time I was trying that, but finally I su=\r\ncceeded -- I could get a fly in a bottle. And I came to the man, I moved my=\r\n hand on his body, and I asked him, &quot;Where the fly is?&quot; And he said, &quot;In th=\r\ne belly.&quot; And I touched the belly and I said, &quot;Of course it is there!&quot; And =\r\nI convinced him that I perfectly believe in him and then I uncovered his bl=\r\nanket and showed him the fly.\n\nAnd he said to the wife, &quot;Now see! And give =\r\nthis bottle to me; I will go all to those fools and take all the fees that =\r\nthey have taken from me! I have wasted thousands of rupees, and all that th=\r\ney did was they told me I am mad! And now I don&#39;t feel the fly anywhere, be=\r\ncause it is in the bottle!&quot;\n\nHe took the bottle, he went to the doctors.\nOn=\r\ne of the doctors who knew me, he came to see me. He said, &quot;How you managed?=\r\n Six months a fly can live in the body? And that man has taken his fee back=\r\n from me, because he was making such a fuss that I said, &#39;Better give it ba=\r\nck to him!&#39; And he proved that he was right!&quot;\nI said, &quot;It is not the point =\r\nwho is right.&quot;\n\nGautam the Buddha defines truth as &quot;that which works&quot;. This=\r\n is the ancient most pragmatic definition of truth: &quot;that which works&quot;! All=\r\n the devices are truth in this sense: they work; they are only devices. The=\r\n Buddha&#39;s work is Upaya; Upaya exactly means device.\n\nMeditation is an Upay=\r\na, a device. It simply helps you to get rid of that which you have not got =\r\nin the first place -- the fly: the ego, the misery, the anguish! It helps y=\r\nou to get free of it, but in fact it is not there. But it is not to be told=\r\n...\n\nAnd Krishnamurti has been doing that: he has been telling crazy people=\r\n that the fly does not exist and you don&#39;t need any doctor. I say to you: t=\r\nhe fly exists and you need the doctor! Because just by telling to you that =\r\nthe fly does not exist is not going to help you at all.\n\nFor thousands of y=\r\nears you have been told the ego does not exist. Has it helped you in any wa=\r\ny? There have been people who have told, in this country particularly, that=\r\n the whole world is illusory, MAYA, it does not exist, but has it helped In=\r\ndia in any way? The true test is there: whether it has helped, whether it h=\r\nas made people more authentic, more real. It has not helped at all. It has =\r\nmade people more deeply cunning, split, schizophrenic; it has made them hyp=\r\nocrites.\n\nAll the religions have done this, because they don&#39;t consider you=\r\n. And you are far more important than the ultimate truth, because the ultim=\r\nate truth has nothing to do with y ou right now. You are living in a dreamw=\r\norld; some device is needed which can help you to come out of it. The momen=\r\nt you are out of it, you will know it was a dream -- but a person who is dr=\r\neaming, to tell him that it is all dream is meaningless.\n\nHave you not obse=\r\nrved in your dreams that when you are dreaming it looks real? And every mor=\r\nning you have found that it was unreal. hut again in the night you forget a=\r\nll your understanding of the day -- again the dream becomes real. It has be=\r\nen happening again and again: every night the dream becomes real, every mor=\r\nning you know it is false, but that knowing does not help. In the dream one=\r\n can even dream that this is a dream.\n\nAnd that&#39;s what has happened in Indi=\r\na: people are living in maya, deeply in it, and still talking that &quot;This is=\r\n all maya.&quot; And this talk too is part of their dream; it does not destroy t=\r\nhe dream. In fact it makes the dream more rooted in them, because now there=\r\n is no need to get rid of it -- because it is a dream! So why get rid of it=\r\n? It does not matter.\n\nIn a subtle way all the religions have done this: th=\r\ney have talked from the highest peak to the people for whom that peak does =\r\nnot exist yet. The people are living in darkness, and you go on telling the=\r\nm that darkness has no existence. It is true -- darkness has no existence, =\r\nit is only the absence of light -- but just by saying to people that darkne=\r\nss has no existence is not going to bring light in.\n\nThat&#39;s what Krishnamur=\r\nti is doing; it has been done by many people. Nagarjuna did it -- Krishnamu=\r\nrti is not new, not at least in the East. Nagarjuna did it: he said, &quot;Every=\r\nthing is false. The world is false, the ego is false, nothing exists. Becau=\r\nse nothing exists you are already free. There is no need for any meditation=\r\n, there is no need for any Master. There is no need to find out any device,=\r\n strategy, technique, because in the first place there is no problem. Why g=\r\no on looking for solutions? Those solutions will create more problems; they=\r\n are not going to help.&quot;\n\nNagarjuna did it; before Nagarjuna, Mahakashyap d=\r\nid it, and it has been a long tradition. Zen people have been saying the sa=\r\nme thing for centuries. Krishnamurti never uses the word &quot;Zen&quot;, but whatsoe=\r\nver he is talking is nothing but Zen -- simple Zen.\n\nZen says no effort is =\r\nneeded, nothing has to be done. When nothing has to be done, what is the ne=\r\ned of a Master? -- because the Master will tell you to do something. Nothin=\r\ng has to be done -- what is the need of the scriptures? -- because the scri=\r\nptures will tell you to do something, to know something. Nothing has to be =\r\ndone, nothing has to be known. You are already there where you are trying t=\r\no reach.\n\nAnd I know this is true, but to talk about this ultimate truth to=\r\n people who are living in tremendous darkness is futile . Prem Pantha, no e=\r\nnlightened person can ever be wrong, but only few enlightened persons have =\r\nbeen of help. The majority of enlightened people have been of no help at al=\r\nl, for the simple reason because they never considered the other.\n\nIn fact,=\r\n George Gurdjieff used to say, &quot;Don&#39;t consider the other.&quot; It was one of hi=\r\ns basic teachings: &quot;Don&#39;t consider the other. Just say what is absolutely t=\r\nrue.&quot; But the absolute truth is truth only when experienced; people are liv=\r\ning in relative truth.\n\nMy approach is different from Krishnamurti&#39;s. I kno=\r\nw that one day you will come to that point where nothing is needed -- no Ma=\r\nster, no teaching, no scripture -- but right now the scripture can be of he=\r\nlp, the methods can be of help, and certainly a living Master can be of imm=\r\nense help. The function of the Master is to give you that which you already=\r\n have and to take away that which you don&#39;t have at all.\n\n&lt;End Quote&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
