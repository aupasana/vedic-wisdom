It wasn&#39;t a rigi=\r\nd system, but a flexible and\n&gt; mobile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system based on aptitude rather=\r\n than birth. Of course, because a child\n&gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; get exposed to what fat=\r\nher does and may have a good chance of\n&gt; developing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aptitude for such=\r\n work, one would by default get father&#39;s varna at\n&gt; birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, as on=\r\ne grows up and one&#39;s vasanas (conditioning from past lives)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; develop, =\r\none may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a\n&gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; di=\r\nfferent from father&#39;s.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Vishwamitra was born as a k=\r\nshatriya, but became a\n&gt; braahmana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and became a brahmarshi later. Val=\r\nmiki was born as a shoodra and lived\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hunting birds. He became a =\r\nbraahmana and became a maharshi later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No matter where one is b=\r\norn and how one was brought up, anyone who is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interested in knowledge=\r\n and liberation and not interested in money or\n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; over others, I=\r\nS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an orthodox brahmin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; family, if =\r\none is deeply interested in money or power and authority\n&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other=\r\ns, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not superior\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; another varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve\n&gt; differ=\r\nent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purposes. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mist=\r\nrust,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fights and killings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate\n&gt;=\r\n consequence of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deepening Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I am saying is not a=\r\nccepted in mainstream society today because we\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply into Kali=\r\n yuga. But, when the Mother decides, social notions can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; change quickl=\r\ny. In fact, we are going through a phase of huge global\n&gt; &gt; &gt; transformatio=\r\nn. Political, economoic, social and religious structures\n&gt; of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wor=\r\nld will be redefined during the coming decades and will remain valid\n&gt; for\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, when the divine Mother appeared befo=\r\nre my guru in March 2006 and\n&gt; gave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a command to spread a simple homa=\r\nm ritual in the world for the coming\n&gt; times,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her clear directive was=\r\n to not differentiate based on caste, creed,\n&gt; class\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and race. We enc=\r\nourage anybody who desires to worship any god in fire\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual=\r\n progress to perform homam on a regular basis using the homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manuals=\r\n at the homam website (see below).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also if a person born in l=\r\now cast is that mean he will receive less\n&gt; grace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GOD & a =\r\npesron who belongs to high cast has abundance of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rather tha=\r\nn caste, environment in which one grows up does have a role\n&gt; (and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ca=\r\nste does sometimes influence the family environment in India). One\n&gt; born i=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a family (brahmana or otherwise) that worships god everyday is expo=\r\nsed\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that notion. One brought up in a family that cares a little =\r\nabout god\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morality and pursues money or power or comforts ruthle=\r\nssly is exposed\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; notion. So the religious/spiritual aspects of =\r\nthe environment in which\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grows up do play a role. However, if o=\r\nne has strong vasanas, they will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually take hold. One will meet =\r\npeople who make those vasanas\n&gt; flourish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and those vasanas take contr=\r\nol.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org&lt;\n&gt; http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- sudhir junonikar &lt;sudhirjunonikar@yahoo.c=\r\nom&lt;sudhirjunonikar%40yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; &lt;http://in.mc949.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compos=\r\ne?to=3Dsudhirjunonikar%40yahoo.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste all gurujanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since childhood i am wandering to have an=\r\nswers to my question, they\n&gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be foolish to scholars like you=\r\n but as lay man I am carrying it with\n&gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Our society is =\r\ndiscriminated in to various cast, does our veda\n&gt; support\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this cast s=\r\nystem?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If we consider that doshas/papam is associated if we make su=\r\nch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discrimination then why it is not taken in to account.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Since thousand&#39;s of years people are treated badly even animals were\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; treated well.

People&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; belonged to different varnas=\r\n based on their aptitude and served different&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; purposes in soc=\r\niety. It wasn&#39;t a rigid system, but a flexible and mobile&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n system based on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a child may=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; get exposed to what father does and may have a good chance o=\r\nf developing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; aptitude for such work, one would by default get=\r\n father&#39;s varna at birth.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But, as one grows up and one&#3=\r\n9;s vasanas (conditioning from past lives)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; develop, one may d=\r\nevelop a different aptitude and may end up with a varna&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; diffe=\r\nrent from father&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; For example, Vishwamitr=\r\na was born as a kshatriya, but became a braahmana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and became =\r\na brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born as a shoodra and lived by&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a maharshi later.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; No matter where one is born and how one was brought up=\r\n, anyone who is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; interested in knowledge and liberation and no=\r\nt interested in money or power&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; over others, IS a braahmana. E=\r\nven if one is born in an orthodox brahmin&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; family, if one is d=\r\neeply interested in money or power and authority over&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; others,=\r\n one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not superior and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; another varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve diff=\r\nerent&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; purposes. It is as simple as that. What we see today - =\r\nbias, mistrust,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fights and killings in the name of caste - ar=\r\ne an unfortunate consequence of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deepening Kali.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; What I am saying is not accepted in mainstream society today=\r\n because we are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother d=\r\necides, social notions can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; change quickly. In fact, we are go=\r\ning through a phase of huge global&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; transformation. Political,=\r\n economoic, social and religious structures of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; world will=\r\n be redefined during the coming decades and will remain valid for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; many centuries.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW, when the divine Mothe=\r\nr appeared before my guru in March 2006 and gave&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a command to=\r\n spread a simple homam ritual in the world for the coming times,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; her clear directive was to not differentiate based on caste, creed, cla=\r\nss&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and race. We encourage anybody who desires to worship any =\r\ngod in fire for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress to perform homam on a regu=\r\nlar basis using the homam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; manuals at the homam website (see b=\r\nelow).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also if a person born in low cast i=\r\ns that mean he will receive less grace&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nGOD &amp; a pesron who belongs to high cast has abundance of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rather than caste, environment in which one grows up does=\r\n have a role (and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; caste does sometimes influence the family e=\r\nnvironment in India). One born in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a family (brahmana or other=\r\nwise) that worships god everyday is exposed to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that notion. O=\r\nne brought up in a family that cares a little about god or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mo=\r\nrality and pursues money or power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; notion. So the religious/spiritual aspects of the environment i=\r\nn which one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; grows up do play a role. However, if one has stro=\r\nng vasanas, they will&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; eventually take hold. One will meet peo=\r\nple who make those vasanas flourish&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and those vasanas take co=\r\nntrol.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://saraswatifi=\r\nlms.org/&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -----------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ---- sudhir junonikar &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:sudhirjunonikar%40yahoo.com&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sudhirjunonikar@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.mc94=\r\n9.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dsudhirjunonikar%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_bl=\r\nank&quot;&gt;http://in.mc949.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dsudhirjunonikar%40yahoo=\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste all gurujanas&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Since childhood i am wandering to have answers to my question, they se=\r\nems&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to be foolish to scholars like you but as lay man I am ca=\r\nrrying it with me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our society is dis=\r\ncriminated in to various cast, does our veda support&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this cas=\r\nt system?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If we consider that doshas/papam is associated=\r\n if we make such&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; discrimination then why it is not taken in t=\r\no account.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since thousand&#39;s of ye=\r\nars people are treated badly even animals were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; treated well. =\r\nToday also more or less situation is same and it is worst in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrural india.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We know that there is no=\r\n biological difference between high cast person &amp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; low cas=\r\nt person then why there is so much hate present.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Also if a person born in low cast is that mean he will receive =\r\nless grace&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of GOD &amp; a pesron who belongs to high cast has=\r\n abundance of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sudhir&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n=\r\n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255); min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;ghate p=\r\ninde nirantar vyapi shree shambhujati guru gorakshnathji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;+++++++=\r\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++=\r\n+++++&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nTRUTH PATH DESTINATION GOAL REAL ADIGURU=A0 SALVATION KARMA D=\r\nESTINY AND ALL THAT EXISTS&lt;br&gt;IS ONLY SUPREME NATURE SUPREME ENERGY DIVINE =\r\nMOTHER ADI SHAKTI MAHAKAALI&lt;br&gt;MAHALAXMI MAHASARASWATI LALITA TRIPURA SUNDA=\r\nRI KULKUNDALINI PARMESHWARI&lt;br&gt;\nSHE IS THE ONLY BEING IN EXISTANCE AND WE A=\r\nRE ALL PART OF HER&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016364ef3227262cb0499501771--\r\n\n"}}
