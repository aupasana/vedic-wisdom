In the same way, no one is able to know the unreality of the\nwak=\r\ning world while he is in the waking state.\n\nThe primary ignorance dominates=\r\n the ego mind at all times, either while\ndreaming or in the waking state, a=\r\nnd this is the cause of the inability of\nmost men even to entertain the tho=\r\nught that the waking world may not be\nreal. The disciple is in a better pos=\r\nition because of his faith in the\ncompetence of his Guru. The Guru, who has=\r\n the experience of the egoless\nstate, can tell him the truth about the worl=\r\nd and of the worldless, egoless\nstate.\n\nThe flaw in the contentions of thes=\r\ne disputants is next indicated.\n\n133 There is no flawless evidence tending =\r\nto prove that the world exists\noutside [apart from the mind of its seer]. B=\r\nut these partisans assume the\ntruth of their contention, which is required =\r\nto be proved, and then concoct\narguments for their case.\n\nThe arguments put=\r\n forward by these disputants, if carefully scrutinised, are\nfound to be bas=\r\ned on a subtle process of what logicians call =E2=80=98begging the\nquestion=\r\n=E2=80=99.\n\nOne such argument is stated and discussed in the following vers=\r\nes.\n\n134 If it is said that the sense impressions of sounds and the rest ar=\r\nise\ninside the mind, while their cause, the world, lies outside, how is thi=\r\ns\ndivision of inside and outside to be accepted as unreal?\n\nThis argument i=\r\ns not a proof, but a mere assertion. Its inadequacy is seen\nin that it assu=\r\nmes the reality of the distinction between inside and\noutside, which is an =\r\noutcome of the assumption that the body is the Self. In\nthat assumption the=\r\n body is assumed to be real, without offering any proof\nof its reality. We =\r\nhave seen that since the body is a part of the world,\nwhose reality is in d=\r\nispute, this assumption is improper.\n\n135 All the divisions experienced in =\r\nworldly life appear as real only in\nrelation to the body. No separate proof=\r\n is offered by them to prove the\nreality of the body!\n\nAnother argument is =\r\nnoticed next.\n\n136 The argument, =E2=80=98The mind is small and the world i=\r\ns vast. How can it be\nwithin the mind?=E2=80=99 is also mistaken. It has be=\r\nen taught by the sage that it\nis the mind that is vast [not the world].\n\n13=\r\n7 The mind is vaster than even the sky, and in it are the five elements of\n=\r\ncreation, the outer space [sky] and the rest. Consciousness in its\nmotionle=\r\nss state is Brahman; the same when moving is mind. Thus it has been\nmade cl=\r\near [by Bhagavan] that the mind is of the nature of Brahman.\n\nBhagavan and =\r\nVedanta recognise three skies: the outer [physical] sky, the\nmind-sky and t=\r\nhe sky of pure consciousness. This last is styled as a sky,\nbecause it cont=\r\nains the mind-sky, which in its turn contains the outer sky\nand all the wor=\r\nlds.\n\nThe fact that the world ceases to appear in deep sleep =E2=80=93 wher=\r\nein the\nexposition of the mental nature of the world is based =E2=80=93 is =\r\nsought to be\ncountered by the following contention.\n\n138 =E2=80=98If you do=\r\nubt whether or not the world existed during your sleep, then\nask those who =\r\ndid not sleep [during the time you slept], and know from their\nwords that t=\r\nhe world existed continuously [without a break].=E2=80=99\n\nThis is consider=\r\ned by the dvaitins to be an unanswerable argument. But\nBhagavan himself, wh=\r\nen this argument was stated as a difficulty to be\novercome, showed that thi=\r\ns also is a case of =E2=80=98begging the question=E2=80=99, as will\nbe show=\r\nn next.\n\n139 This argument, put forward by the ignorant, takes as proved th=\r\ne truth of\ntheir main contention. The men who are not asleep are part and p=\r\narcel of the\nworld under\nenquiry.\n\nWhat Bhagavan said on this point is give=\r\nn next.\n\n140 We see these men who did not sleep only after we wake, not in =\r\nour sleep!\nNo separate proof is offered to prove the reality of these men w=\r\nho did not\nsleep.\nThe reason for not accepting the reality of the world was=\r\n that it is not\nseen during deep sleep. That same objection holds good in r=\r\nespect of these\nmen who did not sleep when we slept. Hence, this argument o=\r\nf the dualists\nfails utterly. It would be a valid argument, suggests Bhagav=\r\nan, if we saw\nthem during our dreamless sleep, which of course is impossibl=\r\ne.\n\nThese men too have no valid argument for believing the world to be real=\r\n, as\nis shown next.\n\n141 Even those who remained awake [while we slept] kno=\r\nw the world only by\nthe mind and never otherwise. Hence, for all alike the =\r\nworld is only mental,\nboth in waking and in dream.\n\nAnother argument is sta=\r\nted and refuted next.\n\n142 The objectivity of the world is also asserted on=\r\n the grounds that it\nappears the same to diverse seers. But the Master refu=\r\ntes the argument by\nasserting that the diversity of observers is unreal.\n\nT=\r\nhis diversity of souls is part of the world illusion. It is therefore no\nmo=\r\nre real than the rest of it. The truth of this point is expounded by\nBhagav=\r\nan in the next verse.\n\n143 Both in dream and in waking this diversity [of s=\r\nouls] is only a mental\ncreation, since in deep sleep, which is mind-free, t=\r\nhis diversity does not\nappear.\n\n144 The mind itself creates the world in th=\r\ne waking state, as it does in\ndream. But the mind does not know, either in =\r\nwaking or in dream, that this\nis its own creation.\n\n145 The mind creates th=\r\ne world subject to a superior power [avidya-maya] and\ntherefore is unable t=\r\no create it to its own liking. The mind, believing the\nworld to be real, is=\r\n deluded and suffers the woes of samsara.\n\nThat the mind has this anomalous=\r\n power, which is also a weakness, is shown\nnext.\n\n146 This is the very natu=\r\nre of the mind, that it takes as real all that it\ncreates. This is seen in =\r\nday-dreaming, witnessing dramas, or listening to\nstories.\nThese instances a=\r\nre taken from our waking experience itself. They\ndemonstrate this self-tort=\r\nuring quality of the mind, which is even worse in\ndreams.\n\nThe conclusion i=\r\ns then stated.\n\n147 Creation is not other than seeing; seeing and creating =\r\nare one and the\nsame process. Annihilation is only the cessation of seeing =\r\nand nothing else,\nfor the world comes to an end by the right awareness of o=\r\nneself.\n\nThe next step is the demonstration that the mind also is unreal. T=\r\nhe next\nverse begins this exposition.\n\n148 As it is settled that the world =\r\nis mental, the world would be real if\nthe mind were real. However, if the m=\r\nind is unreal, then the world would\nalso be unreal. Hence, it becomes neces=\r\nsary to enquire whether the mind is\nreal.\n\nBut there is a preliminary quest=\r\nion to be taken up and answered: the test or\ntests of reality to be applied=\r\n.\n\n149 First, it is necessary to enquire by what tests one can distinguish =\r\nthe\nreal from the unreal, because, in [this] enquiry as to what is real, th=\r\ne\ntest of reality approved of by the worldly ones is not valid.\n\n150 The pa=\r\nrrot who wishes to eat the fruit of the silk-cotton tree [at last]\ngoes awa=\r\ny disappointed. How can the beliefs of one, who thus deludes\nhimself, be ac=\r\ncepted as reasonable?\n\nThis conduct of the parrot, whether true or not, is =\r\nproverbial. Man is in\nthe same situation. He expects to reap unalloyed happ=\r\niness in worldly life\nand is always disappointed. This demonstrates his cap=\r\nacity for\nself-deception. Philosophers would not be philosophers if they ac=\r\ncepted the\ncredulous views of unthinking men.\n\nUnless used under the guidan=\r\nce of a perfectly competent Guru, the worldly\nmeans of knowledge are certai=\r\nn to prove misleading. This truth is expressed\nin the next verse.\n\n151 The =\r\nintellect, the sense organs, and the mind are servants of the\nprimary ignor=\r\nance. Hence, the worldly methods of seeking knowledge do not at\nall favour =\r\nsuccess in this enquiry.\n\nThe worldly means of knowledge, called proofs, ar=\r\ne direct perception,\ninference, analogy, tradition, and so on. These are un=\r\nderstood and practised\nby logicians and philosophers. In vedantic reasoning=\r\n these are not to be\nrelied upon for the reason stated, namely that they ar=\r\ne naturally the\nservants of ignorance, having been created in order to prot=\r\nect and confirm\nthat ignorance.\n\n152 The test of reality that is considered=\r\n good by the worldly is unreliable\nbecause it is a child of ignorance. For =\r\nthe sadhakas the reliable test for\ndistinguishing truth from falsehood is t=\r\nhat which the sages have stated.\n\nThat test is next set forth.\n\n153 That wh=\r\nich shines by its own light [of consciousness], without change,\nand without=\r\n setting and rising, is alone real. All that is not so is unreal.\nSo say th=\r\ne sages.\n\nThis is the test approved of in vedantic metaphysics, and it is t=\r\nhat which\nis used in the Upanishads.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is next referred to=\r\n.\n\n154 =E2=80=98There is never any [real] existence for the unreal, neither=\r\n is there\nany non-existence for the real.=E2=80=99 Thus Bhagavan Sri Krishn=\r\na himself stated\nthe distinction between the real and the unreal.\n\nThus, th=\r\nings that appear at certain times and disappear at other times are\nexcluded=\r\n from the category of the real.\n\n155 What had no existence in the beginning=\r\n and will not exist after some\ntime is non-existent even in the intervening=\r\n period [during which it seems\nto exist]. The notion that anything which ap=\r\npears limited in space or time\n[is real] is ignorance.\n\n156 The analogy for=\r\n the real is gold and the analogy for the unreal is\njewellery [made of gold=\r\n]. Gold is real in comparison with jewellery; the\nlatter is unreal because =\r\nit is perishable.\n\n157 The jewellery was gold before [being made] and it is=\r\n gold even in the\nmiddle [when it appears as jewellery] and also at the end=\r\n, [when it is\nmelted down]. [Thus] the unrealities appear as real on a subs=\r\ntratum of the\nreal, just as unreal jewellery appears as real on a substratu=\r\nm of gold\n[which is comparatively real].\n\nThis is one of the analogies empl=\r\noyed in the Chandogya Upanishad to\nillustrate the truth taught here, that t=\r\nhe one supreme reality, which is the\nreal Self, is the substratum of the wo=\r\nrld appearance.\n\n158 If the two, the world and the mind, are scrutinised in=\r\n this way, they\nare found to be unreal. The process of this demonstration, =\r\nas taught by the\nmost holy one [Bhagavan], is here set forth.\n\n159 The worl=\r\nd that is made to shine and the light, namely the mind, which\ncaused the wo=\r\nrld to shine, arise and set together [as one]. Since this pair\ndoes not app=\r\near uninterruptedly, the pair should be known to be unreal.\n\nSource: http:/=\r\n/www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00235429d356ae79ae049f48b190\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n132 No one is able to know the unreality of the dream world duri=\r\nng the dream itself.

Hence, it becomes=\r\n necessary to enquire whether the mind is real.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But there i=\r\ns a preliminary question to be taken up and answered: the test or tests of =\r\nreality to be applied.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;149 First, it is necessary to enquire by what=\r\n tests one can distinguish the real from the unreal, because, in [this] enq=\r\nuiry as to what is real, the test of reality approved of by the worldly one=\r\ns is not valid.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;150 The parrot wh=\r\no wishes to eat the fruit of the silk-cotton tree [at last] goes away disap=\r\npointed. How can the beliefs of one, who thus deludes himself, be accepted =\r\nas reasonable?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This conduct of the parrot, whether true or not, is=\r\n proverbial. Man is in the same situation. He expects to reap unalloyed hap=\r\npiness in worldly life and is always disappointed.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0This demonst=\r\nrates his capacity for self-deception. Philosophers would not be philosophe=\r\nrs if they accepted the credulous views of unthinking men.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Unless =\r\nused under the guidance of a perfectly competent Guru, the worldly means of=\r\n knowledge are certain to prove misleading. This truth is expressed in the =\r\nnext verse.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;151 The intellect, the sense organs, and the mind are se=\r\nrvants of the primary ignorance. Hence, the worldly methods of seeking know=\r\nledge do not at all favour success in this enquiry.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The worldly me=\r\nans of knowledge, called proofs, are direct perception, inference, analogy,=\r\n tradition, and so on. These are understood and practised by logicians and =\r\nphilosophers. In vedantic reasoning these are not to be relied upon for the=\r\n reason stated, namely that they are naturally the servants of ignorance, h=\r\naving been created in order to protect and confirm that ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;152 The test of reality that is considered good by the worldly is unreliab=\r\nle because it is a child of ignorance. For the sadhakas the reliable test f=\r\nor distinguishing truth from falsehood is that which the sages have stated.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That test is next set forth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;153 That which shines by its =\r\nown light [of consciousness], without change, and without setting and risin=\r\ng, is alone real. All that is not so is unreal. So say the sages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Th=\r\nis is the test approved of in vedantic metaphysics, and it is that which is=\r\n used in the Upanishads.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Bhagavad Gita is next referred to.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;154 =E2=80=98There is never any [real] existence for the unreal, neith=\r\ner is there any non-existence for the real.=E2=80=99 Thus Bhagavan Sri Kris=\r\nhna himself stated the distinction between the real and the unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Thus, things that appear at certain times and disappear at other times ar=\r\ne excluded from the category of the real.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;155 What had no existence =\r\nin the beginning and will not exist after some time is non-existent even in=\r\n the intervening period [during which it seems to exist].=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The notion that anything which appears limited in spa=\r\nce or time [is real] is ignorance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;156 The analogy for the =\r\nreal is gold and the analogy for the unreal is jewellery [made of gold]. Go=\r\nld is real in comparison with jewellery; the latter is unreal because it is=\r\n perishable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;157 The jewellery was gold before [being made] and it i=\r\ns gold even in the middle [when it appears as jewellery] and also at the en=\r\nd, [when it is melted down]. [Thus] the unrealities appear as real on a sub=\r\nstratum of the real, just as unreal jewellery appears as real on a substrat=\r\num of gold [which is comparatively real].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is one of the analo=\r\ngies employed in the Chandogya Upanishad to illustrate the truth taught her=\r\ne, that the one supreme reality, which is the real Self, is the substratum =\r\nof the world appearance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;158 If the two, the world and the mind, are=\r\n scrutinised in this way, they are found to be unreal. The process of this =\r\ndemonstration, as taught by the most holy one [Bhagavan], is here set forth=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;159 The world that is made to shine and the light, namely the mi=\r\nnd, which caused the world to shine, arise and set together [as one]. Since=\r\n this pair does not appear uninterruptedly, the pair should be known to be =\r\nunreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;ma=\r\nrgin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-hei=\r\nght:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;=\r\nmargin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-h=\r\neight:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00235429d356ae79ae049f48b190--\r\n\n"}}
