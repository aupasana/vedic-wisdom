Now I just got off the\n&gt; phone with our temple priest and his logic is that we should use the tithi\n&gt; at sunrise because that is the time when we take the sankalpa for the fast!\n&gt; I have always felt that using the tithi prevailing at sunrise for the rest\n&gt; of the day till the next sunrise for our festivals must be due to some good\n&gt; reasons but no one has explained that me as yet!\n&gt;\n&gt; Clearly, this is something that we (as Hindus) need to resolve.

When chaturdasi\n&gt; prevails during the middle part (when midnight occurs), that is the\n&gt; night during which shivarati is to be observed. Many priests are\n&gt; simply following the dates used in India. So be it. Those who know the\n&gt; details can try to be more careful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Incidentally, it is not clearcut even in India. For example, some\n&gt; members have posted to other e-mail lists conveying that Sringeri is\n&gt; celebrating it on the 5th, as per the word of the pontiff there.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even in the US, festivals may occasionally vary by one day between the\n&gt; east & west coasts.\n&gt;\n&gt; bhavadIyaH,\n&gt;\n&gt; ajit\n&gt;\n&gt; On Tue, Mar 4, 2008 at 5:06 PM, Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your enlightening and inspiring posts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you please clarify when we are supposed to celebrate MahaShivratri\n&gt; &gt; this year in America.

I assumed that you would fast and pray the night\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; March 5 but our temple priests insists that we need to celebrate it on the\n&gt; &gt; midnight of March 6, when, in fact, it will be amavasya during the entire\n&gt; &gt; night...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks once again,\n&gt; &gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and know-it-all with Yahoo!
