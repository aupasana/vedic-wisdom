This non-religious documentary portrays a rare and\nunusual Fire Ritual performed by a Yogi from India and the subsequent\nchemical analysis of his clothing and physical tests that examine this\nsupernatural phenomenon. The Yogi has performed this Fire Ritual for a\ntotal of 1000 days over the last 45 years. The Yogi, weighing a mere\n94 pounds around 43 kilos has been able to survive on only two bananas\nand a mere glass of milk with a few drops of water twice a day for the\nlast 28 years. The ritual is performed for Universal Harmony , Global\nWelfare and Individual Prosperity. Many aspects of the Yogi are on the\nedge of unbelievability, while at the same time highlighting the power\nand endurance of human mind, body and spirit.\n\nhttp://www.grokfiles.net/yoga/?p=45\n\n------------\n\n&quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long\nas one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n\n"}}
