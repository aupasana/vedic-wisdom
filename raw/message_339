Actually books were written in \ntelugu. =\r\n\n&gt; If you have time and you are in India, please don&#39;t miss these \ngreat \n&gt;=\r\n jnanis. As I didn&#39;t go to India recently, I haven&#39;t yet met these \ngreat \n=\r\n&gt; living yogis. Remember, Nowadays, it is very difficult to see a \nliving \n=\r\n&gt; jnani. So please don&#39;t miss the opportunity to visit them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I read a =\r\nstory from dhuniwala dada&#39;s life in one of the books I \n&gt; couldn&#39;t recall. =\r\n\n&gt; Once a old lady begger came to Dhuniwala&#39;s ashram. Then dada send \nher \n=\r\n&gt; out with so much anger and hate. His pupil asked him why he was \nvery \n&gt; =\r\nangry on her. Then dada told them that she killed a saint in her \npast \n&gt; l=\r\nife. So she has to has 7 more lifes(incarnations) like that. Just \n&gt; becaus=\r\ne she visited the ashram, some of her sins were burnt, and 6 \nmore \n&gt; lifes=\r\n would be enough to burn her sins.\n&gt; \n&gt; Visiting living saints is a great o=\r\npportunity. They never care \nabout \n&gt; anything in the earth and don&#39;t judge=\r\n them by their appearance too. \n&gt; \n&gt; Website:\n&gt; http://www.saimastersevatru=\r\nst.org/livingsaints.html\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
