He/she should chant this repeatedly each time they suspect that suc=\r\nh external intervention/control may happen. The sounds, meter and the deity=\r\n associated with this particular chant doesn&#39;t allow the external spirits t=\r\no gain control over the person repeating it. Tongue is an important organ w=\r\nhen such spirits try to assume control and a suitably calibrated tongue twi=\r\nster like the &#39;anjaneya dandakam&#39; can help if the fluency, pronunciation an=\r\nd intensity can be maintained. This &#39;chanting&#39; suggestion is based on what =\r\nI gathered via hearsay in yoga and mantra circuits. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
