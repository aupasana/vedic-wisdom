Nevertheless, there are a few things to note: (1) He was n=\r\not operating with any selfish agendas or seeking money/power/something else=\r\n. (2) His words gave confidence and got his disciples through the most chal=\r\nlenging times of their lives, i.e. they served a purpose. (3) Most importan=\r\ntly, those disciples ended up, a few decades later, living a life of exempl=\r\nary renunciation and selfless service to society and disseminated sublime w=\r\nisdom. One could conclude that his visions were perhaps genuinely inspired&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\nI totally agree with the statement that lack of personal agendas, selfle=\r\nss motvites, satwik intent are very powerful things. Anything done in this =\r\nmanner always eventually turns out good.\n=C2=A0\nIn Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s case, =\r\nthere is one more point IMO. His visions, based on which in a=C2=A0totally =\r\nnon-calculating, guileless and childlike manner, he would proclaim the past=\r\n lives of various disciples, had a strong grain of truth that actualized in=\r\n a reasonable accurate manner at a much later date. Let me give one example=\r\n. One day Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room around evening when he sa=\r\nw a vision of Lord Krishna with another young boy, dressed like a cowherd, =\r\nstanding in the middle of a lotus.=C2=A0 The next day he saw the exact same=\r\n boy come to Dakshineshwar. Incidentally the boy&#39;s name was Rakhal, meaning=\r\n cowherd. Sri Ramakrishna told him that he was in a previous birth, one of =\r\nthe cowherd companions of Sri Krishna in Vrndavana! Later, many decades lat=\r\ner, when Sri Ramakrishna himself had left his physical body, Rakhal went on=\r\n to become a teriffic saint of very very high caliber named Swami Brahmanan=\r\nda and one of the greatest devotees of Lord\n Krshna. His spiritual fulfillm=\r\nent came through worship of Lord Krshna and the study of the Gita. In his l=\r\nast years, he would see and interact with Krshna at all times and hours bef=\r\nore his own death he saw Lord Krshna come to him and take his hand and call=\r\n him back to his own realm. Within hours of this experience he died. The po=\r\nint being, the vision that Sri Ramakrishna saw many decades ago,at a time w=\r\nhen Rakhal himself had no clue of his potential and his specific path, all =\r\nproved correct and accurate. Ramakrishna himself was not alive to see that =\r\nday,=C2=A0therefore it cannot be said e had any agenda in making those proc=\r\nlamations to Rakhal about his past life and his path. So if all this turned=\r\n out to be true in such a tremendous manner, we have no basis to say that h=\r\nis declaratoin of Rakhal&#39;s, or anyone else&#39;s=C2=A0past life was not-true. \n=\r\n=C2=A0Wwe know what imagination and visualization is. All of us have these =\r\npowers of imagination is various measures. But none of us can &#39;imagine&#39; the=\r\n future and make it happen the way we imagine it, that=C2=A0too=C2=A0on a=\r\n=C2=A0regular basis. Then it is not imagination any more. This is something=\r\n else totally. All of Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s vision proved to be 100% accurate a=\r\nt all times. Not one failed.=C2=A0 This is far=C2=A0beyond the capability o=\r\nf the human mind, imagination or visualization or whatever else we want to =\r\ncall it.\n\nAround the time when Swami Vivekananda was born, Ramakrishna one =\r\nday saw a vision in the sky. He saw a powerful bolt of lightning coming fro=\r\nm Kashi and heading towards Bengal. He saw, in his vision, the whole sky wa=\r\ns like split asunder by the power and force of that blaze of lightning. He =\r\ntold some people around him that a very powerful soul has takne birth who h=\r\nas a strong connection to Lord Shiva. Nearly twenty years after this vision=\r\n he met the future Swami Vivekananda for the first time, and as Vievakanda&#39;=\r\ns life later showed, he turned out to be=C2=A0a great Shiva devotee. \n\nLoos=\r\nely speaking one can say that the mind has many hidden abilities. But I loo=\r\nk at it differently. We are born with three koshas - annamaya (physical bod=\r\ny), pranamaya ( life-force) and manomaya (mind). Even in these, each indivi=\r\ndual with have subtle variations in the amount of influence, clarity, depth=\r\n and other things that they have at their disposal in the use of these kosh=\r\nas. This is standard knowledge. One can be born with a very roboust physica=\r\nl body that can sustain many things while anothe with a weak body. Etc. But=\r\n there is a fourth kosha which lies only as a potential. SOme yogis, by the=\r\n power of their sadhana, can develop the same. Shastras call it Vigyanamaya=\r\n.=C2=A0One of best misconcption of this age is that Vgyana means intellect =\r\nas we know it. Hardly. Even the most logically powerful, sharpest and swift=\r\nest intellect is still a working of the manomaya kosha, of course at a high=\r\n pitch. But the Vigyana is sifferent. WHen the Yogi is able\n to=C2=A0develo=\r\np and use this kosha various apparently supernatural things can manifest. T=\r\nhese appear supernatural from our point of view, but maybe just an ordinary=\r\n funtionality of that kosha=C2=A0-=C2=A0sheath - of the human organism. Is =\r\nthis Maya? It is as much Maya as you hands and your legs are.. At a very hi=\r\ngh level of development of Vigyanamaya kosha=C2=A0abilities of Trikal Darsh=\r\nan may come to the Yogi automatically. This is similar to, as I mentioned i=\r\nn the previous mail, the ability to enter the consciousness in the Karan Ja=\r\ngat. That is how some exceptional Yogis, as Vimalananda so offhandly remark=\r\ns, can see an individual and see 25=C2=A0birth in the past and 25 possible =\r\nbirths in the future! (given thecurrent momentum).\n\nNone of this is imagina=\r\ntion at all.=C2=A0 What is the use=C2=A0of this otherwise obscure kosha? On=\r\ne gets=C2=A0the clearest view of REALITY from here than from any of the oth=\r\ner koshas. That is all the bottomline is.Percieving the One Reality using=\r\n=C2=A0the various means at our disposal.=C2=A0\n\nA man like Sri Ramakrishna =\r\nis born with these koshas developed to a very=C2=A0high degree, unlike rest=\r\n of the seekers. That=C2=A0is why his visions=C2=A0almost never failed.\n\n-R=\r\negards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp th=\r\nee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue the=\r\ne like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R.

However, a genuine siddhi a=\r\nnd a hallucination cannot be painted with the same brush.\n=C2=A0\nIf a yogi =\r\nwith Kundalini in a higher chakra obtains a special siddhi and a hasty newb=\r\nie hallucinates getting the same siddhi, they are of course not the same, t=\r\nhough both are stuck in Maya (the delusory power of the field of duality)!\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nSuppose everyone in a room (field of duality) sees a rope (Self) as =\r\na snake (world appearance). They are all under the influence of Maya. Suppo=\r\nse one person in the room makes the snake seem (to everyone in the room) to=\r\n have 10 heads. Suppose another person imagines the snake to have 10 heads =\r\nand that everyone sees 10 heads, while everyone actually sees only one head=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nIn an *absolute* non-dualistic sense, both are in delusion because=\r\n it is not a snake in the first place and a rope. But, in a *relative* dual=\r\nistic sense, the latter is hallucinating and the former is mastering the dy=\r\nnamics of the room.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nHaving said that, I must r=\r\ne-emphasize that it is silly to pursue any siddhis. Seeking the ability to =\r\nmake the rope that everyone sees as snake appear to have 4 heads or 10 head=\r\ns to all is a silly goal.\n=C2=A0\nA true seeker will seek the ability to alw=\r\nays see as rope what everyone sees as snake. That is the only meaningful &quot;a=\r\nbility&quot;. During the process of acquiring that ability, one may get other ab=\r\nilities (e.g. the above one).

Knowledge =\r\ncoming from a visit to a commercial psychotherapist is hardly likely to be =\r\nthat way.\n=C2=A0In any case, my basic point is that it is not at all easy t=\r\no know past life of oneself or others.

Despite wrong a=\r\nttitude and missteps in the beginning, one does find one&apos;s path if one=\r\n sticks to a sadhana. That is why I am a fan of regular practices instead o=\r\nf one-off practices.\n=C2=A0\nA one-off practice can also transform one treme=\r\nndously if one&apos;s conditioning is sufficiently light already. However, =\r\nwe do not encounter such people anymore. That is why I downplay one-off pra=\r\nctices and emphasize regular practice.\n=C2=A0\nWhether it&apos;s homam or ja=\r\npam or a kriya, just do it regularly with as sincere and devoted a mind as =\r\npossible.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n\nKnowing details of past life/lives is mo=\r\nstly useless.

Everyone,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I just thought o=\r\nf adding some clarifications.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;First of all, when I mentioned a=\r\nbout the utility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;=\r\n for handling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other probl=\r\nems for which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were lim=\r\nited to the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge abou=\r\nt whether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge abou=\r\nt anything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of=\r\n the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper=\r\n sense of the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still co=\r\nntinue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or n=\r\not. Though we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth =\r\nbut it is the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=\r\n=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, =\r\nwe keep on continuing with activities which\n helps in keeping life go on...=\r\nIt is in this sense that I&apos;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past =\r\nLife Regression&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth insi=\r\nde a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilit=\r\nies. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the uni=\r\nverse can behave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments abo=\r\nut the utility of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincer=\r\ne dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one re=\r\nally takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced=\r\n about the same.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn&apos;t make comments befor=\r\ne taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would =\r\nprevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in =\r\nreligion and religious practices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in=\r\n science if one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Proof of pudding =\r\nis in eating it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any o=\r\nf their problems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense ut=\r\nility for=C2=A0those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an =\r\nopen mind.

To cite one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recur=\r\nrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for=\r\n the treatment.=C2=A0But due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping =\r\nat a far off place for around 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsen=\r\ned as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 started affecting her professional career adversely=\r\n. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone.=\r\n The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she got re=\r\nlieved from her that recurrent dream and also started improving her profess=\r\nional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;It all depends on the openness of the mind, the strength of the desi=\r\nre to overcome etc. The universe is much more than what we see,what we can =\r\nsee and what we can believe to see.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ya=\r\nhoo.co.in&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To add to the complexit=\r\ny of the problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over =\r\nsimplified and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and=\r\n the soul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul =\r\nhad a role to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has li=\r\nved a life where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth=\r\n and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete p=\r\nrocess. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based o=\r\nn need.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. The=\r\ny believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore thei=\r\nr idea of reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made=\r\n up of mind, body that coalesces together to give the impression of an indi=\r\nvidual being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the gr=\r\neater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another format=\r\nion at a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a differen=\r\nt point can coalesce into a different part. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for=\r\n a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his =\r\nenergy reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reincarna=\r\nte into another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of s=\r\npeech incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in an=\r\nother person, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and all t=\r\nhese\n happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Those=\r\n philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the =\r\nUniverse only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law o=\r\nf debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with=\r\n this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life=\r\n and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here t=\r\nhat is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and forma=\r\nl renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea =\r\nwas different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike bod=\r\ny/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and the chief aim=\r\n of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul&apos;s influence on=\r\n the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this p=\r\nurpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no tw=\r\no souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciously* =\r\noperate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supr=\r\neme Negation of life is not the ultimate aim, it is only one among many pos=\r\nsibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state of complete negation/Shunya/=\r\nOther-world is the final and inevitable aim, then there was just no need fo=\r\nr Avataras to descend and perform complex life-actions. The law of Karma is=\r\n here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take of ene=\r\nrgy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The\n important thing is whet=\r\nher an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. =\r\nIf it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a m=\r\nassive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara=\r\n -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can transform himself in=\r\nto a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hundred times t=\r\no get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whereas those aspects of=\r\n life where the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed b=\r\ny the law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being perishabl=\r\ne, the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it is o=\r\nnly the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cinematic=\r\n biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been lives =\r\nwhen the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those are =\r\ndead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature, those li=\r\nves serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover all these are possibl=\r\ne ONLY if and when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a=\r\n very very strong manner. That is not easy. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajar=\r\nshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee =\r\nin, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee l=\r\nike a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;On Saturday, 26=\r\n October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

I am su=\r\nre there too one can find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unf=\r\nortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is =\r\nconsidered to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form=\r\n of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptu=\r\nres He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. Re=\r\nferences to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some versio=\r\nns of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for centuries b=\r\ny followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against spirits, and =\r\nspecially during rituals of cremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard ma=\r\nntra is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in =\r\none sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time that there i=\r\ns some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine=\r\n instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite im=\r\npossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days alm=\r\nost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession fr=\r\nom a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the o=\r\nne trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the girl wil=\r\nl have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Na=\r\nrasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess=\r\n being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the fa=\r\nmily visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, =\r\nto visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava te=\r\nmple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. =\r\nAround these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live=\r\n who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge=\r\n a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come=\r\n with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and =\r\nthen perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is on=\r\ne method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came t=\r\no my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope this helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a=\r\n hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sur=\r\ne I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-=\r\nSri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013=\r\n 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from s=\r\npirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are various class=\r\nes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and some=\r\n of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many d=\r\nifferent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically,=\r\n but whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not d=\r\nepends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method.=\r\n It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the indivi=\r\ndual and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find =\r\nout the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into t=\r\nhe person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (w=\r\nhere this being(s) reside), or causally entering into their territory and b=\r\neing susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and bod=\r\ny, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm=\r\n to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot o=\r\nne stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on=\r\n the shakti of the spirit, and\n the amount of shakti that those trying to h=\r\nelp are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spi=\r\nrit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tr=\r\nying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specializations. These =\r\ndo not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what o=\r\nne is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best =\r\nto stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how =\r\nto handle the same too. Again if a spirit is removed by force before the ti=\r\nme till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession=\r\n of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will invo=\r\nlve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove th=\r\ne spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particul=\r\nar individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But befo=\r\nre starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spir=\r\nit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession =\r\nas per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he =\r\nwould sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of it=\r\ns own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never tryin=\r\ng to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spi=\r\nrit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Bes=\r\nt thing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how to deal with spirit =\r\npossession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible=\r\n, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhair=\r\nava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are bet=\r\nter) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Whi=\r\nch means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the=\r\n degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any s=\r\nadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through =\r\nto the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper p=\r\not, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprink=\r\nle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck =\r\nand may God help the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred=\r\n lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will=\r\n with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Auro=\r\nbindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;T=\r\no: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sen=\r\nt: Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: M=\r\nantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I&apos;m very sensitive to different ener=\r\ngies - I don&apos;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or ra=\r\nther evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&apos;t feel good t=\r\no me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I =\r\nwould make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see =\r\nthem but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would =\r\nwake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely =\r\nhear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see=\r\n nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&apos;t seem like sleep paralysis to=\r\n me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There w=\r\nere a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe proble=\r\nms with sleep, so it&apos;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last nig=\r\nht I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to sleep and this was th=\r\ne only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming b=\r\nack home from that place I started waking up at home, feeling some strong p=\r\nresence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&apos;ve seen =\r\nthem before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the strange feelings d=\r\nisappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra=\r\n that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Something t=\r\nhat I can chant before going to sleep.

His visions, based on=\r\n which in a&nbsp;totally non-calculating, guileless and childlike manner, h=\r\ne would proclaim the past lives of various disciples, had a strong grain of=\r\n truth that actualized in a reasonable accurate manner at a much later date=\r\n. Let me give one example. One day Sri Ramakrishna was sitting in his room =\r\naround evening when he saw a vision of Lord Krishna with another young boy,=\r\n dressed like a cowherd, standing in the middle of a lotus.&nbsp; The next =\r\nday he saw the exact same boy come to Dakshineshwar. Incidentally the boy&#39;s=\r\n name was Rakhal, meaning cowherd. Sri Ramakrishna told him that he was in =\r\na previous birth, one of the cowherd companions of Sri Krishna in\n Vrndavan=\r\na! Later, many decades later, when Sri Ramakrishna himself had left his phy=\r\nsical body, Rakhal went on to become a teriffic saint of very very high cal=\r\niber named Swami Brahmananda and one of the greatest devotees of Lord Krshn=\r\na. His spiritual fulfillment came through worship of Lord Krshna and the st=\r\nudy of the Gita. In his last years, he would see and interact with Krshna a=\r\nt all times and hours before his own death he saw Lord Krshna come to him a=\r\nnd take his hand and call him back to his own realm. Within hours of this e=\r\nxperience he died. The point being, the vision that Sri Ramakrishna saw man=\r\ny decades ago,at a time when Rakhal himself had no clue of his potential an=\r\nd his specific path, all proved correct and accurate. Ramakrishna himself w=\r\nas not alive to see that day,&nbsp;therefore it cannot be said e had any ag=\r\nenda in making those proclamations to Rakhal about his past life and his pa=\r\nth. So if all this turned out to be true in such a\n tremendous manner, we h=\r\nave no basis to say that his declaratoin of Rakhal&#39;s, or anyone else&#39;s&nbsp=\r\n;past life was not-true. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Wwe know what imagination and visuali=\r\nzation is. All of us have these powers of imagination is various measures. =\r\nBut none of us can &#39;imagine&#39; the future and make it happen the way we imagi=\r\nne it, that&nbsp;too&nbsp;on a&nbsp;regular basis. Then it is not imaginati=\r\non any more. This is something else totally. All of Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s visio=\r\nn proved to be 100% accurate at all times. Not one failed.&nbsp; This is fa=\r\nr&nbsp;beyond the capability of the human mind, imagination or visualizatio=\r\nn or whatever else we want to call it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Around the time when Swami Vivekananda=\r\n was born, Ramakrishna one day saw a vision in the sky. He saw a powerful b=\r\nolt of lightning coming from Kashi and heading towards Bengal. He saw, in h=\r\nis vision, the whole sky was like split asunder by the power and force of t=\r\nhat blaze of lightning. He told some people around him that a very powerful=\r\n soul has takne birth who has a strong connection to Lord Shiva. Nearly twe=\r\nnty years after this vision he met the future Swami Vivekananda for the fir=\r\nst time, and as Vievakanda&#39;s life later showed, he turned out to be&nbsp;a =\r\ngreat Shiva devotee. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Loosely speaking one can say that the mind has many hid=\r\nden abilities. But I look at it differently. We are born with three koshas =\r\n- annamaya (physical body), pranamaya ( life-force) and manomaya (mind). Ev=\r\nen in these, each individual with have subtle variations in the amount of i=\r\nnfluence, clarity, depth and other things that they have at their disposal =\r\nin the use of these koshas. This is standard knowledge. One can be born wit=\r\nh a very roboust physical body that can sustain many things while anothe wi=\r\nth a weak body. Etc. But there is a fourth kosha which lies only as a poten=\r\ntial. SOme yogis, by the power of their sadhana, can develop the same. Shas=\r\ntras call it Vigyanamaya.&nbsp;One of best misconcption of this age is that=\r\n Vgyana means intellect as we know it. Hardly. Even the most logically powe=\r\nrful, sharpest and swiftest intellect is still a working of the manomaya ko=\r\nsha, of course at a high pitch. But the Vigyana is sifferent.\n WHen the Yog=\r\ni is able to&nbsp;develop and use this kosha various apparently supernatura=\r\nl things can manifest. These appear supernatural from our point of view, bu=\r\nt maybe just an ordinary funtionality of that kosha&nbsp;-&nbsp;sheath - of=\r\n the human organism. Is this Maya? It is as much Maya as you hands and your=\r\n legs are.. At a very high level of development of Vigyanamaya kosha&nbsp;a=\r\nbilities of Trikal Darshan may come to the Yogi automatically. This is simi=\r\nlar to, as I mentioned in the previous mail, the ability to enter the consc=\r\niousness in the Karan Jagat. That is how some exceptional Yogis, as Vimalan=\r\nanda so offhandly remarks, can see an individual and see 25&nbsp;birth in t=\r\nhe past and 25 possible births in the future! (given thecurrent momentum).&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;No=\r\nne of this is imagination at all.&nbsp; What is the use&nbsp;of this otherw=\r\nise obscure kosha? One gets&nbsp;the clearest view of REALITY from here tha=\r\nn from any of the other koshas. That is all the bottomline is.Percieving th=\r\ne One Reality using&nbsp;the various means at our disposal.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;A man like =\r\nSri Ramakrishna is born with these koshas developed to a very&nbsp;high deg=\r\nree, unlike rest of the seekers.
