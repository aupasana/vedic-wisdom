In certain paths of sadhana (Ma=\r\ntangi worship, for example), woman\n&gt; &gt; is at her most auspicious when she i=\r\ns menstruating. So to compare this state\n&gt; &gt; to a person being smelly or sw=\r\neaty is, I think, a mischaracterization.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, there are elements o=\r\nf ritual impurity. But it is also true that the\n&gt; &gt; time of menstruation is=\r\n a time ofi inner purification and cleansing (on a\n&gt; &gt; physicial and spirit=\r\nual level) for women that men (unfortunately for them)\n&gt; &gt; do not have acce=\r\nss to. In a way, external sadhana is required for men to\n&gt; &gt; obtain the fru=\r\nits of the automatic purification women attain through\n&gt; &gt; menstruation.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is another reason why women are advised to take complete rest d=\r\nuring\n&gt; &gt; their menses--not that they&#39;re going to contaminate everything ar=\r\nound them,\n&gt; &gt; but the process of cleansing going on within is a subtle and=\r\n sensitive\n&gt; &gt; process that is optimized when a woman can fully rest.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Also, a woman&#39;s work never ends, so this practice is a way of ensuring =\r\nwomen\n&gt; &gt; get their much needed rest, including rest from sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I just wanted to add this, because I think sometimes women get the wrong\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; impression that they are somehow debased or otherwise inauspicious durin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; their time of menstruation and therefore kept away fromthe privilege =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; doing worship. But that is a very crude view and I think the more nu=\r\nanced\n&gt; &gt; understanding that our ancient rishis (and yoginis) had was that =\r\nthis is a\n&gt; &gt; special time for women when external sadhana is not required =\r\nsince internal\n&gt; &gt; cleansing is going on and a time when her energies and k=\r\nundalini are\n&gt; &gt; naturally sensitized and heightened, so special care shoul=\r\nd be taken.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, there is no restriction on doing manasika japa (=\r\nwithout moving the\n&gt; &gt; lips) for a woman during this time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri,=\r\n Aug 28, 2009 at 10:29 AM, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear narayana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for this knowledge.
