Ahamkaara and I Ness \n&gt; is completely two different identity.\n&gt;=\r\n your second statment is a departure from almost every Gnyaani has \n&gt; to sa=\r\ny.\n\n   It is none of my fault that this conflict arose and continues. Here =\r\nis the reason.\n\n   In my first mail (#2704) itself it is explicitly written=\r\n, that Patanjali has used the exact word &quot;asmita&quot; for Egoism - which is the=\r\n I-ness (Ahamkara) in Physical body consciousness - that causes identificat=\r\nion of the seer with the instrument of seeing i.e. Physical senses.\n\n&gt; In P=\r\natanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6\n&gt; Egoism is t=\r\nhe identification of the seer with the instrument of \n&gt; seeing.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Patanj=\r\nali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n\n\n  PATANJALI has not used the wor=\r\nd AHAMKARA anywhere in his PRECISE AND ESTEEMED sanskrit dissertation on YO=\r\nGA - he has chosen to use the word ASMITA everywhere. E.g.\n\n1.  vitarka vic=\r\nharanandasmita rupanugamat samprajnatah -\n\n                 SASMITA SAMADHI=\r\n\n\n2.  From Lahiri Mahasayas&#39; Commentary on Patanjali - \n\n  avidyasmitaragad=\r\nveshabhinibeshah panchakleshah\n\n&quot;Avidya&quot; [ignorance], &quot;asmita&quot; [egotism], &quot;=\r\nraga&quot; [attraction or \n liking], &quot;dvesha&quot; [hatred or disliking] and &quot;abhinib=\r\nesha&quot;  [engrossment] -- these are the five types of afflictions.\n\n  Thus, u=\r\nsing &quot;Ahamkara&quot; while talking about Sankhya and using &quot;Asmita&quot; while talkin=\r\ng about Patanjali Sutras brought in the conflict. In any case, what is call=\r\ned as Ahamkara in 24 principles of Sankhya is actually Asmita, which can be=\r\n very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.\n\n  The idea stated by me was on firm grou=\r\nnds - with reference to Patanjali Sutras and the words of Sri Yukteswar in =\r\nAutobiography of a Yogi. And this idea is there in my first mail, though no=\r\nt the exact table: \n\n  PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  =3D ASMITA   =3D Physica=\r\nl Egotism\n  ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D MANAS    =3D Astral attachments=\r\n\n  CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D CHITTA   =3D Causal Perceptions\n\n  Also,=\r\n one of the 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don=\r\n&#39;t have sense of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness is this:\n\n&gt; Since ast=\r\nral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to \n&gt; see, hear, smel=\r\nl, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a \n&gt; Yogi)... the sense of egois=\r\nm does not take roots in the astral-body &gt; and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral =\r\nKarma.\n&gt; Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everythin=\r\ng.\n\n&gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is \n&gt; ass=\r\nociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has \n&gt; Physical Karma.=\r\n\n\n  Lastly, extending upon this idea further, there are beings in the Astra=\r\nl cosmos who have never been in Physical forms - We Physical beings are not=\r\n the only ones in the cycles of creation. While they will still have the id=\r\nea of &quot;Asmita&quot; in their causal bodies, but they will always be repelled by =\r\nthe grosser-vibrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, an=\r\nd hence would not incur any Physical Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.\n\n--------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n[ TO ALL IN THE LIST ] =\r\n \n  - If the above explanation resolves the issue, well and good. Whether i=\r\nt does or doesn&#39;t, this is my last mail on this topic because I had said al=\r\nl I had to in the first mail itself - whether you read it or missed it.\n  Y=\r\nou may read a detailed article on this topic that I will write as and when =\r\ntime allows me to do so.\n\n\n[ TO UTPALJI ]\n      - Am not a jnani.\n        B=\r\nut there are Jnanis, who know that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist.\n        That i=\r\ns why there is a significant departure.\n\n[ TO NARASIMHA ]\n\n&gt; So you are acc=\r\nepting that there as &quot;I-ness of manas&quot; and &quot;I-ness of &gt; chitta&quot;. I-ness=3Da=\r\nham-kaara.\n\n   There was never a time that I didn&#39;t, and I have no control =\r\nover what meaning you derive from my words.\n\n&gt; I still think this is a case=\r\n of a Pascal language programmer \n&gt; unfamiliar with C language misunderstan=\r\nding some software written \n&gt; in C language and passing comments. But unfor=\r\ntunately that \n&gt; programmer seems to be hasty in using labels like &quot;flawed&quot;=\r\n, \n&gt; &quot;incorrect&quot;, &quot;incoherent&quot; etc about other programmers whose \n&gt; languag=\r\ne he is unable to understand.\n\n   The power of mind needs no language to ex=\r\npress itself...If a Programmer just understands this much, he will become t=\r\nhe Architect!\n   Also, while a Programmer always assumes that every other p=\r\nerson he encounters is a Programmer, an Architect knows that every other pe=\r\nrson is an Architect in making.

My comments on that is:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power=\r\n to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soul=\r\n is the only Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derive=\r\nd existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not co=\r\nntrol each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic=\r\n-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astra=\r\nl-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sen=\r\nsory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas=\r\n co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attribu=\r\ntes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego pri=\r\nnciple!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical=\r\n body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible perso=\r\nn&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great p=\r\nerson&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with t=\r\nhe criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical b=\r\nody and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from dis=\r\ntance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consc=\r\niousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the c=\r\naller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to mor=\r\ne than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. On=\r\ne may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may =\r\nthink of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a differe=\r\nnt body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that=\r\n so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away=\r\n from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in=\r\n a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You=\r\nr idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable=\r\n. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Als=\r\no, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because t=\r\nhey do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an =\r\nI-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have tha=\r\nt I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, th=\r\ne 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with each othe=\r\nr, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not.=\r\n For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various pas=\r\nt experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what =\r\nto do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes =\r\nthem do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas tol=\r\nd my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point =\r\nabout &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. =\r\nThe sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the s=\r\nensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualiz=\r\ned consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each =\r\nother in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be con=\r\ntrols.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mai=\r\nl didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details. Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.

You=\r\nr understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the =\r\nidea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational or causal body, but Aha=\r\nmkara must be overcome only in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or =\r\nCausal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to f=\r\night with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara=\r\n/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...th=\r\ney are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There i=\r\ns a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul=\r\n and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a=\r\n Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is n=\r\not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the=\r\n idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individua=\r\nlity of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;W=\r\nhat exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, bein=\r\ng one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither contr=\r\nols the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without =\r\nrequiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always =\r\ninterfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of li=\r\nfe-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of caus=\r\nal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to =\r\neach other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-=\r\nness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas,=\r\n their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; i=\r\nn any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with =\r\nsharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because =\r\nthey didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i=\r\nndividualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical=\r\n-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t ap=\r\nply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can al=\r\nways pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;t=\r\nhe very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bo=\r\ndied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied b=\r\neing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness=\r\n as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A =\r\nCausal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very =\r\nbasis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that i=\r\nndividuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is why it is n=\r\not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates i=\r\nn the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with thei=\r\nr finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their physic=\r\nal-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni diges=\r\nts the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would =\r\nrequire them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is m=\r\nine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, how=\r\never, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the =\r\nManas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the othe=\r\nr hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out the=\r\nir Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas=\r\n, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego =\r\nor I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and =\r\nremain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of=\r\n Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal bod=\r\ny is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Ch=\r\nitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Act=\r\nion, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 c=\r\nhemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical b=\r\nody expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising i=\r\nt go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole =\r\nin the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituen=\r\nt ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging ide=\r\na for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the ca=\r\nusal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibr=\r\nations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitt=\r\na with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi bei=\r\nng another variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the ot=\r\nher 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain fre=\r\nedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the=\r\n Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the pa=\r\nst incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have =\r\nany inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a con=\r\ntainer containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down.=\r\n Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, in=\r\ncluding those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to =\r\nthe Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - =\r\nTamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-p=\r\nerceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras =\r\nit stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual im=\r\npressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the =\r\nSoul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), t=\r\nhus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -=\r\n6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of=\r\n seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since ast=\r\nral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, =\r\ntaste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does=\r\n not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. S=\r\nimilarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness i=\r\ns associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karm=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-co=\r\nnsciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autob=\r\niography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only t=\r\nhose beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Ast=\r\nral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing=\r\n to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same=\r\n manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashik=\r\nara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to th=\r\nese who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen or heard, and=\r\n which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has com=\r\nmented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This =\r\nis to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and =\r\nworking out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irod=\r\nhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called=\r\n &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring t=\r\nhe consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwi=\r\nse as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mix=\r\ning up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is no=\r\nt limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal body =\r\nas well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. =\r\nOut of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and =\r\nahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) an=\r\nd remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls mana=\r\ns and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs =\r\nor buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observa=\r\ntions of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various ob=\r\nservations or retrieves previously stored observations, they are all guided=\r\n by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers =\r\nof one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads =\r\nand various scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousness in=\r\nto various groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five =\r\npraanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seve=\r\nn chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire in=\r\ndividualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana=\r\n means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by =\r\nthe path of contemplation and discrimination.
