Put another way, this basically means &quot;go with the\nflow&quot; (this is a mental state of mind, and doesn&#39;t imply a lack of effort).\n\nThis &quot;go with the [divine] flow&quot; vaasanaa-taanavam is the gist of the\nspiritual path.\n\nObjectively, it&#39;s difficult to talk about the creation of the world or how\nwe got here. But, I think we can all agree that vaasanaa-taanavam is good\nfrom any perspective. Our Rishis have described different things in the\nland of vaasanaa-taanavam. But, who knows if their words have been handed\ndown without corruption, and if we are correctly interpreting their words\n...\n\nHow do we reach this vaasanaa-taavanam? Some brave souls can get there by\nthemselves, by sheer willpower. They may not use any mantras, or believe in\nany concept of ishwara. If you try to follow this path, you&#39;ll quickly see\nthe problem with this type of sadhana.\n\nThe rest of us use mantra and tantra. These are paths to certain mental\nstates, which also help with vaasanaa-taanavam. Perhaps they existed from\nthe beginning of time, or perhaps certain Rishis visualized some of these\npaths after creation. They are a collection of shakti ... each mantra holds\nthe combined mental focus of every rishi and normal being that has focused\ntheir mental shakti on the mantras. Over time, as millions of sadhakas\nprojected their mental focus on these mantras, their mental shakti was\nadded to the mantra. Techniques like mantra and tantra may be true in an\nabsolute sense, or they may be therapeutic myths. In either case, those who\nhave gone before us (in previous eons and in the current generation) have\ntold us that these techniques work. So, we use them.\n\nYou are correct ... you can&#39;t have bhakti for something until you\nexperience it. So, what are we all doing? Following the age old technique\n-- &quot;fake it until you make it&quot;. This is why, in the sankalpa, many bhaktas\nadd the following words &quot;achanchala-niShkapaTa-bhakti-siddhyartham&quot; ...\nthey ask for the generation of unwavering, guileless bhakti. It isn&#39;t easy.\n\nThe rishis took the divine light and gave it to us in digestible forms. In\nessence, they have given us a box of matches. We are all babies with no\ncontrol over our limbs. We flail all over the place while trying to light\nthe match. We try our best not to be disheartened when nothing happens, and\nwe try not to get distracted by the sparks and smoke of failed attempts.\nOnce the match is lit ... well, someone who has lit their match can talk\nabout it :-)\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jul 19, 2013 at 11:45 AM, vernman_1976 &lt;vernman1976@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; does anyone know...who what and why we are her???.....so far I guess most\n&gt; of us are going with the idea that some kind of primordial consciousness\n&gt; expressed duality....and projected ...created...or manifested what we know\n&gt; of as reality....and we presume a spark of it is us...so to speak....and it\n&gt; goes through a long process to merge back with the whole...and its like the\n&gt; journey never took place.....call it the cosmic dream if u will...\n&gt;\n&gt; so we conceive of duality as shiva and or sakthi..or yin and yang if u\n&gt; will....and at a certain moment in our existence...we feel some kind of\n&gt; urge to transcend.....and we try all methods to get there....\n&gt;\n&gt; now all I know is.....something exists...I cant say within or without\n&gt; me...I don&#39;t know even what me denotes..there is a body....and what could\n&gt; be labelled a mind....something that proceses thoughts and emotions...but\n&gt; all if it is running bye itself....there doesn&#39;t seem to be an entity or\n&gt; what not in charge.....observe closely and u will get what I,m saying.......\n&gt;\n&gt; now I guess the question is...what is the gist of this so called spiritual\n&gt; path???......could it not be that like snowflakes of nature...each one of\n&gt; us is no more than a momentary expression of consciousness?....why do we\n&gt; assume reincarnation to be true???\n&gt;\n&gt; to whom do we worship???and what exactly does worship mean???and who is\n&gt; doing the worship?.....\n&gt;\n&gt; repeating some mystical mantra or name of something that obviously cant be\n&gt; encapsulated in sound is considered by many to be spirituality..when\n&gt; obviously the mind that is repeating and running around at the same time is\n&gt; both one and the same...the whole process seems to me like a mind\n&gt; game....and we feel good about theses games....like we have done something\n&gt; to get 1 step closer to divinity..can we get closer????isn&#39;t the cesspool\n&gt; of sludge we make in the morning just as divine....and all the time in the\n&gt; colon with us???....those who get the last statement would get it...the\n&gt; rest plse ignore...\n&gt;\n&gt; and how come we have this idea that by japa,ing a gazillion times some\n&gt; sari clad woman on a tiger is going to appear in a vision or in front of us\n&gt; and make our existence free of suffering..and basically make everything\n&gt; O.K.?....\n&gt;\n&gt; too many tamil movies perhaps?...u can also substitute the sari clad woman\n&gt; for a man in blue with 4 arms...or a young stud on a peacock...ur\n&gt; preference....\n&gt;\n&gt; and all for what?most of us are truly at the end of the day motivated by\n&gt; some kind of gain...touch ur heart and tell me it is not so???no carrot in\n&gt; front of the donkey it wont move......\n&gt;\n&gt; tell me honestly....how can u have love for something u don&#39;t know and\n&gt; have not experienced in any way???your bakthi is probably something u\n&gt; conjured up in ur head....and at best....an expression of ur existantial\n&gt; longings....\n&gt;\n&gt; we are all lonely and miserable at heart....and add to that the suffering\n&gt; of being human.....\n&gt;\n&gt; so shall end this rant...with the question I began with....what the f is\n&gt; going on guys???who what and where r\n&gt; we????????????????????????????????????that is the question isn&#39;t it....and\n&gt; maybe also why......the day we stop asking,and accept someone elses idea as\n&gt; truth.....we stopped seeking.\n&gt;\n&gt; the search isn&#39;t over till the fat cosmic lady sings........god\n&gt; bless.......whatever that means..............\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--089e013d13f41ca94204e1e3b1f4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nnamaste,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nice mail :-)=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For w=\r\nhat it&#39;s worth, here are some foolish words ...=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Yoga Vasishtha describes moksha as vaasanaa-taanavam (reducing the fie=\r\nld of mental impressions).
