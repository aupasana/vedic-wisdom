Upanayanam means additional\neye. =\r\nThey say that the eye must be opened and for that purpose they give\ntrainin=\r\ng in pranayamam (breath control). After that they give Brahmopadesam\n(Initi=\r\nating about Brahman), give the boy a begging bowl and tell him to go\nabout =\r\nbegging. The first bhiksha is mathru (mother=92s). When the father gives\nBr=\r\nahmopadesam, the mother gives three handfuls of bhiksha (rice) to enable\nth=\r\ne young boy to do manana (repeat inwardly), the upadesa given by the\nfather=\r\n. He is expected to fill his stomach by begging, stay in the Guru=92s\nhouse=\r\n for training and realise his self by opening the jnana netram. That is\nthe=\r\n significance of Upanayanam. Forgetting all that, what is done at present\ni=\r\ns this: pranayamam has come to mean just closing the nose with the fingers\n=\r\nand pretending to control the breath; Brahmopadesam means just to cover bot=\r\nh\nthe father and the son with a new dhoti when the father whispers somethin=\r\ng\nin the ear of the son; bhiksha means just filling up the begging bowl wit=\r\nh\nmoney. What could they preach to the boy when the father who gives the\nup=\r\nadesa and the priest who gets this done,do not know the real significance\no=\r\nf Upanayanam? Not only that. After receiving the required knowledge by\nstay=\r\ning with the Guru for a sufficiently long time, the Guru used to send\nthe b=\r\noy to his parents to find out whether his mind would get caught in\nworldly =\r\naffairs or turn towards sannyasa. After staying for some time in\ntheir own =\r\nhomes, the boys used to start on a pilgrimage to Banaras, devoid\nof worldly=\r\n desires and with a view to renouncing them completely. At that\ntime, paren=\r\nts having girls of marriageable age dissuade the boys from going\nto Banaras=\r\n and offer them their daughters in marriage. Those that are\nstrongly inclin=\r\ned towards renunciation would go without caring for the\noffers of marriage =\r\nand those that are otherwise, return home and accept the\noffer of marriage.=\r\n All that is forgotten now. Pilgrimage to Banaras at\npresent means the youn=\r\ng man puts on a silver-lined silk dhoti, his eyes are\ncoloured black, his f=\r\norehead bears a caste mark, his feet are ornamented\nwith yellow and red pas=\r\nte, his body is smeared with sandal-paste, his neck\nis adorned with flower =\r\ngarlands, an umbrella is spread over his head and\nwooden sandals are worn o=\r\nn his feet and he walks on stylishly to the\naccompaniment of music. When th=\r\ne girl=92s brother comes and offers his sister\nin marriage and presses him =\r\nto accept the offer, he says, =93I want a wrist\nwatch.
