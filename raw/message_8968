Rao&quot;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The=\r\n verbal root &quot;pU&quot; means &quot;to purify&quot;. The expression &quot;pavamAna sUktam&quot; means=\r\n &quot;purificatory hymn&quot;.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; There are two Pavamana sooktas - one RigVedic=\r\n and one YajurVedic.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The longer version Jagmohan ji referred to is the RigVedic versio=\r\nn mentioned by Sanjay ji below. At the beginning of 9th mandala of RigVeda,=\r\n you will find many hymns for &quot;pavamAna soma&quot;. They are all clubbed togethe=\r\nr as &quot;pavamAna sUktam&quot;.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Though some people seem to think that this =\r\nis a prayer for Lord Hanuman, I am not so sure. Because wind and fire purif=\r\ny (by moving away dirt or by burning it), two of the meanings of &quot;pavamAna&quot;=\r\n are wind and fire. Because Hanuman is a son of the wind god, he is called =\r\n&quot;pavamAna suta&quot;. So some people may have guessed that these hymns are for L=\r\nord Hanuman.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n=\r\n&gt; In any case, the deity mentioned in RigVeda itself is &quot;pavamAna soma&quot;. So=\r\nma is the celestial substance, flow of which causes pure and uninterrupted =\r\nbliss. It is not alcohol or a special herb or a special brew made with spec=\r\nial herbs, as speculated by some with a conditioning that puts heavy stress=\r\n on physical matter. Soma is a substance of the inner subtle (and not physi=\r\ncal) body.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once told drunkard thespian Giri=\r\nsh that Hari&#39;s name gave him a much greater intoxication than any wine coul=\r\nd. When mind overcomes its fascination for irrelevant and trivial things su=\r\nrrounding us and focuses on god, the divine intoxication that occurs in suc=\r\nh a mind is due to the flow of &quot;soma&quot;. Soma is basically a devotee&#39;s awaren=\r\ness of the divine that makes consciousness forget other things and gives bl=\r\niss.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This sookta is for the purificatory aspect of that soma. Swami=\r\n Dayananda Saraswati of Arya Samaj said in his Hindi commentary (http://www=\r\n.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/rugveda.htm) that these hymns are for &quot;so=\r\numya svabhAv paramAtmA&quot;, i.e. gentle natured supreme Lord. That is a far be=\r\ntter interpretation than saying it is for Lord Hanuman, but a more correct =\r\ninterpretation would be that these hymns are for the purificatory aspects o=\r\nf a devotee&#39;s awareness of divine.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; As we contemplate god (as a being in the sky with=\r\n so and so great qualities and abilities or as a concept that expresses in =\r\nall people and beings around us as so and so great qualities or abilities),=\r\n taking mind away from trivial aspects of this cosmos that have a crippling=\r\n effect on mind, mind will be intoxicated with divine bliss. That divine bl=\r\niss is very potent and purifies our consciousness further and that process =\r\nis described in these hymns.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; For example, take RV 9.1.1-2: &quot;svAdiShThayA madiShThayA=\r\n pavasva soma dhArayA. indrAya pAtave sutaH.. rakShohA vishvacarShaNirabhi =\r\nyonimayohatam. druNA sadhasthamAsadat..&quot;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Translation: &quot;O Soma (soma=\r\n)! Purify (pavasva) by delicious (svAdiShThayA) and intoxicating (madiShTha=\r\nyA) stream (dhArayA). This extraction (sutaH) is for sharpening the inner s=\r\nenses (indrAya pAtave) . Destroyer of demonic qualities (rakShohA), seer of=\r\n the entire cosmos (vishvacarShaNiH), quickly (druNA) reached (Asadat) the =\r\nsingle source of all (abhiyonim), a wretched manifestation (ayohatam) and t=\r\nhe one that is common to all (sadhastham)&quot;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; [Note: The word ayohatam=\r\n literally means heated and beaten iron, i.e. a specific shape made with ir=\r\non (as opposed to gold). It stands for a wretched being.]\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Basically=\r\n, a mind intoxicated with the bliss of the awareness of divine, has sharpen=\r\ned inner senses and sees divine essence permeating entire cosmos.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Soma is obviously no=\r\nt talking about intoxication coming from alcohol or any physical substances=\r\n as speculated by some misguided commentators, but the divine intoxication =\r\nas Ramakrishna called. Soma is the awareness of divine in a devotee&#39;s mind.=\r\n It is indeed intoxicating and purifying. In Yogic terminology, it is relat=\r\ned to Ida nadi of subtle body, i.e. lunar channel of feeling (soma also mea=\r\nns Moon). When devoted awareness of divine flows in the channel of feeling,=\r\n it gives bliss, nourishes and purifies one. THAT process is described in d=\r\netail in this set of hymns.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; In general, most commentaries on Veda are quite superficia=\r\nl. The one by Swami Dayananda Saraswati (http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/r=\r\nigvedabook.htm) is somewhat reasonable. But the most intelligent commentary=\r\n we have is the one by Sri Aurobindo (&quot;Secret of Veda&quot;). Though he did not =\r\ncomment on all hymns and covered just a few, he left enough food for though=\r\nt for us to proceed on our own.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The YajurVedic pavamAna sUktam is short and known as=\r\n \n&gt; puNyAhavAchanam. It is the short one starting with &quot;hiraNya varNAH \n&gt; s=\r\nhucayaH&quot; as Jagmohan ji mentioned. It is used for purificatory purposes\n&gt;  =\r\nat temples and also for purifying a kalasha (water pot) before any \n&gt; major=\r\n ritual in which a deity is invoked in kalasha. For example, I \n&gt; chant it =\r\nat the end of Varuna pooja at the beginning of our monthly \n&gt; Satya Narayan=\r\na pooja on Full Moon nights. It basically requests the \n&gt; essence of variou=\r\ns deities, rishis and celestial beings to purify the \n&gt; kalasha.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; On Sat, Jan 19, 2013 =\r\nat 8:03 AM, Sanjay Rao wrote:\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Pavamana Sukta, a powerful hymn for L=\r\nord Hanuman/Vayu, occurs in the Rig Veda Mandala 9 (1 to 67).=A0 \n&gt; You can=\r\n find the text starting at this link=A0 http://sanskritweb.net/rigveda/rv09=\r\n-001.pdf=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The Punyavahachanam mantras you mention below are used=\r\n for purificatory purposes. \n&gt; Sanjay \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________=\r\n_______\n&gt; \n&gt; From: jagmohan_nanaware  \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n=\r\n&gt; Sent: Friday, January 18, 2013 9:09 PM \n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Questio=\r\nns regarding Pavamana Suktam... \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste, \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a confusion reg=\r\narding Pavamana Sukta.
