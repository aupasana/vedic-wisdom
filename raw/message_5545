In or around 1955 A jagadgur ShankarAcArya i=\r\ns guest at my father&#39;s elder brother&#39;s house in Marredpally. I can remember=\r\n he drove up in a huge car that had no number plate but a big &quot;sha~gku&quot; - W=\r\ne kids were supposed to take off our shits - and receive his blessings. The=\r\nre were two queues - one for girls most of them wearing bright new silk &quot;pa=\r\nTTu&quot; dresses. One of the sha~gkarAcarya&#39;s goons come up and asked  one litt=\r\nle Punjabi girl  that was our neighbour age about about 10 or 11 that was w=\r\nearing shalwar kameez to go out of the line. And the poor girl was in tears=\r\n. I asked my elder brother (cousin) what was happening - he said - &quot;I think=\r\n he thinks she is Muslim or God knows what&quot; I slipped way from the line unn=\r\noticed and went over to a Billiard Saloon.\n\n2. A couple of years later I ma=\r\nde peace with Adi sha~gkarAcArya on a trip to Kedarnath with my Gujarati cl=\r\nass mate from a business family and My father - The three of us walked abou=\r\nt 45 miles up and down stopiing at different &quot;chaTTis&quot; and cooking our own.=\r\n On reaching kedarnath, I told him about the incident of the punjabi dress.=\r\n He in his typical tone said - &quot;dandho ni bAt ce .. we have come so far ...=\r\n. anybody that has re built a shiva temple and that too bearing your name c=\r\nannot be all that bad&quot; We both had a laugh. My father asked us whether we w=\r\nanted to have a dip in the river in biting cold... &quot;both of us had one voic=\r\ne ... are you joking&quot;\n\n3, Years later a &quot;shankarAcarya&quot; gets arrested and c=\r\nharged with murder. My heart goes out to him The most surprising thing neit=\r\nher his followers nor the brave community whimper. \n\n4. 2 of my labour boys=\r\n 18 and 19 were from Nalgonda - They were working on daily wages doing hard=\r\n work. They told me they were H.Sc. passed - I said &quot;ruZu - proof&quot; In a mat=\r\nter of a week they brought their certificates  - Both of them had marks tha=\r\nt I never even imagined was possible. Immediately - we started working on &quot;=\r\ndemarcations&quot;, &quot;contour survey&quot; and plants inventory of our place - and all=\r\n mapped on graph paper note books. and graph sheets. How do you draw a perf=\r\nect square on the ground? Simple you might think all sides must be equal. T=\r\nry it for a 10,000 sq yard area. This is where my young friends were taught=\r\n the vedic wisdom that the sides don&#39;t matter at all. It is the diagnols th=\r\nat are important and that can be obtained by formula - discovere centuries =\r\nbefor in India what we are dished out in schools.\n\nNext on their own money =\r\n- I dont believe in donations of any sort. They were told , I was dismissin=\r\ng them - Unless they went after work to a nearby computer training class an=\r\nd put all our data in spreadsheets Excel - and email it to me in one month =\r\nthey can continue to lift stones elsewhere. They did all sorts of &quot;nAtak&quot; i=\r\nn their typical teenage way - They took 2- 1/2 months shedding crocodile te=\r\nars sometimes. Next, I dismissed them - I had been pestering an IAS officer=\r\n that I want an evaluation of these two boys. I was asked whether  they wer=\r\ne my relatives... I didn&#39;t answer.. They had an appointment fixed and the o=\r\nfficer said (1) First time warning (2) Next time suspension (3) Next time j=\r\nail - understood. They nodded their heads. I have not seen these boys again=\r\n although they try to meet me sometime. \n\nSo, lengths and breadths and dept=\r\nhs - you better save for people that are absolute unhygienic morons getting=\r\n wounds and infections and worms when right next door is a primary health c=\r\nentre.\n\n4. One of my favourite movies is Rambo - I will not pollute a Vaidi=\r\nka Wisdom group with the true story of how the Adi sha~gkara is supposed to=\r\n have obtain in depth knowledge of the kAma shAstra.\n\nreagrds\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; n=\r\namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; You wrote earlier: &quot;With computer facilities - it is a likel=\r\ny that what people took 12 years in Shankara&#39;s times can be learnt by kids =\r\nin 3 months&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You may be able to create in 3 months overconfident n=\r\newbies who can cut & paste reams of material from the computer and try to c=\r\nonnect the dots with guesswork, but you cannot create true scholars.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I was once taking to someone who is a well-qualified sanskrit scholar\n&gt; a=\r\nnd poet. He related the following incident that took place between\n&gt; his co=\r\n-student (scholar-1) and his teacher (scholar-2) who is a great\n&gt; pandita.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; scholar-1 -- There are so many Panditas these days, but people keep\n&gt; =\r\ntalking about the scholarship of some particular Pandit (scholar-3).\n&gt; Is t=\r\nhere really such a vast difference?\n&gt; \n&gt; scholar-2 -- It is difficult to se=\r\ne the difference, unless you\n&gt; yourself have deep scholarship. Let me descr=\r\nibe this by way of\n&gt; example. Though you yourself are well-qualified, you s=\r\nee the\n&gt; difference between us. It is like you are seated at the base of th=\r\ne\n&gt; himalayas, and I am seated at the top. Well, with this Pandita\n&gt; (schol=\r\nar-3), I feel the same way. I am seated at the base of the\n&gt; himalayas, and=\r\n he is seated on top. But, for the average person, or\n&gt; even a mere scholar=\r\n, it is almost impossible to tell the difference.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many learn=\r\ned people who have access to a wide range of books\n&gt; and materials. They co=\r\nncentrate on breadth, and are limited to\n&gt; scratching the surface. A true s=\r\ncholar on the other hand, looks for\n&gt; depth. It isn&#39;t just the sheer amount=\r\n of material that they have\n&gt; studied -- they have internalized the materia=\r\nl to such an extent that\n&gt; they speak it with every breath. Their way of th=\r\ninking changes, and\n&gt; their speech is pramANam.\n&gt; \n&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 =\r\n=A0ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
