Ho=\r\nwever, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept =\r\nit hence forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He=\r\n says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generate=\r\nd (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.\n&gt; Although, it may see=\r\nm easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult =\r\nto achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer o=\r\nur queries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important information about Vimalananda which I came to kn=\r\now only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a sing=\r\nle day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day=\r\n of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; fre=\r\nquently and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you =\r\npointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exa=\r\nct thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thin=\r\ng. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he=\r\n says and not try to do what he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems=\r\n sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts fu=\r\nrther (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth c=\r\nan be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or =\r\nVimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we=\r\n tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high lev=\r\nel of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many things i=\r\nn the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to u=\r\nniversal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal g=\r\nnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate=\r\n meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew =\r\nwhat they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each a=\r\nnd every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background =\r\nbehind their each action and\n&gt;  moreover their self identification is missi=\r\nng from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to acc=\r\nomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt;=\r\n Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very=\r\n different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him =\r\nwhich can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind=\r\n him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for othe=\r\nrs, a kind of food intake is extremely important.\n&gt; If Vivekananda ate meat=\r\n during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is no=\r\nt possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of=\r\n that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst =\r\nwesterners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowl=\r\ny try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable h=\r\nabits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some bala=\r\nnced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible =\r\nthat he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by co=\r\nnsuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for tha=\r\nt but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda,=\r\n His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from d=\r\nrowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even plann=\r\ned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n&gt;  years actually met Swami in US=\r\nA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water an=\r\nd when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a mom=\r\nents thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later =\r\nand will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of P=\r\naramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Sil=\r\nver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew=\r\n&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us ar=\r\ne NOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as se=\r\nlf deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang=\r\n Swami and such masters and justify our completely self identified and utte=\r\nrly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts=\r\n!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not advisable f=\r\nor anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekan=\r\nanda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many =\r\ndays on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relished it.

Do they ever think of the agony a h=\r\nen goes through when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, t=\r\nhe embodiment of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when s=\r\nhe sees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own bod=\r\ny and nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?\n&gt; &gt; D=\r\no these so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to moth=\r\ner cow?
