Fantast=\r\nic rendition.\nIf Thakur ji sang/heard this, coupled with his devotion, he w=\r\nould be\nlost in mahabhava samadhi in seconds.

Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo\n\nTo Priyank  Mahara=\r\nj,\n\nA little pointer,\n&quot;they do sadhana for all gods&quot;\nFor all forms sounds b=\r\netter, and I always prefer to do for one form\nfirst, paagal kutton ki tarah=\r\n till that form runs after the devotee to\nperform worship because now he/sh=\r\ne can&#39;t afford to be away from the\ndevotee. It becomes a play, a play of th=\r\nat only those two lovers can\nunderstand.\n\nA little point about love these d=\r\nays, One day a man who is in love with\nthe sun, was doing homam on , a sund=\r\nay afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\nopen field with no shade, in a temperatur=\r\ne of 47 degree centigrades and\nwas sweating profusely as expected. He was g=\r\netting irritated with the\nsweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun aske=\r\nd him, bete do you want\nme to hide so that you are comfortable???\nThe man l=\r\nooked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\nwe all can&#39;t stand him =\r\nin summers, I want him to  go away this very\nmoment, just because my body i=\r\ns trying to cool itself down with sweat.\nAll of us look out for him in the =\r\nwinters calling him, coming out to\nsunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse hi=\r\nm, we wish to drive him away, we\ndon&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fuc=\r\nking love??? And to all that\nlook at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaj=\r\ni&quot; ,the man said.\n\nThe man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun f=\r\norgave him\nbecause after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could s=\r\nay back\n&quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up t=\r\no 48.\n(That last line was a joke.)\n\nIn winters we all sing songs of loving =\r\nthe sun, yet in summers we hate\nhim, that is not love, its mere usage, and =\r\nsince that orb is so\nmagnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all =\r\nbecause of him\nthere is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads t=\r\no all of us\nbreathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet=\r\n won&#39;t\nexist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\nHell=\r\n, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n\nYet wh=\r\nat do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\nbirths comb=\r\nined.\nI am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And\nt=\r\nhere are quite a few.\n\nThese days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t re=\r\nspond favorably,\nautomatically she is a whore for that man. Just because sh=\r\ne didn&#39;t give\nthe man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n\nI&#39;ll t=\r\nell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\nlove wit=\r\nh a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\nhim, infac=\r\nt is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\nactually care( Do=\r\nn&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\ndon&#39;t know) He is ridi=\r\nculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\nI asked him if you so lo=\r\nve her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\nWell, he slapped me. He told me y=\r\nou forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\nmother will decide her daughter - in- l=\r\naw, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\nbata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who =\r\nchahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\nchahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is=\r\n far more insane than\nquite a lot of people I have met.\n\nThen he went on, t=\r\nhat who told you that you are sure to get the one you\nlove????\nYou love the=\r\nn claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\nslap!!\nYou people lo=\r\nve, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\nis to look out f=\r\nor her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\nI ask, i am screwed=\r\n, because I know it will be delivered, but then\nwhat&#39;s the fun in that, and=\r\n when did i become big enough to know whats\nbest for me???? yeh toh meri ma=\r\na ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\nshould be so intense, that god he=\r\nrself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\nson, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather p=\r\nrefer that she (god) tells me first\n&quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if=\r\n I have her, i already have that\ngirl, who is eventually her.\nTo top it all=\r\n he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then\nhe say anything =\r\nto his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\nhave surrendered, the=\r\nn it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\nmean you sit on your ass wa=\r\nrming it up and saying what do I need to do,\neverything god will do, kyun b=\r\nhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\nhui hai??\n\nSurrender is you do your=\r\n duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\ngod&#39;s, the results are &quot;good=\r\n&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\nIf you actually manage to surren=\r\nder, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\ncounselor, believe you me. Its a bl=\r\nissful life post the surrender, be it\nin a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet=\r\n house, one and the same thing.\n\nOne of the greatest men, the greatest, eve=\r\nr to grace this planet, has\nalways maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will brea=\r\nk his tail off by wagging\nwhen he sees his master, that is devotion and lov=\r\ne. He doesn&#39;t ask the\nmaster , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. Hi=\r\ns master brings,\ndoggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail i=\r\ns wagging,\ndoggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthou=\r\nght.\n\nEquate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\nWe=\r\n are never happy with what the master brings, because we were\nexpecting but=\r\nter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n\n(Haanji madame waale hero, phir c=\r\nhant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\nlo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n\nWe a=\r\nctually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\nthen w=\r\ne claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\nyeah rig=\r\nht!!\nIf you only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????=\r\n\nWe are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\nth=\r\nat masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\nblanket, =\r\nthat milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\nwag at his th=\r\nought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\nabout the great d=\r\nogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\nnope. That is mental =\r\nmasturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n\nSir, if you become dog&#39;s dog=\r\n, and then you walk on the left handed path,\noye hoye sir, the ethereal wor=\r\nld will salute you. They do to Mr Rao&#39;s\nmentor.\n\nMaalik, main shehennshaye =\r\n- e - befkuf aap jaise sant mahagyaani logon\nke kya jawaab doonga, mujhe ku=\r\nch nahin aata, main gadha hoon aur sada\nrahoonga. It all my teacher aka my =\r\nbaapji aka my god aka my mother aka\nmy father aka my universe, who is respo=\r\nnsible for all that you perceive\nabout me. i am useless, its all my mother.=\r\n\n\nIf anyone has any questions, ask god. Ask sincerely answers will be\nprovi=\r\nded. Ask god when you invite him/her.it in the fire, baaten karo\nunse, woh =\r\nbare kamaal ki cheez hain, bahut hi mast, unke peeche par\njaao, pagal kutte=\r\n ki tarah jo ki pyjama phaar ke hi dum leta hain, aur\nphir dekho ki kya hot=\r\na hai.\n\n\nAsk Mr Rao, ask Rajarshi, ask guys who are actually doing worship,=\r\n me\ntoh is busy gawking at beautiful girls.\n\nYaar type karke, aur baith bai=\r\nth ke, dard ho gaya hain pichware mein,\naur main yeh soch raha hoon ki agar=\r\n itna effort bhagwaan ke baare mein\nsochne mein lagayaa hota, toh behtar ho=\r\nta.

Listen around 5 minutes in,&n=\r\nbsp; a man who is properly &quot;cooked&quot; in &quot;god&#39;s ghee&quot; cannot remain in the ri=\r\nght senses after that=85=85=85=85 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Oh Bhaisaab,=\r\n you there, haanji chikni chameli, bhai chant kar lo parte -&nbsp; parte, t=\r\nime naa waste karo. Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Priyank&nbs=\r\np; Maharaj,&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A little pointer,&lt;br&gt;&quot;they do sadhana for all gods&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;For all forms sounds better, and I always prefer to do for one form firs=\r\nt, paagal kutton ki tarah till that form runs after the devotee to perform =\r\nworship because now he/she can&#39;t afford to be away from the devotee. It bec=\r\nomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can understand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A =\r\nlittle point about love these days, One day a man who is in love with the s=\r\nun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an open field=\r\n with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and was sweating =\r\nprofusely as expected. He was getting irritated with the sweat coming into =\r\nhis eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want me to hide so that y=\r\nou are comfortable???&lt;br&gt;The man looked down in shame upon himself and aske=\r\nd himself,&lt;br&gt;we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to&nbsp; go awa=\r\ny this very moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with=\r\n sweat. All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming out t=\r\no sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we =\r\ndon&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that look=\r\n at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The man =\r\nwas humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him because after al=\r\nl, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back &quot;shine on, I love &quot;=\r\nyou&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48. (That last line was a=\r\n joke.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summe=\r\nrs we hate him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so =\r\nmagnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him there =\r\nis photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us breathing=\r\n, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t exist, which l=\r\neads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.&lt;br&gt;Hell, he burns for us,=\r\n just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet what do most o=\r\nf us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our births combined.&lt;br&gt;I a=\r\nm talking about people outside of all this worship business. And there are =\r\nquite a few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respo=\r\nnd favorably, automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she d=\r\nidn&#39;t give the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;l=\r\nl tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in love =\r\nwith a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met him, in=\r\nfact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to actually care(=\r\n Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself don&#39;t know) He is r=\r\nidiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother, I asked him if you so=\r\n love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.&lt;br&gt;Well, he slapped me. He tol=\r\nd me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My mother will decide her daughter -=\r\n in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujh=\r\ne who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this =\r\nguy is far more insane than quite a lot of people I have met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then h=\r\ne went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you love????&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another slap!=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from Go=\r\nd is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment I=\r\n ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but then what&#39;s th=\r\ne fun in that, and when did i become big enough to know whats best for me??=\r\n?? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.&nbsp; Rather my love should be =\r\nso intense, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my son, deserve =\r\nher.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first &quot;You , my son, d=\r\neserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that girl, who is eventu=\r\nally her.&lt;br&gt;To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how=\r\n can then he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If=\r\n you have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t m=\r\nean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I need to do, ever=\r\nything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari hui hai??=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Surrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they =\r\nare god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between. =\r\nIf you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a cou=\r\nnselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it in a =\r\njhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One =\r\nof the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has always ma=\r\nintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging when he see=\r\ns his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the master , to bri=\r\nng him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings, doggy is happy, his =\r\nmaster doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging, doggy is happy. Because do=\r\nggy wants master, food is an afterthought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Equate doggy with us , an=\r\nd master with god, and what do we do?????&lt;br&gt;We are never happy with what t=\r\nhe master brings, because we were expecting butter chicken, who saala leke =\r\naaya paneer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, b=\r\nhai kar lo, kar lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We actually don&#39;t wa=\r\nnt the master , we subconsciously want the food, and then we claim to other=\r\ns , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him, yeah right!!&lt;br&gt;If you o=\r\nnly want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????&lt;br&gt;We are se=\r\nlfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so that masterj=\r\ni brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that blanket, that milk,=\r\n but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t wag at his thought. Tai=\r\nls of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read about the great dogs, and p=\r\nretend that we too are somewhere there, but nope. That is mental masturbati=\r\non, its an illusion just like porn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, an=\r\nd then you walk on the left handed path, oye hoye sir, the ethereal world w=\r\nill salute you. They do to Mr Rao&#39;s mentor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maalik, main shehennshay=\r\ne - e - befkuf aap jaise sant mahagyaani logon ke kya jawaab doonga, mujhe =\r\nkuch nahin aata, main gadha hoon aur sada rahoonga. It all my teacher aka m=\r\ny baapji aka my god aka my mother aka my father aka my universe, who is res=\r\nponsible for all that you perceive about me. i am useless, its all my mothe=\r\nr.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If anyone has any questions, ask god. Ask sincerely answers will =\r\nbe provided. Ask god when you invite him/her.it in the fire, baaten karo un=\r\nse, woh bare kamaal ki cheez hain, bahut hi mast, unke peeche par jaao, pag=\r\nal kutte ki tarah jo ki pyjama phaar ke hi dum leta hain, aur phir dekho ki=\r\n kya hota hai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nAsk Mr Rao, ask Rajarshi, ask guys who are actua=\r\nlly doing worship, me toh is busy gawking at beautiful girls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yaar t=\r\nype karke, aur baith baith ke, dard ho gaya hain pichware mein, aur main ye=\r\nh soch raha hoon ki agar itna effort bhagwaan ke baare mein sochne mein lag=\r\nayaa hota, toh behtar hota. Khair koi nahin ab aap(jo bhi par raha hain), j=\r\nitni der ho sake, bhagwaan ke saath bitao, bahut par liya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ja=\r\ni Shree Shenshah - e - Shamshaan!!!&lt;br&gt;Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. Just as I was posting this , ms jha has given me a nice kick in =\r\nthe face. Yay!! Feels nice Ms Jha, no actually there was no need for that l=\r\nong lecture, Jo aap samajh gayin hain us lecutre se, bhagwaan na karen ki k=\r\noi aur samjhe, mujhe aur jooten khane parenge, khair chhoro. Bhagwaan ke na=\r\nam japte japte woh bhi kha lenge. Madame aage se lecture nahin doonga, sorr=\r\ny.
