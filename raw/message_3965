I was born on fix date..so\n&gt; &gt; as i am going to die on any fix date onl=\r\ny.. it is all decided....\n&gt; &gt; Happiness, sorrows, success, praise, failures=\r\n everything about me\n&gt; &gt; is decided by god  well in advance.. it is like a =\r\nfilm.. my end\n&gt; &gt; is already decided.. but i amnot aware of this.. so Doing=\r\n homam\n&gt; &gt; will help me changing my end?  Whatever i am destined to get.. i=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; will get...\n&gt;  \n&gt; One can also say in the same vein: Do I have to go t=\r\no work to everyday and earn money for my family? Happiness, sorrows, succes=\r\ns, failure everything about me and my family is decided by god in advance. =\r\nIt is like a film. Whether I work or not, whatever god has decided will hap=\r\npen to my family. Whatever I and my family are destined to get, we will get=\r\n. Will my going to work or not going to work change things?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course=\r\n, one does not think that way. In fact, when one loses job, one tries hard =\r\nto find a new job so that one&#39;s family does not suffer. What happened to th=\r\ne logic that &quot;everything about me is decided by god well in advance&quot;?\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Well, from one reference frame, everything may have been pre-decided. But =\r\nyou, I and most people (including great yogis) do not have access to that r=\r\neference frame. From where you stand, you have a free will using which you =\r\ncan engage in actions. And you will later receive comparable reactions to t=\r\nhose actions. From where you stand, what actions you engage in is very impo=\r\nrtant and decides your future. Of course, at the end, you may have performe=\r\nd an action or skipped an action only because god had already decided so. B=\r\nut you do try to perform what you think is the best action for you, don&#39;t y=\r\nou? In the previous example where one lost a job, won&#39;t one look for a new =\r\njob?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Perhaps god has decided that one will not look for a job, sit at=\r\n home and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will not loo=\r\nk for a job, sit at home and yet something will happen and family will do f=\r\nine. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a job, but not get a jo=\r\nb and family will suffer. Perhaps god has decided that one will look for a =\r\njob, get a job and family will do fine.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is absolutely true that wh=\r\nichever of the above god willed will happen. Suppose you do not know it ahe=\r\nad and suppose you have a desired outcome (e.g. family not suffering) and w=\r\nant to maximize the chance (calculated based on what you know in your refer=\r\nence frame) that your desired outcome happens. Then, you use your logical a=\r\nnd intuitive minds to figure out the best action, in order to achieve the d=\r\nesired outcome. However, given that you don&#39;t know what god willed and what=\r\n will happen, you cannot convince yourself that your desired outcome WILL h=\r\nappen. So do not cry later if it doesn&#39;t. Do the best you can and be prepar=\r\ned for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Suppose you are trying to sail your boat in the ocean to a bank. Suppos=\r\ne a really heavy wind is blowing. You can leave it to the wind to take you =\r\nthere or you can row the boat actively. As wind changes your course, you co=\r\nnstantly re-evaluate how you should row and row the boat in such a way that=\r\n you finally reach the bank. Because wind is so heavy and sometimes overcom=\r\nes your rowing, you cannot say that your rowing is not needed. If you do no=\r\nt row well, wind may keep you going in circles within the ocean and you may=\r\n not reach the bank. You keep doing your best to row in the correct directi=\r\non. If wind took you in a wrong direction, you do not stop rowing and start=\r\n crying. Then wind may push you further in a wrong direction! Irrespective =\r\nof the outcome, the best strategy is to keep re-evaluating how to row and k=\r\neep rowing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you start rowing harder than before and yet wind is al=\r\nso blowing harder than before and you are not making progress, do not stop =\r\nrowing. If you do, you may go back further. Keep rowing. Remember that wind=\r\n does not blow the same way always!!! If you keep rowing, your time will co=\r\nme when your rowing will be productive. A time may also come when wind push=\r\nes you in the correct direction. So, just row row row your boat...\n&gt;  \n&gt; Po=\r\nnder on this metaphor a little.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The same lo=\r\ngic that applies to looking for a job above applies to doing homam and othe=\r\nr spiritual sadhana. Do they change your destiny? Yes, they do, in the same=\r\n way looking for a job actively when you are out of one does.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Perhaps=\r\n god has decided that one will not do sadhana and one will be stuck without=\r\n any progress. Perhaps god has decided that one will not do sadhana and yet=\r\n something will happen and one will make progress. Perhaps god has decided =\r\nthat one will do sadhana, but not make much progress in the next few years =\r\nor lives. Perhaps god has decided that one will do sadhana and make good pr=\r\nogress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is absolutely true that whichever of the above god willed =\r\nwill happen. Suppose you do not know it ahead and suppose you have a desire=\r\nd outcome (e.g. spiritual progress) and want to maximize the chance (calcul=\r\nated based on what you know in your reference frame) that your desired outc=\r\nome happens. Then, you use your logical and intuitive minds to figure out t=\r\nhe best action, in order to achieve the desired outcome. Do the best you ca=\r\nn and be prepared for any outcome as god decides the outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just as=\r\n searching for a job is a good strategy in general for one without a job an=\r\nd wanting family not to suffer, doing spiritual sadhana such as homam and j=\r\napam is a good strategy in general for one wanting to make spiritual progre=\r\nss.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I want to emphasize that spiritual prog=\r\nress does not mean giving up family and their welfare. Spiritual progress m=\r\neans doing whatever dharma you are doing now, but doing it better - doing i=\r\nt without attachment. Attachment to a result does not enable you to do bett=\r\ner actions. Constant anxiety regarding whether the desired result will happ=\r\nen or not will decrease one&#39;s focus and stop one from operating at one&#39;s be=\r\nst. Decide your actions based on a desired outcome, but with a complete rea=\r\nlization that the outcome may not be achieved even though your actions seem=\r\n at this point of time to be the best possible actions to maximize the chan=\r\nce of that outcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Such a karma yogi is always doing the best possib=\r\nle actions and wasting very little time on worrying about things not in one=\r\n&#39;s control. It is a very effective strategy materially as well as spiritual=\r\nly!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I also would like to ask whether Spir=\r\nitual progress requires\n&gt; &gt; sacrifice of material benefits & worldly pleasu=\r\nres ? Can&#39;t we have\n&gt; &gt; both?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Spiritual progress and material success=\r\n can co-exist. But spiritual progress and attachment to (and worrying about=\r\n) material success tend to pull one in different directions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not s=\r\nee world as a place where you seek pleasures or enjoyments, but see it main=\r\nly as a place where you *give* enjoyment to others. Focus on giving. You ma=\r\ny also *receive* pleasures in the bargain, but do not strive for it or calc=\r\nulate it or focus your mind on it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; What you give now is in your hands=\r\n. What you get now is in god&#39;s hands and is decided based on what you gave =\r\nearlier. What you give now decides what you will receive later. Spiritual p=\r\nrogress essentially means realizing this and focusing the mind, its thought=\r\ns and actions on giving to the world, rather than receiving. Even as you fo=\r\ncus your mind on giving, you will also receive some things. But exactly wha=\r\nt they are is based on what you gave in the past, which is water under the =\r\nbridge, and hence you have no control over it now. This is true irrespectiv=\r\ne of whether you are attached to what you receive or not.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just keep doing sadhana. My feeling is that you are one of t=\r\nhe people who will make very good progress in coming years. Rome is not bui=\r\nlt in a day.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My intuition strongly tells me that Vishnu homam is the =\r\nbest for you. If you want, you can keep doing occasional Chandi homam like =\r\nyou are doing now. But why don&#39;t you consider replacing the daily Ganapathi=\r\n homam with Vishnu homam? Learn Vishnu sahasra naama stotra and do homam wi=\r\nth it.
