Whatever you offer, try to envision that you are \n&gt;=\r\n surrendering your ego to god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Apart from Rajarshi&#39;s suggestion, one s=\r\nimple idea is to offer a small \n&gt; dry fruit dipped in ghee (e.g. dry date).=\r\n If you have a really small \n&gt; fire, then a raisin (kismis or kishmish) dip=\r\nped in ghee will be small \n&gt; enough and will burn well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Mar 24, 2012 at 1:08 PM, king_tanvir wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nam=\r\naste Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sharing your experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComp=\r\noseWindow(&#39;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt; \n&gt; , rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Tanvir ji,\n&gt; &gt; I sometimes use one full supari (ak=\r\nhanda supari - unbroken supari) as \n&gt; &gt; purnahuti.

Today is=\r\n the third day that I kept the coconut \n&gt; &gt; slices open to dry, but they st=\r\nill are not dry enough to burn.

So if I do the fire with twig or wood, the only \n&gt; &gt; time I =\r\nwould need coconut is for Purnahuti. Since dry coconut is not \n&gt; &gt; availabl=\r\ne now, can I do purnahuti with a big stream of spoonful ghee? \n&gt; &gt; Logicall=\r\ny it might be acceptable, since I am offering only ghee as \n&gt; &gt; ahuti, so w=\r\nhy not a big amount of ghee as purna (full) ahuti? Also I \n&gt; &gt; read in the =\r\narchieve that in deepa-homam, purnahuti can be done with \n&gt; &gt; ghee.\n&gt; &gt; Kin=\r\ndly confirm.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Tanvir\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openCompo=\r\nseWindow(&#39;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&#39;)&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/t=\r\nerms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
