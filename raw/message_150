Please mention the important mantras which are mis \nprono=\r\nunced these days, so that we shall start changing our \npronounciation Sir.\n=\r\n \n \nThank You for sharing your knowledge with us.\n \nHari Om,\n \nRajesh\n\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once said that even Veda=\r\ns are corrupted \nthese days. It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt every=\r\nthing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Ve=\r\ndic \nscholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda \nm=\r\nantras) incorrectly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Havi=\r\nng devotion and the \nspirit of surrender to god is even more important. How=\r\never, \npronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is =\r\n\nvery important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra \ncan =\r\nstop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In \nfact, we have=\r\n a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda \nmantras, but very few wh=\r\no can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Over the next few months, I wil=\r\nl write my views on correct \npronunciation and point out some common errors=\r\n. If you do not think \nthat correct pronunciation is important or if you di=\r\nsagree with my \nassessment of the errors or if you do not want to change yo=\r\nur \npronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On the \nother=\r\n hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please \ngive a consi=\r\nderation to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find \nthem appropriate=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the word=\r\ns \nlike &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests \na=\r\nnd scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to \nsomething=\r\n like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why \nthis corruptio=\r\nn came into practice, but it is a corruption \nnevertheless.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In &quot;prach=\r\nodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. \nIf you change i=\r\nt into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at \nthe end, it becomes =\r\ntwo aksharas. This increases the number of \naksharas, changes the chhandas =\r\nand changes the meaning also. You may \nstill experience something when medi=\r\ntating on the mantra, but you \nwill never experience the mantra to the full=\r\nest with that \npronunciation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swa=\r\nras) are the praana (life \nforce) of an akshara. If you have just a consona=\r\nnt without a vowel \nafter it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT a=\r\nn akshara. It \nperishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without a=\r\ndding any \nsounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener can=\r\nnot \ndecipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In &quot;=\r\nprachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. \nBecause &quot;t&quot; has no p=\r\nraana by itself, it simply joins to the \nakshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel=\r\n &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes \npart of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot;=\r\n is considered one letter \n(one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly,=\r\n it is difficult for \nthe listener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot;=\r\n or &quot;yaak&quot; \nor &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwi=\r\nse \ndifficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient \nsou=\r\nnd without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This makes people add=\r\n some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; \nor &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound=\r\n in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; \nsound gets a praana and becomes clearly =\r\naudible. It suddenly becomes \nan akshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Pr=\r\nobably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so \nthat &quot;t&quot;=\r\n gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so \nthat his stude=\r\nnts would not get confused when learning. Probably the \nstudents thought th=\r\ne mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got \nused to that mis-pronunci=\r\nation. Probably, that became a standard \npractice after a couple of centuri=\r\nes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it \nt=\r\no &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and \nleave i=\r\nt there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the \nend. The same t=\r\nhing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; What =\r\nI said about words ending in consonants applies to all \nconsonants and not =\r\njust &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. \nThere can be words that=\r\n end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, \npeople normally add an artificial=\r\n vowel sound at the end and end up \nchanging the chhandas and altering the =\r\nflow of energy in the mantra. \nThat is also wrong.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D \nsto=\r\nry). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D \nmoney).=\r\n In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha \nlooks very simi=\r\nlar and just one dot in the middle is different. It is \npossible that some =\r\npeople started mispronouncing this sound because \nof their inability to see=\r\n the dot and others started following. Now \npronouncing tha as dha became m=\r\nainstream and one pronouncing \ncorrectly will be the odd person out.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nSanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for \nthe same =\r\nsound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The \nletters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;=\r\ndha&quot; are different and their sounds are different \ntoo. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as i=\r\nn &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a \nstress/aspiration to get =\r\n&quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, =\r\npeople say &quot;dharmaartha kaama \nmoksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham=\r\n&quot;. This means &quot;for \nattaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence=\r\n) - dharma \n(fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling =\r\n\ndesires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end up \npronounc=\r\ning &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. \nIt means &quot;ha=\r\nlf of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; \nmeans &quot;half attainment=\r\n&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-\npronunciation in this sanka=\r\nlpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it \ncommitted by many many trained pri=\r\nests!\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attentio=\r\nn to \nthe difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them \nd=\r\nifferently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra \nattention=\r\n to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most=\r\n \npeople in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing \nthem=\r\n out slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me \nto.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into \nconsideration i=\r\nn altering your pronunciation (if you are open to \nthat). If you don&#39;t find=\r\n any sense in what I am saying or want to \ncontinue as taught by your gurus=\r\n, I can understand that. I am not \nhere to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation=\r\n. But, because She inspired \nme to share my thoughts with the world, I am g=\r\nuessing that there are \nSOME who are destined to change their pronunciation=\r\n based on my \nviews. That is why I am writing these mails.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you do =\r\nnot like this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this \nidiot!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
