He was a precocious youth whose early studies created\na dis=\r\ntaste for religious literature. This lasted until he came under the\npowerfu=\r\nl influence of Ganapati Muni, who brought him to the Maharshi in\n1929. He w=\r\nas enchanted by the holy presence of the sage, but still wandered\nabout for=\r\n some years exploring the different spiritual traditions and\nteachers of th=\r\ne time. As the result of his wide study and long practice,\nKrishna Bhikshu =\r\nbecame convinced of the truths taught and lived by Sri\nRamana Maharshi and =\r\nsurrendered to him whole-heartedly.\n\nHe authored several important works in=\r\n Telugu, one being Sri Ramana Leela,\nthe most comprehensive biography of th=\r\ne Maharshi. Amidst the chanting of\nArunachala Siva, Krishna Bhikshu breathe=\r\nd his last on December 30, 1981.\n\nOUR FAMILY was in some way or other alway=\r\ns associated with religion and\nspiritual searching. Brahmarsi Chivukula Ven=\r\nkata Sastri, the husband of my\npaternal aunt, had asked some of the questio=\r\nns recorded in the Ramana Gita.\nWhen I was a child I often used to go to hi=\r\ns house and there I saw for the\nfirst time the photo of Bhagavan Ramana and=\r\n read Ramana Gita and other early\nbrochures.\n\nI went to Arunachala for the =\r\nfirst time with Sri Rami Reddi. We had our food\nin the town and then went t=\r\no the Ashrama. In those days there was very\nlittle there - a hut for Bhagav=\r\nan and another over his mother&#39;s samadhi\n(place of burial). Bhagavan had ju=\r\nst finished his food and was washing his\nhands. He looked at us intently. &quot;=\r\nDid you have your food?&quot; He asked. &quot;Yes,\nwe had it in town.&quot; &quot;You could hav=\r\ne had it here,&quot; he replied.\n\nI stayed with him for three days. He made a gr=\r\neat impression on me. I\nconsidered him to be a real Mahatma, although his w=\r\nays were very simple.\nMost of the cooking was done by him in those days. Th=\r\ne Ashrama lived from\nhand to mouth and usually only rice and vegetable soup=\r\n were prepared. When I\nwas about to leave, I asked Bhagavan: &quot;Bhagavan, kin=\r\ndly show me a good\npath.&quot; &quot;What are you doing now?&quot; he asked. &quot;When I am in=\r\n the right mood, I\nsing the songs of Tyagaraja and I recite the holy Gayatr=\r\ni. I was also doing\nsome pranayama but these breathing exercises have upset=\r\n my health.&quot; &quot;You had\nbetter stop them. But never give up the Advaita Drist=\r\nhi (non dual vision).&quot;\nAt that time I could not understand his words.\n\nI we=\r\nnt to Benares for a month, returned to Pondicherry and spent five months\nth=\r\nere. Wherever I would go people would find some fault or other with me:\n&quot;Yo=\r\nu are too weak, not fit for yoga, you do not know how to concentrate, you\nc=\r\nannot hold your breath, you are unable to fast, you need too much sleep,\nyo=\r\nu cannot keep vigils, you must surrender all your property . . .&quot; Only\nBhag=\r\navan asked for nothing, found fault with nothing. As a matter of truth,\nthe=\r\nre was nothing in me that entitled me to his grace. But it did not matter\nw=\r\nith Bhagavan. He wanted me, not my goodness. It was enough to tell him &quot;I\na=\r\nm yours&quot;, and for him to do the rest. In that way he was unsurpassed. The\ns=\r\ntrange people he gathered around him! But those who gave themselves to him\n=\r\nand trusted him and did his bidding were overwhelmed by his immense\nsolicit=\r\nude and kindness.\n\nIn 1930 I visited Ramanasramam for the second time, and =\r\nstayed a month. Our\nlife was very simple at that time. I would get up early=\r\n each morning, have\nmy bath near the well at Palitirtham, prepare sacrament=\r\nal food on a small\nstove and start worshipping the Lingam over Bhagavan&#39;s m=\r\nother&#39;s samadhi.\nChinnaswami helped in the chanting. Bhagavan would make hi=\r\nmself generally\nuseful. He would talk quite freely with us every night afte=\r\nr food. They\nwould ply him with questions on philosophy and metaphysics. In=\r\n the evening\nhe would sit on a wooden cot near the well and gaze at Arunach=\r\nala in deep\nsilence. His face would glow with an inner radiance which would=\r\n appear to\nincrease with the deepening darkness. We were sitting all around=\r\n him, either\nsilently, or singing some song. Alamelamma would sometimes sin=\r\ng from\nTiruppughazh. The silence and peace at those hours was quite remarka=\r\nble.\n\nAt night after dinner all the inmates of the Ashrama would collect ar=\r\nound\nBhagavan, and then he was our own, telling stories, answering question=\r\ns,\ndispelling doubts, laughing and joking. We never knew how late it was un=\r\ntil\nMadhavaswami would go behind Bhagavan&#39;s back and give us signs that it =\r\nwas\ntime to allow Bhagavan some rest.\n\nB. V. Narasimhaswami took up in thos=\r\ne days the task of writing a book on\nBhagavan&#39;s life and was collecting mat=\r\nerials for his work from devotees. The\nfirst draft of the book was ready an=\r\nd the author gave it to me to read. The\nidea came to me that a similar book=\r\n should be written in Telugu. I got\nBhagavan&#39;s permission and, using Narasi=\r\nmhaswami&#39;s manuscript for an outline,\ngot the Telugu version written within=\r\n a month.\n\nAfter that, whenever there was some court holiday and I had enou=\r\ngh money for\na railway ticket, I would come down to Ramanasramam. Everybody=\r\n, including\nBhagavan, used to say: &quot;Krishnayya has come,&quot; and there was alw=\r\nays a warm\nwelcome for me.\n\nI asked him once: &quot;You told me to repeat the Ga=\r\nyatri. It is too long. Also,\nI am expected to know its meaning and to medit=\r\nate on it.&#39;&#39; &quot;Who asked you to\nbother about the meaning and all that? I hav=\r\ne only asked you to see who is\nrepeating the Gayatri, or who is the japi,&quot; =\r\nwas his kind reply.\n\nOn the other hand he did not limit his teaching to the=\r\n one question &quot;Who am\nI ?&quot; He invariably adjusted his advice to the needs o=\r\nf the devotee. He would\nsay: &quot;Sooner or later the question &#39;Who am I?&#39; will=\r\n have to be faced. All\nthat leads to this question is good. By itself nothi=\r\nng else is fully\neffective, for Self-knowledge comes only through self-enqu=\r\niry. But other\nmethods purify the mind and help it to see its own limits. W=\r\nhen the mind\ncomes to the end of its resources and stands baffled before th=\r\ne unanswerable\nquestion, then a Higher Power takes charge of the mind and t=\r\nhe Self stands\nrevealed, the Real, the Wonderful.&quot;\n\nOnce an old woman came =\r\nto the Ashrama. She always carried with her a framed\npicture of Bhagavan Na=\r\nrayana and she would worship it on every occasion.\n\nShe asked Bhagavan whet=\r\nher she was right in doing so. Bhagavan replied:\n\n&quot;Without name and form, o=\r\nn what is one to concentrate? What you are doing\nwith your heart and soul i=\r\ns just right for you.&quot;\n\nOne night there were only one or two persons in the=\r\n hall. Madhavaswami was\nmassaging Bhagavan&#39;s legs. A gentleman from Kakinad=\r\na asked Bhagavan&#39;s\npermission to massage his legs. Bhagavan did not reply. =\r\nThe man repeated his\nrequest, saying: &quot;At home I am daily praying to Bhagav=\r\nan and now I have a\nchance to serve him.&quot; Suddenly Bhagavan thundered: &quot;You=\r\n had all the chances\nof serving me at home. Why did you come here?&quot; The man=\r\n became quite\nfrightened and could not speak. Thus Bhagavan taught us not t=\r\no make a show\nof our devotion.\n\nNobody could guess about the way Bhagavan w=\r\nould meet people. The high and\nmighty of the land would not get even a blan=\r\nk look, while some insignificant\nlooking wanderer would become the object o=\r\nf his concentrated attention for\nhours and days. On the other hand eminent =\r\npeople would sometimes be taken up\nby him and given the immense blessing of=\r\n being the centre of his interest.\nOnce Pranavananda Swami came to the Ashr=\r\nama. He was utterly exhausted. He\nsat on the steps of the temple and could =\r\nnot move any further. Bhagavan was\ntold about it. He came out at once, sat =\r\nat the feet of Pranavananda Swami\nand started rubbing his legs, saying: &quot;Yo=\r\nu had a long way to walk, Grandpa.\nYour legs must be paining you very much.=\r\n&quot; The old swami protested in vain;\nBhagavan had his way and massaged the sw=\r\nami&#39;s feet.\n\nAt food time Bhagavan would ask to be served very little and h=\r\ne would\ncarefully clear the plate of the last grain of food before getting =\r\nup.\nAlthough he never asked us to do the same, I asked him: &quot;If we clear ou=\r\nr\ndining leaves so scrupulously, the dogs, cats, monkeys, rats and the ants=\r\n\nwill starve.&quot; Bhagavan answered: &quot;Well, if you are so compassionate, why n=\r\not\nfeed the animals before taking food yourselves? Do you think they relish=\r\n\nyour scrappings?&quot;\n\nOnce a visitor said: &quot;I have been coming to you, Swami,=\r\n many times, hoping\nthat something will happen and I shall be changed. So f=\r\nar I do not see any\nchange in me. I am as I was: a weakling of a man, an in=\r\nveterate sinner.&quot; And\nhe started weeping piteously. &quot;On this road there are=\r\n no milestones,&quot;\nreplied Bhagavan. &quot;How can you know which direction you ar=\r\ne going ? Why\ndon&#39;t you do what the first-class railway passenger does? He =\r\ntells the guard\nhis destination, locks the doors and goes to sleep. The res=\r\nt is done by the\nguard, If you could trust your guru as much as you trust t=\r\nhe railway guard,\nit would be quite enough to make you reach your destinati=\r\non. Your business\nis to shut the door and windows and sleep. The guard will=\r\n wake you up at\nyour destination.&quot;\n\nOne Rama Rao, an advocate in Nellore, w=\r\nas requested many times by his\nfriends to come with them to Ramanasramam. I=\r\nnvariably he would answer: &quot;I\nshall go when Bhagavan calls me.&#39;&#39; Once when =\r\nhe was praying Bhagavan\nappeared to him and asked: &quot;Why have you not come?&quot;=\r\n Rama Rao immediately\nleft for Tiruvannamalai. Before reaching the Ashrama =\r\nhe had a dream in which\na unique Chakra (symbolic drawing) appeared before =\r\nhim. He told the dream to\nBhagavan, described the Chakra and asked who coul=\r\nd help him in having one\ndrawn correctly. Bhagavan gave him all the necessa=\r\nry information. When the\nChakra was ready, Bhagavan examined it carefully a=\r\nnd gave it to Rama Rao,\ntelling him to use it in his worship.\n\nA widow arri=\r\nved one day, entered the Hall and bowed to Bhagavan. He looked\nat her close=\r\nly and started laughing. &quot;Oh, it is you.&#39;&#39; he said. The woman\ngot confused,=\r\n covered her face with her white widow&#39;s sari and hid herself\nin a corner. =\r\nBhagavan continued with a broad smile: &quot;When I was a boy her\npeople were ou=\r\nr neighbours and she was their little girl. It was agreed\nbetween our paren=\r\nts that she would be my wife in due course. I was very fond\nof helping my m=\r\nother in the kitchen and her mother used to grumble that she\nwould never ma=\r\nrry her daughter to a fellow who likes to spend his day near\nthe stove, lik=\r\ne a woman. Anyhow I was not fated to marry. But had I married\nher, what wou=\r\nld have been my fate!&quot; Everybody had a good laugh at Bhagavan&#39;s\nnarrow esca=\r\npe.\n\nOnce I said to Bhagavan: &quot;Bhagavan, formerly, whenever I thought of yo=\r\nu,\nyour form would appear before my eyes. But now it does not happen. What =\r\nam I\nto do?&quot; &quot;You can remember my name and repeat it. Name is superior to f=\r\norm.\nBut in the course of time even the name will disappear. Till then repe=\r\nat the\nname,&quot; advised Bhagavan.\n\nAn inmate of the Ashrama who had been serv=\r\ning Bhagavan for many years\nstarted visiting a certain woman in the town. H=\r\ner relatives came to know of\nit and decided to catch and kill the man. One =\r\nnight they caught him at her\nhouse, bound him hand and foot and locked him =\r\nup in a room, postponing the\ncutting of his throat until they had found a s=\r\nafe way of disposing of the\nbody. Our man managed to escape and came runnin=\r\ng to the Ashrama, pursued by\nhis enemies. When he entered the gate they gav=\r\ne up the chase. He entered the\nHall trembling and fell on the ground shouti=\r\nng: &quot;Save me, save me.&#39;&#39;\nBhagavan ordered the doors to be shut and said: &quot;D=\r\non&#39;t fear, tell me what\nhappened.&quot; After having been told everything, he lo=\r\noked at the culprit with\nunderstanding and pity and said reassuringly: &quot;Don=\r\n&#39;t fear any more. Go and\nsleep.&quot; From the next day the man was at his work =\r\nand Bhagavan would not\nmention the matter at all. Everybody in the town cam=\r\ne to know what happened.\nThe Ashrama people requested Bhagavan to send the =\r\nman away, for his presence\nwould tarnish the good name of the Ashrama. Bhag=\r\navan called the man and told\nhim in front of everybody: &quot;You have done some=\r\n wrong, but you were too\nfoolish to keep it secret. Others do worse things,=\r\n but they take care not to\nbe caught. Now, the people who were not caught w=\r\nant you to leave the Ashrama\nbecause you were caught. They will make your l=\r\nife miserable. You had better\nstay outside for some time, until things sett=\r\nle down.&quot; The man stayed with\nsome devotees outside the Ashrama and came ba=\r\nck after a few months.\n\nWhen people would complain to Bhagavan about some m=\r\nischief or other done in\nthe Ashrama, Bhagavan would say: &quot;I have not come =\r\nhere to punish people. If\nI start punishing people, even a black crow would=\r\n not remain in this place.\nPeople come here, each with his own purpose, and=\r\n each may find his purpose\nfulfilled. Why don&#39;t you take care of your own p=\r\nurpose? Why do you pay\nattention to what others do?&quot;\n\nOn some other occasio=\r\nn Bhagavan remarked about some of the visitors: &quot;On\ntheir first visit to th=\r\ne Ashrama they seem to be all right; on their second\nvisit they discover th=\r\nat the Ashrama is not properly run; on their third\nvisit they start giving =\r\nadvice; on the fourth they know best how to run the\nplace; on the fifth the=\r\ny discover that the management is not responsive and\nthey are very displeas=\r\ned; on the sixth they suggest that the present staff\nshould walk out, leavi=\r\nng the Ashrama to them. Finally they become\ndisheartened and blame me for w=\r\nhat I have never done.&quot; After all it is\nperfectly true that Bhagavan neithe=\r\nr started nor organized the Ashrama. It\nwas all done by others who just did=\r\n what they thought right.\n\nWhen Bhagavan was still on the hill, a postcard =\r\ncame in which the sender\nwrote: &quot;I am a poor elementary school teacher. My =\r\nmother is old and my\nsalary is so small that I cannot look after her proper=\r\nly. Kindly see that I\nget a raise.&quot; Bhagavan laughed and said: &quot;Well, why n=\r\not?&quot; Another card came\nafter some time in which he wrote: &quot;By your grace my=\r\n salary was increased.\nNow there is a vacancy in a higher grade. If I am gi=\r\nven that grade, I shall\nearn more and make my mother very happy.&quot; Bhagavan =\r\nhad a good laugh and\nsaid: &quot;Good.&quot; Again after some days, another card: &quot;My=\r\n mother is bedridden\nand there is nobody to nurse her. If I could get marri=\r\ned, my wife would look\nafter her. But I am a poor man. Who will give me his=\r\n daughter in marriage?\nAnd where shall I get the money for expenses? Bhagav=\r\nan may kindly arrange.&quot;\nBhagavan laughed and said: &quot;Well, let it be so.&quot; Af=\r\nter some months another\npostcard came: &quot;By your kindness I was married quit=\r\ne easily. My wife is\nalready with me. My mother wants a grandchild before s=\r\nhe dies. Please\nprovide. &quot;Why not?&quot; said Bhagavan. After some months anothe=\r\nr card: &quot;My wife\ngave birth to a child, but she has no milk for it. I canno=\r\nt afford milk for\nthe baby. Please get me a promotion.&quot; Then another card: =\r\n&quot;I got a promotion\nand an increment. The child is doing well. I owe everyth=\r\ning to your\nkindness.&quot; Bhagavan remarked: &quot;What have I done? It is his good=\r\n karma that\nall goes well with him.&quot; After some days another card: &quot;Mother =\r\ndied. She\nworshiped you before her death. &quot;Well,&quot; said Bhagavan. After a mo=\r\nnth,\nanother card: &quot;Swami, my child has died.&quot; &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Bhagavan. Anot=\r\nher\nmonth had passed and a card came saying: &quot;My wife is pregnant again.&quot; T=\r\nhen\nanother card: &quot;My wife gave birth to a child. Both died.&quot; &quot;Ram, Ram,&#39;&#39; =\r\nsaid\nBhagavan. &quot;Everything seems to be over.&quot; Then another card: &quot;Due to fa=\r\nmily\ntrouble my work was very irregular and I was dismissed. I am completel=\r\ny\ndestitute now.&#39;&#39; Bhagavan said, heaving a deep sigh: &quot;All that came has\ng=\r\none; only his Self remained with him. It is always like this. When all\ngoes=\r\n, only the Self remains.&quot;\n\n-- The preceding was taken from &quot;The Bhagavan I =\r\nKnew&quot; in the Ramana Smriti\nSouvenir.\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/new=\r\nsletters/1992/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13b78729b08047c8f8a16\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nKrishna Bhikshu was a man of insatiable curiosity, keen intellec=\r\nt, enthusiasm and energy.

When I was about t=\r\no leave, I asked Bhagavan: &quot;Bhagavan, kindly show me a good path.&quot=\r\n; &quot;What are you doing now?&quot; he asked. &quot;When I am in the righ=\r\nt mood, I sing the songs of Tyagaraja and I recite the holy Gayatri. I was =\r\nalso doing some pranayama but these breathing exercises have upset my healt=\r\nh.&quot; &quot;You had better stop them. But never give up the Advaita Dris=\r\nthi (non dual vision).&quot; At that time I could not understand his words.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I went to Benares for a month, returned to Pondicherry and spent =\r\nfive months there. Wherever I would go people would find some fault or othe=\r\nr with me: &quot;You are too weak, not fit for yoga, you do not know how to=\r\n concentrate, you cannot hold your breath, you are unable to fast, you need=\r\n too much sleep, you cannot keep vigils, you must surrender all your proper=\r\nty . . .&quot; Only Bhagavan asked for nothing, found fault with nothing. A=\r\ns a matter of truth, there was nothing in me that entitled me to his grace.=\r\n But it did not matter with Bhagavan. He wanted me, not my goodness. It was=\r\n enough to tell him &quot;I am yours&quot;, and for him to do the rest. In =\r\nthat way he was unsurpassed. The strange people he gathered around him! But=\r\n those who gave themselves to him and trusted him and did his bidding were =\r\noverwhelmed by his immense solicitude and kindness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In 1930 I visi=\r\nted Ramanasramam for the second time, and stayed a month. Our life was very=\r\n simple at that time. I would get up early each morning, have my bath near =\r\nthe well at Palitirtham, prepare sacramental food on a small stove and star=\r\nt worshipping the Lingam over Bhagavan&#39;s mother&#39;s samadhi. Chinnasw=\r\nami helped in the chanting. Bhagavan would make himself generally useful. H=\r\ne would talk quite freely with us every night after food. They would ply hi=\r\nm with questions on philosophy and metaphysics.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;In the evening he would sit on a wooden cot near the well and ga=\r\nze at Arunachala in deep silence.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0His face would glow with an i=\r\nnner radiance which would appear to increase with the deepening darkness. W=\r\ne were sitting all around him, either silently, or singing some song. Alame=\r\nlamma would sometimes sing from Tiruppughazh.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;The silence and peace at those hours was quite remarkable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;At night after dinner all the in=\r\nmates of the Ashrama would collect around Bhagavan, and then he was our own=\r\n, telling stories, answering questions, dispelling doubts, laughing and jok=\r\ning. We never knew how late it was until Madhavaswami would go behind Bhaga=\r\nvan&#39;s back and give us signs that it was time to allow Bhagavan some re=\r\nst.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;B. V. Narasimhaswami took up in those days the task of =\r\nwriting a book on Bhagavan&#39;s life and was collecting materials for his =\r\nwork from devotees. The first draft of the book was ready and the author ga=\r\nve it to me to read. The idea came to me that a similar book should be writ=\r\nten in Telugu. I got Bhagavan&#39;s permission and, using Narasimhaswami&#3=\r\n9;s manuscript for an outline, got the Telugu version written within a mont=\r\nh.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;After that, whenever there was some court holiday and I had eno=\r\nugh money for a railway ticket, I would come down to Ramanasramam. Everybod=\r\ny, including Bhagavan, used to say: &quot;Krishnayya has come,&quot; and th=\r\nere was always a warm welcome for me.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;I asked him once: &quot;You told me to repeat the Gayatri. It is too l=\r\nong. Also, I am expected to know its meaning and to meditate on it.&#39;&#3=\r\n9; &quot;Who asked you to bother about the meaning and all that? I have onl=\r\ny asked you to see who is repeating the Gayatri, or who is the japi,&quot; =\r\nwas his kind reply.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On the other hand he did not limit his =\r\nteaching to the one question &quot;Who am I ?&quot; He invariably adjusted =\r\nhis advice to the needs of the devotee.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;He would say: &quot;Sooner or later the question &#39;Who am I?&#39; wil=\r\nl have to be faced. All that leads to this question is good. By itself noth=\r\ning else is fully effective, for Self-knowledge comes only through self-enq=\r\nuiry.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0But other methods purify the mind and help it to see its =\r\nown limits. When the mind comes to the end of its resources and stands baff=\r\nled before the unanswerable question, then a Higher Power takes charge of t=\r\nhe mind and the Self stands revealed, the Real, the Wonderful.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Once an old woman came to the Ashrama. She always carried with her a fra=\r\nmed picture of Bhagavan Narayana and she would worship it on every occasion=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She asked Bhagavan whether she was right in doing so. Bhagavan rep=\r\nlied:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Without name and form, on what is one to concentrate? =\r\nWhat you are doing with your heart and soul is just right for you.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night there were only one or two persons in the hall. Madhavaswami=\r\n was massaging Bhagavan&#39;s legs.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;A=\r\n gentleman from Kakinada asked Bhagavan&#39;s permission to massage his leg=\r\ns. Bhagavan did not reply. The man repeated his request, saying: &quot;At h=\r\nome I am daily praying to Bhagavan and now I have a chance to serve him.&qu=\r\not; Suddenly Bhagavan thundered: &quot;You had all the chances of serving m=\r\ne at home. Why did you come here?&quot; The man became quite frightened and=\r\n could not speak. Thus Bhagavan taught us not to make a show of our devotio=\r\nn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Nobody could guess about the way Bhagavan would meet peo=\r\nple. The high and mighty of the land would not get even a blank look, while=\r\n some insignificant looking wanderer would become the object of his concent=\r\nrated attention for hours and days. On the other hand eminent people would =\r\nsometimes be taken up by him and given the immense blessing of being the ce=\r\nntre of his interest. Once Pranavananda Swami came to the Ashrama. He was u=\r\ntterly exhausted. He sat on the steps of the temple and could not move any =\r\nfurther. Bhagavan was told about it. He came out at once, sat at the feet o=\r\nf Pranavananda Swami and started rubbing his legs, saying: &quot;You had a =\r\nlong way to walk, Grandpa. Your legs must be paining you very much.&quot; T=\r\nhe old swami protested in vain; Bhagavan had his way and massaged the swami=\r\n&#39;s feet.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At food time Bhagava=\r\nn would ask to be served very little and he would carefully clear the plate=\r\n of the last grain of food before getting up. Although he never asked us to=\r\n do the same, I asked him: &quot;If we clear our dining leaves so scrupulou=\r\nsly, the dogs, cats, monkeys, rats and the ants will starve.&quot; Bhagavan=\r\n answered: &quot;Well, if you are so compassionate, why not feed the animal=\r\ns before taking food yourselves? Do you think they relish your scrappings?&=\r\nquot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once a visitor said: &quot;I have been coming to you,=\r\n Swami, many times, hoping that something will happen and I shall be change=\r\nd. So far I do not see any change in me. I am as I was: a weakling of a man=\r\n, an inveterate sinner.&quot; And he started weeping piteously. &quot;On th=\r\nis road there are no milestones,&quot; replied Bhagavan. &quot;How can you =\r\nknow which direction you are going ?=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\nWhy don&#39;t you do what the first-class railway passenger does? He tells =\r\nthe guard his destination, locks the doors and goes to sleep. The rest is d=\r\none by the guard, If you could trust your guru as much as you trust the rai=\r\nlway guard, it would be quite enough to make you reach your destination. Yo=\r\nur business is to shut the door and windows and sleep. The guard will wake =\r\nyou up at your destination.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One Rama Rao, an advocate=\r\n in Nellore, was requested many times by his friends to come with them to R=\r\namanasramam. Invariably he would answer: &quot;I shall go when Bhagavan cal=\r\nls me.&#39;&#39; Once when he was praying Bhagavan appeared to him and aske=\r\nd: &quot;Why have you not come?&quot; Rama Rao immediately left for Tiruvan=\r\nnamalai. Before reaching the Ashrama he had a dream in which a unique Chakr=\r\na (symbolic drawing) appeared before him. He told the dream to Bhagavan, de=\r\nscribed the Chakra and asked who could help him in having one drawn correct=\r\nly. Bhagavan gave him all the necessary information. When the Chakra was re=\r\nady, Bhagavan examined it carefully and gave it to Rama Rao, telling him to=\r\n use it in his worship.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;A widow a=\r\nrrived one day, entered the Hall and bowed to Bhagavan. He looked at her cl=\r\nosely and started laughing. &quot;Oh, it is you.&#39;&#39; he said. The wom=\r\nan got confused, covered her face with her white widow&#39;s sari and hid h=\r\nerself in a corner. Bhagavan continued with a broad smile: &quot;When I was=\r\n a boy her people were our neighbours and she was their little girl. It was=\r\n agreed between our parents that she would be my wife in due course. I was =\r\nvery fond of helping my mother in the kitchen and her mother used to grumbl=\r\ne that she would never marry her daughter to a fellow who likes to spend hi=\r\ns day near the stove, like a woman. Anyhow I was not fated to marry. But ha=\r\nd I married her, what would have been my fate!&quot; Everybody had a good l=\r\naugh at Bhagavan&#39;s narrow escape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once I said to Bhagav=\r\nan: &quot;Bhagavan, formerly, whenever I thought of you, your form would ap=\r\npear before my eyes. But now it does not happen. What am I to do?&quot; &qu=\r\not;You can remember my name and repeat it.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:=\r\nbold&quot;&gt;Name is superior to form. But in the course of time even the name wil=\r\nl disappear. Till then repeat the name,&quot; advised Bhagavan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;An inmate of the Ashrama who had been serving Bhagavan for many years =\r\nstarted visiting a certain woman in the town. Her relatives came to know of=\r\n it and decided to catch and kill the man. One night they caught him at her=\r\n house, bound him hand and foot and locked him up in a room, postponing the=\r\n cutting of his throat until they had found a safe way of disposing of the =\r\nbody. Our man managed to escape and came running to the Ashrama, pursued by=\r\n his enemies. When he entered the gate they gave up the chase. He entered t=\r\nhe Hall trembling and fell on the ground shouting: &quot;Save me, save me.&=\r\n#39;&#39; Bhagavan ordered the doors to be shut and said: &quot;Don&#39;t f=\r\near, tell me what happened.&quot; After having been told everything, he loo=\r\nked at the culprit with understanding and pity and said reassuringly: &quot=\r\n;Don&#39;t fear any more. Go and sleep.&quot; From the next day the man was=\r\n at his work and Bhagavan would not mention the matter at all. Everybody in=\r\n the town came to know what happened. The Ashrama people requested Bhagavan=\r\n to send the man away, for his presence would tarnish the good name of the =\r\nAshrama.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan called the man and =\r\ntold him in front of everybody: &quot;You have done some wrong, but you wer=\r\ne too foolish to keep it secret. Others do worse things, but they take care=\r\n not to be caught. Now, the people who were not caught want you to leave th=\r\ne Ashrama because you were caught.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0They will make your life mis=\r\nerable. You had better stay outside for some time, until things settle down=\r\n.&quot; The man stayed with some devotees outside the Ashrama and came back=\r\n after a few months.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When people =\r\nwould complain to Bhagavan about some mischief or other done in the Ashrama=\r\n, Bhagavan would say: &quot;I have not come here to punish people. If I sta=\r\nrt punishing people, even a black crow would not remain in this place. Peop=\r\nle come here, each with his own purpose, and each may find his purpose fulf=\r\nilled. Why don&#39;t you take care of your own purpose? Why do you pay atte=\r\nntion to what others do?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On some other occasion Bhaga=\r\nvan remarked about some of the visitors: &quot;On their first visit to the =\r\nAshrama they seem to be all right; on their second visit they discover that=\r\n the Ashrama is not properly run; on their third visit they start giving ad=\r\nvice; on the fourth they know best how to run the place; on the fifth they =\r\ndiscover that the management is not responsive and they are very displeased=\r\n; on the sixth they suggest that the present staff should walk out, leaving=\r\n the Ashrama to them. Finally they become disheartened and blame me for wha=\r\nt I have never done.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;After all =\r\nit is perfectly true that Bhagavan neither started nor organized the Ashram=\r\na. It was all done by others who just did what they thought right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;When Bhagavan was still on the hi=\r\nll, a postcard came in which the sender wrote: &quot;I am a poor elementary=\r\n school teacher. My mother is old and my salary is so small that I cannot l=\r\nook after her properly. Kindly see that I get a raise.&quot; Bhagavan laugh=\r\ned and said: &quot;Well, why not?&quot; Another card came after some time i=\r\nn which he wrote: &quot;By your grace my salary was increased. Now there is=\r\n a vacancy in a higher grade. If I am given that grade, I shall earn more a=\r\nnd make my mother very happy.&quot; Bhagavan had a good laugh and said: &qu=\r\not;Good.&quot; Again after some days, another card: &quot;My mother is bedr=\r\nidden and there is nobody to nurse her. If I could get married, my wife wou=\r\nld look after her. But I am a poor man. Who will give me his daughter in ma=\r\nrriage? And where shall I get the money for expenses? Bhagavan may kindly a=\r\nrrange.&quot; Bhagavan laughed and said: &quot;Well, let it be so.&quot; Af=\r\nter some months another postcard came: &quot;By your kindness I was married=\r\n quite easily. My wife is already with me. My mother wants a grandchild bef=\r\nore she dies. Please provide. &quot;Why not?&quot; said Bhagavan. After som=\r\ne months another card: &quot;My wife gave birth to a child, but she has no =\r\nmilk for it. I cannot afford milk for the baby. Please get me a promotion.&=\r\nquot; Then another card: &quot;I got a promotion and an increment. The chil=\r\nd is doing well. I owe everything to your kindness.&quot; Bhagavan remarked=\r\n: &quot;What have I done? It is his good karma that all goes well with him.=\r\n&quot; After some days another card: &quot;Mother died. She worshiped you b=\r\nefore her death. &quot;Well,&quot; said Bhagavan. After a month, another ca=\r\nrd: &quot;Swami, my child has died.&quot; &quot;Sorry,&quot; said Bhagavan.=\r\n Another month had passed and a card came saying: &quot;My wife is pregnant=\r\n again.&quot; Then another card: &quot;My wife gave birth to a child. Both =\r\ndied.&quot; &quot;Ram, Ram,&#39;&#39; said Bhagavan. &quot;Everything seems=\r\n to be over.&quot; Then another card: &quot;Due to family trouble my work w=\r\nas very irregular and I was dismissed. I am completely destitute now.&#39;&=\r\n#39; Bhagavan said, heaving a deep sigh&lt;/span&gt;: &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;All that came has gone; only his Self remained with him. It is =\r\nalways like this. When all goes, only the Self remains.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;-- The preceding was taken from &quot;The Bhagavan I Knew&quot; in=\r\n the Ramana Smriti Souvenir.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1992/?pg=3Dnov-de=\r\nc&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1992/?pg=3Dnov-d=\r\nec&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;col=\r\nor:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bot=\r\ntom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=\r\n=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd13b78729b08047c8f8a16--\r\n\n"}}
