Rightly pointed out that puja of &#39;M=\r\naata&#39; is very beneficial to all. However, i believe that anybody persuing s=\r\nadhana of any deity will also be very beneficial, as this period has someth=\r\ning special which is suitable for chanting, japa and meditation. Thus, bene=\r\nfits accruing will be manifold. Right conduct during puja and japam is equa=\r\nlly important,even more important. Restraint on food, speech, thinking, and=\r\n sex is extremely important to progress faster. Offcourse, divine grace is =\r\nalso required.But divine will helps endlessly those who want to persue divi=\r\nne end.\n\nRegards,\nsanjeev sharma\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; As mentioned below, Vasant=\r\na Navaratris (9 days from tomorrow) are a great time for Chandipath, just l=\r\nike Sarannava raatris that come six months later.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In addition, this i=\r\ns a great time to pray to Lord Rama. You can take any mantra of Rama and ke=\r\nep chanting it as many times as you can everyday. Some people read Valmiki&#39;=\r\ns Ramayana or Tulsidas&#39;s Ram Charit Manas. If you know no mantra of Rama, h=\r\nis amrita mantra (&quot;Sree Raama Raama Raama&quot;) can be tried. It is a powerful =\r\nmantra. His dwadasakshari is &quot;Om namo bhagavate Raamachandraaya&quot;. Actually,=\r\n just repeating &quot;Sree Raama&quot; or even just &quot;Raama&quot; is powerful.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The ke=\r\ny is to do it with as much focus of mind as possible, keep the body steady =\r\nand free from motion (as much as possible), keep the eyes closed, do the ch=\r\nanting mentally, keep the back and neck straight and maintain brahmacharya =\r\nif possible.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- utpal pathak &lt;=\r\nvedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Hiral,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suggetions are\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Chandi Homa / MahaLakshmi Homa\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; Chandi Paath\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Fasting=\r\n depends upon your own liking/capacity but may not be that important. impor=\r\ntantly to eat home food and saatwik food (Lighter, Fresh, without much oil,=\r\n spice)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -No Non Veg, Avoid or moderate Onion, Garlic, No Alcohole =\r\nand such stuff\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jay Mataji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Hiral Desai &lt;hdesai_wakhlu@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar to all members,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please advise on th=\r\ne type of Sadhanas that one can during Chaitra Navratri beginning from tomo=\r\nrrow.
