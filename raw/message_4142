Some of them are meaningfu=\r\nl to an extent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millen=\r\nnia by intellectuals.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homa=\r\nm for the pleasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicaliti=\r\nes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpat=\r\nhi homam everyday as a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at=\r\n these technicalities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If Agni (fire god) l=\r\neaves earth completely and goes to heavens (aakaasha) or netherworld (paata=\r\nala), there would be no activity on earth. You cannot breathe, digest food,=\r\n think or move your body. Even flow of signals in the nerves requires Agni.=\r\n Agni is present everywhere at all times. Even during his residence in heav=\r\nens or netherworld, Agni is certainly capable of acting on earth, receiving=\r\n our oblations here on earth and making them reach various deities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you want to get your father (or mother) to buy =\r\nyou a car or to give you money to start a business, you may want to pick a =\r\ngood time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not tired after qua=\r\nrrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course, even when you =\r\nthink you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your father may not =\r\nbe in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agendas and only wa=\r\nnt to tell your father &quot;I love you&quot; and take whatever he gives, you can do =\r\nit anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favored by parents ov=\r\ner the long run and will get whatever the parents have to give.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Simil=\r\narly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are several tech=\r\nnicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you may not ge=\r\nt it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many corruptions =\r\nin our understanding of the technicalities and the art of getting specific =\r\nmaterial results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best approach is to=\r\n surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express your love and =\r\nsurrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad. Such a per=\r\nson will be favored by deities over the long run.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Namaste Ramakishore,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Different points of space and different p=\r\noints of time have a different quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not th=\r\ne same as sadhana in Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chautur=\r\nthi is not the same as sadhana on Pournima.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is doing a specifi=\r\nc sadhana occasionally (e.g. a monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Ch=\r\nandi homam or a monthly Krishna homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/=\r\ntime that is aligned with the energy of that deity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, one can =\r\nonly make so much progress with occasional sadhana. To make real progress a=\r\nnd to experience divinity, more intense sadhana is needed. If one is into s=\r\nerious sadhana with a mantra/deity, one can do it every day and at all time=\r\ns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; A lot of beggars may be standing at the =\r\ngate of a king&#39;s palace, waiting for the king to see them when leaving/ente=\r\nring the palace and give them some money. That king may be known to step ou=\r\nt of the house to go to a specific place on every so and so day and there m=\r\nay be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gate on that day. But, by =\r\nstanding at the gate on that day along with so many beggars, you may or may=\r\n not be able to get something from the king. On the other hand, if you simp=\r\nly stand at the gate everyday, king&#39;s eyes may fall on you someday!\n&gt;  \n&gt; H=\r\nave the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, keep doing your chose=\r\nn sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity&#39;s grace. That is a sure=\r\nshot formula for success.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The issue of ausp=\r\nicious days and times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may b=\r\ne more auspicious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For =\r\nexample, if a particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expe=\r\nct to go there and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendul=\r\nkar, Gambhir and Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but=\r\n you may still get out cheaply.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of helping, sadhana done on a=\r\n particularly good day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expe=\r\nctancy. I remember one incident.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A few years ago, I decided oneday in=\r\n spring that I wanted to spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gaya=\r\ntri mantra for the whole day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not=\r\n look at anything like tithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahea=\r\nd. I mentioned it to Manish and he said, &quot;excellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated=\r\n with Gayatri mantra from 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times fo=\r\nr 2-minute breaks and having a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the mi=\r\nddle of the day. When I finished in the night, I was in a nice state.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Next morning, I realized that the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisak=\r\nha Sukla Tritiya, birthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga st=\r\narted). It is said that spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 =\r\ntimes more effective than a normal day. I was excited that the day I picked=\r\n at random happened to be an auspicious day.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I mentioned it to Manish=\r\n. He said, &quot;I knew it was Akshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the inten=\r\ntion to me&quot;. I asked him why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly rem=\r\narked, &quot;knowing you were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not ha=\r\nve helped and would have instead distracted you.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; He was right. As su=\r\nch, I was a little &quot;proud&quot; of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japam=\r\n. There was a bit of excitement and expectancy that was present as an under=\r\ncurrent and somewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I =\r\nwas doing it on a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effec=\r\ntive, that undercurrent of useless excitement would&#39;ve been higher and dist=\r\nracted me even more!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But w=\r\nhat really matters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on=\r\n an auspicious day can create excitement and expectancy and distract one. D=\r\noing the same sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to succeed oned=\r\nay is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy.

Als=\r\no related to this is the question of how do planets really affect us , Vima=\r\nlananda in the aghora books says it is through the rasa or food that is ing=\r\nested by us. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know science does not yet possess the right tools =\r\nto measure this phenomena and einstein&#39;s grand search for a unified filed t=\r\nheory and the universal particle is still ongoing and might take ages for m=\r\nodern science to understand the workings of even a commonplace phenomena li=\r\nke gravitation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However a simple test like admission rates in a me=\r\nntal aslyum should hold up to proof if the moon is truly having a effect on=\r\n humans.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=3Dlunacy=\r\n-and-the-full-moon\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This article in the scientific american finds n=\r\no such correlation...also there have been many studies in the past some for=\r\n and some against this correlation effect but none of them found a strong e=\r\nvidence....And always there is the risk of mistaking correlation as causati=\r\non in any experiment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is just out of curiosity that am asking t=\r\nhis question...Does astrology matter at all for a serious sadhaka. Can not =\r\nany day /time or hour be picked for worship. If the relationship with the d=\r\neity is truly personal why should one even consider the nava grahas in the =\r\nritual worship. I increasingly find that astrology is only serving to disco=\r\nurage the masses rather than pointing them in the direction of worship of d=\r\nivinity. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope you could throw some light on this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
