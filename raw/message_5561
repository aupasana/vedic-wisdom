Literally guru means dispeller of darkness. How=\r\never, how much darkness is dark? The room I am in now right now has several=\r\n lights placed in several places and there are different shades of shadows =\r\neverywhere. Some shadows are dark, some are darker, some are not so dark.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; As long as the delusion of individualized self-awareness (aka &quot;egosense&quot;=\r\n or ahamkara or asmita) persists and, through it, one experiences dualities=\r\n such as likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains etc, one is in *some* leve=\r\nl of darkness! Only a self-realized and liberated person is free from darkn=\r\ness. Any person who improves one&#39;s understanding of things through his teac=\r\nhing is *reducing* darkness, but not *dispelling* it completely. For this r=\r\neason, most spiritual gurus of today are not really gurus in the correct se=\r\nnse of the word. They are darkness reducers but not darkness dispellers.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; After all, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa vehemently protested whenever someone =\r\ncalled him a guru and declared firmly that only Parabrahma (supreme being) =\r\ncould be called a guru and nobody else was a guru. This from a man who sent=\r\n a highly rational being (young Narendranath) into samadhi by merely touchi=\r\nng him!\n&gt;\n&gt; So, we will examine whether this gentleman has some spiritual c=\r\naliber or not, instead of whether he is a genuine guru or not.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; This data seems like that of Paramahamsa Nithyananda. I was earlier given=\r\n his birthdata by someone as Jan 1. Your data seems more plausible. Moon in=\r\n Virgo makes more sense than Moon in Leo. A lot of things fall in place wit=\r\nh this data! Nice. Those who wrote Jan 1 were probably using traditional co=\r\nnventions of changing date at sunrise..\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; [Note: I am using Sri=\r\n Surya Siddhanta (SSS) for planetary calculation in this mail. It will be a=\r\nvailable in JHora soon. I am using standard Jyotish techniques that I found=\r\n to work well with the SSS calculations.]\n&gt;\n&gt; Using longitudes, Moon and Ra=\r\nhu are in the 12th house. This shows a mystic. In D-10, Moon, Mars and Jupi=\r\nter are in 9th house of fortune, in a super-friendly sign (adhimitra rasi).=\r\n They give powerful yogas. With them including 1st and 5th lords, this make=\r\ns him famous and gives great following. But Moon is also the 8th lord and c=\r\nan give a fall.\n&gt;\n&gt; Using Chara dasa of D-10 (read &quot;Making Chara Dasa of Pa=\r\nrasara Work!&quot; at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings/message/137 =\r\nfor more on this dasa), Le dasa ran till 2009. Containing Moon, Mars and Ju=\r\npiter (1st/5th lords), Le dasa made him very famous. But Cn dasa started in=\r\n 2009 and runs till 2020. With Cn being the 8th house and its lord afflicti=\r\nng the 9th house and 1st/5th lords, this dasa shows fall from dharma and fa=\r\nll from fame. With this being a long-term dasa, I am afraid he cannot recov=\r\ner from this sex scandal. I am afraid he is finished as far as fame is conc=\r\nerned. His best is over.\n&gt;\n&gt; In D-20, lagna lord Venus, yogakaraka (4th/5th=\r\n lord Saturn) and 9th lord Mercury are together in the 8th house in a Venus=\r\nian sign. This is a very powerful rajayoga in the 8th house. Hence I do not=\r\n think he is a fake sadhaka. IMHO, he is a good sadhaka who was blessed wit=\r\nh genuine mystical experiences (8th). However, AK Mercury is closely afflic=\r\nted by GK Saturn within 2 deg in Taurus (in D-20 of course). AK shows Self =\r\nand GK shows weaknesses and vulnerabilities and this shows someone vulnerab=\r\nle to a fall.\n&gt;\n&gt; As per Chara dasa of D-20, Sg dasa ran from 1989 to 2001.=\r\n This is the 3rd house of Gurupadesa (7th from 9th) containing Jupiter in m=\r\noolatrikona. It is also the 8th house of austerities from AK. He probably d=\r\nid some intense austerities and received blessings from guru(s). Then Cp da=\r\nsa from 2001 to 2009. This is the 4th house of direction and properties in =\r\nD-20. Being the 9th house of dharma from AK, it makes one fulfil one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma spiritually (D-20). Being the 4th house, he built an organization. The n=\r\next dasa is Aq till 2018. Aq is owned and aspected by GK Saturn and can giv=\r\ne the results of GK afflicting AK. Being the 10th from AK, it shows individ=\r\nualized Self (AK) working actively. Instead of becoming detached, individua=\r\nlized Self is becoming active. I am afraid he is not calm as cucumber inter=\r\nnally, however he may behave externally. His egosense is concerned about it=\r\ns future, becoming attached and working hard in self-interest. Then Pi dasa=\r\n during 2018-2021 and Ar dasa during 2021-2032 can give the best experience=\r\ns of his spiritual life, as Ar is the 12th from AK Mercury and its lord Mar=\r\ns is in Pi. Worship of Valli Sahita Subrahmanya (12th lord from AK is Mars =\r\nand with Moon) is recommended for him for more detachment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Overall, he =\r\nis a sadhaka who did some austerities, experienced some things, became famo=\r\nus before full realization and fell. This fall may be a blessing sent by hi=\r\ns real gurus. Careerwise, he may not recover. Sadhanawise, his best is yet =\r\nto come.\n&gt;\n&gt; How lucky was Swami Vivekananda that Ramakrishna guarded him f=\r\nrom becoming famous, until he was ready to handle it! How lucky was Paramah=\r\namsa Yogananda that Sri Yukteshwar Giri guarded him from becoming famous un=\r\ntil he was ready to handle it!\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, the reply I sent on vedic=\r\n-wisdom when someone sought my view soon after his sex scandal broke is ava=\r\nilable at:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3872\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI am including it at the end of this mail.\n&gt;\n&gt; An interview with Rajiv Malh=\r\notra published in later days suggested that he was practicing some tantrik =\r\nsex with mutual consent. I want to add my 2 cents on that line. Please forg=\r\nive my bluntness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tantrik sex is a buzzword that is abused by perverted=\r\n people who bring bad name to tantra.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sex is a human weakness and an ac=\r\ntivity that increases the binding of self-awareness to the physical body. I=\r\nt is not without a reason that many religious traditions value celibacy. Ho=\r\nwever, just as mowed grass can come back after the winter if roots remain u=\r\nnder the ground, similarly desires can come back after decades of celibacy =\r\nif the root conditioning remains under the surface. One can chant &quot;all is g=\r\nod, all is god&quot; for decades, encounter a beautiful naked body after decades=\r\n of celibacy and see in it an object that provokes certain impulses, rather=\r\n than seeing the same &quot;god&quot; that is in &quot;all&quot;. Staying away from something d=\r\noes not necessarily remove liking/disliking for it.\n&gt;\n&gt; A tantrika may put =\r\noneself in intimate company that normally provokes certain impulses and con=\r\nsciously try to chant mantras and overcome the impulses. There is nothing i=\r\nnherently impure in a naked body, but the impulses it evokes may take mind =\r\naway from god and to physical gratification and hence are &quot;impure&quot;. To cut =\r\ndown on the production of those impulses, that imagery has to be associated=\r\n in the mind with something else. The goal of so-called tantrik sex is not =\r\nhaving sex, but to resist temptation. If one is able to resist temptation, =\r\nchant mantras and focus mind on mantra/god even in the intimate company of =\r\na naked partner, seeing such imagery in future may not evoke impure impulse=\r\ns, but make one think of a mantra or god. Thus, tantrik sex is not really s=\r\nex and is ironically about maintaining celibacy (even mentally!) in tough p=\r\nhysical conditions. It is not for all and only for those who have a reasona=\r\nble level of self-control and want to perfect it further. One needs a capab=\r\nle partner.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is unfortunate that some people increase the already bad=\r\n name of &quot;tantrik sex&quot; by hiding behind the buzzword irresponsibly.\n&gt;\n&gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me not engage in empty exuberance and wish that the new year be =\r\ngreat, prosperous and all that. Who knows, it may or may not be. That does =\r\nnot really matter anyway. What matters is this.\n&gt;\n&gt; One more gregorian year=\r\n is over and world moves on to another one. If one tries to not make this y=\r\near also another statistic and strives to do something worthwhile with this=\r\n year, it will be good. If one uses this year to do some spiritual sadhana =\r\n(i.e. reading scriptures, engaging in practices such as meditation, homam e=\r\ntc, helping those in need and caring more about others than oneself), to im=\r\nprove one&#39;s attitude in life, to reduce one&#39;s sensitivity to the undesirabl=\r\ne aspects of life (that are there as a result of one&#39;s own previous karmas!=\r\n), to increase one&#39;s *acceptance* of what destiny throws at one and to use =\r\nfreewill wisely to engage in good, selfless and dharmik actions (that will =\r\ngenerate good karma for future!), then the new year will be worthwhile. Pro=\r\ngress in life in not measured in terms of happiness and prosperity, but in =\r\nterms of dharma, selflessness, usefulness to universe and equanimity in ple=\r\nasure and pain, adulation and adversity.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will try to see some more ch=\r\narts and answer pending queries next week.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;J.&quot; &lt;jkoperumcholan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Shri Narasimha Ji.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this self-proclaimed spiritual Guru genuine?

There may be some members of this group who make good progress i=\r\nn the coming years and people around them may start noticing their purity a=\r\nnd treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, imag=\r\ne, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated serv=\r\nant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-cons=\r\nciousness, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to ano=\r\nther and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if a spiritua=\r\nl master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by di=\r\nscussing those weaknesses.
