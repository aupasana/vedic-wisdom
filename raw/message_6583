The\n&gt; problem is =\r\nnot &quot;actions&quot;, but actions with attachment and a sense of\n&gt; ownership, i.e.=\r\n actions driven by the will and agenda of a limited ego.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actions should=\r\n not be spoken ill of like this. Detached action is a *sacred\n&gt; duty* of ev=\r\nery being. Gods and rishis came back again and again to earth to\n&gt; engage i=\r\nn detached action.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; If &quot;the atman is entirely op=\r\nposed to action&quot;, then why is atman (Self) even\n&gt; allowing action? Why does=\r\nn&#39;t it simply halt everything? Or, is all the\n&gt; action happening outside of=\r\n atman? Is there anything outside of atman at\n&gt; all?\n&gt;\n&gt; Some buddhist phil=\r\nosophies coined the term anatman (non-Self) to describe\n&gt; transient things.=\r\n But, in Vedic philosophy, there is no anatman. All that is\n&gt; is atman (Sel=\r\nf). Ocean is permanent and still, but ripples that arise in it\n&gt; are transi=\r\nent and moving. But ripples are part of ocean only and you do not\n&gt; start l=\r\nabeling ripples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Atman or Purusha or Shiva is the potent=\r\nial energy of this cosmos, while\n&gt; Maya or Prakriti or Shakti is the kineti=\r\nc energy of this cosmos. Shiva and\n&gt; Shakti are seen as different entities =\r\nby some people, but rishis have\n&gt; declared their oneness. Potential energy =\r\nbecomes kinetic energy and vice\n&gt; versa.\n&gt;\n&gt; Atman is the still ocean and M=\r\naya is the force (kinetic) that gives rise to\n&gt; moving ripples on the surfa=\r\nce. A ripple that exerts itself to move in a\n&gt; particular way keeps collidi=\r\nng with the force and keeps moving hither and\n&gt; tither in a chaotic way for=\r\n a very long time. A ripple that does not exert\n&gt; itself and moves smoothly=\r\n as dictated by the force will eventually grind to\n&gt; a halt and cease to ex=\r\nist as a ripple on the surface. It then becomes part\n&gt; of the still ocean. =\r\nIf a ripple exerts itself to become still, it may even\n&gt; take longer to bec=\r\nome still. What prolongs a ripple is not movement but\n&gt; resisting the direc=\r\ntion given by the force and exerting to move in a\n&gt; particular way (or even=\r\n exerting to become still). A ripple that surrenders\n&gt; to the force will ri=\r\nde the course and die down faster.\n&gt;\n&gt; Contemplate the imagery I presented =\r\nabove regarding Atman and Maya,\n&gt; ignorant/egoistic action and detached act=\r\nion! It is very apt.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; In not-so-distant past, sa=\r\nnnyasins remained in ashrams and isolated\n&gt; themselves from society and did=\r\n their sadhana. Swami Vivekananda started a\n&gt; new trend.\n&gt;\n&gt; A sannyasin re=\r\nnounces expectation of things from people stuck in transient\n&gt; material wor=\r\nld and does not depend on anyone. But he may still *give* basic\n&gt; material =\r\nthings to those hapless people stuck in transient material world!\n&gt; For exa=\r\nmple, Swami Vivekananda and his brother monks went to places struck\n&gt; by pl=\r\nague, floods, droughts, cyclones etc and served people. They provided\n&gt; foo=\r\nd, medicines etc (instead of lecturing that body is a transient illusion\n&gt; =\r\nand one should stop worrying about its welfare!) and also did construction\n=\r\n&gt; work. They ignored the welfare of their own bodies, put themselves at ris=\r\nk\n&gt; and overcame maya personally. But they served those still stuck in maya=\r\n\n&gt; without looking down upon them or their needs or maya that trapped them!=\r\n\n&gt; Those who wanted food got food, those who wanted medicines got medicines=\r\n and\n&gt; those who wanted books got books. Renunciation means you do not expe=\r\nct\n&gt; anything from anyone and accept whatever comes to you naturally. It do=\r\nes not\n&gt; necessarily mean rejecting or ignoring others. Overcoming maya doe=\r\ns not\n&gt; require belittling maya or belittling those still stuck in maya.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; The trend started by Swami Vivekananda was continued by Swami Sivananda.\n=\r\n&gt; For that reason, it is a bit weird to see him talking so ill of action! H=\r\ne\n&gt; was obviously trying to inspire a specific group of people for a specif=\r\nic\n&gt; body of work. These words are neither universal nor do they reflect hi=\r\ns\n&gt; tremendous wisdom I have seen elsewhere!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Al=\r\nl this intellectual discussion may be satisfying to some, but the quote\n&gt; f=\r\nrom Swami Brahmanananda in the other mail is very apt: &quot;You have been only\n=\r\n&gt; hearing of all these spiritual things. Now realise them. You have done\n&gt; =\r\nenough study and reasoning. Now do some spiritual practice. First take up\n&gt;=\r\n that aspect of God which appeals to you most. Follow your own path of\n&gt; Sa=\r\ndhana. When you realise God through it, you will feel the joy of realising\n=\r\n&gt; Him also in other aspects and through other paths.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; According to Rama=\r\nkrishna, Swami Brahmananda was a gopala who accompanied\n&gt; Lord Krishna in a=\r\n previous life. His words are simple, pragmatic and\n&gt; powerful.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want =\r\nthis forum to facilitate exchange of Vedic knowledge (and I will\n&gt; also be =\r\ncontributing, though in spurts). But I want more that this forum\n&gt; should i=\r\nnspire people to do sadhana and find God.

The sruti=\r\n says: =E2=80=9CWhen to him everything has become the Self, who should see =\r\nwhat and through what should one see?=E2=80 etc. This nullifies the meaning=\r\n of actions in one who has knowledge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;MIN-HEIGHT: 0px; COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--bcaec52999f91ac7b604a62a40b7--\r\n\n"}}
