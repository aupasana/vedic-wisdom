I am pretty sure the learned members can better =\r\nanswer your questions. \n\nJust sharing my opinion.\n\n1.Vipassana is a very go=\r\nod technique, Paramahamsa Nithyananda often says Vipassana and Upasana are =\r\ntwo sides of the same coin. Buddhism and Hinduism had a common origin and s=\r\nhare many meditation practises.\n\n2.It was simply beautiful to look at your =\r\ndescription of your inner conversation with your mental imagery. \n\n3.Pranic=\r\n healing and Reiki are both powerful methods. I can draw the parallel to th=\r\ne Twin hearts meditation practised in pranic healing with the way you sough=\r\nt permission and the whole visualization.Also sending pranic healing/reiki =\r\nin the direction of a departed soul will help it find its way to a better w=\r\nomb .So I beleive you are doing good.\n\n4.The hen sacrifice you mentioned in=\r\n hyd is usually done for grama devatas...hyd before the boom being witnesse=\r\nd now was mostly rural atleast at its periphery. Orissa and Andhra used to =\r\nhave a vibrant tantric tradition ( Temple of the sixty four yoginis in oris=\r\nsa is an example ) .The concept of an protector goddess for the village or =\r\ngrama devata comes from this....though the worship is not sattvic in nature=\r\n.  Black hen does have an prominent place atleast in tantra  left handed ta=\r\nntra ( not implying the left is inferior to the right..both have their uses=\r\n).\n\nI am not sure of the spiritual meaning of the hen appearing there, the =\r\ndivine probably chooses the most convienient body nearby to appear.\n\n\nThank=\r\n you for sharing your experience once again.\n\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sharadsap&quot; &lt;sharadsap@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear=\r\n Members,\n&gt; After a lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to sh=\r\nare an experience with the members on this forum - hoping that doing so wou=\r\nld elicit some feedback in the form of further guidance.  \n&gt; \n&gt; I am a stud=\r\nent of Vipassana and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recen=\r\ntly started a simple version of Durga Homam) &#39;almost&#39; regularly for a year =\r\nnow. And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and inte=\r\nrest. \n&gt; \n&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after str=\r\nuggling with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderaba=\r\nd. When we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final ri=\r\ntes, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya =\r\nhai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chand=\r\ni Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering=\r\n if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought=\r\n how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funer=\r\nal - so that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then im=\r\nmediately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, bu=\r\nt I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can=\r\n do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started=\r\n experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially in/=\r\naround the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensat=\r\nions as equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would chan=\r\nge&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of =\r\nthe mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my =\r\nmental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I a=\r\nsked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now=\r\n when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and =\r\nhe went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the a=\r\nbove 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. \n&gt; \n&gt; It was my first ti=\r\nme at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/=\r\ndead body at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me=\r\n, but soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at su=\r\nnset time), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all =\r\nthe friends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in suk=\r\nhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them t=\r\nhat I would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;somethi=\r\nng&#39; happens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivi=\r\nd description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform,=\r\n so I think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly =\r\nme!!):). \n&gt; \n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my gran=\r\ndparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings i=\r\nn my very first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator=\r\n, I am used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fas=\r\nt. I continued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred e=\r\nnough. I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with=\r\n the purest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind=\r\n and found the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father ac=\r\ncumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;ma=\r\nngalmayee&#39;. I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitem=\r\nent too in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not =\r\nwant to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the tru=\r\nth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have do=\r\nne homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have be=\r\nlieved and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/null=\r\nification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same =\r\nspeed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind t=\r\nhat I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and =\r\nhis journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, s=\r\no please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Pl=\r\nease pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; After =\r\nthis mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even =\r\nthough I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ON=\r\nLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my=\r\n mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should =\r\nnot really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visu=\r\nalise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and=\r\n fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying=\r\n to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his f=\r\neet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my m=\r\nind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skelet=\r\nal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is th=\r\ne form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repea=\r\nted mentally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of my ignorance=\r\n. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the=\r\n context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I to=\r\nld Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to b=\r\ne fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n&gt; \n&gt; I ha=\r\nd a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what =\r\nI was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visual=\r\nising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visua=\r\nlise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at t=\r\nhe end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam witho=\r\nut the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation=\r\n of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise h=\r\ner lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few =\r\nminutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw i=\r\nt at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think=\r\n about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see =\r\nif the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and=\r\n did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was si=\r\nlly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I =\r\ncontinued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and op=\r\nened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it ha=\r\nd a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land n=\r\next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) af=\r\nter descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funer=\r\nal and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the h=\r\nen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perha=\r\nps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the fire particles=\r\n (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the=\r\n funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched th=\r\ne bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instea=\r\nd of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for u=\r\ns to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I continued t=\r\nhe mental chanting. \n&gt; \n&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time =\r\nfor everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the e=\r\nxit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet i=\r\ntself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my i=\r\nmpudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three tim=\r\nes, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonderi=\r\nng how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? =\r\nAnother cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry =\r\nup and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen ex=\r\nactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyo=\r\nne to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied =\r\nthe contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again =\r\nfor my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and threw =\r\nit at the funeral pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and reques=\r\nted her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the y=\r\nahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; When I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the f=\r\nuneral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there befor=\r\ne (could be because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). \n&gt; \n&gt; On the way b=\r\nack home and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I =\r\nwould&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of wha=\r\nt happened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I th=\r\ninking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within my existence that e=\r\nvening. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions,=\r\n just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of =\r\nmy own imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silen=\r\nce was the most beautiful thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; The next day, I heard my brother tel=\r\nl my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed t=\r\noo big and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of &#39;=\r\nperception&#39; or love for our father.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that it is few days since that=\r\n incident, I have questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is=\r\n? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between=\r\n the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/M=\r\naa temples? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then=\r\n why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two =\r\nfeet) a half-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some r=\r\neiki to him? \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure if these questions can be answered or if t=\r\nhey should be answered at all, but based on the above experience, if anyone=\r\n has any input/lessons/guidance/teachings, I would be most appreciative.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. \n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nlso, apologies for the length of the note.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Sharad\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
