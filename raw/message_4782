Regarding Krishna and gopis:\n \nThe love of gopis for Krishna =\r\nis not physical. Gopis were re-incarnations of blessed beings from higher l=\r\nokas (realms of consciousness) and were instinctively drawn to Krishna as t=\r\nhey were aware that Krishna was the perfected being. They had perfect surre=\r\nnder to the perfected being and aspired for his company always.\n \nThe story=\r\n of vastraapaharana (Krishna stealing the clothes of gopis from the riverba=\r\nnk while they were bathing in the river and forcing them to come out of the=\r\n river without clothes) explains complete surrender and has an esoteric mea=\r\nning. The sensual overtones some may perceive in the story are an unfortuna=\r\nte side effect of the overly sensualized society we live in.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nLet me talk about the esoteric meaning.\n \nGopi literally means th=\r\ne shakti that has control over the cows. Cows and horses in RigVeda symboli=\r\nze the jnanendriyas and karmendriyas respectively. After all, this is the m=\r\neaning in &quot;Sri Sooktam&quot; also, where we encounter &quot;ashvadaayI ca godaayI&quot;, t=\r\nhough that line has been superficially interpreted by scholars as &quot;one who =\r\ngives cows and horses&quot;. Extolling Sri Maha Lakshmi as the giver of two spec=\r\nific kinds of cattle would be too frivolous for RigVeda, which represents t=\r\nhe timeless and uncreated absolute knowledge rather than relative knowledge=\r\n bound by space and time. The true meaning is that our jnanendriyas and kar=\r\nmendriyas come into being and operate through the shakti of the Mother. Any=\r\nway, let us go back to gopis.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWithin us, gopis repr=\r\nesent the control over the senses. Control of various kinds over the senses=\r\n will restrict the sense activity and safeguard one&#39;s purity. But, merely b=\r\ny controlling or restricting the senses, one cannot reach god or merge in g=\r\nod. The goal of the shaktis that represent control over senses is to merge =\r\nin the Infinite. That is what the desire of gopis to be with Krishna repres=\r\nents.\n \nClothes represent conditioning with gunas. Even as one controls/res=\r\ntricts sense activity, there may be pride about it and several other types =\r\nof conditioning that colors the control exerted over sense activity. That i=\r\ns what the clothes of gopis represent! Gopis going to Krishna without cloth=\r\nes represents pride and other conditioning being withdrawn from one&#39;s contr=\r\nol over senses, one&#39;s self-control becoming pure and devoid of ANY conditio=\r\nning and then merging in the Supreme.\n \nAs I said, the sensual overtones so=\r\nme may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect of the overly s=\r\nensualized society we live in.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding all people=\r\n being women and the Supreme being a man:\n \nThis is also an esotetic concep=\r\nt and not physical or sensual in nature.\n \nIn this universe, masculine spir=\r\nit represents the potential energy and feminine spirit represents the kinet=\r\nic energy. Supreme Cosmic Being or Parama Purusha exists as the potentialit=\r\ny behind the entire universe. He is the potential energy. Shakti or the kin=\r\netic energy that is running the show in this entire universe manifests in e=\r\nach person as his/her Kundalini shakti. It is through the Kundalini shakti =\r\nthat one is aware of the universe and acts in it. One&#39;s awareness of the wo=\r\nrld is colored by one&#39;s conditioning. As Kundalini shakti awakens, rises, p=\r\nurifies herself and drops off all conditioning that colors one&#39;s self-aware=\r\nness, it will rise to sahasrara and has a union with Parama Purusha. Instea=\r\nd of being aware of oneself as a limited object that perceives and interact=\r\ns with so many other objects, one then is absorbed in an awareness of the S=\r\nupreme Potentiality of the entire universe. Kundalini shakti (one&#39;s self-aw=\r\nareness) is symbolically represented as a female deity. She awakens (one st=\r\narts to search for true self), purifies herself, sheds her clothing (condit=\r\nioning that colors one&#39;s self-awareness) and ultimately has a union with th=\r\ne supreme being in sahasrara.\n \nAll this is symbolic and esoteric in meanin=\r\ng. Any sensuality one perceives in this depiction is simply due to the cond=\r\nitioning of one&#39;s mind.\n \n*        *        *\n \n[Warning: Some raw and unin=\r\nhibited language in the remainder of this mail MAY offend some sensitive an=\r\nd conservative readers.]\n \n2. Regarding references to body parts:\n \nThere i=\r\ns nothing inherently &quot;titillating&quot; in a breast or other body parts. When a =\r\nbaby sees the breast, for example, the baby thinks of milk and nourishment.=\r\n There are no other thoughts in the baby&#39;s mind!\n \nOur problems and weaknes=\r\nses do not lie in external objects. They lie in our own minds. When one see=\r\ns a luxury car, one can just appreciate its elegance, power and beauty and =\r\nleave it at that. One need not think, &quot;I must somehow have this car&quot; or ima=\r\ngine what one can do if one has that car. When one sees a briefcase contain=\r\ning one million dollars, one can just appreciate that it is a lot of money =\r\nand a lot of things can be bought with it. One need not think, &quot;I must some=\r\nhow have this money&quot; or imagine what one can do if one has that money. Simi=\r\nlarly, when one sees a breast, one can just appreciate its ability to nurtu=\r\nre new life. One need not imagine what one can do with it. When one sees a =\r\nvagina, one can just appreciate it as the source of new life.\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nUnfortunately, ego and conditioning make one think unnecessary t=\r\nhoughts about every object perceived by senses. Ego and mental conditioning=\r\n make one introduce oneself mentally in the middle of all objects perceived=\r\n by senses and engage in mental actions with those objects. Those mental ac=\r\ntions are of course shaped by one&#39;s own conditioning! THAT is the problem. =\r\nThe over-materialization and over-sexualization prevalent in our society ma=\r\nkes the conditioning deeper and more difficult to shake off. But the goal o=\r\nf sadhana is to shake off all conditioning.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen an=\r\n evolved yogi sees a beautiful naked body, he need not close eyes and run a=\r\nway. He need not feel uncomfortable or embarrassed or self-conscious when l=\r\nooking at or talking about it. There is nothing inherently wrong or sinful =\r\nin a naked body. It is not an object of lust by itself, though it may seem =\r\nlike an object of lust to a mind conditioned with lust. Even if such a cond=\r\nitioned person takes sannyasa and remains in a forest for 30 years away fro=\r\nm everybody, he may feel lust if he suddenly sees a beautiful naked body af=\r\nter those 30 years of brahmacharya. On the other hand, when an evolved yogi=\r\n who overcame this conditioning sees a beautiful naked body, he may not clo=\r\nse eyes and run away. He may notice its beauty (just like one may notice th=\r\ne beauty of a roadside scenery or waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or =\r\na sunrise over a lake etc) and appreciate the Creator for creating objects =\r\nof infinite variety and beauty. Thoughts of lust (e.g. I can do so and so t=\r\nhing with this body, it will be nice to do so and so thing with this body, =\r\netc) may not even arise in his mind!\n \nOf course, when one is lustful, the =\r\nbest thing to do is to keep oneself away from objects that provoke lust. Bu=\r\nt the final goal is to reach the above state.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen =\r\nyou encounter references of body parts in ancient devotional literature, yo=\r\nu should realize that those authors had overcome lust and were childlike. T=\r\nalking of a breast or navel would not make them lustful or uncomfortable or=\r\n embarrassed. There was no difference between talking about a breast or a n=\r\navel that they saw and talking about a scenery or a waterfall or snowfall o=\r\nver a mountain or sunrise over a lake that they saw.\n \nWhen a goddess revea=\r\nled herself to them, there was no need to cover her breasts. Clothes repres=\r\nent covering by additional conditioning and gunas. If goddess revealed hers=\r\nelf to one with more conditioning, there was a need for more clothes, jewel=\r\nlery etc. If goddess revealed herself to a childlike one with no conditioni=\r\nng, unconditioned raw form is just fine. After all, a woman may feel comfor=\r\ntable standing naked in front of a baby, while she will cover herself prope=\r\nrly when coming in front of a twenty year old son whose mind looks at thing=\r\ns differently.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBottomline: Those yogis and authors =\r\nwere unconditioned by lust and were shown what they were ready to see and t=\r\nhey described what they saw. Moreover, everything has a symbolic meaning to=\r\no. However, if you are teaching a young and conditioned mind, I&#39;d suggest n=\r\not teaching verses that can appear to be explicit or provocative. It is eas=\r\ny to misunderstand or get erotic thoughts in the mind, though that is not t=\r\nhe intention of the author. After all, let me give an analogy. Suppose seei=\r\nng anything red makes a person remember a bloodbath one saw earlier, become=\r\n enraged and go and kill the enemies. Suppose you have a picture of abhishe=\r\nkam of a Lalita idol with kumkum (sacred red vermillion powder). You better=\r\n not show the picture to that person..\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   =\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n =\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste all learned friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few questions for which I am=\r\n sincerely seeking answers. The questions pertain to Mathura Bhakti traditi=\r\non as well as some very popular works of great sages and saints of our belo=\r\nved Bharata Varsha. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. There is this tradition of envisioning the lor=\r\nd (paramatma) as the only purusha and all the humanity (various jeevatmas) =\r\nas women and thereby jeevatmas seeking union with paramatma culminating in =\r\nsalvation. We have seen examples of great saints like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu=\r\n who were stalwarts of this path. And this explains the Krishna tatva in Sr=\r\nimad bhagavatam as well in gopika vastra apaharana / rasaleela episodes. Wh=\r\nile I think I understand this concept very well, I find it very hard to exp=\r\nlain it 1. To someone who is foreign to our culture and 2. To people who in=\r\ntentionally malign the image of our rich Vedic traditions and 3. To kids wh=\r\no might come up with questions on this subject. What is the best way to exp=\r\nlain it in these situations? \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In Lalitha Sahasranama stotra as well=\r\n as Saundarya Lahari stotra, Veda Vyasa and Adi Sankara respectively have d=\r\nescribed the mother goddess in a very detailed way detailing on specific bo=\r\ndy parts. Yes, undoubtedly they have envisioned the formless nirguna Brahma=\r\nn as their beloved mother, but where from is this tradition anga-anga varna=\r\nna (part - by part description) of mother? While I have no problem in accep=\r\nting those and include those in my daily prayers, how do we sensibly / conv=\r\nincingly explain these to the above groups of people? \n&gt; \n&gt; Not only in the=\r\nse, I find reference to woman&#39;s body parts quite liberally in most of the a=\r\nncient sanskrit / telugu literature and I want to know why? Examples are Sr=\r\ni Krishna Ashtakam, Venkateshwara stotra that follows soon after Suprabhata=\r\n (kamala kucha choochuka kumkumatO ....) and so on. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pardon me if I am=\r\n sounding naive... But having to teach some of these to a teenage kid... I =\r\nreally do not know how to approach, in case of any questions! \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards=\r\n, \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj\n\n\n"}}
