I&#39;ve faced this dilema in the past but now over time, =\r\nmy understanding has become clearer (atleast i feel that way).\n\nJust take e=\r\nxamples of Ganapati Atharvashirsha and Sri Sukta. They both are having quit=\r\ne a few verses in the end which describes Phalshruti. Like wise there are m=\r\nany spiritual texts that are coupled with Phalshruti. It is observed that m=\r\nost of the &#39;Propagated Fruits&#39; are for Material benefits.\n\nIt is very logic=\r\nal to assume that when one reads such stotras or spiritual knowledge source=\r\ns such as Bhagvad Gita only for the sake of spiritual progress, meaning imp=\r\nroving upon the inner faculties such as discrimination, detachment, humilit=\r\ny etc., One does not need to recite Phalshruti.\n\nIt is my well considered o=\r\npinion that Phalshruti can be skipped entirely even if there present a vers=\r\ne which says that if one does not read Phalshruti path then the whole effor=\r\nt will be fruitless !\n\nIt is very likely that these &quot;Fruits verses&#39; were ad=\r\nded to the basic text to attract people so that they are ultimately benefit=\r\ned spiritually. Like Nityaananda (Nitai) famously allure people to chant Ha=\r\nri Naam.   \n\nNarasimha Garu will surely enlighten us all.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nU=\r\ntpal\n   \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;puneetrph&quot; &lt;puneetrph@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Very often the phatal sruthi of variou=\r\ns stotras extend the stotra by quite a bit. I understand the importance of =\r\nchanting the Rishi, meter bijam, shakti, kilakam, and purpose at the beginn=\r\ning; but is it needed to continue on and also recite the phala sruthi in th=\r\ne end? Sometimes it is as long as the actual benediction itself. It basical=\r\nly tells of all of the fruits that one would gain by reciting the stotra, a=\r\nuspicious times to do it etc.. Does one lose out if they stop before this p=\r\nart of the stotra?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Puneet\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
