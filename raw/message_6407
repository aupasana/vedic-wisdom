He was the greatest votary of karma. He argued wit=\r\nh Sri Shankaracharya for days together on the point that sannyasa is not ne=\r\ncessary. He wanted to establish that we can attain mukti or salvation by ka=\r\nrma marga and that nivritti is not absolutely essential. But at last Sri Sh=\r\nankara defeated Mandana Misra and he also became one of the four disciples =\r\nof Shankara. When such a mighty man became a sannyasi, are you not convince=\r\nd that sannyasa is necessary? \n\n\n"}}
