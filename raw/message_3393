You have come very cl=\r\nose to resolving my\ntheoretical doubts as far as Realization and Samadhi is=\r\n concerned.\n\nI request to answer a few more questions on your explanations.=\r\n\n\n***\nYou have mentioned the 3rd type of realization and stated - &quot;This is =\r\nan\nopen-ended process.&quot; That statement is enough and for me, there is\nnothi=\r\nng to understand further in this type of *Open Loop* realization. I\nam sati=\r\nsfied with the understanding that such rarest beings are the one\nwho may la=\r\nst till the end of creation cycle. If i may give examples such\nas Babaji, R=\r\namakrishna, various Rishis, Gods such as Krishna and such\nbeings...\n***\nmy =\r\nquestion is related to 1st and 2nd type of realization.\n\nYou have mentioned=\r\n in Dualistic type realization (which Mira bai had\nknown to attain) - &quot;: On=\r\ne can experience closeness to deities, oneness\nto deities&quot;\n\nIn the Non-dual=\r\nistic realization, you mentioned - &quot;&gt; When one goes to\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, =\r\none may either come back and deal with duality again\nor merge in it forever=\r\n&quot;\n\nI wish to understand one thing here. &quot;Oneness to deities&quot; in Dualistic\na=\r\nnd &quot;merging in to Brahman forever&quot; in Non-Dualistic (Adwaitic) are same\nin =\r\nnature? i mean, When a bhakta merges in to  a deity completely\nwithout any =\r\ntrace (For example, Mira Bai was believed to have merged in\nKrishna idol) a=\r\nnd a Yogi merges forever in Brahman in Nirvikalpa Samadhi\n- both have attai=\r\nned the same end?\n\nOne more query within the above. When a Bhakta (Dwaitic =\r\nsaadhana) merges\nin to a Deity, does he/she still needs to attain Nirvikalp=\r\na Samadhi or\nis it a final end for the person? Why i ask this is because Ra=\r\nmakrishna\nused to frequently tell his disciples that Merging in Brahman is =\r\nthe\nlast thing. Most probably he was referring to the forever merging of\nSa=\r\ndhaka in Nirvikalpa Samadhi but it&#39;s my feeling that he was not\nconsidering=\r\n as &#39;Final thing&#39; for Dualistic Oneness with a Deity.\n\nI hope you understoo=\r\nd what i am asking here.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt;\n&gt; R=\r\nealization comes in many levels. I will broadly classify it in 3\ngroups:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; (1) Dual Realization: One can experience closeness to deities, oneness\nto=\r\n deities etc and realize aspects of Self from a dual perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) N=\r\non-dual Realization: One can merge in non-dual Self. This is\nNirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi.\n&gt;\n&gt; When one goes to Nirvikalpa samadhi, one may either come back and=\r\n deal\nwith duality again or merge in it forever. If it is the latter, that\n=\r\n(i.e. realization of non-dual Self) is the &quot;final realization&quot; for *that\nbe=\r\ning*.\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) Realization of Non-difference between Duality and Non-duality=\r\n:\nThis is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality after merging\nin=\r\n non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality is the\nsimple un=\r\nderlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is\nimperceptible and re=\r\nached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is\nperceptible, but its ch=\r\nallenge is that it has infinite variety and is\npursued through an I-ness an=\r\nd its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive\nand realizing the oneness of the =\r\ntwo is an infinite process with no\nsingle event signaling a &quot;perfect&quot; reali=\r\nzation. Rishis and deities are\npursuing it constantly.\n&gt;\n&gt; When some gods o=\r\nr rishis are back on earth, they may come back to\nduality after Nirvikalpa =\r\nsamadhi and proceed to deal with the oneness of\nduality or non-dual Self. W=\r\nhen some other classes of beings reach\nNirvikalpa samadhi, they do not come=\r\n back. As Ramakrishna says, this is\nlike a salt doll that goes to survey th=\r\ne depth of the ocean merging in\nocean before reaching the ocean bed.\n&gt;\n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; One cannot question why some characters in one&#39;s drea=\r\nm last for the\nentire dream and some characters last a short time. It is th=\r\ne\nprerogative of the dreamer. Similarly, we are all dream objects in\nSuprem=\r\ne Cosmic Being&#39;s long dream called Creation and we cannot question\nwhy some=\r\n beings are meant to merge in non-dual self and some are meant\nto last furt=\r\nher.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Adwaita teaches the universe is unreal, it is correct. We are=\r\n\njust dream characters. But then, it is also correct that different dream\nc=\r\nharacters have different roles to play *within* the dream. Some take\npart i=\r\nn the dream till the end knowing it is a dream. Some exit the\ndream once th=\r\ney realize it is immaterial. Some take part in the dream\nwithout knowing it=\r\n is a dream and become quite worried.

It is a significant=\r\n step in one&#39;s spiritual\nevolution, but still not the ultimate.&quot; - Sadhguru=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are various types of samadhis. For the sake of\nunderstan=\r\nding, samadhis have been classified into eight forms. Of these\neight, they =\r\nhave been broadly categorized as savikalpa and nirvikalpa,\nsamadhis with at=\r\ntributes or qualities and samadhis without attributes or\nqualities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; We see with Isha Yoga, people go into different types of samadhis.\nHer=\r\ne it is common to witness both savikalpa and nirvikalpa types.\nSamadhi is a=\r\n certain state of equanimity where the intellect goes beyond\nits normal fun=\r\nction of discrimination. This, in turn, loosens one from\nhis physical body.=\r\n In samadhi states, one becomes loose inside the body\nor there is a space b=\r\netween what is you and your body. These samadhis,\nby themselves have no gre=\r\nat significance in terms of Realization.\nExperiencing a certain type of sam=\r\nadhi, does not mean you are released\nfrom Existence. It is just a new level=\r\n of experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is like when you were a child, you had one l=\r\nevel of experience,\nonce you moved into your adulthood, you have another le=\r\nvel of\nexperience. The same things that you have experienced at a particula=\r\nr\npoint in your life, after a few years, you experience them in a totally\nd=\r\nifferent way. So, you have moved from one level of experience to\nanother le=\r\nvel of experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Samadhis are just like this. You are moving =\r\nfrom one level of\nexperience to another level of experience in a much more =\r\nsignificant and\ndeeper sense. Still, it is just another level of experience=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Somebody may go into a certain level of samadhi and stay ther=\r\ne for\nyears because it is enjoyable. There is no space or time. There are n=\r\no\nbodily problems. He has broken the physical and psychological barriers\nto=\r\n some extent. But this is only temporary. The moment he comes out,\nagain he=\r\n gets hungry, he has to sleep, and again everything comes back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Samadhi definitely has its benefits. There are many things it has\nto offer=\r\n for an individual, but this doesn&#39;t really take you closer to\nRealization,=\r\n as such. Compared to a man who is sober, a man who is\nslightly drunk, has =\r\na different level of experience, but he has to come\ndown at some point. All=\r\n samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high\nwithout any external chem=\r\nicals. Now, by going into these states, it\nopens up a new dimension for you=\r\n, but it doesn&#39;t leave any great\ntransformation behind. It doesn&#39;t leave yo=\r\nu permanently transformed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You have not moved into another real=\r\nity. In the same reality, your\nlevel of experiences has deepened. You have =\r\nexperienced the same things\nin a little deeper sense. You have not become f=\r\nree from the mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, somebody meditates for 12 years and com=\r\nes out. Even after 12\nyears, he may not be a realized being, but, maybe he =\r\nis a little closer.\nWhen you go into another reality and stay there for lon=\r\ng hours or long\nyears, the grip of this reality is broken on you. Now, you =\r\nhave come to\nan experiential understanding that, this is not it. Not just a=\r\nn\nintellectual understanding, you have seen experientially that this is\nnot=\r\n it. That is the whole purpose of long meditations. But most realized\nbeing=\r\ns never went into samadhi states.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gautama never sat for 12 year=\r\ns in one place. Many of his\ndisciples, many Buddhist monks went into very l=\r\nong meditations. They\nnever came out for years, but Gautama himself never w=\r\nent, because he saw\nit is not necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He practiced and exper=\r\nienced all the eight kinds of samadhis\nbefore his enlightenment and he disc=\r\narded them. He said, &quot;This is not\nit&quot;. This is not going to take you any cl=\r\noser to realization. It is just\nmoving into a higher level of experience an=\r\nd probably you will get more\ncaught up, because it is more beautiful than t=\r\nhe current reality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the goal is set, if you&#39;ve made realizat=\r\nion the top priority in\nyour life, then every thing else which doesn&#39;t take=\r\n you one step closer\nis meaningless. Let&#39;s say you are climbing the Mount E=\r\nverest, you will\nnot take one step sideways, because every ounce of energy =\r\nis needed.\nNow, if you have to transcend your own consciousness, you need e=\r\nvery\nounce of what you have and it&#39;s not enough. So, any action that we\nper=\r\nform, we don&#39;t want it to be a sidewinder.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We have created powe=\r\nrful consecrated spaces where experiencing\nsamadhi states comes very natura=\r\nlly. There are samadhis that are very\npleasant, blissful, and ecstatic and =\r\nthere are samadhis that are beyond\nthis. Those who go into samadhi states b=\r\neyond pleasant or unpleasant, or\nnirvikalpa, we always keep them in protect=\r\ned states as their contact\nwith the body has become very minimal. The small=\r\nest disturbance, like a\nsound or a pinprick would dislodge them from their =\r\nbody. These states\nare maintained for certain periods to establish the dist=\r\ninction between\nyou and the body. It is a significant step in one&#39;s spiritu=\r\nal evolution,\nbut still not the Ultimate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot;\n&lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [&quot;When I am in Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experien=\r\nce.

Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being\nwhere there\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no &quot;experiencer&quot;, nothing &quot;to experience&quot; and also no act of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;experiencing&quot;. In other words, there is no observer (subject),\nobserved=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (object) and observing (action). All merge into one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I-ness (the sense that &quot;this is I. There are others. I\ncan\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observe them&quot;) disappears, what is the basis for any\nobjectificatio=\r\nn in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Supreme Cosmic Essence? If there is no objectification, ho=\r\nw\ncan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there be any experience or observation? If there is no\nobserv=\r\nation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that there is nothing to describe in Nirv=\r\nikalpa\nsamadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to m=\r\ne: &quot;When I am\nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus, =\r\nanything I say\nabout\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actu=\r\nally the\nobservation of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I-ness as it is being torn down or being=\r\n reconstructed, i.e.\njust before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or after Nirvikalpa samadhi but no=\r\nt *during* it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is essentially the problem wit=\r\nh &quot;describing&quot; Nirvikalpa\nsamadhi!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; In terms of the diamond analogy quoted by Kishore, what\ndifferent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; yogis are saying about the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi\nsays more\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; about the path they are taking into the inside of the diamond,\nrathe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than describing the inside of the diamond itself. One may think\n&quot;=\r\nnothing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really exists apart from Brahman - all this I am perceiving=\r\n is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive is actually\nBrah=\r\nman&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another may think &quot;all that I perceive is actually a minute p=\r\nart\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna&quot;. And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness on a\ns=\r\npecific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought and everything else disappears from the mind, one i=\r\ns in\nsamadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvikalp=\r\na samadhi.\nHowever,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one can only describe the last thought on which=\r\n I-ness was\nfocused prior\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvika=\r\nlpa samadhi itself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some yogis prefer the stage jus=\r\nt before Nirvikalpa samadhi\nwhere a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trace of I-ness is left in an i=\r\nntense focus on one thought, to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi itself.

Now I see this l=\r\nine in different ways - 1) As different\nsaints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have mentioned diffe=\r\nrent sadhanas/paths to achieve God. 2)\nSecondly as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you mentioned, t=\r\nhat Truth is One, but saints call it\ndifferently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom=C2 from the diamond analogy I understand that if=C2 X\nreaches a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n certain face of the diamond and Y reaches another face of the\ndiamond,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; they percieve it differently, thought both faces are the same\ndiamond,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just different aspects. This is OK. This can be equal to\nsavikalpa=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; samadhi and may be experienced differently depending upon the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; individual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As yo=\r\nu break through any face of the diamond\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and jump into the inter=\r\nior of the diamond, you no longer\nperceive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the faces=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n of the diamond or the world outside.

Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2  the s=\r\name? I thought, whichever face\nof teh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diamond you chose as your ent=\r\nry point, the middle of teh diamond\nshould\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel and look exactly si=\r\nmilar. Please correct me if I am wrong\nin my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding.=C2 =C2 =\r\nAnd yet these three spiritual gaints\nhave spoken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differently of the=\r\nir realizations. If duality itself does not\nexist,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then how can the=\r\n field of possiblity at all arise? Which means,\nhow can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there be a =\r\ndifference in the &quot;perception&quot; of the same One final\nTruth?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Not to mention the query about whether, that which is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nranscendental in its basic nature (Truth/One/Middle of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diamond)=\r\n,=C2 can=C2 at all be=C2 described from within the\nfield of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duality=\r\n? Then I wonder why these three people - saints of\nhighest order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - =\r\ntry to describe it when all descriptions are from within\nduality...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Considering the above, I understand the wisdom (theoritica=\r\nlly)\nof why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also wonder whether=C2 the three saints, Sri Rama=\r\nna\nMaharishi, Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking from teh =\r\nsame\nrealization of=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the One/Truth, or was it different kinds of =\r\nrealizations. By\nthis I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean, can it be possible that there are dif=\r\nferent intermediate\nor not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly documented stages of samadhi ap=\r\nart from the\nstandard=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I can understand that maybe Buddha did not mention a void=\r\n\nper se,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he probably mentioned that there is nothing - for lack of =\r\nany\nbetter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; words -=C2 and stopped further discussion.

I will broadly classify it in 3 groups:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) Dual Realization: One can experience closeness to=\r\n deities, oneness to deities etc and realize aspects of Self from a dual pe=\r\nrspective.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Non-dual Realization: One can merge i=\r\nn non-dual Self. This is Nirvikalpa samadhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When on=\r\ne goes to Nirvikalpa samadhi, one may either come back and deal with dualit=\r\ny again or merge in it forever. If it is the latter, that (i.e. realization=\r\n of non-dual Self) is the &quot;final realization&quot; for *that being*.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) Realization of Non-difference between Duality and Non-duali=\r\nty: This is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality after merging =\r\nin non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality is the simple =\r\nunderlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is imperceptible and =\r\nreached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is perceptible, but its =\r\nchallenge is that it has infinite variety and is pursued through an I-ness =\r\nand its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive and realizing the oneness of th=\r\ne two is an infinite process with no single event signaling a &quot;perfect&quot; rea=\r\nlization. Rishis and deities are pursuing it constantly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; When some gods or rishis are back on earth, they may come back to dual=\r\nity after Nirvikalpa samadhi and proceed to deal with the oneness of dualit=\r\ny or non-dual Self. When some other classes of beings reach Nirvikalpa sama=\r\ndhi, they do not come back. As Ramakrishna says, this is like a salt doll t=\r\nhat goes to survey the depth of the ocean merging in ocean before reaching =\r\nthe ocean bed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n One cannot question why some characters in one&#39;s dream last for the entire=\r\n dream and some characters last a short time. It is the prerogative of the =\r\ndreamer. Similarly, we are all dream objects in Supreme Cosmic Being&#39;s long=\r\n dream called Creation and we cannot question why some beings are meant to =\r\nmerge in non-dual self and some are meant to last further.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; When Adwaita teaches the universe is unreal, it is correct. We are j=\r\nust dream characters. But then, it is also correct that different dream cha=\r\nracters have different roles to play *within* the dream.

It =\r\nis a significant step in one&#39;s spiritual evolution, but still not the ultim=\r\nate.&quot; - Sadhguru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There are various typ=\r\nes of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadhis have been classifie=\r\nd into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been broadly categorized as s=\r\navikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or qualities and samadhis=\r\n without attributes or qualities. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We =\r\nsee with Isha Yoga, people go into different types of samadhis. Here it is =\r\ncommon to witness both savikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain=\r\n state of equanimity where the intellect goes beyond its normal function of=\r\n discrimination. This, in turn, loosens one from his physical body. In sama=\r\ndhi states, one becomes loose inside the body or there is a space between w=\r\nhat is you and your body. These samadhis, by themselves have no great signi=\r\nficance in terms of Realization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, do=\r\nes not mean you are released from Existence. It is just a new level of expe=\r\nrience. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is like when you were a ch=\r\nild, you had one level of experience, once you moved into your adulthood, y=\r\nou have another level of experience. The same things that you have experien=\r\nced at a particular point in your life, after a few years, you experience t=\r\nhem in a totally different way. So, you have moved from one level of experi=\r\nence to another level of experience. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSamadhis are just like this. You are moving from one level of experience to=\r\n another level of experience in a much more significant and deeper sense. S=\r\ntill, it is just another level of experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Somebody may go into a certain level of samadhi and stay there for =\r\nyears because it is enjoyable. There is no space or time. There are no bodi=\r\nly problems. He has broken the physical and psychological barriers to some =\r\nextent. But this is only temporary. The moment he comes out, again he gets =\r\nhungry, he has to sleep, and again everything comes back. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Samadhi definitely has its benefits. There are many th=\r\nings it has to offer for an individual, but this doesn&#39;t really take you cl=\r\noser to Realization, as such. Compared to a man who is sober, a man who is =\r\nslightly drunk, has a different level of experience, but he has to come dow=\r\nn at some point. All samadhis, I would say, are a way of getting high witho=\r\nut any external chemicals. Now, by going into these states, it opens up a n=\r\new dimension for you, but it doesn&#39;t leave any great transformation behind.=\r\n It doesn&#39;t leave you permanently transformed. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; You have not moved into another reality. In the same reality, you=\r\nr level of experiences has deepened. You have experienced the same things i=\r\nn a little deeper sense. You have not become free from the mind. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, somebody meditates for 12 years and comes =\r\nout. Even after 12 years, he may not be a realized being, but, maybe he is =\r\na little closer. When you go into another reality and stay there for long h=\r\nours or long years, the grip of this reality is broken on you. Now, you hav=\r\ne come to an experiential understanding that, this is not it. Not just an i=\r\nntellectual understanding, you have seen experientially that this is not it=\r\n. That is the whole purpose of long meditations. But most realized beings n=\r\never went into samadhi states. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Gautam=\r\na never sat for 12 years in one place. Many of his disciples, many Buddhist=\r\n monks went into very long meditations. They never came out for years, but =\r\nGautama himself never went, because he saw it is not necessary. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He practiced and experienced all the eight kinds=\r\n of samadhis before his enlightenment and he discarded them. He said, &quot;This=\r\n is not it&quot;. This is not going to take you any closer to realization. It is=\r\n just moving into a higher level of experience and probably you will get mo=\r\nre caught up, because it is more beautiful than the current reality. &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If the goal is set, if you&#39;ve made realizat=\r\nion the top priority in your life, then every thing else which doesn&#39;t take=\r\n you one step closer is meaningless. Let&#39;s say you are climbing the Mount E=\r\nverest, you will not take one step sideways, because every ounce of energy =\r\nis needed. Now, if you have to transcend your own consciousness, you need e=\r\nvery ounce of what you have and it&#39;s not enough. So, any action that we per=\r\nform, we don&#39;t want it to be a sidewinder.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; We have created powerful consecrated spaces where experiencing samadhi=\r\n states comes very naturally. There are samadhis that are very pleasant, bl=\r\nissful, and ecstatic and there are samadhis that are beyond this. Those who=\r\n go into samadhi states beyond pleasant or unpleasant, or nirvikalpa, we al=\r\nways keep them in protected states as their contact with the body has becom=\r\ne very minimal. The smallest disturbance, like a sound or a pinprick would =\r\ndislodge them from their body. These states are maintained for certain peri=\r\nods to establish the distinction between you and the body. It is a signific=\r\nant step in one&#39;s spiritual evolution, but still not the Ultimate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ve=\r\ndic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; [&quot;When=\r\n I am in Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience.

Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of b=\r\neing where there&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is no &quot;experiencer&quot;, nothing &quot;to ex=\r\nperience&quot; and also no act of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;experiencing&quot;. In othe=\r\nr words, there is no observer (subject), observed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (o=\r\nbject) and observing (action). All merge into one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I-ness (the sense that &quot;this is I.=\r\n There are others. I can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observe them&quot;) disappears, =\r\nwhat is the basis for any objectification in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Sup=\r\nreme Cosmic Essence? If there is no objectification, how can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; there be any experience or observation? If there is no observation=\r\n and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomlin=\r\ne is that there is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa samadhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Regarding Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: &quot;When I am =\r\nin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus,=\r\n anything I say about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa=\r\n samadhi is actually the observation of an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I-ness as=\r\n it is being torn down or being reconstructed, i.e. just before&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; or after Nirvikalpa samadhi but not *during* it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is essentially the prob=\r\nlem with &quot;describing&quot; Nirvikalpa samadhi!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&nbsp; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of the diamond analogy quoted by K=\r\nishore, what different&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogis are saying about the &quot;e=\r\nxperience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi says more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the=\r\n path they are taking into the inside of the diamond, rather&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; than describing the inside of the diamond itself. One may think &quot;n=\r\nothing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really exists apart from Brahman - all this I=\r\n am perceiving is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;al=\r\nl I perceive is actually Brahman&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another may think=\r\n &quot;all that I perceive is actually a minute part of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nrishna&quot;. And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness on a specific&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought and everything else disappears from the mind, one is=\r\n in samadhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once that I-ness also disappears, one i=\r\ns in Nirvikalpa samadhi. However,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one can only descr=\r\nibe the last thought on which I-ness was focused prior&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa samadhi itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some yogis prefer the stag=\r\ne just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trace of I-=\r\nness is left in an intense focus on one thought, to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNirvikalpa samadhi itself. In the former, there is an experience and&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss - some rasa (juice). In the latter, there is no expe=\r\nrience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&nbsp; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBuddha is a great jnaani and his statement is perfect. However, one&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; who is not at Buddha&#39;s wavelength can easily misunderstand =\r\nit. If an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; observer exists and observes &quot;void&quot;, that =\r\nis different. What we are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talking about here is the =\r\nabsence of observer, i.e. merging of observer,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obser=\r\nved and the act of observing into one, without ANY distinction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; whatsoever between them. Is &quot;void&quot; the right word to describe th=\r\nat state&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or is &quot;everything&quot; the right word? Is there=\r\n a good way to describe it?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Problem is that the word=\r\n &quot;void&quot; may make people imagine a scenario where&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\nre is an observer, but a void to observe.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&nbsp; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=\r\n =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&nbsp; Films that make a diffe=\r\nrence:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&nbsp; Spirituality:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&nbsp; J=\r\nyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On=\r\n Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@ wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, December 29, 2009, 1:=\r\n27 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand the ex=\r\nample given in that superb mail, yet some confusion&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nexist (in my understanding) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See, Sri Ramakrishna, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Sam=\r\nadhi said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he cannot describe it in words like the sa=\r\nlt doll example provided by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hari.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;eka=\r\nm sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot; .=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True.

Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2&nbsp; the same? =\r\nI thought, whichever face of teh&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diamond you chose a=\r\ns your entry point, the middle of teh diamond should&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n feel and look exactly similar. Please correct me if I am wrong in my&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understanding.=C2 =C2 And yet these three spiritual gaint=\r\ns have spoken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; differently of their realizations. If =\r\nduality itself does not exist,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then how can the fiel=\r\nd of possiblity at all arise? Which means, how can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhere be a difference in the &quot;perception&quot; of the same One final Truth?&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Not to mention th=\r\ne query about whether, that which is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; transcendental =\r\nin its basic nature (Truth/One/Middle of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; diamond=\r\n),=C2 can=C2 at all be=C2 described from within the field of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; duality? Then I wonder why these three people - saints of highest =\r\norder&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - try to describe it when all descriptions are=\r\n from within duality...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Considering the above, I understand the wisdom (theoritically) of =\r\nwhy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalpa Samad=\r\nhi.=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I also w=\r\nonder whether=C2 the three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking from teh same realization =\r\nof=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the One/Truth, or was it different kinds of re=\r\nalizations. By this I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean, can it be possible that =\r\nthere are different intermediate or not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly doc=\r\numented stages of samadhi apart from the standard=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I can understand that maybe Buddha did not mention a vo=\r\nid per se,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he probably mentioned that there is nothi=\r\nng - for lack of any better&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; words -=C2 and stopped f=\r\nurther discussion. Over years his words could&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have=\r\n=C2 got corrupted to some degree and people mistook it to mean&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Buddha was saying there is a void.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 Ra=\r\njarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutr=\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/12=\r\n/09, Kishore Chitrapu chitrapu@gmail. com&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; From: Kishore Chitrapu chitrapu@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 29=\r\n December, 2009, 9:00 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The bright star in the sky analogy that Narasimha posted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 83) may a=\r\nnswer&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your questions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fe=\r\nw excerpts of that mail:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, whic=\r\nh&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is O=\r\nne, but the learned call differently&quot; .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; . . .&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you break th=\r\nrough any face of the diamond&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and jump int=\r\no the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; the faces=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the diamond or the world=\r\n outside.
