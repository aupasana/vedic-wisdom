People belonging to Yukteshwar Maharaj&#39;s kriya yoga\n=\r\ntradition believe that we are in Dwapara yuga now.\n \nWell, when people do n=\r\not even know what yuga is running and different\ngreat yogis hold a differen=\r\nt view as to what yuga is running, surely\nit must be a sign of the deepenin=\r\ng Kali! :-) :-(\n \nYukteshwar Maharaj was a great yogi. But mistakes do happ=\r\nen. And there\nis a reason for everything. Jnaaninaamapi chetaamsi devi bhag=\r\navati hi\nsaa balaadaakrushya mohaaya mahaamaayaa prayachhati. She can delud=\r\ne\nthe minds of even great jnaanis. She does these things for a reason.\nAs K=\r\nali is deepening, this basic confusion was *meant* to be created\nand Yuktes=\r\nhwar maharaj was Her chosen instrument.\n \nOne more point..\n \nThere is suppo=\r\nsed to be 1/4th dharma in Kali yuga. With the deepening\nKali yuga, dharma i=\r\nn mainstream society will start to fall rapidly\n(even below 25% level!). It=\r\n is probably happening already. If 99.99%\nof the society is not maintaining=\r\n 25% dharma, it is the responsibility\nof the rest to actually maintain a ve=\r\nry high level of dharma,\ncompensate for the fallen and ensure that the over=\r\nall dharma on earth\nis atleast 25%. Thus, as the society becomes more and m=\r\nore perverse,\nselfish and adharmik, some sections of the society will sprin=\r\ng up that\nembrace a very high level of dharma. People living in those secti=\r\nons\nmay even think that we are in Treta yuga, let alone Dwapara yuga!\n \nMy =\r\n2 cents...\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\nDo Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n\n--- End forwarded message ---\n\n\n\n"}}
