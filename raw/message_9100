Why not acc=\r\nept \n&gt; whatever comes our way as &#39;PRASAD&#39; from Isvara and move on.&quot;\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; My response: The final goal is indeed to reach a state of mind where =\r\none can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of Lord, with an equanimo=\r\nus mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits of some really=\r\n terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that we lose our ba=\r\nlance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may result in further bad ka=\r\nrmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, it I=\r\nS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending karmas when one is=\r\n still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer state of mind in tha=\r\nt borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits better. It is eve=\r\nn possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad karma, makes prog=\r\nress during that borrowed time, reaches an equanimous state of mind, become=\r\ns liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being with a totally eq=\r\nuanimous mind that does not get agitated.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Comment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and sanchitha and=\r\n agami are what we going to do.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My Response: Actually sanchita k=\r\narmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha ka=\r\nrmas are different in the sense that their fructification has already begun=\r\n. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; means &quot;beg=\r\ninning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that was] begu=\r\nn&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction has alre=\r\nady begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas =\r\nthat have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely=\r\n. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self witho=\r\nut experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha=\r\n karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even by a li=\r\nberated being.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in =\r\nthe pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline =\r\nis that there are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level even =\r\nfor things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is possib=\r\nle.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Comment 3:How does nishkam karm=\r\na works? In other words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where=\r\n does the reaction goes?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My Response: If one identifies with a b=\r\nody-mind complex and a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its=\r\n selfish agenda, one keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal ide=\r\nntification with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda =\r\nand engages in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but n=\r\not driven by any conditioning, i.e.agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), t=\r\nhen one is untouched by karmas performed in that state.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In the w=\r\nords of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated and current actions=\r\n of a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In other words, Sanchita k=\r\narmas (piled up actions from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and =\r\naagami karmas (actions being performed right now) of a liberated being take=\r\n shelted in Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Comment 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should=\r\n I pray to God? And if i am being \n&gt; punished for some kind of bad karma fr=\r\nom the past, why am i not aware of it? It is like getting punishment withou=\r\nt knowing your bad deeds.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My Response: One need not pray to God.=\r\nAll one needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the=\r\n pile of such karmas from the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a =\r\ncalm and sustainable state of mind in which that can be maintained even in =\r\nthe middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one&#39;s life due to serious bad=\r\n karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sens=\r\ne objects, material world and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose=\r\n its balance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and =\r\nstarts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplat=\r\ning various ideals and qualities that God represents can give a shelter to =\r\nthe mind in which it can maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If t=\r\nhat is not the case for one, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; God has no agenda to either punish you or hide the reason. God is an =\r\nimpartial balancer of reactions to all actions. If there is something unrea=\r\nsonable about the reaction you are getting, it means your action had a simi=\r\nlar unreasonableness.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0Let me turn around your question on being =\r\n&quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple question. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, d=\r\no we always tell that person why we are doing it? If not, how can we expect=\r\n someone to tell us before causing loss or hurt to us? If I caused terrible=\r\n strife to someone pious and pure for no reason, then Nature will use someo=\r\nne in future to cause terrible strife to me despite my piety and purity and=\r\n apparently for no reason.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In fact, what will you achieve by kno=\r\nwing exactly what was the action that caused what is happening to you right=\r\n now? Why is that useful? More useful is your conscience (a representation =\r\nof God in each heart) that tells you right from wrong. It constantly gives =\r\nguidance on which actions will give good reactions *in future*.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Comment 5: Vasana can be for wealth, fame, power,=\r\n domination (a struggle for power!) etc.Many ripus, many reasons...!\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; My Response: Well-said. Though we are discussing karma and karma phal=\r\na here, the root cause of karma is vasana in chittaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is=\r\n the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaasha is the space of conditio=\r\nned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc.) Vasishth=\r\na defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yoga Vaasishtham and Patanjal=\r\ni defined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH&quot; (resisting the working of=\r\n conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in Yoga Sutras. Until we overcom=\r\ne our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and some are very subtle. But a=\r\nll of them bind us.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Comment 6:1. As pe=\r\nr Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas as Homa to inner \n&gt; d=\r\nevas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser of suffering if \n&gt; y=\r\nou do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My Response:=\r\n Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that karma alone. It =\r\nis a function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of mind. If someone ser=\r\nves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria for a=\r\n week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphala set =\r\nin motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical & subtle) can c=\r\nause different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s current state of min=\r\nd.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; An idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds keep vibrating wi=\r\nth various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish desires and =\r\nunnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects of one&#39;s env=\r\nironment (through which fruits of karmas are administered).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If o=\r\nne thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates various ideals an=\r\nd qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik energy, it abso=\r\nrbs the negative effects of one&#39;s environment better or atleast does not am=\r\nplify them.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & S=\r\npirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti=\r\n is the sum total of all the beings with various agendas engaging in variou=\r\ns karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it=\r\n all.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Though each karma should give karmaphala that is commens=\r\nurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. ano=\r\nther being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part of Cosmic =\r\nCumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated =\r\nrules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for=\r\n their delivery.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past =\r\nare placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas=\r\n in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in =\r\nthe third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas ar=\r\ne assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/ka=\r\nrmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;The assignment and ordering=\r\n of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new=\r\n actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, =\r\npossibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may cha=\r\nnge and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;As one engages in remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, d=\r\nonations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities =\r\nor re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including planets, deities =\r\netc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate throu=\r\ngh other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools m=\r\nay be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to=\r\n a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. Or, some desira=\r\nble karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in order within th=\r\ne same pool.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient m=\r\nental force behind it (this is the key), the same thing can happen. It is a=\r\nll about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one,=\r\n or even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik po=\r\nols. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was =\r\nnot to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Ho=\r\nwever, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma=\r\n that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small forc=\r\ne, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific resu=\r\nlt, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what ritual one d=\r\noes. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their optio=\r\nnal pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their option=\r\nal pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make s=\r\nome difference.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Ch=\r\naritra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s=\r\n actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show =\r\nfavoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of Go=\r\nd is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is =\r\nthe power that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balance and =\r\norder within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her e=\r\nyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administ=\r\ners just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using available agents.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeli=\r\nne and will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with the=\r\nm, with some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most importan=\r\nt thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply p=\r\nut, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad k=\r\narmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to ot=\r\nhers are good karmas.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-ex=\r\nisting pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and=\r\n current action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available i=\r\nn shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each actio=\r\nn. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to b=\r\ne commensurate with the karma\n&gt;  itself.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;You need only small f=\r\norce to push a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an eleph=\r\nant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;Astrology &=\r\n Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit=\r\n.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Sent: Tuesday, Feb=\r\nruary 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Dear=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When a kingdom had =\r\nno royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by the courtiers to random=\r\nly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a beggar to suddenly find =\r\nhimself the king. Whose karma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Vasishtha gives =\r\ntwo answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citi=\r\nzens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Ev=\r\nerything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;=\r\ns karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s k=\r\narma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizen=\r\ns&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. M=\r\nany of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actua=\r\nlly blessings.

We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person are =\r\nhis many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. W=\r\ne then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic=\r\n pipeline.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; a=\r\nre the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-i=\r\nmpressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karm=\r\nas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your k=\r\narma. Or course, that is easier said than done.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Any moment wh=\r\nen your mind becomes quiet is a blessing.

As sadhakas, we run after quieting the mind !\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;sasneham,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;On Tue, Feb 26, =\r\n2013 at 8:08 AM, &lt;dgporob@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Dear Narasimha Ji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I was pondering over few things we routinely come =\r\nacross as a part of worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(1=\r\n) When someone gives a `curse&#39; or does a prayoga such as `maran&#39; or `uchhat=\r\nan&#39; what happens to a person who is at receiving end, does his bad karma co=\r\nmes forward or is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vim=\r\nalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a sain=\r\nt or elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad=\r\n Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80&quot; what do this items really do =\r\nif they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80&quot; =\r\ndo they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(3) I recol=\r\nlect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), whe=\r\nrein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parab=\r\ndha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenat=\r\nes her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has only readjuste=\r\nd the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to=\r\n word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So questi=\r\non I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is =\r\njust our perception that changes?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Thanking you,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Digamber\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
