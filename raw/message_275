Tantra basically means a procedure. Different rituals have different \nprocedures. Some are more elaborate and some are simple. But there is a \ntantra in every ritual.\n\nWhether a ritual is saattwik or raajasik or taamasik is decided by the \nattitude and thinking involved and not based on the deity or the procedure \nalone.\n\nChoice of deity based on horoscope is for bhakti yoga. However, our \nunderstanding of Jyotisha is imperfect. Sometimes, we give a wrong advice. \nBut, in this case, wrong advice is not catastrophic. If a seeker is sincere, \nhe will eventually find the right direction.\n\nA sadguru is far more useful than astrology to show the correct direction in \nwhich one makes quick progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 17, 2008 1:36 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] mantras\n\n\n&gt; namaste  to all\n&gt; i wanted to ask that when do certain upayas in jyotish are they a part\n&gt; of tantra also or what\n&gt;\n&gt; and another thing i wanted to ask is\n&gt; as narasimha ji mentioned in his book integrated approach vedic\n&gt; astrology (in the chapter regarding vedic remedies)that a jyotishi has\n&gt; to choose a particular god on the basis of knowledge of vedic studies\n&gt; for a native whose chart is being studied to help him grow\n&gt; spiriyually   then it is RAJAYOGA or BHAKTI YOGA\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n\n"}}
