Rao &lt;pvr108@...=\r\n&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; What he wrote was to do Savitri Gayatri mantra =\r\n1000 times everyday in one\n&gt; sitting and do like that for 100 days at a str=\r\netch without break. Then\n&gt; possibly give a break for a few days and do for =\r\nanother 100 days. Like that,\n&gt; do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of =\r\ncourse, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But,\n&gt; keeping=\r\n brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and hence\n&gt; the=\r\n suggestion of the break.\n&gt;\n&gt; For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is v=\r\nery important. Restraint from\n&gt; sex and control of anger and short-temper w=\r\nill help one avoid leakage of\n&gt; shakti (purifying energy). Everytime one ex=\r\nperiences lust, anger etc, one\n&gt; loses some shakti.\n&gt;\n&gt; Every factor contri=\r\nbutes a little to success. Beard is useful. The\n&gt; tradition of growing bear=\r\nd exists in many religions and it is not without a\n&gt; reason. We discussed t=\r\nhis sometime back.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one is living a lifestyle where one avoids contac=\r\nt with any tempting\n&gt; situations altogether (e.g. living in a remote monast=\r\nery), beard may or may\n&gt; not add much value. But, if one is living a lifest=\r\nyle where one comes in\n&gt; contact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. l=\r\niving in the modern world\n&gt; with a family and job and a TV), beard can be v=\r\nery useful. As I said earlier\n&gt; when we discussed this, beard is not the co=\r\nmplete solution but a small part\n&gt; of the solution. Just as a railing on th=\r\ne side of a hill road may stop a\n&gt; slowly moving car from sliding off the h=\r\nill at night but be unable to stop a\n&gt; fast moving car out of control, simi=\r\nlarly a beard can help a person with\n&gt; decent control over the mind to reta=\r\nin control in some tricky situations.\n&gt;\n&gt; Trimming beard is ok.\n&gt;\n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a=\r\n couple of hours)\n&gt; everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n&gt;=\r\n while following the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and\n&gt; f=\r\nacing the same direction, one will certainly make good progress.\n&gt; Brahmach=\r\narya is one key thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and\n&gt; head=\r\n with the eyes closed is the other thing. The probability of mind\n&gt; becomin=\r\ng still is almost zero if the body is not still. If the body can be\n&gt; kept =\r\nvery still, there is a chance that mind will also become still for a\n&gt; mome=\r\nnt. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cause great bliss.\n&gt; As=\r\n mind gets more used to being still, it will become still more often and\n&gt; =\r\nfor longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis become possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make=\r\n a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...=\r\nm&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39;s savitur gayatri sadhana\n&gt; procedure\n&gt; To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; This is a great mail and very inspiring.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That then is t=\r\nhe experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s =\r\npersonality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there t=\r\nhen the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ther=\r\ne then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nertain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nhich appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; de=\r\nvatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identi=\r\nfication is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continues.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me which is black =\r\nmagic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a highe=\r\nr shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then=\r\n your power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). =\r\nAfter the\n&gt; death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the =\r\ndeity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate rea=\r\nlm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings th=\r\ne full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some peop=\r\nle may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Na=\r\nth burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). =\r\nSome people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only=\r\n action and reaction.(Bit like you\n&gt; attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you =\r\nwill get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5=\r\n to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying=\r\n with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe it=\r\nself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on h=\r\nis identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in usin=\r\ng the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a=\r\n little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and in=\r\ntellects will not be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so thei=\r\nr actions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These =\r\npeople usually join the same spirits which they have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been using after=\r\n death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is w=\r\norshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he o=\r\nr she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a fe=\r\nw repitions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the=\r\n other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel=\r\n that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\ncheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is =\r\nin the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so =\r\ninclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the S=\r\navitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidd=\r\nen) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same place=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as o=\r\nne can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Com=\r\nplete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body)=\r\n, reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start=\r\n, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continue th=\r\nis for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See the differen=\r\nce in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is imp=\r\nortant is that life may be short, so do\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist w=\r\nith that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope =\r\nthis clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list=\r\n as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.

I hav=\r\ne also read elsewhere that the beard helps to trap the shakti accumulated a=\r\ns a result of the sadhana.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39=\r\n;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: arial=\r\n; font-size: medium; &quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic =\r\nsans ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-si=\r\nze: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;=\r\nApple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-s=\r\npan&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-family: arial; font-size: medium; &quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-sty=\r\nle-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-=\r\nstyle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sans-seri=\r\nf&quot;&gt;Please correct my understanding if I am wrong.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D=\r\n&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-=\r\nstyle-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;App=\r\nle-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;best regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;comic sans ms&#39;, sa=\r\nns-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;Har=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Thu, Jan 21, 20=\r\n10 at 9:04 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Then possibly give a break for a few days =\r\nand do for another 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Of course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. B=\r\nut, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and =\r\nhence the suggestion of the break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For success in any sadhana, brahm=\r\nacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and control of anger and shor=\r\nt-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying energy). Everytim=\r\ne one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Every fac=\r\ntor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition of grow=\r\ning beard exists in many religions and it is not without a reason. We\n disc=\r\nussed this sometime back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one is living a lifestyle where one avo=\r\nids contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a remot=\r\ne monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living a =\r\nlifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (e.=\r\ng. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be=\r\n very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the co=\r\nmplete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the =\r\nside of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill =\r\nat night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly =\r\na beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to retain contr=\r\nol in some tricky situations.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Trimming beard is ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one indeed does 1000 tim=\r\nes Gayatri (or any\n mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one year whi=\r\nle maintaining brahmacharya, &lt;br&gt;while following the simple rules of same p=\r\nlace, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one will certainly =\r\nmake good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still with an=\r\n erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. The pro=\r\nbability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If=\r\n the body can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also bec=\r\nome still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cau=\r\nse great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still=\r\n more often and for longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis become pos=\r\nsible.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam\n and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_bl=\r\nank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that make a d=\r\nifference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0 Jyotish writings: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;i&gt;&lt;&lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj_um@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nagraj_um@...&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16,=\r\n 16, 255)&quot;&gt;\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj_um@...&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nagraj_um@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRepost:Manishji&#39;s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure&lt;br&gt;To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDate: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table border=3D=\r\n&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n:inherit;font-style:inherit;font-variant:inherit;font-weight:inherit;font-s=\r\nize:inherit;font-size-adjust:inherit;font-stretch:inherit&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;This is a great mail and very inspiring.

How can i&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; again experience the Beloved.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; That then is the experience o=\r\nf mantra when it is done correctly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s per=\r\nsonality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; personality sits=\r\n there then the sadhak experiences himself as that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Deity(Devat=\r\na) .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deit=\r\ny commanding a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to=\r\n be good or be it that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#3=\r\n9;s personality is crucial. Ugra&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; devatas make the person care=\r\n almost for nothing himself, so self&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identification is minimis=\r\ned and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; continues.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me which is black m=\r\nagic.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is =\r\na higher shakti&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chi=\r\nnnamasta, then your power&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provide=\r\nd you have Vijnana). After the death&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadh=\r\naka joins the realm of the deity or if he was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; originally a Nat=\r\nh or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; beings=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma ont=\r\no the heads&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this=\r\n to their detriment(&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying t=\r\nhe city of Patan with his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some=\r\n people may even equate this with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is o=\r\nnly action and reaction.(Bit like you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal person, =\r\nand you will get a result of this from that same Atma&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; whom yo=\r\nu harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; some=\r\nbody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the univ=\r\nerse).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a sma=\r\nll Pisacha,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which ca=\r\nn be used, moreover=C2&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will n=\r\not be free of identification with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the body and so their action=\r\ns are those which are generally termed as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. These p=\r\neople usually join the same spirits\n which they have&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; been usin=\r\ng after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine if=\r\n somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ev=\r\nen in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previou=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this =\r\nmantra only in this lifetime may&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which=\r\n bind every mantra are crucial and may not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; acheive in this li=\r\nfetime.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eat=\r\ning, so let me&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is=\r\n so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; reititi=\r\nons of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same time e=\r\nvery day.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same\n place.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same materials.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Same direction.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete =\r\nrestraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bod=\r\ny), reduce food intake, grow a beard.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before =\r\nyou start, make sure your bowels are empty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; before you start.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so =\r\ndo some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as =\r\nis physically&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; possible.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies so=\r\nme of the concepts which were being discussed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Kind Love and Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; manish&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; You may post this =\r\non the list as a\n clarification from me if you feel&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that this =\r\nis suitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/tabl=\r\ne&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
