On the contrary, bhak=\r\nti has been, by its very inherent nature, a powerful and dynamic social for=\r\nce in the past. Bhakti is an unparalleled motivating force that has induced=\r\n revolutionary and meaningful change. It will also serve as the driving spi=\r\nritual force that will revive and strengthen Dharma well into the 21st Cent=\r\nury.\n\nBhakti can be the only motivational force strong enough to ensure the=\r\n degree of self-sacrifice necessary to create true leadership. It is not en=\r\nough to identify yourself as a &quot;Hindu activist&quot; merely because you find San=\r\natana Dharma interesting, inspiring, a cool culture that shouldn&#39;t disappea=\r\nr, or just because you somehow think it&#39;s your ethnic heritage. Such trivia=\r\nl concerns are not enough to promote effective action. The only way a Hindu=\r\n leader will be truly effective is if he/she has had a direct vision of God=\r\n in his/her heart so powerful that they see it as their own personal servic=\r\ne to Bhavagan to teach others how to love Him. Any lesser motivation only l=\r\neads to the invisible chains of ego. Only when we have leaders who are on f=\r\nire with devotion (bhakti) to God will Dharma be saved.\n\nMy message to the =\r\nHindu community is this: if you want to see an empowered and fearless Hindu=\r\n leadership arise to lead Dharma into the Twenty-First Century, then YOU mu=\r\nst become the leaders you seek. And you must do so, not out of a craving fo=\r\nr money, fame, or power, but as a devotional offering of your life humbly s=\r\nurrendered at the divine feet of Bhagavan - the Sweet Absolute....&quot;\n\n\nVISIT=\r\n HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS POWERFUL ARTICLE:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.=\r\ncom/forum/content.php?9-Bhakti-Social-Force\n\n\nPlease forward this informati=\r\non to all sincere spiritual seekers.
