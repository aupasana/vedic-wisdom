May the\nlearned forgive errors made by this fool.\n\nYour question is not simplistic. The answer is both. Rebirth in such a case\nhappens within the limits of karma that was taken on through free will!\n\nLet me come down a little from the level of Shiva. Let us say there is a\nrishi (Sage), who did enough good karma and sadhana to stay in a higher\nrealm of consciousness (say, Tapoloka) till the end of this world cycle,\nwithout having to take birth again on earth. Let us say he comes back to\nearth and is born as Swami Vivekananda or someone like that. What happens to\nhim? Is he bound by the karmas? If he faces some sufferings, where are the\nkarmas resulting in that experience coming from?\n\nWhenever a being is born on earth, some of the previously accumulated karmas\nare ear-marked as &quot;must experience in this lifetime&quot; karmas. Other karmas\naccumulated in the past may or may not be experienced in this lifetime and\nmay be reserved for future. But those specially marked karmas MUST be\nexperienced (or burnt through sadhana) in the current lifetime no matter\nwhat.\n\nIf a rishi or a god is born on earth, there may not be enough bad karmas to\nbe marked as &quot;must experience in this lifetime&quot; karmas. Then, in order to be\nborn on this earth, the rishi or god may &quot;take on&quot; new karmas through\nfreewill.\n\nThis can be done in several ways. One can take karmas from some other\nbeings. Moreover, the decision of rebirth itself brings new karmas. For\nexample, one&#39;s choice of mother and father instantly creates new karmas. If\na rishi decides to be born to certain parents, some of the karmas of those\nparents and their ancestors are automatically tranferred to him. The choice\nof the place can also transfer some part of the karmas associated with that\nplace (town, country etc) to the person. Thus, the moment a rishi or a god\ndecides to be born on earth, a set of karmas is created.\n\nBut, typically, reborn gods and rishis carry very little bad karma and a lot\nof good karma. During the course of life, some more bad karmas may be added.\nBut, overall, they are karmically light (as opposed to heavy). It is\nrelatively easy to burn those karmas and become free. Still, it is possible\neven for a reborn rishi to struggle for several decades before becoming\nenlightened.\n\nBottomline: In the case of those who are born on earth without being forced\nto, it is a result of karmas that were taken on through free will.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, June 28, 2007 4:13 AM\nSubject: [sivacharya] Will of Siva or karma?\n\n\n&gt; Dear J.R.Krishnan,\n&gt; My thanks for the kind words of welcome, which\n&gt; I received by email. I have a question (perhaps\n&gt; simplistic) that someone here may be able to\n&gt; shine some light upon.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have read that Siva undertakes rebirth within the\n&gt; world as a kind of sport or game.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, by which agency is the outcome of rebirth\n&gt; brought to pass; the will of Siva or karma?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Kris\n\n\n"}}
