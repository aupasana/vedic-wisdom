M=\r\ny comments on that is:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and C=\r\nhitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else has=\r\n an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with e=\r\nach other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a p=\r\nerson in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently=\r\n due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordina=\r\ntes the senses.\n&gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact =\r\nwith manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have propos=\r\ned. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not=\r\n due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitis=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of =\r\nindividualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am=\r\n that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of c=\r\nourse not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may=\r\n feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one=\r\n may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticis=\r\nm or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and onl=\r\ny a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as o=\r\npposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness ma=\r\ny still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As i=\r\nn these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a bo=\r\ndy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forg=\r\notten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think of someth=\r\ning else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may =\r\nnot even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thin=\r\ng is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physi=\r\ncal body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That =\r\nis ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkar=\r\na is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-nes=\r\ns extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deiti=\r\nes like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physica=\r\nl bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am=\r\n Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not =\r\ndo everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individ=\r\nualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word =\r\n&quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intel=\r\nlectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts wi=\r\nth manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts=\r\n with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My =\r\nbuddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and=\r\n I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part ca=\r\nnnot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memori=\r\nes and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas=\r\n etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play =\r\ndifferent roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some o=\r\nf those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mi=\r\nxing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your unders=\r\ntanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Aham=\r\nkara naturally belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must b=\r\ne overcome only in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodie=\r\nd beings (those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with th=\r\ne idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls ma=\r\nnas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided =\r\nby the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through a=\r\nll layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where =\r\ndid you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the se=\r\nnse of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness der=\r\nived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three =\r\nbodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection i=\r\nmplies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including =\r\nall other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is=\r\n not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be t=\r\nhe whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Cau=\r\nsal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Ea=\r\nch idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act up=\r\non it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning o=\r\nf Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces =\r\nand are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independen=\r\nt of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas an=\r\nd Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existe=\r\nnce is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. I=\r\nt is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind sti=\r\nll carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particula=\r\nr idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very b=\r\nasis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/cau=\r\nsal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Caus=\r\nal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human a=\r\nctivities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized cons=\r\nciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as fo=\r\nr an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of M=\r\nanas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized co=\r\nnsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- con=\r\nsciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea,=\r\n which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousne=\r\nss and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, D=\r\nevatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in=\r\n all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Moola=\r\ndhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Aha=\r\nmkara that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot;=\r\n or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves.=\r\n Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt =\r\nto influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. P=\r\nretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as we=\r\nll as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four a=\r\nntahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamka=\r\nara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal bod=\r\ny) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul=\r\n of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body=\r\n is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chi=\r\ntta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Acti=\r\non, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 ch=\r\nemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body e=\r\nxpires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go =\r\naway at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in th=\r\ne corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ide=\r\nas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for=\r\n all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal =\r\nbody is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infini=\r\ntely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variab=\r\nle, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illi=\r\nterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkar=\r\na and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Ch=\r\nitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. Howe=\r\nver, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability =\r\nto act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an =\r\ninflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required =\r\nfor That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra,=\r\n Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while th=\r\ne Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the S=\r\nuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta=\r\n doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once=\r\n the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Gun=\r\na remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself a=\r\ns distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nat=\r\nure as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identific=\r\nation of the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita =\r\ninstead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the =\r\nsenses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography =\r\nof a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body an=\r\nd hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can us=\r\ne thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be ro=\r\noted out while the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body senso=\r\nry activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas,=\r\n as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body=\r\n, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yuk=\r\nteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back =\r\nto the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently =\r\nin the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which=\r\n is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also i=\r\nt is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika visha=\r\nya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect=\r\n which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either =\r\nseen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. V=\r\nivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to As=\r\ntral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied=\r\n being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrit=\r\ntin irodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is =\r\ncalled &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring=\r\n the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or other=\r\nwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies=\r\n. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the phy=\r\nsical body, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, eg=\r\no resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four anta=\r\nhkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-=\r\nness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the en=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When =\r\nmanas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual =\r\nor thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta =\r\n(remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves =\r\npreviously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness.=\r\n That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized =\r\nconsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have =\r\nbroken down the individualized consciousness into various groups by functio=\r\nnality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas,=\r\n five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamk=\r\naara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to diffe=\r\nrent people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and di=\r\nscrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies and k=\r\noshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comca=\r\nst. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan n=\r\nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinio=\r\nn, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to rise above Ego, M=\r\nind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (Sthoola), astr=\r\nal (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising abo=\r\nve Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Risi=\r\nng above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaAru=\r\ndha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;=\r\nNarasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing that path may or may not d=\r\nebate with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will ana=\r\nlyze and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self=\r\n is imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on elimina=\r\nting things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a=\r\n beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects li=\r\nke this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self=\r\n.
