It has been a long standing =\r\nwish of mine to do homam regularly. However there are some practical proble=\r\nms. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1 Can I do a homam inside the house? I am wondering if the smoke =\r\nwould raise the fire alarm etc. In summer, though it is terribly hot here, =\r\nI can still afford to open the windows. In winter this is next to impossibl=\r\ne. I am not worried abt my home catching fire, but I am worried abt the fir=\r\ne safety alarm. The leasing office levies hefty fines for violating fire sa=\r\nfety rules.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2 Do you know any place in US where I can find a small hom=\r\na kunda and other necessary items? \n&gt; \n&gt; shubham bhavatu\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramnath\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
