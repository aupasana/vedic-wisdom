I mean, I understand each =\r\natman is just a piece of the ultimate, and that ideally we should be prayin=\r\ng for all of mankind. Yet, have the rishis or anyone in our legacy ever bes=\r\neeched the gods on behalf of any individual? And if the individual is &#39;dead=\r\n&#39; would that really matter as the atman is everlasting?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not q=\r\nuite sure how to phrase what I want to ask. My beloved mother passed away s=\r\neveral months ago and I feel that I should do something to wish her well in=\r\n her journey toward the ultimate. Is that wrong of me? Is there anything in=\r\n Hinduism which speaks to that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -- Davyd\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   _____  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE=\r\n8.
