Each must decide what see=\r\nms right to them. \n\n&lt;&lt;But if =C2=A0that is what God wanted =C2=A0that we =\r\n=C2=A0can=C2=A0lessen their&gt;&gt;\n\nRight. Only problemis how do you know whatGo=\r\nd wants? This requires a sufficiently high state of realization to understa=\r\nnd whatGod actually wantsand not confuse it withour belief of what we think=\r\n God is wanting or not wanting. Secondly when you are in a state when you c=\r\nan understand what God wants you to do, clearly and without hesitation, the=\r\nre is no scope for grieving or frustration or half measures. For you become=\r\n constantly aware of the Divine Will and the accompanying Force of the same=\r\n. This Force is the Supreme Mother against whom no opposition, of worlds vi=\r\nsible or worlds invisible, can stand.\n\n\nBut no doubt as you must have reali=\r\nzed, it is not easy. More often we tend to confuse or impose our own ideas =\r\nor mental beliefs, however pious and holy and apparently virtuous they seem=\r\n in our eyes, ontu God and act accordingly. Then when things take a turn th=\r\nat is unforseen, we suffer from agony and grief and then try and shift goal=\r\nposts in a vain attempt at self-justification. This is not a spiritually he=\r\nlpful behavior. Better is to start with the first acknowledgement that we h=\r\nave no clue of God&#39;s Will. It can be anything.\n\n&lt;&lt;.=C2=A0But=C2=A0then can =\r\nwe leave every one =C2=A0on their =C2=A0own karma. Then=C2=A0what=C2=A0is t=\r\nhe way to \n=C2=A0go =C2=A0ahead...to =C2=A0purify =C2=A0ourselves =C2=A0as =\r\n=C2=A0well as =C2=A0those =C2=A0who =C2=A0are =C2=A0suffering?&gt;.\n\nIf you th=\r\nink you can take on others Karma and happily deal with them, please go ahea=\r\nd. I follow a different philosophy. First attain a state of realization whe=\r\nre one is in constant communion with the Divine Will, then act as the Will =\r\ndirects. God, or whatever you chose to name it, is infinitely capable of ru=\r\nnning the universe and managing karma of various entities. Indeed that Infi=\r\nnity is All Powerful, Omnipotent. It has perfectall round knowledge. We don=\r\n&#39;t. Not until a communion is firmly established inside.Till such time whate=\r\nver I do and however pious it may seem to me is still a product of my own c=\r\nonditioned mindand nothing more. That is the naked truth. \n\n\nThere is a dif=\r\nference between compassion and pity. Compassion can arise only when there i=\r\ns detachment inside. For only in seriousdetachment, and a very quite mind i=\r\ns it possible to understand all angles of a problem. A many-sided knowledge=\r\n comes. Then one realizes what exactly needs to be done, if at all anything=\r\n needs be done in a certain situation. Pity on the other hand jumps into ac=\r\ntions, rather is driveninto action without this integral wisdom. It has an =\r\ninternal agitation. When Arjuna refused to kill his Gurus, he was driven ve=\r\nry deeply by a sense of pity. Krshna. OTOH, who works through Immaculate Wi=\r\nsdom knew that only by the deaths of these otherwise great mencan future ge=\r\nnerations be in peace. His vision was far reaching and more consequential. =\r\nThis was Divine Compassion. The actions based on compassion always have a g=\r\nreater impact than pity, for compassion presupposes a settled wide-angle wi=\r\nsdomwhich in turn can arise only in equanimity,\n detachment and internal qu=\r\nietude. The great Gods are always compassionate, but never pitiful. If they=\r\n suffered from pity, then every time someone cries for spiritual realizatio=\r\nn these Great Beings would have rushed down and poured a realized state int=\r\no the consciousness in a single fraction of a second. But they don&#39;t do so.=\r\n Not until they know for sure that the adhara or mind-body is capable enoug=\r\nh to make good use of their energies. They wait for the right time to inter=\r\nvene. That is their unique compassion!\n\nThe thing is, even self purificatio=\r\nn is not done by ourselves. At a point in sadhana one inevitable realizes t=\r\nhat it is a Higher Force that does the purification=C2=A0 process. We are a=\r\nt best, as the Gita describes, are a nimitta-matra. How then can one who ha=\r\ns not reached a stable and Divine Union with the Supreme even think of puri=\r\nfying anyone elsewhen we are not even able to purify ourselves sufficiently=\r\nand are at the mercy of this Infinite and All Capable Force?\n\nA deeper and =\r\ndeeper surrender from all parts of mind and life and body. A sincere, patie=\r\nnt, respectful wait. Positive efforts at self examination and correction. I=\r\nnternal consecration. And waiting for an eventual grace which cannot be con=\r\ntrolled or commanded or demanded. That, IMO, is the way out. Let the busine=\r\nss of running the world be left to God, who is more than capable of doing s=\r\no using a million and one methods.\n\nAs for me, only if I am 101% sanguine t=\r\nhat someone shares an extremely strong karmic bond with me, and my trying t=\r\no help can be useful in some way, ONLY THEN I can make an effort to help, t=\r\nhough it cannot be said if the effort will fructify at all. At one point I =\r\nused to believe, a bit ignorantly, that I could help others. Now all such i=\r\ndeas are being driven out of my head.=C2=A0\n\nThat is how I look at it. I am=\r\n sure others will have their own differing view-points...\n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0=\r\nRajarshi\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAn=\r\nanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From:=\r\n gaurav tripathi &lt;gaurav_alld@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Sunday, 3 March 2013 12:21 PM\nSubjec=\r\nt: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrome\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Rajarshi N=\r\nandy,\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0I =C2=A0agree =C2=A0with your =C2=A0thoughts =C2=A0that =\r\n=C2=A0there =C2=A0will be inheritance of =C2=A0Karmas =C2=A0of =C2=A0the =\r\n=C2=A0person for =C2=A0whom we =C2=A0are =C2=A0going to =C2=A0do the Homam.=\r\n But if =C2=A0that is what God wanted =C2=A0that we =C2=A0can=C2=A0lessen t=\r\nheir =C2=A0suffering=C2=A0then be it.The cricket field =C2=A0analogy is =C2=\r\n=A0perfect.=C2=A0But=C2=A0then can we leave every one =C2=A0on their =C2=A0=\r\nown karma.

There are plenty of simultaneous things that can happen. =\r\nKundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot.

But how is a doctor to tell apart kun=\r\ndalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar=\r\n experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot exp=\r\nerience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hall=\r\nucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic te=\r\nst. \n\nHowever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeki=\r\nng &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their s=\r\ntories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voi=\r\nces in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. \n\nAbout vata, most of o=\r\nur patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually =\r\nunable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement=\r\n. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use o=\r\nf Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this does n=\r\no good for vata.\n\nThe Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some o=\r\nn her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patie=\r\nnt. \n\nCan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini pat=\r\nient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and will advise =\r\nanti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm t=\r\nhem, though I doubt it will help.\n\nAdvice and thoughts from all members wou=\r\nld be much appreciated.\n\nOm Dum Durgayai Namaha\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

See all the saints. You are u=\r\nnlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all liv=\r\ned lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). However the int=\r\nernal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely th=\r\nat some great ones were completely unaware of their external problems.\n&gt; &gt;W=\r\nhen Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I s=\r\nometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by t=\r\nhe parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrende=\r\nr is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother =\r\nso it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.\n&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they hav=\r\ne to learn surrender.

Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits,=\r\n sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all=C2=\r\n=A0that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apa=\r\nna is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to tota=\r\nlly calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real c=\r\nases may be useful.\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small=C2=A0Homas to MahaGanapati and =\r\nthe nava grahas to be performed by the patient.

These =\r\nare not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting suf=\r\nficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in =\r\na previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be get=\r\nting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it=\r\n!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to=\r\n fancy too many specific\n&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granti=\r\nng your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right n=\r\now, arising from YOUR\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives y=\r\nou what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. F=\r\nor example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a=\r\n rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pra=\r\ny whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, b=\r\nut not have any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt; case, one may deeply desi=\r\nre to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt; as a tiger or a dog and ac=\r\nt in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt; experience. Basically, peo=\r\nple keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something=\r\n they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if on=\r\ne deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and =\r\none&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be=\r\n born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there=\r\n is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is we=\r\nll-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw =\r\na chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badl=\r\ny and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow dea=\r\nth and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that =\r\nchipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared =\r\nof being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas abo=\r\nut who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we =\r\nare this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of t=\r\nhat at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without b=\r\neing scared?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise =\r\nafter most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than\n&gt;  Kund=\r\nalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left i=\r\nn one&#39;s system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion a=\r\nbout who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper i=\r\nn consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes=\r\n the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind=\r\n complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great le=\r\nader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one pe=\r\nrson had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he =\r\nmay fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. =\r\nWhen one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notio=\r\nn, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet r=\r\nemain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalin=\r\ni in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses=\r\n and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual prob=\r\nlems.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I reco=\r\nmmend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, =\r\novercome your\n&gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I=\r\n want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/thin=\r\ngs/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It i=\r\ns a negative attachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt; whether y=\r\nour Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 in=\r\nternal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt; not. If your=\r\n ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF you=\r\nr Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you complet=\r\nely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt; will automatically as=\r\ncend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true =\r\nsurrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business w=\r\nith god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and b=\r\nare fact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give it t=\r\no me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protec=\r\nt me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you want and y=\r\nou ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demand=\r\ns or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination fo=\r\nr the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws o=\r\nne&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and=\r\n accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascinati=\r\non and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If =\r\none without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experien=\r\nces a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a perso=\r\nnal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. I=\r\nt is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk gl=\r\nued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was sc=\r\nared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s\n&gt;  prot=\r\nection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger t=\r\nhat one should run away from!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and d=\r\netachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime=\r\n. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose=\r\n everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (=\r\nvery light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises =\r\nto meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will di=\r\nstract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Sel=\r\nf.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituali=\r\nty Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;S=\r\nent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] K=\r\nundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 =\r\n, perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=\r\n=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of th=\r\ne hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal=\r\n deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes=\r\n who play havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protect=\r\nion of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitel=\r\ny=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose =\r\nthe human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more d=\r\netachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, =\r\ngreed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one h=\r\nas to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a f=\r\nar more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 =\r\n- A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really do=\r\nes - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and enti=\r\nties, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useles=\r\ns, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends.=\r\n They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-util=\r\nizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi\n becomes even more\n&gt;  vital. 4 -=\r\n While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini =\r\nShakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because =\r\nof this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and in=\r\nsufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that =\r\nthe aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences=\r\n and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to v=\r\narious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That=\r\n can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have ch=\r\nances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and variou=\r\ns possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Mor=\r\neover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the ri=\r\nght knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are =\r\noften doing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n work.\n&gt;  Sometimes it w=\r\nill have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting=\r\n point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say -=\r\n Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aw=\r\naktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyaya=\r\nmanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;De=\r\nar all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent=\r\n experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, a=\r\nnd have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had=\r\n a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has invol=\r\nved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of=\r\n Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started =\r\nand she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything=\r\n physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is =\r\ndue to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themse=\r\nlves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awaken=\r\ning- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream=\r\n psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by wester=\r\nn medicine, and as we have no treatments for\n deranged\n&gt;  kundalini, we str=\r\nuggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My expe=\r\nrience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be for=\r\ncibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffer=\r\ning from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and =\r\nit is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there coul=\r\nd be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who =\r\nmanifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and eith=\r\ner cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the =\r\ngood samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we ma=\r\ny not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful i=\r\nn our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this=\r\n is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me=\r\n be your instrument&quot; and leave the\n kundalini\n&gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s will. =\r\nOm Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Reply via web post  Reply to send=\r\ner   Reply to group   Start a New Topic  Messages in this topic (5) \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;R=\r\necent Activity: \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \r\n--701135548-477312346-1362309360=:51855\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nama=\r\nste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can speak only from my point of view.

There are plenty of simultaneous things=\r\n that can happen. Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kund=\r\nalini awakening may not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a p=\r\nerson suddenly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very=\r\n subtle nature. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities o=\r\nf all kinds. If by some chance the link to this world opens up, willingly o=\r\nr unwillingly, it can cause quite a bit of problems for both mature as well=\r\n as immature people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get=\r\n affected by them easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected b=\r\ny a plethora of false experiences and misplaced priorities. As such\n a diag=\r\nnosis like this\n simply cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of th=\r\nis forum (unless I am grossly mistaken).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing a homa with the desir=\r\ne that someone gets cured maybe good. However, it can also have unintended =\r\nconsequences. Some part of the person&#39;s karma will come to you today or tom=\r\norrow. You must have enuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it.

But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises =\r\nfrom non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences,=\r\n such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in o=\r\nther words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or=\r\n the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nHowever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;f=\r\nake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their storie=\r\ns tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices i=\r\nn my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAbout vata, most o=\r\nf our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usual=\r\nly unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangem=\r\nent. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The us=\r\ne of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this doe=\r\ns no good for vata.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I wil=\r\nl do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this t=\r\no any patient. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful i=\r\nn the kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosi=\r\ns&quot; and will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope t=\r\nhis will not harm them, though I doubt it will help.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAdvice and th=\r\noughts from all members would be much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOm Dum Durgayai=\r\n Namaha&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R=\r\n.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this energy=\r\n could kill you. in actual fact, that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To ki=\r\nll the limited you&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However=\r\n,&nbsp;the hold of the I ness on everything is so tremendous that its diffi=\r\ncult to let go enough that you can allow this Shakti to complete its job.&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doc=\r\ntors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because they are =\r\nconditioned to think in words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence o=\r\nf God completely anyway.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This,&nbsp;combined with the fact that fo=\r\nr&nbsp;most people, Kundalini is not wanted because these people&nbsp;want =\r\nthe objects which God can give, not God Herself, means that the scope for m=\r\nisunderstanding is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but m=\r\nost are unable to realise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the sain=\r\nts. You are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact=\r\n they all lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). Ho=\r\nwever the internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so =\r\ncompletely that some great ones were completely unaware of their external p=\r\nroblems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the exte=\r\nrnal world to sleep.I sometimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being=\r\n thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous beca=\r\nuse the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anyth=\r\ning without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The pro=\r\nblem with adults is that they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of=\r\n ego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painless process unlike t=\r\nhat of the baby.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;s=\r\nurges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;result&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise ar=\r\ne brought up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air elemen=\r\nt which is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in these people.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be =\r\npeople who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in the=\r\nir lives and think that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get som=\r\ne esteem in the eye of the general public.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the=\r\n specific problem:In general, for any doctor, the separation of the true fr=\r\nom the false claims must precede any attempt at helping the patient. A true=\r\n Kundalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularit=\r\ny, in food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp;that must be regimentalised, then appropriate =\r\nherbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application o=\r\nf oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro=\r\n basti in difficult real cases may be useful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Then institute s=\r\nmall&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the =\r\npatient. That should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the =\r\nMuladhara.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two y=\r\nears.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be suffic=\r\nient.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s=\r\n small dilapidated house (this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palac=\r\ne (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into it=\r\n when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in th=\r\ne palace still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due =\r\nto Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The=\r\n former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can p=\r\nrogress towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experienc=\r\nes. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get somethin=\r\ng without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have=\r\n deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough=\r\n effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared =\r\n(and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too ma=\r\nny specific&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting you=\r\nr desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, ar=\r\nising from YOUR&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives =\r\nyou what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. =\r\nFor example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as =\r\na rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pr=\r\nay whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, =\r\nbut not have any knowledge or money. In another &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; case, one may dee=\r\nply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as a tiger =\r\nor a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; expe=\r\nrience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, alwa=\r\nys &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of =\r\nbody experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas const=\r\nrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with thi=\r\ns specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force beh=\r\nind it).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  *&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily =\r\nscary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachme=\r\nnt.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to=\r\n a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to sh=\r\nake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scare=\r\nd that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are lik=\r\ne that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and =\r\nscared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind =\r\ncomplex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, =\r\nwon&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of =\r\nthis body-mind complex, without being scared?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundali=\r\nni rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning =\r\nis still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Whe=\r\nn one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs=\r\n, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the =\r\nsurface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there=\r\n may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clin=\r\ngs on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great sai=\r\nnt etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to b=\r\ne a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnat=\r\ned X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Ku=\r\nndalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person =\r\nmay show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck b=\r\nadly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a s=\r\nystem with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wro=\r\nng notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms =\r\nof Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  weaknes=\r\nses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that =\r\ndetachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Di=\r\nsgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry abo=\r\nut &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you a=\r\nre able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pash=\r\nas) or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are=\r\n making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still maki=\r\nng progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awaren=\r\ness) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true=\r\n Self).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity.=\r\n Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply =\r\ndo business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is th=\r\ne plain and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, =\r\nI will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini ris=\r\ne, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business =\r\ndeal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender ha=\r\ns no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is=\r\n losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surren=\r\nder is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable =\r\nor highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surre=\r\nnder is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of=\r\n (and during) Death.&lt;br&gt;\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
