What this namboodiri did i=\r\ns the correct way.\n\nVisualize the external fire as your internal fire and w=\r\norship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamli=\r\nne it, depending on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger=\r\n with practice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in=\r\n it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for=\r\n burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karm=\r\nas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. O=\r\nf course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are read=\r\ny and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a strong indivi=\r\ndualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego=\r\n. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more ka=\r\nrmas and face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, =\r\nflowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let=\r\n it grow very\n big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So,=\r\n until you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free your=\r\nself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n\nBut some peop=\r\nle use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the=\r\n fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one =\r\nwho strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does such th=\r\nings, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this a=\r\npproach do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong identifi=\r\ncation with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and the=\r\ny do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to s=\r\ntart or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best=\r\n and disastrous at worst.\n\nThe best approach is: You start your own fire. O=\r\nnly you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it=\r\n with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If=\r\n you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your know=\r\nledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.\n\n(2)=\r\n There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga ny=\r\naasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worry about these things =\r\nand do what you are used to or what you are more attracted to.\n\nAs I said m=\r\nany times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a lett=\r\ner in a particular body part has a higher significance than just tough a pa=\r\nrt and saying it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specifi=\r\nc sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying o=\r\nne&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentia=\r\nlly a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.\n\n(3) They sho=\r\nuld be shown in the video.

Is the beejam , shakthih and kilakam mudras /=\r\nmantrams differnet for each diety ? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) There are 4 more a=\r\nvhana mudras for suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava, varado bhava, sarvAbhIshTa=\r\nprado bhava. The manual does not talks about these mudras. Kindly let me kn=\r\now if these are imporatnt and how to show these mudras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Th=\r\nanks and regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Girish Sundaram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nhours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday. It is like &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fasting everyday and eating a 30-course meal once every few mont=\r\nhs vs eating &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dal and rice everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; However, your request is good and I will try to create a long procedure &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; manual atleast for Mahaganapathi homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; (2) I have all of them in mind. Purusha sookta homam is the simplest h=\r\nomam &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and very useful for spiritual progress. I do have that i=\r\nn mind. Sudarsana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam can also be done on a regular basis q=\r\nuickly. But navagraha homam is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; more time-consuming. I will ev=\r\nentually put all of them\n up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC)\n website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@.. .&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;=\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_=\r\nblank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 01, 2009 6:10 AM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Query related to Maha Ganapathi Homam&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskaram PVR Narasimha Raoj=\r\ni,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am a big fan of the Maha Ganapathi=\r\n Homam and I have seen it being &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; performed at our home as=\r\n a kid many times.

I have couple of requests from=\r\n my side:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Is it possible to create a=\r\n document for the full fledged Ganapathi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; homam ? This wi=\r\nll be immensely helpful for people who have the time and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n intrest to perform such a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Th=\r\nere are some other important homams particularly the following in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; which I am deeply intrested :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a) Sudarshana Hom=\r\nam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; b) Navagraha Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; c) Purusha Suktha=\r\n Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I would request you to kindly cr=\r\neate documents similar to the Maha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganapathi Homam PDF s=\r\no that the larger population is benefited.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Swami Sharanam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Girish\n Sundaram&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;META content=3Don http-equiv=3Dx-dns-p=\r\nrefetch-control&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1703780994-1252395279=:73795--\r\n\n"}}
