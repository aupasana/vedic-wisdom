I ness and Attachment are the same.\n\nWhen Chandika attack=\r\ns Shumbha he becomes unconscious. at that time Nishumbha attacks her. It in=\r\ndicates that the final war for realisation is with our Ahamkaar & Aasakti (=\r\nI ness & Attachment -me, my, mine). it may seem that Ahamkaar is dead but i=\r\nt can be a deception. it may have been hiding (like Shumbha became unconsio=\r\nus for some time). Aasakti (Nishumbha) is ready to attack even if I ness is=\r\n temporarily sleeping.\n\nWhen mother completely destroys Nishumbha (Aasakti)=\r\n, Shumbha is furious and even challenges the mother with the abuses such as=\r\n Dushte, Anyasa Balamaashrita. he is furious because he lost his brother wh=\r\nich is like a soul mate. Inseparable. once aasakti is finished, Ahamkaar be=\r\ncomes weaker and then mother finally mounts concluding attack on the demon =\r\nShumbha to finally liberate the soul. \n\n***\nRaktabeeja -&gt; Vaasanaas (Desire=\r\ns, mental conditioning)\n\nRaktabeeja is veru dangerous and powerful. He has =\r\na capacity to multiply and multiply and feel the entire universe. Our desir=\r\nes are also like that. they multiply in no time. they are never finshes eve=\r\nn if we satisfy them. they keep increasing and multiplying.\n\nThe most power=\r\nful demon after Shumbha & Nishumbha is Raktabeeja. it is so powerful that a=\r\nll the various forms of mothers (such as Indriyaani, Naarasimhi, Vaaraahi, =\r\nMaaheshwari, Brahmaani) attack him simultaneously but still he is not finis=\r\nhed. The multiplication ability of his, ceates danger for the whole world a=\r\nnd Devas becomes worried (like Good virutes feel scared of danger from endl=\r\ness desires, like saintly people are always at danger from onslaught of mat=\r\nerialistic and wicked people).\n\nseeing that Devas are really worried, Chand=\r\nika and Chaamunda both attack him and destroy him. Chaamunda (Kali) actuall=\r\ny sucks the blood of the demon and destroys all the multiplied demons insta=\r\nntly to the point that Raktabeeja becomes bloodless and then detroyed compl=\r\netely. Hence Kaali has capacity to destroy all the vaasanaas and the beeja =\r\nof vaasanaas.\n\n***\nChanda and Munda are like Greed & Appeasement. they both=\r\n fan the Ego (Shumbha). they lure him to go for possesing everything in the=\r\n world.\nThey successfully trigger Ahamkaar and propell us to go for the wro=\r\nng things/desires/possession.\n***\nDhumraLochan -&gt; Krodha (Anger/fury which =\r\nis unmindful but very weak)\n\nDhumralochan (Krodha) is aggressive but has fe=\r\net of clay, that is why Durga destroys Dhumralochan with just as &#39;Hunkaar&#39; =\r\n(just by a word &#39;Hum&#39;) and the chapter no.6 is over in few verses.\n****\n\nco=\r\nnfused! not your fault. i couldn&#39;t explain it properly :)\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nU=\r\ntpal\n \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2=\r\n003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would be happy if you could expla=\r\nin and elaborate about armies of shumbh and vishumbha.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; \n&gt; ra=\r\njesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 7/3/09, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; F=\r\nrom: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Reason t=\r\no Smile for Sanatan Dharma !!!\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: S=\r\naturday, 7 March, 2009, 12:41 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt; =\r\n            Dear Mitesh,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; These are good informations which gives=\r\n us lot of hopes for future of Dharma in general and Sanatan Dharma in pert=\r\nicular.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Let us also join in doing Sadhana as per our best of cap=\r\nabilities and try to reduce our Ahamkaar by each passing month. let us get =\r\nover our little minds and start hearing call of Big mind, which will help u=\r\ns individually & collectively,  to overcome negativity such as unnecessary =\r\nfights of words, pride of everything, anger, selfishness, haughtyness, endl=\r\ness desires, greedy ness and all the other armies of Shumbh and Nishumbha.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal     \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;=\r\nm540i98@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good information,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; May I add one more place, that is located in Rajkot Gujarat,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Ranchod Vadi, the Ranchoddasji Maharaj&#39;s ashram.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; They =\r\nare also doing 24 by 7 uninterrupted ram dhun for many many years..
