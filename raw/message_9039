Thus, it was poss=\r\nible for a\nbeggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?\n\n=\r\nVasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king,\n=\r\nand all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.\n=\r\n\nEverything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The\nelepha=\r\nnt&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The\nminister&#39;=\r\ns karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And\nthe citi=\r\nzens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the\nresult.\n=\r\n\nThe sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the=\r\n\ncurses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually\nblessi=\r\nngs. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amount of\npurity of =\r\nspeech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n\nWhen it comes to peopl=\r\ne and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an\nassumption. We assume that =\r\nthere is a person, and separate from the person\nare his many karmas. These =\r\nkarmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to\ntime. We then want someone to =\r\ncome and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our\nkarmic pipeline.\n\nVasishtha t=\r\neaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You\nare your karm=\r\nas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your\nvaasanaas. In ot=\r\nher words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.\n\nIf you can change your vaasanaa=\r\ns, you have changed your karma. Or course,\nthat is easier said than done.\n\n=\r\nAny moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your=\r\n\nmind becomes agitated is a curse. As sadhakas, we run after quieting the\nm=\r\nind !\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 26, 2013 at 8:08 AM, &lt;dgporob@yah=\r\noo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha Ji,\n&gt;         I was pondering over few thi=\r\nngs we routinely come across as a part\n&gt; of worship and how it manipulates =\r\nkarma pipe line,\n&gt; (1) When someone gives a `curse&#39; or does a prayoga such =\r\nas `maran&#39; or\n&gt; `uchhatan&#39; what happens to a person who is at receiving end=\r\n, does his bad\n&gt; karma comes forward or is it a new parabdha that is create=\r\nd.
