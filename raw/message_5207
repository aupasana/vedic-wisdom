Simplicity and not trickery, surrender and=\r\n not mastery, humility and not technical perfection, is what one needs to s=\r\nucceed in spiritual sadhana.\n \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa once said, &quot;you may =\r\nserve a normal human being perfectly 99 times and fail once. He will forget=\r\n the 99 times you served well and only remember the one time you failed. Go=\r\nd is different. You may fail to serve god well 99 times and serve him well =\r\nonly once. Still, he will remember that one time and be pleased with you.&quot;\n=\r\n \nIf one&#39;s spiritual sadhana and remedies are not working, it is unlikely t=\r\no be due to technical imperfections. It is likely due to lack of a perfect =\r\nsurrender and humility.\n \nIf an over-confident and arrogant adult is lost i=\r\nn a fair and running around frenetically, nobody would care. If an innocent=\r\n child is lost in a fair and looking for his parents while crying, everyone=\r\n will come forward to help and reunit the child with parents. In the fair o=\r\nf this samsaara, be an innocent child lost and cry sincerely for the &quot;paren=\r\nts&quot;.

I am a strong believer that prayers to the Almighty are the =\r\nultimate answers to things not in our control. Thank you for sharing this s=\r\nimple mantras with the readers; literally hundreds would benefit from this =\r\nas they seek their solace. Bhakti is what makes people focus more on intern=\r\nal strengths (of individuals) and become stronger to overcome difficulties.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am student/have been a student of Astrology for 20+ yea=\r\nrs, and continue to use it for guidance for the future, but do not expect p=\r\nredictions would come true as there are factorial 12! x 9! factorial permut=\r\nations and combinations to deal with, virtually making it impossible to pre=\r\ndict correctly. But for a trained eye and the learned gurus, and for those =\r\nwho have focused more on the good lord to seek the knowledge (with total di=\r\nscipline and in submitting to the Lord unconditionally), this art becomes a=\r\n science as they acquire &quot;vak-suddhi&quot;; AND they are able to guide the peopl=\r\ne. I see many in this group following such discipline and thanks to them. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this wonderful help is available, I still think we n=\r\need to give the members something to focus on the Lord in terms of mantras =\r\nlike you have done Mr. Jay-ji. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible, Jay-ji, th=\r\nat we have a few simple mantras listed for the benefit of the members to ad=\r\ndress the common issues people face, plus to appease the lords of the house=\r\ns (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn etc). Mr. PVRji=\r\n has listed some, but would be good to develop such list and make them avai=\r\nlable in one place. I truly believe that would be more useful and powerful =\r\nthan prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with possible high degr=\r\nee of error possibilities in the charts). Bhakti and meditation always woul=\r\nd work!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other gurujis are reading this, I wo=\r\nuld appreciate it if they take the leadership to develop such mantras and c=\r\nirculate for the benefit of the members.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very mu=\r\nch!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With deep regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant the below mantra=\r\n at least 108 times everyday with deep belief and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopala Mantram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krishna M=\r\nah=C3=84=C2=81yogin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakt=C3=84=C2=81n=C3=84=C2=81m Abhayam Kara\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=84=C2=81nanda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=84=\r\n=C2=81na Ya !!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi, y=\r\nou give shelter to your devotees.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, You are the giver o=\r\nf Supreme Bliss.
