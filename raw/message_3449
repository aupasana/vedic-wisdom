You are lucky to have spent time\nwith Manish in the blessed city of=\r\n Kashi and that too at the blessed\nManikarnika ghat.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is something=\r\n about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were doing\na Chandi homam atop a h=\r\nill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing\nhappened. A pack of 7-8 dog=\r\ns living on that hill came and sat around the\nhomam to watch. They were cal=\r\nm for the entire homam (a couple of hours)\nand watched it. When bali (we us=\r\ned raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at\nthe end, they all got up together a=\r\nnd ran in one direction barking and\njumping up. It was as though they were =\r\ntrying to chase someone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some say that several animals, especially dogs=\r\n, have subtle\nextra-sensory perception that is superior to that of humans.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; That homam is still fresh in my mind. When we w=\r\nere climbing that hill\nin the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish told me=\r\n, &quot;we have a strong\nconnection with this place. Something will happen here =\r\ntoday.&quot; When we\ndiscovered two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorak=\r\nshanath)\nliving there, we talked to them for a while. Manish saw their homa=\r\n\nkundam there and asked, &quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it in\nyo=\r\nur homa kundam tonight?&quot; The person said, &quot;we are worshippers of\nNarayana a=\r\nnd do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any\ntaamasik practices =\r\nresorted to.&quot; We told him we would call Mahalakshmi\nin fire and there would=\r\n be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.\n&gt;\n&gt; We left and reached the h=\r\nill with materials around 8:30 pm. The hill\nand its surroundings were pitch=\r\n dark and silent. There was no\nelectricity in that area. We climbed the hil=\r\nl using Manish&#39;s cell phone\nbacklight to show the way. There were several d=\r\nogs there and they\nstarted barking when they saw us climbing. But when we s=\r\ntarted the\nhomam, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An o=\r\nld sadhu\nalso came out of the hut and sat near the fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; The moment The=\r\n Mother was invoked in fire, the whole place that was\nsilent till then exce=\r\npt for our chants suddenly came alive with all\nkinds of sounds. There was a=\r\n valley in the eastern direction. A lot of\nbirds suddenly rose up from thei=\r\nr trees in that area and started making\nloud sounds. The whole area resound=\r\ned with the sounds of birds, beetles\netc. Given the silence till then, this=\r\n huge commotion felt quite eerie.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; While on the =\r\ntopic of that trip, I can mention something personal that\ndemonstrates how =\r\npride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in\nthe story sent by Pras=\r\nanth today.\n&gt;\n&gt; During that trip in the Indian summer of 2008, Manish kept =\r\non feeding\nmy ego. He praised me to the skies in front of several people. W=\r\nhen a\nlady saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was talking about Upasan=\r\ni\nMaharaj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mention great things\nab=\r\nout me. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was first\nunaffected. =\r\nBut it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the night o=\r\nf that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxed\nhis rule of not all=\r\nowing another person to put aahutis in fire when\ndoing homam. Though the pl=\r\nan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam\nand Manish would do in their=\r\n homa kundam, he changed his mind at the\nlast minute and said we would do t=\r\nogether in the same homa kundam. He\nsaid I was ready and could share homam =\r\nwith him. I was ecstatic and saw\nit as an &quot;acknowledgment&quot; of my &quot;spiritual=\r\n progress&quot;. My already\nprovoked pride peaked with this.\n&gt;\n&gt; My mind was fil=\r\nled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra and\ndeity was weak, as we ch=\r\nanted Saptashati during that night&#39;s homam.\nManish said nothing there. The =\r\nmoment homam was over and we went back,\nhe scolded me with a very stern and=\r\n serious tone, &quot;what were you\nthinking? We called the Mother in fire and yo=\r\nu were so distracted. You\nwasted a great opportunity tonight. We are chooti=\r\nyas (an expletive) and\nShe is the Mother of the universe. How can you absor=\r\nb your mind in\negoistic thoughts in her presence? Had I been strict like my=\r\n gurus or\nlike the gurus of the old times, you would&#39;ve been killed today.&quot;=\r\n He was\nin that serious mood for an hour or so and then became very kind an=\r\nd\ncompassionate again. He laughed, &quot;are you still thinking about it? Leave\n=\r\nit Narasimha. These things happen. Everything happens for good. I have\nno d=\r\noubt you will overcome. Time has to come for anything. Don&#39;t worry\nand keep=\r\n doing sadhana.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful.=\r\n Irrespective of\nwhat you experience and irrespective of how much progress =\r\nyou make, she\ncan delude you in a split second. In fact, the experiences on=\r\ne has and\nthe progress one makes is not really one&#39;s. She gives them and sh=\r\ne uses\nthem to bind one. The moment one thinks &quot;I, so-and-so individual, ex=\r\nist&quot;\nand attributes those &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is\n=\r\ninstantly bound - there is scope for pride, happiness, unhappiness etc\nand =\r\none can be deluded. Constant surrender to the supreme power running\nthe uni=\r\nverse, while performing the duties that one is inspired to\nperform using th=\r\ne body inhabited by one and without paying ANY attention\nto ANY results tha=\r\nt come, including praises and criticism, is the only\nsolution.\n&gt;\n&gt; This exp=\r\nerience taught me a very valuable lesson. What Manish said\nabout me to othe=\r\nrs in my presence may have been a way of testing me. It\nis also possible th=\r\nat it is correct. In either case, it does not matter.\nThe persona (body-nam=\r\ne-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *temporary*\nabode allocated to one for=\r\n fulfilling one&#39;s dharma. Attributes of that\npersona, including its merits =\r\nand demerits, are irrelevant to one. The\nmoment one looks at that persona a=\r\ns &quot;I&quot; and forms an attachment to the\nattributes of that persona, one gets b=\r\nound. Instead, one should just use\nthat persona to fulfill dharma without f=\r\norming an attachment. An\nattachment to a persona brings many happinesses an=\r\nd many miseries and\nbinds one, irrespective of how meritorious that persona=\r\n is. At the end\nof the day, everything that is temporary perishes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also=\r\n, note that pride can strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has\nan attach=\r\nment to the persona. Keep doing sadhana, while constantly\ncontemplating and=\r\n guarding against such an attachment. Pride is\nsuppressed for a while, come=\r\ns back again, is suppressed again, comes\nback again and so on. This cycle g=\r\noes on until one&#39;s attachment to the\npersona is killed completely. This is =\r\na long process. Don&#39;t worry too\nmuch and just keep doing sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of something. =\r\nWhen Manish\nand I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog th=\r\nat was\nwalking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a long way. =\r\nAt\none point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather\n=\r\nstair-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, bought some\nbi=\r\nscuit packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us\nthen. =\r\nIn a couple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy\nclothes. He was=\r\n weeping. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He\nsaid he lost all h=\r\nis money at a hotel in Junagadh and has no money to\neven buy food. He decid=\r\ned to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!)\nand go to Dattatreya and l=\r\neave it to him to help him out. He was\nclimbing up, while we were climbing =\r\ndown. It was getting nearly dark\nthen. Manish gave him a lot of money, all =\r\nthe biscuit packets that were\nwith us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave=\r\n back a few\n&gt; biscuit pieces to me and said, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Late=\r\nr Manish told me the same thing he told you, &quot;you never know when\nand in wh=\r\nat form god comes to test you. Kindness and compassion towards\nneedy people=\r\n is an important dharma.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; One does not need to do something beyond one&#39;=\r\ns means. But, one can\nhave compassion, feel the other person&#39;s pain and hel=\r\np within one&#39;s\nmeans.\n&gt;\n&gt; I considered the biscuit pieces given back by tha=\r\nt old man as\nDattatreya&#39;s prasad and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, p=\r\nlease note\nthat Vatuka Bhairava is depicted as a child.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, the Girnar trip happenened unplanned. We were supposed to be =\r\nin\nDwaraka for one more day shooting for the Krishna movie. But we\nbasicall=\r\ny finished what we had intended. So I was thinking in my mind\nwith dissatis=\r\nfaction, &quot;why does Manish want to prolong things here and\nshoot more? We ar=\r\ne done here. Why can&#39;t we just leave Dwaraka and\nperhaps go to Girnar for a=\r\n day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to myself. It was\nlate in the evening and we were=\r\n on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka.\nAll of a sudden, Manish told the =\r\ndriver to stop and turn back to the\nhotel. He announced that we were leavin=\r\ng for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa aa\ngaya. hum Girnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation ha=\r\ns arrived. We will go to\nGirnar.) We rushed to the hotel, packed and left i=\r\nn 10 minutes. We\nreached Girnar around midnight and spent the next day ther=\r\ne. For those\nwho do not know, Girnar is considered the abode of Lord Dattat=\r\nreya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sometimes, Manish has the uncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s\ntho=\r\nughts. However, he says it is not his ability, but it is Nature\nlistening t=\r\no one&#39;s wish and fulfilling through another.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Im=\r\nagine chess pieces being moved by an expert player thinking &quot;I am an\npowerf=\r\nul king. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a beautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am\na strong =\r\nknight. I am great&quot;, &quot;I killed a great bishop despite being a\npawn. I am gr=\r\neat&quot;, &quot;I am just a pawn, but I sacrificed myself to trap\nthe queen. I am gr=\r\neat&quot; etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life all=\r\n the\ntime. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess gam=\r\ne.\nNot realizing that a player is moving us, we engage in egoistic\nthoughts=\r\n, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake shame etc. One\nis free fro=\r\nm all those fake feelings if one realizes this. Of course,\nthat does not me=\r\nan inaction. The inspiration that comes in us to engage\nin various actions =\r\nin the world is like the hand of the player moving\nthe piece. We should res=\r\npect that engage in actions, but not see them as\nour actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writin=\r\ngs,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 1/14/10, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@... wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naama=\r\n Satya Hai - 1\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, January=\r\n 14, 2010, 6:56 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha and o=\r\nthers,\n&gt;\n&gt; Rajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I =\r\nsee\nthat your signature changed after the trip.\n&gt;\n&gt; We had a remarkable tim=\r\ne at Varanasi.\n&gt;\n&gt; The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which =\r\nis actually\nquite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is some=\r\nthing in\nhere which is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After\n=\r\nchecking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats,\nwat=\r\nching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt;\n&gt; By 9 PM Manish decided on d=\r\noing a Chandi homa, at the famous\nManikarnika samshan, on a funeral pyre. S=\r\nadhana in a samshan bhoomi is\nsomething that many great sadhakas in Hinduis=\r\nm have done before.\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various sadhana=\r\ns in a\nsamshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha - spent most of his days=\r\n\nnear the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana. The effect that a Samshan has\no=\r\nn the human consciousness can be apty used, for those who have such\ninclina=\r\ntion, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funeral\npyre is calle=\r\nd kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of\na standard homa =\r\nagni. However, there have been sadhakas, and many in\nnumber, who has used t=\r\nhe samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not\nto make a distinction betw=\r\neen pure and impure.If someone feels that a\nfuneral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or=\r\n she would be better off not trying\nanything in such a fire. The main deiti=\r\nes of a samshan bhoomi are\n&gt; Mahakala and Mahakali.\n&gt;\n&gt;  We went to buy som=\r\ne samagri - til (black and white), couple of full\ncoconuts, flowers, incens=\r\ne stick (agabatti),  kismis, havan samagri.\nWhile buying the samagri from a=\r\n shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath\ntemple, suddenly a small begger chi=\r\nld came and kept asking for food.\nThere was a sweet shop on the other side =\r\nof the lane, he pointed to the\nshop asking for food. Manish turned around, =\r\nbought some food and gave it\nto the child. The child was eating when we tur=\r\nned back towards the shop\nfrom where we were buying the samagri. In a momen=\r\nt Manish asked me to\ncheck for the child, I turned round and found no one t=\r\nhere. I looked in\nthe lane and there was no child anywhere. Just gone, vani=\r\nshed! I still\nremember the child very clearly. Manish smiled and said, &quot; Th=\r\ne deity of\nthis place wanted to see whether we had become so big sadhakas t=\r\nhat we\nare unable to feed a hungry child . That is how God comes to test\npe=\r\nople. Kya\n&gt; pata Narayan kab, kaha aur kis roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At 11 pm =\r\nwe left for Manikarnik, dressed in a combination of red and\nblack. Walking =\r\nalong the ghats we reached the samshan at around eleven\nthirty. It was quit=\r\ne crowded, with domes (people who work there to help\nthe bodies burn) and t=\r\nhe relatives. There were at least 8 to 10 pyres\nburning simultaneously. Rig=\r\nht next to it was the Ganges, pitch black at\nnight. We sat on a stairs, wai=\r\nting for the crowd to ease out a bit, not\nsure when that will happen, not s=\r\nure how people are going to react. As\nwe sat observing, the people too were=\r\n observing us with a mix of\ncuriosity and possible apprehension. Suddenly M=\r\nanish closed his eyes and\nmeditated some time, then remarked that this plac=\r\ne has a tremendous\nenergy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides i=\r\nn this samshan\nbhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look a=\r\nt something,\nI too turned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that ve=\r\nry instant\nthe dogs in the\n&gt; samshan went running to that direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Af=\r\nter waiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the\nrelative=\r\ns had left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there\nwas enough l=\r\neft to last for some time still. We went and sat next to it.\nManish started=\r\n the homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to him\ndoing the Chandi path=\r\n, trying to be in sync with his recital. A part of\nmy mind was also trying =\r\nto adjust itself to the ambience. There were\nquite a few people around watc=\r\nhing what we were upto. But no one\ndisturbed. The dome had to come and take=\r\n wood from the pyre to light\nother pyres. He did it in the most cautious ma=\r\nnner possible, taking\npieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time M=\r\nanish indicated to\nhim not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head =\r\nand did not\ndisturb that pyre again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very soon, within half an hour I n=\r\noticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had\ncome and were sitting around the pyre on=\r\n which the homa was being done.\nAs I read the Chandi I felt a great pressur=\r\ne on my head, from all sides.\nAs if a something was pressing hard on my sku=\r\nll, gripping it tight. The\nconcentration become excellent. I soon forgot wh=\r\no was watching us or\nanything else around me, except for the sound of the C=\r\nhandi Path. Very\nnice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was =\r\na piece of\niron and there was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulli=\r\nng the\nmind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am=\r\n\nnormally accustomed to. While the homa was on, suddenly one black dog\nfrom=\r\n the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept\nstarting at=\r\n Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s\nhead pointed i=\r\nn an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a\nfeeling as if it is\n&gt; n=\r\not an animal but a human being watching. Just staring and observing\nevery a=\r\nction. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of\nthat dog.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as\nwell =\r\nas in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a\nfew not=\r\nches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n&gt;\n&gt; Simply being in a=\r\n samshan and observing the human body burning up has\na powerful effect on t=\r\nhe mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones\nof a female human body bur=\r\nning. Both the femurs were visible and spread\napart. In an ordinary setting=\r\n, this kind of a scene would mean a woman\nwith &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which ha=\r\ns a very sexual connotation. In\nManikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a=\r\n feeling of how eventually\nthe body is merely a covering for something far =\r\nmore real and powerful\nthat resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will=\r\n perish as they are\nment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.\n&gt;\n&gt; Manish sa=\r\nid if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely\nto please God =\r\nthrough sadhanas - i.e you are not planning something\nnegative nor desirous=\r\n of petty mundane gains - there is very little\nchance that you will ever co=\r\nme to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi\nhoma, no ethereal beings will dis=\r\nturb you because no one wants to mess\nwith someone who is worshipping Chand=\r\ni. It is not difficult, neither\nsomething to be unnecessarily scared of. Th=\r\nere are spirits etc for sure,\nbut neither will you bother them nor will the=\r\ny bother you.  Surrendering\nto the deity is very good attitude to have. And=\r\n finally, the soul of the\nindividual on whose pyre the homa is being done, =\r\nis taken by the Goddess\nand acquires a lot of punya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus ended my firs=\r\nt experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That\nnight was Krishna Sapt=\r\nami. The next two nights again we did homas at\nManikarnik.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  =\r\nRajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; ...to be continued...\n&gt;\n&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--5-1816547238-6940077633=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste Guru!&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;[&lt;BR&gt;I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is very p=\r\nowerful.

You are lucky to have spent time with Manish i=\r\nn the blessed city of Kashi and that too at the blessed Manikarnika ghat.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is something about Manish and dogs. Even when w=\r\ne two were doing a Chandi homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a s=\r\nimilar thing happened. A pack of 7-8 dogs living on that hill came and sat =\r\naround the homam to watch. They were calm for the entire homam (a couple of=\r\n hours) and watched it. When bali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was offere=\r\nd at the end, they all got up together and ran in one direction barking and=\r\n jumping up. It was as though they were trying to chase someone.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some say that several animals, especially dogs, have subtle ex=\r\ntra-sensory perception that is superior to that of humans.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That homam is still fresh in m=\r\ny mind. When we were climbing that hill in the afternoon to do some shootin=\r\ng, Manish told me, &quot;we have a strong connection with this place. Something =\r\nwill happen here today.&quot; When we discovered two Nath path sadhus following =\r\nGorakhnath (Gorakshanath) living there, we talked to them for a while. Mani=\r\nsh saw their homa kundam there and asked, &quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday. C=\r\nan we do it in your homa kundam tonight?&quot; The person said, &quot;we are worshipp=\r\ners of Narayana and do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any ta=\r\namasik practices resorted to.&quot; We told him we would call Mahalakshmi in fir=\r\ne and there would be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We left and reached the hill with materials around 8:30 pm. The =\r\nhill and its surroundings were pitch dark and silent. There was no electric=\r\nity in that area. We climbed the hill using Manish&#39;s cell phone backlight t=\r\no show the way. There were several dogs there and they started barking when=\r\n they saw us climbing. But when we started the homam, dogs stopped barking =\r\nand sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu also came out of the hut and s=\r\nat near the fire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The moment The Mother was invoked =\r\nin fire, the whole place that was silent till then except for our chants su=\r\nddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a valley in the easte=\r\nrn direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from their trees in that area=\r\n and started making loud sounds. The whole area resounded with the sounds o=\r\nf birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this huge commotion felt=\r\n quite eerie.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nWhile on the topic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demo=\r\nnstrates how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story=\r\n sent by Prasanth today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; During that trip in the Ind=\r\nian summer of 2008, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the ski=\r\nes in front of several people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani =\r\nMaharaj was talking about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the t=\r\nopic and mention great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of =\r\npeople, I was first unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to =\r\nfeel special.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; On the night of that homam atop a hill=\r\n in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxed his rule of not allowing another person to =\r\nput aahutis in fire when doing homam. Though the plan was that I would do h=\r\nomam in my homa kundam and Manish would do in their homa kundam, he changed=\r\n his mind at the last minute and said we would do together in the same homa=\r\n kundam. He said I was ready and could share homam with him. I was ecstatic=\r\n and saw it as an &quot;acknowledgment&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already p=\r\nrovoked pride peaked with this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; My mind was filled w=\r\nith proud thoughts and my focus on mantra and deity was weak, as we chanted=\r\n Saptashati during that night&#39;s homam. Manish said nothing there. The momen=\r\nt homam was over and we went back, he scolded me with a very stern and seri=\r\nous tone, &quot;what were you thinking? We called the Mother in fire and you wer=\r\ne so distracted. You wasted a great opportunity tonight. We are chootiyas (=\r\nan expletive) and She is the Mother of the universe. How can you absorb you=\r\nr mind in egoistic thoughts in her presence? Had I been strict like my guru=\r\ns or like the gurus of the old times, you would&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He w=\r\nas in that serious mood for an hour or so and then became very kind and com=\r\npassionate again. He laughed, &quot;are you still thinking about it? Leave it Na=\r\nrasimha. These things happen. Everything happens for good. I have no doubt =\r\nyou will overcome. Time has to come for anything. Don&#39;t worry and keep doin=\r\ng sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is =\r\nvery powerful. Irrespective of what you experience and irrespective of how =\r\nmuch progress you make, she can delude you in a split second. In fact, the =\r\nexperiences one has and the progress one makes is not really one&#39;s. She giv=\r\nes them and she uses them to bind one. The moment one thinks &quot;I, so-and-so =\r\nindividual, exist&quot; and attributes those &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; to tha=\r\nt &quot;I&quot;, one is instantly bound - there is scope for pride, happiness, unhapp=\r\niness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the supreme power r=\r\nunning the universe, while performing the duties that one is inspired to pe=\r\nrform using the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY attention to A=\r\nNY results that come, including praises and criticism, is the only solution=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This experience taught me a very valuable lesson. =\r\nWhat Manish said about me to others in my presence may have been a way of t=\r\nesting me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does =\r\nnot matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *temp=\r\norary* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one&#39;s dharma. Attributes of th=\r\nat persona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The m=\r\noment one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and forms an attachment to the attri=\r\nbutes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use that pe=\r\nrsona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An attachment to a p=\r\nersona brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds one, irrespectiv=\r\ne of how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, everything tha=\r\nt is temporary perishes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, note that pride can s=\r\ntrike anytime anywhere, as long as one has an attachment to the persona. Ke=\r\nep doing sadhana, while constantly contemplating and guarding against such =\r\nan attachment. Pride is suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppre=\r\nssed again, comes back again and so on. This cycle goes on until one&#39;s atta=\r\nchment to the persona is killed completely. This is a long process. Don&#39;t w=\r\norry too much and just keep doing sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of s=\r\nomething. When Manish and I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a l=\r\name dog that was walking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a =\r\nlong way. At one point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (=\r\nor rather stair-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, boug=\r\nht some biscuit packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following=\r\n us then. In a couple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy cloth=\r\nes. He was weeping. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He said he =\r\nlost all his money at a hotel in Junagadh and has no money to even buy food=\r\n. He decided to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattat=\r\nreya and leave it to him to help him out. He was climbing up, while we were=\r\n climbing down. It was getting nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of m=\r\noney, all the biscuit packets that were with us and a soft drink. He thanke=\r\nd and gave back a few&lt;BR&gt;&gt; biscuit pieces to me and said, &quot;you guys keep=\r\n this.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later Manish told me the same thing he told =\r\nyou, &quot;you never know when and in what form god comes to test you. Kindness =\r\nand compassion towards needy people is an important dharma.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One does not need to do something beyond one&#39;s means. But, one can=\r\n have compassion, feel the other person&#39;s pain and help within one&#39;s means.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I considered the biscuit pieces given back by that =\r\nold man as Dattatreya&#39;s prasad and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, ple=\r\nase note that Vatuka Bhairava is depicted as a child.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; BTW, the Girnar trip happenened unp=\r\nlanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shooting for the=\r\n Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended. So I was th=\r\ninking in my mind with dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want to prolong th=\r\nings here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just leave Dwaraka=\r\n and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to myself. It was =\r\nlate in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka. Al=\r\nl of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to the hotel. H=\r\ne announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa aa gaya. hum =\r\nGirnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.) We rushed =\r\nto the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar around midni=\r\nght and spent the next day there. For those who do not know, Girnar is cons=\r\nidered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sometimes, Mani=\r\nsh has the uncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s thoughts. However, he says i=\r\nt is not his ability, but it is Nature listening to one&#39;s wish and fulfilli=\r\nng through another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Imagine chess pieces being moved by an expert player thinking &quot;I am a=\r\nn powerful king. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a beautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a=\r\n strong knight. I am great&quot;, &quot;I killed a great bishop despite being a pawn.=\r\n I am great&quot;, &quot;I am just a pawn, but I sacrificed myself to trap the queen.=\r\n I am great&quot; etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It may sound weird, but this is wh=\r\nat happens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people are pieces i=\r\nn another kind of chess game. Not realizing that a player is moving us, we =\r\nengage in egoistic thoughts, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake=\r\n shame etc. One is free from all those fake feelings if one realizes this. =\r\nOf course, that does not mean inaction. The inspiration that comes in us to=\r\n engage in various actions in the world is like the hand of the player movi=\r\nng the piece. We should respect that engage in actions, but not see them as=\r\n our actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; -------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.=\r\norg &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 1/14/10, rajars=\r\nhi nandy rajarshi14@... wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naama Satya Hai - 1&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, January 14, 2010, 6:56 AM&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha and others,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi, =\r\nI hope you had a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I see that your signatu=\r\nre changed after the trip.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We had a remarkable time =\r\nat Varanasi. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The moment our flight landed at the Ka=\r\nshi airport which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish =\r\nsaid there is something in here which is different. The energy is palpable =\r\nthroughout. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming aro=\r\nund the ghats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; By 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Mani=\r\nkarnika samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is somethin=\r\ng that many great sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa used to perform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a =\r\ngreat siddha -&nbsp;spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doin=\r\ng sadhana.&nbsp;The effect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness ca=\r\nn be apty used, for those who have such inclination, to further ones spirit=\r\nual growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure f=\r\norm of fire unlike the fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have be=\r\nen sadhakas, and many in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform h=\r\nomas. They chose not to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someo=\r\nne feels that a funeral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not=\r\n trying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Mahakala and Mahakali. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;We went to buy =\r\nsome samagri - til (black and white), couple of&nbsp;full coconuts, flowers=\r\n, incense stick (agabatti), &nbsp;kismis, havan samagri. While buying the s=\r\namagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a sma=\r\nll begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop on th=\r\ne other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish tu=\r\nrned around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was eatin=\r\ng when we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagr=\r\ni. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and f=\r\nound no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Ju=\r\nst gone, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled a=\r\nnd said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we&nbsp;had become=\r\n so big sadhakas that we&nbsp;are unable to feed a hungry child&nbsp;. That=\r\n is how God comes to test people.&nbsp;Kya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pata Narayan kab, kaha a=\r\nur&nbsp;kis roop me mil jaye.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; At 11 pm we left for =\r\nManikarnik, dressed in a combination of red and black. Walking along the gh=\r\nats we reached the samshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, w=\r\nith&nbsp;domes (people who work there to help the bodies burn) and the rela=\r\ntives. There were at least 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next=\r\n to it was the Ganges, pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting fo=\r\nr the crowd to ease out a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure&nbs=\r\np;how people are going to react. As we sat observing, the people too were o=\r\nbserving us with a mix of curiosity&nbsp;and possible&nbsp;apprehension.&nb=\r\nsp;Suddenly Manish closed his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked t=\r\nhat this place has a tremendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilit=\r\nies resides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned beh=\r\nind to look at something, I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space=\r\n. But that very instant the dogs in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; samshan went running&nbsp;t=\r\no that direction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; After waiting like this for about =\r\nan hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major portion had=\r\n been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for some time still.=\r\n We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offering was of t=\r\nil. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync with his =\r\nrecital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the ambience=\r\n. There were quite a few people around watching what we were upto. But no o=\r\nne disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to light oth=\r\ner pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking pieces fro=\r\nm the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to him not to ta=\r\nke any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb that pyre ag=\r\nain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that =\r\na pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the h=\r\noma was being done. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;read the Chandi I felt a great pressure =\r\non my head, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull=\r\n, gripping it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who =\r\nwas watching us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Cha=\r\nndi Path. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a =\r\npiece of iron and there&nbsp;was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pu=\r\nlling the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I=\r\n am normally&nbsp;accustomed to.&nbsp;While the homa was on, suddenly&nbsp;=\r\none black dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs an=\r\nd kept starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with i=\r\nt&#39;s head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeli=\r\nng as if it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not an animal but a human being watching. Just stari=\r\nng and observing every action. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into t=\r\nhe body of that dog.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The homa finished at around 3 A=\r\nM. The meditations both at the end as well as in between, were all excellen=\r\nt. The mind would just get pulled a few notches above the ordinary with sli=\r\nghtest bit of effort.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Simply being in a samshan and =\r\nobserving the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind. In a=\r\n nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Both th=\r\ne femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind o=\r\nf a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very sexu=\r\nal connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of h=\r\now eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more real and=\r\n powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as th=\r\ney are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Man=\r\nish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to pleas=\r\ne God through sadhanas&nbsp;- i.e you are not planning something negative n=\r\nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you w=\r\nill ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal bein=\r\ngs will disturb you because no one wants to mess with&nbsp;someone who is w=\r\norshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be unnecessari=\r\nly scared of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bother t=\r\nhem nor will they bother you. &nbsp;Surrendering to the deity is very good&=\r\nnbsp;attitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyr=\r\ne the homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of pun=\r\nya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa =\r\non a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again=\r\n we did homas at Manikarnik. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp=\r\n;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ...to be continued...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--5-1816547238-6940077633=:4--\r\n\n"}}
