But you are going to the other extreme when suggesting that physic=\r\nal immortality is the highest ideal. Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical psudo-vedanti=\r\nn of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical body is t=\r\no be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical body and we=\r\n are something else residing in a shell called the physical body. What we t=\r\nruly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physical body may=\r\n perish. But, if someone currently thinks that one is a physical body, one =\r\ncannot simply ignore the physical body. One has to *use* the physical body =\r\nto eventually realize that one is not the physical body. A mere intellectua=\r\nl statement of it is not tantamount to its realization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that acti=\r\non (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are two wings with which the bird of indi=\r\nvidualized consciousness flies into the sky of self-realization. Physical b=\r\nody is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and carefully to perfor=\r\nm the *right actions* that can free one.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As I said earlier, one perfo=\r\nrming actions without correct knowledge (that god is the doer of all action=\r\ns!) is like a person who is walking around a mountain not realizing that th=\r\ne goal of walking is to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking fore=\r\nver and not reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct knowle=\r\ndge but not performing actions is like someone who knows that reaching the =\r\ntop of the mountain is the goal and keeps staring at the top, without walki=\r\nng. Such a person will remain at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and=\r\n karma alone are not able to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares th=\r\nem to two wings of a bird. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge i=\r\ns what takes us towards liberation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Physica=\r\nl bodies of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long time, like cen=\r\nturies or millennia. But, eventually, they too may give up physical body. S=\r\nomeone mentioned Vallalar, but he gave up physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt;  \n&gt; A=\r\nctually, to a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortali=\r\nty will sound silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modifica=\r\ntions such as physical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A=\r\n siddha, as long as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in=\r\n an individualized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up =\r\na physical body. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge ba=\r\nck in the ethereal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and s=\r\no on. So, what is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Trilinga S=\r\nwami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bhai=\r\n of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to Varana=\r\nsi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dak=\r\nshineshwar and taught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga =\r\nSwami. Later, a grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami=\r\n a big container full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his impris=\r\nonment by the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some gua=\r\nrds to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the s=\r\name time. Even when he finally decided to give up his body and his disciple=\r\ns put his body in a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen after a=\r\n few minutes to walk on the other side.\n&gt;  \n&gt; To a realized being with a hi=\r\ngh enough command over duality, creation and destruction of physical body i=\r\ns not a big deal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One who thinks that a gold coin is special and need=\r\ns to be preserved forever will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a g=\r\nold coin, a gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all basically t=\r\nhe same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate it again. Preserving the coin=\r\n forever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The key poi=\r\nnt is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities because he wanted th=\r\nem or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The same non-dual Self fil=\r\nls us all. Whether X realizes non-dual Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, th=\r\ne realization is the same. But, if one retains individual ego-consciousness=\r\n and interacts with the field of duality, different possibilities are there=\r\n. One may engage in various actions using a physical body and at the end dr=\r\nop the ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, one may engage in variou=\r\ns actions using a physical body, then give it up and tie the ego-consciousn=\r\ness to an ethereal body and remain in a higher realm for a long time. If so=\r\n, one may re-enter a physical body from time to time. But, all this is gove=\r\nrned by one&#39;s caliber and evolution in the field of duality. Though, all ar=\r\ne the same at the non-dual level, different beings have different caliber i=\r\nn the field of duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be=\r\n the same as somebody else.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I like Aurobind=\r\no, but I am afraid he lent himself vulnerable to misinterpretation when it =\r\ncomes to divinization of matter. I say quite emphatically that physical imm=\r\nortality as an ideal and as the end goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous id=\r\nea.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self an=\r\nd, if needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do whatever comes=\r\n spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning is overcome, Nature starts to sho=\r\nw one the role one has to play. One should just play the role given to one =\r\nwell, instead of asking for this role or that role.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;         =\r\n          http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namask=\r\nar,\n&gt; &gt; The aim of my mails is only to free the minds of the reader from bi=\r\nases, caused by dominating propaganda of Vedantists - that is to see the Ph=\r\nysical body as something to be ignored for spiritual pursuit.

Vishnu is one of the many devatas fr=\r\nom which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physical consciousness finds its expression, another being A=\r\ngni, thus attaining\n&gt; &gt; &gt; divinity in body requires worshipping more than o=\r\nne devata simultaneously.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Striving for physical immortality a=\r\ns a great ideal can create such an unhealthy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fascination that is not=\r\n idealized in any scriptures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The divinizing of Physical body b=\r\ny Mahavatar Babaji is a scripture in itself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and since such a thing i=\r\ns not being idealized by any scripture, it only means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that: &quot;Scriptur=\r\nes other than Vedas contain partial truth&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They talk about the=\r\n highest truth, but only Vedic method, of worshipping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; divinity in its=\r\n numerous forms, is the most complete expression of truth for all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n creatures in all the planes of existence. Such a worship would finally lea=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to divinization of Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (1) As I said, Yo=\r\nga Vaasishtham and other scriptures tell you to unidentify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with the =\r\nbody to realize higher realities. They do talk about higher states\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;b=\r\neyond samdhi, but never tell you to think of the physical body as you attem=\r\npt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to realize.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedic method, worshipping the devatas, al=\r\nlows for immortality, through Soma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devata.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) The on=\r\nes in scriptures who actively pursued the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;divinization/immortalizati=\r\non of physical body did not succeed. For example, king\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Trishanku wan=\r\nted to ascend to the immortal plane in his physical body. His\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;family=\r\n guru Maharshi Vasishtha refused to help him.

The=\r\ny do talk about higher states\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;beyond samdhi, but never tell you to t=\r\nhink of the physical body as you attempt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;to realize.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (2) Saints/yogis who ascended to the immortal planes with their physic=\r\nal body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(e.g. Sant Tukaram who was taken by Vishnu himself to Vaikun=\r\ntha in his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;*physical* body to live there forever!) never talked abou=\r\nt such a pursuit. They\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;only talked about surrender to the Divine. Th=\r\ney did not actively try to divinize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their physical being, but instea=\r\nd ignored it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) The ones in scriptures who actively p=\r\nursued the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;divinization/immortalization of physical body did not suc=\r\nceed. For example, king\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Trishanku wanted to ascend to the immortal p=\r\nlane in his physical body. His\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;family guru Maharshi Vasishtha refuse=\r\nd to help him.

As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the =\r\nbasis of sense-mind, Chit is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;basis of Physical consciousness, an=\r\nd Sat is the basis of existence of Physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;plane, so lets not argue=\r\n that there is another reality which is better and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;happier than this=\r\n one, and that this world is a myth. If physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;sense-experience is=\r\n fleeting, it is because one has not progressed enough to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;realize wh=\r\ny the truth of being is expressed in such a way at this plane of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;exi=\r\nstence ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different fr=\r\nom Ananda, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the =\r\nfield of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect =\r\nself-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What =\r\ndoes the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThis question was asked because you were trying to compare apples with\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;oranges, by saying that (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with e=\r\ngo\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness, presuming that they act upon each other.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Truth of the matter is that Soul is not in competiti=\r\non with ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness ever, because God is never in competition =\r\nwith his creation !! If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a liberated soul wants to take part in an eg=\r\no competition (Yada Yada hee\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, howe=\r\nver high, like that of an avatar. Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;took the wheel of the char=\r\niot and tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Other people may =\r\ndiffer with me on this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsisten=\r\ncies in your views and a biased and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; OTOH, I see a lot of co=\r\nnsistency in this mail exchange than the last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;time. It is understand=\r\nable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent in every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;mind-set, because =\r\nat times, it is not possible to write every little detail for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sa=\r\nke of consistency.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the happiness one =\r\ngets when one achieves something in the field &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of duality is not pe=\r\nrmanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the h=\r\nighest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is permanent.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo Ghosh has clearly stated:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;...If the immortal and infinite spirit has veiled =\r\nitself in Matter and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is emerging, the development of a liberated Sup=\r\nramental being who shall impose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in Mind, Life and Matter a higher la=\r\nw than that of limitation and Division, is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the inevitable conclusion=\r\n from the nature of the cosmic existence. There is no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;reason why suc=\r\nh a being should not liberate and make Divine the physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;existence=\r\n as well as the Mind and Life....&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, lets=\r\n attempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with highest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ideal =\r\nof Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done, because its basis is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn about all the achievements made =\r\nby all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;those we can know of, irrespective of their being recognized =\r\nas good or bad by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;limited set of people, for a limited duration of=\r\n time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These are just a few of my views bas=\r\ned on what I have read so far,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;because I don&#39;t see any reason, why a=\r\nn afterlife would bring me greater truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;than where I am now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You say that &quot;Killing Ravana was not a great deed&quot; and y=\r\net look at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;binding the physical body of both Ram and Lakshman&quot; as a=\r\n &quot;great deed&quot;. I see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;inconsistencies in your views and a biased and =\r\nsympathetic attitutde towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ravana and his kin. Anyway, I will jus=\r\nt make a couple of specific points on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti, which is a subtle topi=\r\nc and not easy to understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mu=\r\nndane level, Shakti is Memory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If memor=\r\ny is extended the longest, the most fundamental and first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;memory sho=\r\nuld say that one is Brahman. If one&#39;s memory extends that far, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\ncreates the highest Shakti! In other words, self-realization brings the hig=\r\nhest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;hi=\r\nghest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great question!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any lower shakt=\r\ni is an ability to perform actions with objects in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;field of dual=\r\nity. Why does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nfield of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the oth=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the fi=\r\neld of duality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;w=\r\nhich is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one is pursuing=\r\n an individual will, one may be swimming with or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;against the divine =\r\nwill. One will have some successes and some failures, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pleasures=\r\n and some pains. When one&#39;s individual will has dropped off and one is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;flowing with the rhythm of the divine will, one is in bliss no matter wh=\r\nat one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;does. One *can* do anything, but one does only what divine rh=\r\nythm wills done by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Only the=\r\n fully detached Shiva can beget Shakti in totality and demons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;like R=\r\navana or Mahisha or Shumbha can only get some trappings of Shakti but can\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;never beget Shakti in totality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\n demon like Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;self-rea=\r\nlized rishi. It may seem like the demon has more shakti. But the rishi\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;is in bliss whether he is alive or being killed, whether he is at his he=\r\nrmitage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;or in prison. The happiness demons got from their successes =\r\nwere short-lived and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ended later. But the rishi was in constant blis=\r\ns. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;superior.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, just order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; e=\r\nnemies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the thing with s=\r\nhakti. Shakti is the ability to do things in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the field of duality. J=\r\nust as you do not give important work to irresponsible\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;people, any l=\r\nevel of shakti never goes to people who do not know how to handle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;th=\r\nat level of shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a rishi wan=\r\nted, he could&#39;ve summoned Rudra to finish off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ravana or Hiranyakashi=\r\npu. But, a rishi is in bliss no matter what and does not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;break divin=\r\ne rhythm. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;establ=\r\nish certain lessons for future and take care of Ravana, a rishi will let\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;that happen and not do anything hasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated an=\r\nd killed Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had done that 10 times himself, beheading his own=\r\n head, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the shakti of his sadhana was such that he got a new head=\r\n every time to continue\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the sadhana. On a deeper level, it is Rudra =\r\nthat finally effects the death of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical consciousness, so even th=\r\nat part is not in the hands of a mortal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Ravana above Rama in shakti, =\r\nI\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your understanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized h=\r\nis shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;only after he was reminded of it. Karna, in the final batt=\r\nle, forgot his Shastra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;vidya because of the curse of his Guru. Gener=\r\nalizing, Shakti is the ability to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;remember the series of actions to =\r\nbe done to effect a cause lawfully,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;irrespective of the doer. Thus, =\r\nHanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the association wit=\r\nh Rama. Ravana didn&#39;t have perfect memory, else he would have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;attemp=\r\nted to kill Vibhishana sooner than later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The use of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of both\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Ram and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, because e=\r\nven the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;motherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a r=\r\nope. Meghnaad was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Ga=\r\nruda using divine powers, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;result would have been different.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhishana reveali=\r\nng the secrets, it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;impossible to kill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of the field of =\r\nduality and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to =\r\nmanipulate objects in the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ca=\r\nnnot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; latter represents the highest shakti and Lord Rama had it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ?

Lor=\r\nd Hanuman had a perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender to Rama and said th=\r\nat all his power came to him due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devoti=\r\non to Lord Rama. If you still put Ravana above Rama in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;shakti, I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your understanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of =\r\nthe field of duality and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;even a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of =\r\nability to manipulate objects in the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;latter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represents the highest shakti and Lord Rama=\r\n had it. Ravana was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka who had a =\r\nvery high level of mastery over the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but his self-control was lacking.

It is a continuum. As on=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer and increases self-control, =\r\none may get some results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Thus, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person sti=\r\nll afflicted by undesirable conditioning may acquire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity to get some results. But, people like Ravana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;Hiranyakashipu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc fell in the end!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;self-control&quot;. Both\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Surrender of slaves is not the surrender I am talking about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;when I=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk about surrender to god. The instinct of self-=\r\npreservation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another aspect of ego. A per=\r\nson with ego and pride may suppress\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pride\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd self-importance out of no choice, for self-preservation. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s pride without sacr=\r\nificing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-preservation, one may still do so. Thi=\r\ns is conditional\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;surrender.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the case of g=\r\nod also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a mess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and one is helpless may still be conditional surrender. But,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;when the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender is unconditional and one see=\r\ns god as the controller\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;of all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any c=\r\nonditions attached, irrespective of whether life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-control\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; A powerless person may also become angry. But, as you said, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;a=\r\nnger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;s self-co=\r\nntrol increases,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to become an=\r\ngry comes down. That increases one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;power. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; person who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infinitely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;Higher the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-control and purity, higher th=\r\ne power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
