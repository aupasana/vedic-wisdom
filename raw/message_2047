Horoscope can give clues, but our understanding may or may n=\r\not be perfect always. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s chart has Sun =\r\n(Raama/Maatangi in general opinion) in 12th from Atma Karaka in navamsa and=\r\n Jupiter (Vaamana/Taaraa) owns it. A highly learned astrologer once argued =\r\nwith me publicly that Lord Rama and Taaraa were Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s i=\r\nshta devatas and not Kaali and tried to justify that. Well, if Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa comes to you and the thumb rules you use do not show Kaali as i=\r\nshta devata for him, the rules you are using have something missing.\n \nThus=\r\n, horoscopic thumb rules are not reliable. However, the vibrations you feel=\r\n when chanting different mantras and visiting different temples can be usef=\r\nul clues. The word of a sadguru is the best way to know one&#39;s ishta devata.=\r\n Second best is internal guidance. Horscope comes only after that.\n \nIrresp=\r\nective of ishta devata, I will recommend Mahaganapathi homam for anybody fo=\r\nr a while. After Ganapathi gives an initial clearance and push, the path wi=\r\nll become clear by itself and clear guidance will come, from either inside =\r\nour outside.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Sanjay=\r\n Prasad \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, June 25, 200=\r\n9 12:35 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Sanjay&#39;s Spirituality Query\n\n\n  De=\r\nar Narasimhaji \n\n  Namaste,\n\n  Thanks for the detailed explanation. It real=\r\nly helps and I really appreciate your time & patience in explaining it so b=\r\neautifully for a layman.\n\n  One followup question:\n\n  Regarding Homam - wil=\r\nl it not depend on my chart? As per my chart (26/2/73, 17:07, 87E19,23N29, =\r\nLeo Lagna) and my brief study of VRA/CoVA, My Isht devta will be Shiva(Sun)=\r\n, Palan devta is Samba siva (have not heard much about him) and Guru Devta =\r\nis Skanada. \n\n  Further, As per inclination, I do feel great energy in SOME=\r\n of shiva and ganesh temples(from last 3 years). It&#39;s a difficult to descri=\r\nbe feeling - it&#39;s as if a spiritual energy/vibration is surrounding me. Rec=\r\nently, I went to a shani( w/Hanuman & Ganesha) temple, and it also seemed t=\r\no have good vibration to me. How do I reconcile these facts on choosing the=\r\n homam? Is it just the play of my mind to be ignored , or divine interventi=\r\non to be interpreted. \n  Or \n  if Mahaganapathi Homam is THE starting point=\r\n before we go ahead with any effort at reconciliation.\n\n  Thanks & Regards\n=\r\n\n  Sanjay\n   \n  On Thu, Jun 25, 2009 at 8:29 AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\ncharter.net&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n    =EF=BB=BF \n\n    Namaste,\n\n    (a) Correct. It i=\r\ns fine to work hard like a honeybee, be engrossed in material life and feel=\r\n many happinesses and sadnesses of life. The only thing missed out is self-=\r\nrealization and moksha.\n\n    (b) Not exactly. Spiritual progress does not m=\r\nean shunning material things. Some people leave wife, children, house, car =\r\netc and live in forest, in an attempt to get control over the mind and remo=\r\nve the attachment to and dependency on those things. However, it is not nec=\r\nessary. One can remove the dependency on all things that surround one, even=\r\n as one remains in their middle! Staying away from something is neither nec=\r\nessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment. What things and people are ar=\r\nound you and what actions you engage in are not the problem that blocks you=\r\n from moksha. It is how you look at them and with what frame of mind you en=\r\ngage in the actions that are the blockages. So the problem is not the mater=\r\nial world around you, but your own mind that is the problem. Detachment doe=\r\ns not mean not loving or not engaging in actions. Detachment means loving b=\r\nut without expectations and engaging in actions but without expectations.\n\n=\r\n    If you give love and do not expect anything in return, if you put in yo=\r\nur best effort towards what you see as your dharma for people around you an=\r\nd do not worry about things that go wrong, if you focus on the present and =\r\nengage in the best possible actions without too much of worry or anxiety ab=\r\nout past or future, can there be anything more effective or efficient than =\r\nthat?\n\n    If one is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf and engages in ac=\r\ntions without attachment, one is not necessarily a failure materially. Such=\r\n a person will do everything a person with deep attachments does, but only =\r\nbetter! I say better, because a detached person does not waste time worryin=\r\ng about things out of one&#39;s hand or things that went wrong. A detached pers=\r\non always focuses on the best action to engage in right now and does it.\n\n =\r\n   Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment does not make you more effec=\r\ntive or efficient. In fact, if anything, attachment makes you less effectiv=\r\ne and efficient. If you are detached, you will give unconditionally and eng=\r\nage in actions without any energy being dispersed on worrying over things o=\r\nut of your control. Normal people waste a lot of their time, energy and emo=\r\ntional space, worrying about things they cannot control. A detached person =\r\ndoes what is in one&#39;s control perfectly and accepts the result whole-hearte=\r\ndly.\n\n    (c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you will do everything you see as y=\r\nour dharma, but only better. You will not feel happy or sad or jealous and =\r\nangry etc. Your mind will be in a stable, peaceful and blissful state alway=\r\ns. It is worth it. You are not getting out of anything, but putting in the =\r\nbest effort.\n\n    (e) Yes, do not think of emancipation or liberation. Thin=\r\nk one small step at a time. Think of getting some physical and mental disci=\r\npline. Think of some minor control over mind. Thinking overcoming minor wea=\r\nknesses. Start slowly.\n\n    (f) There are many ways. The specific way using=\r\n which many people will benefit in the next few centuries and the specific =\r\nway which I am here to teach is &quot;homam&quot; or fire ritual. When you are with a=\r\n person, the physical vibrations made by the person&#39;s lips can be heard phy=\r\nsically by your ears. Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle body and=\r\n mind can be &quot;heard&quot; by your subtle body and mind. That is why we feel plea=\r\nsant when we are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. The vibrat=\r\nions produced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us do have a=\r\nn impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very pleasant, powerf=\r\nul and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. Being next to =\r\nfire of a reasonable size is like being with a great yogi.\n\n    If one does=\r\n a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam everyday for 2-3 years, things will automa=\r\ntically start to fall in place.\n\n    The problem you are seeking is your mi=\r\nnd. The solution is also in your mind. You use your mind to train mind to l=\r\net go of its weaknesses and attachments one by one.\n\n    Best regards,\n    =\r\nNarasimha\n    -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n    Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n =\r\n   Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n    S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n    -------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n\n      ----- Original Message ----- \n      F=\r\nrom: Sanjay Prasad \n      To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n      Sent: Wed=\r\nnesday, June 24, 2009 6:17 AM\n      Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Descent=\r\n of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n\n      Dear Narasimha,\n\n      Very good =\r\narticle/discussion..Thanks for sharing it.\n\n      If I can, Let me also ask=\r\n some basic questions. (I am very new to all this. Search for some answers =\r\nhas brought me to this forum.) \n\n      a) Why Madhukaitam is  so bad/evil? =\r\nIs it not that the world is being sustained by people keeping their head do=\r\nwn and doing the routine work? Do we not please the God by keeping our head=\r\n down and playing the role assigned to us ? An obvious answer comes to mind=\r\n is that it will keep us away from emancipation and/self-actualization. Cor=\r\nrect/Incorrect? \n\n      b) So,  Is spirituality and materialism two poles a=\r\npart (and twain shall never meet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of =\r\nprofessional success in my career, Am I doomed not to become a good spiritu=\r\nalist (???)? or, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does it mean =\r\nI should stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do understand ab=\r\nout &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot; issue - but, then I also read about King Janak. Can=\r\n I combine these two - if yes, how?\n\n      c) Getting even more confused no=\r\nw,  Why do we say that emancipation is our spiritual goal. If GOD created u=\r\ns, and put us on this stage - should our goal not be to play the role dutif=\r\nully, which God wants us to play. By seeking for emancipation, are we tryin=\r\ng to get off the stage and trying to escape the role assigned to us. Are we=\r\n not contradicting the God&#39;s scheme of things by trying to get out of the s=\r\ncheme? \n\n      d) Or, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; f=\r\nirst and then ask us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure=\r\n he will not be playing &quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??\n\n      e) Some=\r\ntimes, I also think that all these above questions are meaningless. I look =\r\nat my pre-school kid and the way she has put her faith in her teacher. She =\r\nis not worrying about her profession or phd thesis right now. Similarly, pr=\r\nobably, Emancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul etc are problems that we should =\r\nnot be thinking at the begining of our spiritual journey - just look to lea=\r\nrn/experience more till we are ready (for what?)\n\n      f) Then, what do we=\r\n mean by spiritual journey? where/how do we start? I thought about doing ho=\r\nmam/reciting mantra - but is that the right way? or there is another way. P=\r\nrobably, there are many ways - then how do I choose my way? An &quot;user guide&quot;=\r\n or &quot; spirituality for dummies&quot; book  would have been useful. Do we have on=\r\ne?\n\n      I will appreciate if you can take some time out to guide me here.=\r\n In fact, probably, I donot even have the right question right now - forget=\r\n about articulating them well and seeking the answer (I am seeking the prob=\r\nlem :))\n\n      Regards\n\n      Sanjay\n\n      On Wed, Jun 24, 2009 at 9:12 AM=\r\n, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n      Namaste Rajarshi,\n\n =\r\n     The non-dual Aatman or Brahman is the original source of everything. B=\r\nut the world of duality is a lot more tricky.\n\n      Please see the &quot;many f=\r\naced diamond&quot; analogy for god at the end of http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom/message/1 to get clarity on why different people give different=\r\n hierarchies and consider different beings as supreme. As per Narayana sook=\r\ntam, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Naraya=\r\nna. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, =\r\nShiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, a=\r\nll gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi. A=\r\ns per Suryopanishat, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) =\r\ncame from Surya. And so on.\n\n      The duality is so vast and yet non-duali=\r\nty is the underlying supreme reality in duality. Thus, the hierarchy within=\r\n hierarchy will have to start at the connection with non-duality and it is =\r\nnot one. In other words, any hierarchy given by anyone is with respect to o=\r\nne perspective. I will not be too keen on finalizing one hierarchy, because=\r\n that cannot be done really. If you haven&#39;t before, do read the analogy in =\r\nthe last part of the mail mentioned above. It is an analogy worth getting i=\r\nnto your thinking system.\n\n      *        *        *\n\n      &gt; I mean is it =\r\nthe Rishi who is acting our the Mother&#39;s instructions\n      &gt; or is it She =\r\nwho is creating the environment for the Rishi&#39;s wish\n      &gt; to come true? =\r\nWhich one came first?\n\n      There is no causal relationship between the tw=\r\no. Actions of rishis and the will of the supreme cosmic being are in sync. =\r\nThey just happen together. Neither causes the other.\n\n      Rishis are the =\r\nmost perfected beings without a trace of ego and yet performing actions of =\r\ngreat consequence, with zero attachment. They operate right on the border o=\r\nf duality and non-duality.\n\n      *        *        *\n\n      &gt; As a devotee=\r\n it is natural and simple to believe that the God I\n      &gt; pray to is the =\r\nUltimate Supreme authority, but when I hear that\n      &gt; Rishis are even be=\r\nyond this, then doubt creeps in, is the deity\n      &gt; therefore not as supr=\r\neme as is made out to be?\n\n      Our ego does not leave us even in sadhana.=\r\n Sometimes, one&#39;s belief that one&#39;s guru is the best guru or the god one pr=\r\nays to is the supreme one is rooted in one&#39;e ego and one&#39;s need to be the b=\r\nest and be associated with the best. Just contemplate if that is the case a=\r\nnd if it is, try to root out such thinking.\n\n      Having said that, do loo=\r\nk at the god you pray to as the supreme and try to reach the supreme throug=\r\nh him/her by surrendering to him/her. If you take a low level manifestation=\r\n of that deity, then rishis may indeed be beyond him/her as Vimalananda sai=\r\nd. But, if you take the highest manifestation of the deity, as the supreme =\r\ncosmic being, then rishis are his playmates and neither above nor below.\n\n =\r\n     *        *        *\n\n      If you take a company, there may be a chair=\r\nman who may be the highest authority. But, it may be a ceremonial role and =\r\nsome may consider CEO to be higher while some may consider the chairman to =\r\nbe higher. Why bother about who is higher? In a company does well, they bot=\r\nh work with understanding.\n\n      The hierarchy is irrelevant to one who is=\r\n a clerk at the company. Just follow the order of your boss (guru) instead =\r\nof wondering whether chairman calls the shots or CEO.\n\n      Best regards,\n=\r\n      Narasimha\n      -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n      Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n      Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n     =\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n      Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Sri Jagann=\r\nath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n      ---------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------- \n\n        ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n        From: rajarshi nandy \n        To: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com \n        Sent: Tuesday, June 23, 2009 6:56 AM\n        Subject:=\r\n Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n\n\n        =\r\n      Namaste Narasmihaji\n\n              I have a question.

A=\r\nlso, he need not be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreo=\r\nver, when it comes to great lineages, there are connections between all. Fo=\r\nr example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremo=\r\nst disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in C=\r\nalcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just a fe=\r\nw years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge.=\r\n Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who =\r\nwas a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga S=\r\nwami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga=\r\n Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.\n\n                C=\r\noming back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of ear=\r\nth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some a=\r\nttention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of t=\r\nhe higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by t=\r\nhe mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some positi=\r\nve changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus a s=\r\nmall part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few importa=\r\nnt souls to do some key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogi=\r\ns etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfi=\r\nl different parts of a divine play.\n\n                You may then see sever=\r\nal (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings b=\r\norn on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. =\r\nEach of them will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine, =\r\nbased on what their part in the play is.\n\n                *        *       =\r\n *\n\n                The &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is a=\r\nll around us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego in pretty mu=\r\nch everybody. At the grossest level, he manifests as blatant lies, wrong pr=\r\nopaganda etc.\n\n                One should not tolerate this Asura (demon) a=\r\nnd fight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura or those afflicted b=\r\ny him. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand for truth but not =\r\nhate the liar at the same time. There is nothing that needs to be hated in =\r\nthis world. One should learn to do the job assigned to one by Nature withou=\r\nt attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and with unconditional lov=\r\ne (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.\n\n                &gt; This was a =\r\nvery interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n                &gt; says a=\r\nbout changes coming in the world.\n\n                I know very little. But =\r\nI was told that an age that is somewhat like the bygone ages will be establ=\r\nished on earth for a few hundred years in the coming decades. The reason th=\r\ne Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked him to spread simple homam=\r\n procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds for that. Manish also t=\r\nold me that all this is the play of a senior maharshi.\n\n                Bes=\r\nt regards,\n                Narasimha\n                ------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n                Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n                D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n       =\r\n         Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n      =\r\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n=\r\n                Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologe=\r\nr.org\n                Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org\n                ------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- \n\n                  ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n                  From: Laxmi Narayan \n                  To: vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com \n                  Sent: Sunday, June 21, 2009 6:50 PM\n  =\r\n                Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Descent of the Supramenal Consc=\r\ninousness\n\n                        Hi, Some time back I saw  similar articl=\r\ne and was intrigued by it.

I am =\r\nposting it here for anyone interested.\n\n                                Nea=\r\nr the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yo=\r\ngi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been express=\r\ned before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come=\r\n for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to=\r\n manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence i=\r\nnto Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Ear=\r\nth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her =\r\nmaterial body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n                     =\r\n           =EF=BF=BD\n                                Sri Aurobindo was join=\r\ned in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later beca=\r\nme known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive ce=\r\nllular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties w=\r\ne face today.\n                                =EF=BF=BD\n                   =\r\n             Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, =\r\nand that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of =\r\nthe divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The pro=\r\ncess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolu=\r\ntion. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these =\r\ntwo events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he fores=\r\naw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BD=\r\nsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change =\r\neverything on Earth.\n                                =EF=BF=BD\n            =\r\n                    Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri =\r\nAurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere wit=\r\nhin him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit over=\r\nshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constru=\r\ncted personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evide=\r\nnce of the outer senses seems to contradict it.\n\n                          =\r\n      Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolution=\r\nary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made treme=\r\nndous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent=\r\n its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before=\r\n her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, wh=\r\nat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields=\r\n of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into c=\r\nellular consciousness.\n\n                                Evolution took a gr=\r\neat leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of =\r\nMind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more moment=\r\nous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks=\r\n about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to ex=\r\nperience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul=\r\n, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.\n             =\r\n                   =EF=BF=BD\n                                Next is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =\r\nbirth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=\r\nhat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=\r\nind-consciousness. \n\n                                Thirdly is the =EF=BF=\r\n=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=\r\n be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =\r\nthat has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n\n                    =\r\n            Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSuprame=\r\nntal Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of =\r\nmatter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Master=\r\ns.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully =\r\nrealized upon Earth.\n\n                                The great work of Sri=\r\n Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down in=\r\nto the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified =\r\nconsciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneo=\r\nusly being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the=\r\n moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matt=\r\ner.\n                                Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=\r\n=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother spea=\r\nk of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially a=\r\nnti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkne=\r\nss, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death.=\r\n These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be =\r\nin control of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darknes=\r\ns (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of S=\r\nuffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to=\r\n wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =\r\n=EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of the=\r\nir own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be di=\r\nfficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders i=\r\nn the current political sphere.\n\n                                With the d=\r\nescent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human struc=\r\ntures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although t=\r\nhe changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The=\r\n power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most =\r\npart consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a =\r\npower of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means other =\r\nthan dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed=\r\n into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may b=\r\ne interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the d=\r\nestruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization=\r\n!\n\n                                When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo=\r\n and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum desc=\r\nent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supra=\r\nmental transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about wit=\r\nh a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still conside=\r\nrable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n\n    =\r\n                            This was a very interesting read and matches wh=\r\nat Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.\n\n                   =\r\n             -Regards\n                                 Rajarshi\n\n          =\r\n                      The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Su=\r\ntra \n                       \n             \n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_007C_01C9F561.7BFC3990\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: =\r\nsmaller; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: cente=\r\nr 50%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62=\r\npx; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 6=\r\n2px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}=\r\n\nDIV.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hove=\r\nr {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: =\r\nnone\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DI=\r\nV.attach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PAD=\r\nDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-=\r\nrow DIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DI=\r\nV DIV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bol=\r\nd\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #=\r\nd8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#y=\r\ngrp-mkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;=\r\n\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px=\r\n 0px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: =\r\n0 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\nSTYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear Sanjay,&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Yes, the right deity who takes one far changes from \nfrom=\r\n person to person.

A highly learned astrologer once =\r\nargued with \nme publicly that Lord Rama and Taaraa were Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa&#39;s ishta \ndevatas and not Kaali and tried to justify that.

It is fine to work hard like a \n    honeybee, be engrossed in =\r\nmaterial life and feel many happinesses and \n    sadnesses of life. The onl=\r\ny thing missed out is self-realization and \n    moksha.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial size=3D2&gt;(b) Not exactly. Spiritual progress does not \n    mean shunnin=\r\ng material things. Some people leave wife, children, house, car \n    etc an=\r\nd live in forest, in an attempt to get control over the mind and \n    remov=\r\ne the attachment to and dependency on those things. However, it is not \n   =\r\n necessary. One can remove the dependency on all things that surround one, =\r\n\n    even as one remains in their middle! Staying away from something is ne=\r\nither \n    necessary nor sufficient to overcome attachment.&nbsp;What thing=\r\ns and people \n    are around you and what actions you engage in are &lt;EM&gt;not=\r\n &lt;/EM&gt;the problem \n    that blocks you from moksha. It is how &lt;EM&gt;you&lt;/EM&gt; =\r\nlook at them and with \n    what frame of mind &lt;EM&gt;you &lt;/EM&gt;engage in the ac=\r\ntions that are the \n    blockages. So the problem is not the material world=\r\n around you, but &lt;EM&gt;your \n    own mind&lt;/EM&gt; that is the problem. Detachmen=\r\nt does not mean not loving or \n    not engaging in actions. Detachment mean=\r\ns loving but without expectations \n    and engaging in actions but without =\r\nexpectations.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If you give love and do not e=\r\nxpect anything in \n    return, if you put in your best effort towards what =\r\nyou see as your dharma \n    for people around you and do not worry about th=\r\nings that go wrong, if you \n    focus on the present and engage in the best=\r\n possible actions without too \n    much of worry or anxiety about past or f=\r\nuture, can there be anything more \n    effective or efficient than that?&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If one is like a drop of water on a lotus lea=\r\nf \n    and engages in actions without attachment, one is not necessarily a =\r\nfailure \n    materially. Such a person will do &lt;EM&gt;everything &lt;/EM&gt;a person=\r\n with deep \n    attachments does, but only better! I say better, because a =\r\ndetached person \n    does not waste time worrying about things out of one&#39;s=\r\n hand or things that \n    went wrong. A detached person always focuses on t=\r\nhe best action to engage in \n    &lt;EM&gt;right now &lt;/EM&gt;and does it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Let me put this in one sentence: Attachment \n    does=\r\n not make you more effective or efficient. In fact, if anything, \n    attac=\r\nhment makes you less effective and efficient. If you are detached, you \n   =\r\n will give unconditionally and engage in actions without any energy being \n=\r\n    dispersed on worrying over things out of your control. Normal people wa=\r\nste a \n    lot of their time, energy and emotional space, worrying about th=\r\nings they \n    cannot control. A detached person does what is in one&#39;s cont=\r\nrol perfectly \n    and accepts the result whole-heartedly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n   =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;(c) If you are a jeevanmukta, you will do \n    everything=\r\n you see as your dharma, but only better. You will not feel happy \n    or s=\r\nad or jealous and angry etc. Your mind will be in a stable, peaceful and \n =\r\n   blissful state always. It is worth it. You are not getting out of anythi=\r\nng, \n    but putting in the best effort.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n(e)&nbsp;Yes, do not think of emancipation or \n    liberation.

The specific way \n    using which many people will benefit in t=\r\nhe next few centuries and the \n    specific way which I am here to teach is=\r\n &quot;homam&quot; or fire ritual. When you \n    are with a person, the physical vibr=\r\nations made by the person&#39;s lips can be \n    heard physically by your ears.=\r\n Similarly, the vibrations made by his subtle \n    body and mind can be &quot;he=\r\nard&quot; by your subtle body and mind. That is why we \n    feel pleasant when w=\r\ne are with great saints and uneasy in some companies. \n    The vibrations p=\r\nroduced by the subtle and causal bodies of people around us \n    do have an=\r\n impact on us. Fire is one powerful object which has very \n    pleasant, po=\r\nwerful and cleansing vibrations at the subtle and causal levels. \n    Being=\r\n next to fire of a reasonable size is like being with a great \n    yogi.&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If one does a 20-40 min Mahaganapathi homam \n=\r\n    everyday for 2-3 years, things will automatically start to fall in \n   =\r\n place.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The problem you are seeking is your=\r\n mind.

Is it not that the world is \n      being sustained by people ke=\r\neping their head down and doing the routine \n      work? Do we not please t=\r\nhe God by keeping our head down and playing the \n      role assigned to us =\r\n? An obvious answer comes to mind is that it will keep \n      us away from =\r\nemancipation and/self-actualization. Correct/Incorrect? \n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;b) So,&nbsp; Is =\r\nspirituality and materialism two poles apart (and \n      twain shall never =\r\nmeet..). Say I wd like to reach the heights of \n      professional success =\r\nin my career, Am I doomed not to become a good \n      spiritualist (???)? o=\r\nr, If I want to become self-actualized by 2025, does \n      it mean I shoul=\r\nd stop planning to climb the professional ladder? I do \n      understand ab=\r\nout &quot;Limited Bandwidth&quot; issue - but, then I also read about \n      King Jan=\r\nak.

If GOD created us, and put us on \n      this stage - should o=\r\nur goal not be to play the role dutifully, which God \n      wants us to pla=\r\ny. By seeking for emancipation, are we trying to get off \n      the stage a=\r\nnd trying to escape the role assigned to us. Are we not \n      contradictin=\r\ng the God&#39;s scheme of things by trying to get out of the \n      scheme? &lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;d=\r\n) Or, Is it part of God&#39;s scheme to put us in this &quot;maya&quot; first and \n      =\r\nthen ask us to get out of the &quot;maya&quot;? Why will he do so? I am sure he will =\r\n\n      not be playing&nbsp;&quot;rats in the maze&quot; game. Then, why??&lt;/DIV&gt;\n     =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;e) Sometim=\r\nes, I also think that all these above questions are \n      meaningless. I l=\r\nook at my pre-school kid and the way she has put her faith \n      in her te=\r\nacher. She is not worrying about her profession or phd thesis \n      right =\r\nnow. Similarly, probably,&nbsp;Emancipation/Merger in Cosmic soul \n      et=\r\nc are problems that we should not be thinking at the begining of our \n     =\r\n spiritual journey - just look to learn/experience more till we are ready \n=\r\n      (for what?)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;f) Then, what do we mean by spiritual journey? where/how=\r\n do we start? \n      I thought about doing homam/reciting mantra - but is t=\r\nhat the right way? \n      or there is another way. Probably, there are many=\r\n ways - then how do I \n      choose my way? An &quot;user guide&quot; or &quot; spirituali=\r\nty for dummies&quot; book&nbsp; \n      would have been useful.
