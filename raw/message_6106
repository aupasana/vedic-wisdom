Patanjali, who taught that &quot;yoga\nis restraint of the fluctuati=\r\nons of the mind&quot; (yogas chitta vritti\nnirodhah), sought to restrain those f=\r\nluctuations by restraining the breath,\nwhich can when performed with care c=\r\nultivate prana admirably. Unfortunately, ever\nsince Patanjali many unwary s=\r\ntudents and teachers of yoga have equated\npranayama with prolonged, forcibl=\r\ne holding of the breath, which can actually\nruin the body.\n\n=A0\n\n=A0=A0=A0\n=\r\nWise pranayama begins with observation. When moving your body, how often\ndo=\r\n you ponder what causes your body to move? When exercising, do you exercise=\r\n\nyour muscles alone, or also the force that drives them? Do you limit yours=\r\nelf\nto the physical posture when you perform an asana, or do you perform it=\r\n\nenergetically as well? A good first step to effective prana stewardship is=\r\n to\nalert yourself to your energy posture, your habits of holding and utili=\r\nzing\nyour energy.\n\n=A0\n\n=A0=A0=A0\nUnderstand your natural affinity with pra=\r\nna and you gain insight into\nwhich method of prana cultivation will work mo=\r\nst efficiently and effortlessly\nfor you. Sound prana handling is methodical=\r\n, and the rishis, India&#39;s seers\nwho spent their long lives poring over the =\r\nmany facets of the paradox that is\nlife, proposed an variety of methods to =\r\nencourage prana to adopt an suitable\npace. They advised at the outset that =\r\nwe use the principles of Ayurveda, India&#39;s\nlife-science, to balance vata, p=\r\nitta and kapha, the three energy strategies of\nembodied beings. These Three=\r\n Doshas encourage ailments when they are permitted\nto struggle with one ano=\r\nther, and work to support the organism when taught to\ncooperate. When the T=\r\nhree Doshas strive toward amity they serve to strengthen\nagni, or tejas, th=\r\ne fire of transformation that permits us to feed and nourish\nourselves. Str=\r\nong fire digests cleanly the prana that we consume through our\nbreath and t=\r\nhrough our food, and strong agni and prana facilitate the\ndevelopment of oj=\r\nas, the pure &quot;juice&quot; that makes living worthwhile by\ncementing together bod=\r\ny, mind and spirit and fueling immunity from illness.\n\n=A0\n\n=A0=A0=A0\nStron=\r\ng tejas and ojas in a body provide prana a good seat (asana) there.\nWell-se=\r\nated prana provides us the visceral resolve we need to perform our every\nac=\r\ntion precisely, rightly, with great resolve and enthusiasm. Such a body mov=\r\nes\nnot from obligation but from the joy of movement that is prana&#39;s nature.=\r\n\nWell-seated prana enhances immeasurably our ability to perform any yoga po=\r\nsture\n(asana). As prana becomes carefully settled through the practice of a=\r\nsana our\nbodies become fit for pranayama, which can promote control of the =\r\nsenses and\nthe mind. Breath, prana and mind are mutually and inherently rel=\r\nated; cultivate\none well and the other two will fall into line. While many =\r\nyogis do use\nbreathing exercises to cultivate prana and mind, others use me=\r\nditation to\nregulate the breath and prana. Some practice Svara Yoga, contro=\r\nl of prana and\nmind by means of song, and some align breath, prana and mind=\r\n by means of\nundiluted devotion to Divinity.\n\n=A0\n\n=A0=A0=A0\nDevotion may b=\r\ne the supreme method for prana control, just as faith is\nthe supreme remedy=\r\n for disease. Strong faith can turn any placebo into an\neffective medicine =\r\nas surely as doubt can render ineffectual the most powerful\nof remedies. Wh=\r\nile implicit devotion to Reality can compensate for\nmisalignments in yoga p=\r\nractice, no quantum of technical proficiency in asana\nwill suffice to restr=\r\nain the mind&#39;s fluctuations when that mind is plagued by\ndoubt. Devote your=\r\nself to knowing and cultivating your prana, and your every\ncapillary will s=\r\noon swell with the exhilaration of genuine vitality.
