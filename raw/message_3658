People who follow Satvik path for spiritual evolution should avoi=\r\nd eating rajsik and tamsik food.\n\nAnother thing told in Shrimad Bhagwat Gee=\r\nta is that the aim and state of mind behind the karma decides that the Karm=\r\na will be counted as Satvik, Rajsik or tamsik and hence will decide the out=\r\ncome of karma.  If a homam/karma/ritual/work is done without selfishness/gr=\r\need/want then that will be counted as satvik. If same homam/karma/ritual/wo=\r\nrk is done with greed/want/ahamkar then it will be counted as rajsik. and i=\r\nf same homam/karma/ritual/work is done due to ignorance and agyana then it =\r\nis counted as tamsik.\n\nSame karma done with same procedure but different mi=\r\nndset will give different results.\n\nplease forgive me if I sound rude\n\nKind=\r\n Regards\nAtul\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; One last thing and excuse me for the de=\r\nviation from the subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking about Shri Krushna himself as=\r\n an example (for the particular verse of Bhagvad Gita) but i was engrossed =\r\nin Aghora reading and postponed to write.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the morning i am seeing t=\r\nhat Narasimha has given Shri Krishna&#39;s example much the same way as i thoug=\r\nht during previous night.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear KK, Lord himself has given that verse i=\r\nn Gita but how many of us can literally follow his *Actions* who has instru=\r\ncted this very verse.

However, you are free to add=\r\nress me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasim=\r\nha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one)=\r\n when one self-identifies with it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Although, it may seem easy to unde=\r\nrstand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Ne=\r\nvertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Important information about Vimalananda which I came to know onl=\r\ny yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day=\r\n passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of hi=\r\ns departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequentl=\r\ny and occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointe=\r\nd out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact tho=\r\nughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The=\r\n Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says =\r\nand not try to do what he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now whatever I wrote above see=\r\nms sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts =\r\nfurther (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth=\r\n can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda o=\r\nr Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, =\r\nwe tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high l=\r\nevel of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many things=\r\n in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to=\r\n universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal=\r\n gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they a=\r\nte meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually kne=\r\nw what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each=\r\n and every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete backgroun=\r\nd behind their each action and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  moreover their self identification is=\r\n missing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them =\r\nto accomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect ch=\r\nain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Nar=\r\nen is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning w=\r\nithin him which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction doe=\r\ns not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled bu=\r\nt for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If Viveka=\r\nnanda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpo=\r\nse which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained =\r\nby a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere se=\r\nekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them =\r\nand then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other=\r\n undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullif=\r\nying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is =\r\nalso possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the anima=\r\nl&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent r=\r\neasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Onl=\r\ny Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda save=\r\nd a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did =\r\nnot even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  years actual=\r\nly met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay =\r\naway from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, =\r\nswami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his gur=\r\nu will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later be=\r\ncame disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually g=\r\niven a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami=\r\n Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda was all=\r\n knowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So moral of my whole writings=\r\n is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconv=\r\nentional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanan=\r\na Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our c=\r\nompletely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Great coincidence =\r\nof thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Veg =\r\neating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not a=\r\ndvisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on=\r\n Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he =\r\nsurvived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relis=\r\nhed it.
