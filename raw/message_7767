I was waiting for this one for a long time. =\r\nMany times I thought to send an email regarding this, but then didn&#39;t  do, =\r\nthinking that it was not appropriate to ask Guru to give something, when ti=\r\nme comes Guru would give it by himself, and looks like the time is coming n=\r\now.\n\n10-12 years ago you changed the astrology world by offering free softw=\r\nare and free astrology teachings. A few years ago, you started the homam mo=\r\nvement to benefit people and now I see a new movement getting started with =\r\nSatya Narayana Vratam and Pooja manual.\n\nSatya Narayana pooja is the most c=\r\nommon pooja which most of the people in every part of India do, but with my=\r\n limited experience in North India, not many people know the exact method o=\r\nf doing it. This pooja is done every month at my house, my dad&#39;s house and =\r\nseveral families do that I know of. All we do is just read the katha bookle=\r\nt and sing the prayer in the end. Better than not doing anything, but not t=\r\nhe most right way of doing. I feel with your manual, we would learn the rig=\r\nht way of doing this pooja and vratam, and I am sure this manual  is going =\r\nto benefit large number of people across the world.\n\nThanks\n\nRegards\n\nVikra=\r\nm\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am putting together a manual.
