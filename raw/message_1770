Gita 9.22\n&gt; \n&gt; For tho=\r\nse constant yogis who worship with thoughts centered only on Me, I Myself c=\r\narry their yoga (necessities for sustenance) and (protect) their kshema (th=\r\ne necessities)&#2404;\n&gt; Devotees who are always connected to God in their t=\r\nhoughts, have to be really special. We can understand that. But wait a minu=\r\nte here.. what is God saying? Is He promising to haul groceries on His own =\r\nback and deliver them to His devotees? And also, be their personal chowkida=\r\nr?\n&gt; God hauled groceries for Arjun Mishra. That is the story I came to tel=\r\nl you today. His story is found in the Bhaktamaal grantha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pundit Arju=\r\nn Mishra lived with his wife in Puri, Orissa. I do not know his exact time,=\r\n but after talking with some informed people, got the impression that they =\r\nlived between 150-200 years ago. Puri is also known as the Purushottam kshe=\r\ntra ( Land of Lord Purushottama Jagannatha ). The famous Jagannatha temple =\r\nis here. The ancient history of this holy place is described in the Skanda =\r\nPuran (Vishnu Khanda-Purushottam Mahatmyam).\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, back to the story=85=\r\n Arjun Mishra and his wife did not have much material wealth. In fact, they=\r\n were poorer than most poor. Like other Brahmins in those days, he never sh=\r\nowed any interest in making money. His life was for studying the Gita and t=\r\nhe Bhagavata. He was a great devotee and saw the world as Krishna-maya. Tha=\r\nt means, he saw Sri Krishna everywhere and in everybody, pervading the univ=\r\nerse. The world is seen that way by the exalted devotees.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you can i=\r\nmagine, such devotees are entirely unselfish. Arjun Mishra wanted to find a=\r\n way to share his most valued wealth: his learning and his Spiritual experi=\r\nences. What should he do?\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Well, the jagadgurus wrote commentaries on =\r\nthe Gita&quot; thought Arjun Mishra, &quot;I might just do that as well=85.I would ce=\r\nrtainly love to discuss those verses where I can mention my own Spiritual e=\r\nxperiences.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was thinking about this verse\n&gt; yena bhutaani asheshhe=\r\nna drakshyasi aatmani atho mayi. 4.35\n&gt; By which (Spiritual knowledge) you =\r\nwill (initially) see all beings in your Atman and then (see all) in Me.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; And this verse,\n&gt; Vidya vinaya sampanne braahmane gavi hastini\n&gt; shuni ch=\r\na eva shvapaake cha panditaah samadarshanah. 5.18\n&gt; The pundits see a wise =\r\nand humble Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater to be equal (=\r\nin Spirit).\n&gt; \n&gt; And these verses,\n&gt; Samam sarveshu bhuteshu tishthantam pa=\r\nrameshvaram. 13.27\n&gt; The Parameshwar is equally present in all beings.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Yadaa bhuta prithagbhaavam ekastham anupashyati\n&gt; Tata eva cha vistaaram b=\r\nrahma sampadyate tadaa. 13.30\n&gt; When (someone) sees the beings of all diffe=\r\nrent characteristics to be one (in Spirit) and sees them to be expanded fro=\r\nm That, then (that person) attains the Brahman.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such Spititual vision =\r\nof the world has been called sama-darshan (equal vision) in the Gita. Sri K=\r\nrishna said that these exalted devotees obtain paraa-bhakti (unwavering dev=\r\notion) (18. 54). Arjun Mishra was ready for it. Still, he had some lingerin=\r\ng doubts.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;But=85 do I really know enough to write about the whole Git=\r\na?&quot; he wondered. &quot;Well, let&#39;s look at it this way=85Arjuna heard the Gita f=\r\nrom Sri Krishna Himself and saw His vishwarupa; yet sage Suta did not consi=\r\nder him a boddhaa (knower) of the Gita, just someone who knows &quot;kinchit pha=\r\nlam&quot; (a bit of the benefits).\n&gt; \n&gt; krishno janati vai samyak, kincit kunti-=\r\nsutah phalam. Gita Mahatmya 3 (Vaishnava tantra saara).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Krishna ce=\r\nrtainly knows (the Gita), the son of Kunti (Arjuna) knows a bit of its bene=\r\nfits.\n&gt; \n&gt; And again, acharya Madhva initially thought that he could say ab=\r\nout his commentary of the Gita that his goal was to, &quot;bakshyaami shaktitah&quot;=\r\n (describe as far as I can), but later, he changed it to &quot;bakshyaami leshat=\r\nah&quot; (describe, only be a tiny part of the teachings).&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, nobody =\r\ncan be wise enough to discuss every message in the words of God. Those thou=\r\nghts humbled Arjun Mishra very much. But then, he wanted to write the comme=\r\nntary. So he reasoned, &quot;if I get stuck, I will ask Sri Krishna to help me o=\r\nut with the meaning and wait. I am not going to rationalize, but just wait =\r\nfor Sri Krishna. May be Sri Krishna will have mercy on me, and teach me per=\r\nsonally! Nothing can be more wonderful.&quot;\n&gt; He was doing fine with writing t=\r\nhe commentary until he came to verse 9.22 (that&#39;s the verse in the beginnin=\r\ng of this story). A doubt came to his mind. Vahaamyaham? Can it really be t=\r\nrue? God lugging provisions on His own back? How can that be? He believed i=\r\nn God&#39;s words in the Gita, but just couldn&#39;t accept that God can also be th=\r\ne porter for His devotees.\n&gt; \n&gt; He had promised to himself that he will not=\r\n rationalize, but that&#39;s exactly what he started doing. He reasoned, &quot;May b=\r\ne God means that He will arrange the delivery by someone else.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thinki=\r\nng so, he drew a line through the word vahaamyaham in his commentary with r=\r\ned ink. Isn&#39;t it interesting how we want God to conform to our model of Him=\r\n? But the devotee in Arjun Mishra took over soon. He remembered his vow abo=\r\nut not rationalizing. He suddenly became very disappointed with himself. He=\r\n stopped writing and got up, with a sad heart that he just broke his vow. W=\r\nhat could he do? After a while, he got back some of his composure and said =\r\na prayer to Sri Krishna in all humility, &quot;Please teach me, O Madhava! I am =\r\nignorant and foolish and I do not know what you mean by vahaamyaham. Please=\r\n teach me, and guide me so the commentary can be completed. You give so muc=\r\nh help to Your devotees. I know I am only a poor undeserving devotee, but p=\r\nlease have mercy on me and help me.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; It was already mid-morning. His w=\r\nife came to see him and said, &quot;We have no food today. You have been writing=\r\n since morning. Please go to beg for alms, otherwise we will have to go hun=\r\ngry.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra went out for the alms. In those days, people consid=\r\nered it an honor to give food grains and vegetables to Brahmins like him. T=\r\nheir begging is called maadhukari. Arjun Mishra was distraught from the mor=\r\nning, so he thought that he would go to take a dip in the holy Rohini kunda=\r\n first. He set out from home, the kunda was a little distance away.\n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n he was walking towards the kunda, he remembered the story of the old crow =\r\nin the Skanda puran. When the crow realized that death was near, it flew to=\r\n the Rohini Kunda and took a bath in the water and then looked devotedly at=\r\n Lord Jagannatha on the temple alter. Soon afterwards, it died and became f=\r\nree from life. Arjun Mishra thought that taking a dip in such a holy water =\r\nwill help him as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; While he was gone, two young boys arrived at th=\r\ne Mishra home with big sacks on their backs, huffing and puffing from the l=\r\noad. They looked miserable and were crying loudly. Arjun Mishra&#39;s wife was =\r\nsitting on the verandah, looking out for her husband. When she saw the boys=\r\n, she came down the steps running, very concerned. She was an extremely kin=\r\nd lady.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What happened to you, my children? Why are you crying? I cann=\r\not understand who would hurt such young boys. Who is making you carry such =\r\nheavy sacks? Where are you going?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Saying so, she helped them unload t=\r\nhe sacks. Then she had the shock of her life. She discovered deep lateral s=\r\ncars of fresh injury on their backs. Blood was oozing out from their scars.=\r\n &quot;Oh! What kind of heartless person can beat small children in this manner?=\r\n&quot; she exclaimed.\n&gt; \n&gt; She picked the two boys up in her arms and brought th=\r\nem inside the house&#2404; She sat them down on wooden seats they had in th=\r\ne verandah, and ran inside. There was no food in the house, so she brought =\r\ntwo cups of cold water for them. After drinking the water, the boys looked =\r\nslightly more comfortable. They said to her, &quot;Ma! Punditji beat us, and mad=\r\ne us carry the grocery sacks. Those groceries are for you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My husban=\r\nd has beaten you? But I have never known him to be angry&#2404; For what re=\r\nason? When did he beat you? What did he beat you with?&quot; she almost collapse=\r\nd in shock.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We do not know why, Ma&#2404; But he beat us with a sharp=\r\n stick of iron&quot; they said&#2404; &quot;Just a little while ago&#2404;&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; She =\r\ncould not wait for all the answers. She had to take care of their wounds fi=\r\nrst. She ran inside again, and came back with a big pot of water and some b=\r\nandage cloth. They had a ghritakumari (aloe vera) plant in the yard; she ra=\r\nn to it and broke a fat leaf. Then she mashed the leaf with her masala-grin=\r\nding stone and collected the expressed resin. She was now ready to dress th=\r\neir wounds. She cleaned their wounds, put a little of the ghritakumari extr=\r\nact and made a cloth bandage. The ghritakumari resin soothed their wounds a=\r\nnd the boys were feeling a lot better.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Our friends are waiting for us=\r\n for play. We want to go, Ma&quot; they said. Then they bowed before her and lef=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra&#39;s wife was happy that she could help them feel better.=\r\n She also knew how little boys are.. always short on patience. So, she hugg=\r\ned them and did not press for more answers and let them go. Then her though=\r\nts turned again to her husband. She just did not understand how her gentle =\r\nhusband could have hurt those boys. Anyway, she did not have time to think =\r\ntoo much. She needed to start cooking. So she picked up the groceries and s=\r\ntarted cooking. Her husband should come back any time now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishr=\r\na had taken the vow of three-house maadhukari. He would only go to three ho=\r\nuses and accept one handful of rice and some vegetables from each house. It=\r\n had rained heavily the night before and it rained all morning. The three h=\r\nouses he went to, were all flooded. He called out, but nobody was home. Peo=\r\nple had left for higher ground. So he came back home empty-handed. When he =\r\ngot home, he found his wife was cooking something. He thought that somebody=\r\n must have brought some food for them.\n&gt; \n&gt; He announced, &quot;My love, the rai=\r\nns have flooded a lot of houses. Nobody was there to give me alms today. Bu=\r\nt I see you are cooking, who brought us food?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; His wife was crying, &quot;H=\r\now could you beat those two little boys?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;What do you mean? I beat tw=\r\no boys? I didn&#39;t beat any boys.&quot; He exclaimed.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You didn&#39;t beat them?&quot;=\r\n She said in disbelief.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Why should I beat anybody? You saw what I was=\r\n doing since morning. I was writing about the Gita. Then I went to the Rohi=\r\nni kunda and took a bath. Then I went for maadhukari. From there, I came st=\r\nraight back home. I did not see any boys.&quot; He said in defense.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;You di=\r\nd beat them. They told me how you beat them with a sharp stick of iron. The=\r\ny had scars across their backs, and were bleeding. I treated them with ghri=\r\ntakumari myself. &quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I did not beat anybody. I didn&#39;t. Why sh=\r\nould I lie to you?&quot; he insisted.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Making them carry those heavy sacks =\r\nwas bad enough. What did they do that you beat them with a sharp iron stick=\r\n?&quot; She grumbled, clearly not believing her husband.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I do not know wha=\r\nt you are talking about.&quot; Arjun Mishra retorted. He went inside to the room=\r\n where he was writing in the morning. He was about to sit down, but his wif=\r\ne followed him there.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Come now and eat. I have much work to do. I hav=\r\ne to clean after you.&quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All right, I am coming. But I am ver=\r\ny unhappy that you do not believe me.&quot; He said.\n&gt; Arjun Mishra followed her=\r\n and sat down to eat. &quot;I do not understand how the day is going. First, I g=\r\net stuck with a verse. Then I do not get any maadhukari. Then you say that =\r\nI beat up two young boys.&quot; He mumbled. &quot;Who brought us the food?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Tho=\r\nse two boys, who else? You had sent them with the food, they told me.&quot; She =\r\nsaid.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I sent two boys with food? I did not do any such thing. Are you=\r\n sure they brought the food for us?&quot; He asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;They said your name. A=\r\nnd said that you made them carry the sacks of food and bring to me.&quot; She sa=\r\nid, &quot;Eat now. I have work to do.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Whose children are they? Do you kno=\r\nw them?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;No. I do not. They are not from our village.&quot; She =\r\nsaid.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Not from our village? What did they look like?&quot; he asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;They were cute little boys. The younger one was dark and the older one was=\r\n fair.&quot; She said.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra did not need any more clues. He immedia=\r\ntely realized who the two boys were: they were Sri Krishna and Balarama. In=\r\n the morning, he had doubted that Sri Krishna will personally carry provisi=\r\nons for his devotees. To show him that He does, He carried a sack of grocer=\r\nies on His back. He even made Sri Balarama carry a second sack for them for=\r\n another meal. And, he struck out the word vahaamyaham with red ink. That m=\r\nark Sri Krishna carried as injury.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra could eat no more. He =\r\nwas chocking with emotion. He had picked up a morsel, but he put that on hi=\r\ns head and sat there in silence. Tears streamed out from his eyes.\n&gt; \n&gt; His=\r\n wife was perplexed. &quot;What happened?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My love, this is no mere food, =\r\nthis is prasad. Those boys were Sri Krishna and Balarama. You are so fortun=\r\nate that you saw them. Eat some of the prasad yourself and let&#39;s go out to =\r\nfetch everybody in the village. This we should share with everyone.&quot; He sai=\r\nd excitedly.Then he explained to her what had happened since morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nShe ate some prasad excitedly. After that, they had a big celebration with =\r\nthe neighbors sharing the prasad. There were lots of Harinam singing and ec=\r\nstatic dancing. After everyone had gone home, Arjun Mishra went to his writ=\r\ning room. He wrote: vahaamyaham, vahaamyaham, vahaamyaham. He was convinced=\r\n of God&#39;s promise to His devotees.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arjun Mishra wrote an excellent com=\r\nmentary of the Gita with real Spiritual insights. His commentary is famous =\r\nfor the triple mention of vahaamyaham. The message of this story is that we=\r\n should never seek an imaginary relationship with God and trust God to pers=\r\nonally help us, teach us and at the end, liberate us. If we do not have tha=\r\nt confidence, we are not worthy of being called devotees.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
