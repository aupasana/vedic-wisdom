When someone says \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha is a great inspiration to=\r\n people&quot;, I may be tempted to be \n&gt; happy. When someone says &quot;Narasimha is =\r\na deluded person&quot;, I may be \n&gt; tempted to be unhappy. But, who is this &quot;Nar=\r\nasimha&quot; they all refer to? \n&gt; Is it &quot;me&quot; or someone else? More importantly,=\r\n is he the *same* being or \n&gt; *many different* beings? Let us look at it ve=\r\nry logically and very \n&gt; systematically.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Thes=\r\ne people commenting on Narasimha may have met me physically or seen \n&gt; my p=\r\nhoto and my emails. If you go by objective reality perceived by \n&gt; physical=\r\n senses, they know me only by my face, looks, facial expressions \n&gt; when I =\r\nsay things, my spoken words and me written words. Do all their \n&gt; notions a=\r\nnd statements about me follow objectively from this objective \n&gt; reality ab=\r\nout me that is perceived by senses? Can one say objectively \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha i=\r\ns a great inspiration to people&quot; or &quot;Narasimha is a deluded \n&gt; person&quot; from=\r\n it? Of course, not.\n&gt; \n&gt; People&#39;s minds are conditioned by all their prior=\r\n experiences. They take \n&gt; the tangible cues (written/spoken words, facial =\r\nexpressions etc) and \n&gt; guess what is going on in the other person&#39;s mind, =\r\nusing their life \n&gt; experiences as a database to look up. They think based =\r\non the \n&gt; experiences, &quot;If one says or does XYZ, this is what is in his min=\r\nd or \n&gt; this is what he wants&quot;. To one person, a few sentences written by m=\r\ne \n&gt; suggest that I have experienced god and I can show him the path to god=\r\n. \n&gt; To another person, a few sentences written by me suggest that I know \n=\r\n&gt; nothing and am desperately seeking followers and fame. And so on! \n&gt; Logi=\r\ncally speaking, based strictly on objective reality perceived by \n&gt; physica=\r\nl senses, none of these conclusions is guaranteed to be correct. \n&gt; Though =\r\nmy true personality is intangible to people, people are looking \n&gt; at the t=\r\nangible cues from me and constructing notions of who I am, \n&gt; within *their=\r\n* minds.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone says &quot;Narasimha is a gr=\r\neat inspiration to people&quot;, one is \n&gt; NOT talking about &quot;me&quot;. One is talkin=\r\ng about a character called \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha&quot; that was crated and sustained in =\r\none&#39;s mind by oneself. \n&gt; Though this character was created based on a few =\r\ntangible cues from me, \n&gt; the significant contribution to the creation of t=\r\nhis character was from \n&gt; that person&#39;s own mental conditioning. So this ch=\r\naracter need not even \n&gt; be similar to me! It is a totally different being =\r\ncompared to me and \n&gt; exists/lives only in the mind of that person!\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nen someone says &quot;Narasimha is a deluded person&quot;, one is NOT talking \n&gt; abou=\r\nt &quot;me&quot;. One is talking about a character called &quot;Narasimha&quot; that was \n&gt; cra=\r\nted and sustained in one&#39;s mind by oneself. Though this character was \n&gt; cr=\r\neated based on a few tangible cues from me, the significant \n&gt; contribution=\r\n to the creation of this character was from that person&#39;s \n&gt; own mental con=\r\nditioning. So this character need not even be similar to \n&gt; me! It is a tot=\r\nally different being compared to me and exists/lives only \n&gt; in the mind of=\r\n that person!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If people say &quot;Narasimha is a g=\r\nreat inspiration to people&quot; and I am \n&gt; tempted to feel happy, doesn&#39;t it m=\r\nean I am foolishly identifying with a \n&gt; character created and maintained i=\r\nn someone else&#39;s mind? If people say \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha is a deluded person&quot; and=\r\n I am tempted to feel unhappy, \n&gt; doesn&#39;t it mean I am foolishly identifyin=\r\ng with a character created and \n&gt; maintained in someone else&#39;s mind? As the=\r\nse characters are created and \n&gt; maintained in their minds, I have nothing =\r\nto do with those beings and \n&gt; should not identify with them, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; To make it even more extreme and interesting, I wil=\r\nl give another set of \n&gt; special examples.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few people had dreams in =\r\nwhich I met them and told them to do specific \n&gt; types of homam. Some actua=\r\nlly started doing homam after the dream and \n&gt; some said their lives were t=\r\nransformed after the dream. One person, for \n&gt; example, cleared a tough & i=\r\nmportant exam after doing badly in the mock \n&gt; exams. As I never thought of=\r\n these people (and did not even know of some \n&gt; of them!), I obviously had =\r\nno direct influence on the dreams they had. \n&gt; The dreams were creations of=\r\n their own minds. The character called \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha&quot; who came in their dre=\r\nams and transformed their lives, is a \n&gt; being built in their own minds. Ba=\r\nsed on their reading of my writings \n&gt; and based on their own mental condit=\r\nioning, they created a powerful \n&gt; character called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in their su=\r\nb-conscious minds, who is a very \n&gt; good sadhaka and guru and having the ab=\r\nility to transform people. That \n&gt; powerful character (and not me!) came in=\r\n their dreams and transformed \n&gt; their lives!\n&gt; \n&gt; Same thing applies to so=\r\nmeone who takes me as guru and becomes realized. \n&gt; Based on my writings an=\r\nd words and their own mental conditioning, if \n&gt; someone succeeds in creati=\r\nng a powerful character called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in \n&gt; their own mind and lets hi=\r\nm affect them positively, they can make great \n&gt; spiritual progress. But th=\r\nen, that character is not really me! If \n&gt; someone says &quot;you are my guru&quot;, =\r\n&quot;you gave me so and so&quot;, &quot;you affected \n&gt; me in so and so way&quot;, I will unde=\r\nrstand that a powerful character they \n&gt; constructed in their minds, with a=\r\n little input from me, did all of \n&gt; that!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; No=\r\nw, one specific example stands out. In this case, the person did not \n&gt; kno=\r\nw me, never heard of me and did not know of my website. This person \n&gt; just=\r\n had a dream in which someone came and said, &quot;I am Narasimha Rao. \n&gt; You do=\r\n so and so homam with so and so mantra&quot; and gave a mantra. This \n&gt; person r=\r\nemembered the dream and did a google search next morning and \n&gt; landed on m=\r\ny website. The photo in my website apparently matches the \n&gt; person in the =\r\ndream. This surprised the person and gave faith.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I had no clue =\r\nand did not know this person at all. So, rationally \n&gt; speaking, I had no r=\r\nole to play in this! In this case, this person did \n&gt; not even read my emai=\r\nls or other writings and hence &quot;I&quot; had no direct or \n&gt; indirect role in the=\r\n dream. The phenomenon that a character called \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; was const=\r\nructed in that person&#39;s sub-conscious mind with \n&gt; some similarities with m=\r\ne (looks and spiritual interest) is interesting, \n&gt; but does not mean that =\r\ncharacter is me. Either the person did know about \n&gt; me sometime back and f=\r\norgot (but remembered sub-consciously), or some \n&gt; force up there manipulat=\r\ned that mind. In either case, it is not of my \n&gt; doing and the character in=\r\n the dream is a creation of that force and \n&gt; that mind and not me.\n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that there are notions in the minds of=\r\n people who met us \n&gt; in some manner (and possibly even in people who did n=\r\not meet us), which \n&gt; we may be tempted to identify with and say &quot;that is I=\r\n&quot;. Positive and \n&gt; negative comments on those notional beings give us pride=\r\n and shame, \n&gt; happiness and sadness! How weird!\n&gt; \n&gt; As you cling on to mo=\r\nre and more identities, you are stuck more and \n&gt; more. If you think logica=\r\nlly and impassionately, you will see that all \n&gt; these characters are someo=\r\nne else&#39;s creations and different from you. So \n&gt; they are not &quot;I&quot;. As you =\r\ndrop off one identity after another, you become \n&gt; very light. Your mind be=\r\ncomes very clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, let us come to a funda=\r\nmental question. We saw that the notions of \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha&quot; in the minds of =\r\npeople are not based on objective reality \n&gt; alone and based on their own c=\r\nonditioning and created (and grown over \n&gt; time!) in their own minds! Now, =\r\nwhat about the notion of &quot;Narasimha&quot; in \n&gt; my own mind? Is that based on ob=\r\njective reality or is it also created \n&gt; (and grown over time!) in my own m=\r\nind based on my own conditioning? If \n&gt; so, who is the real &quot;I&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; I wil=\r\nl let you contemplate on it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =\r\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;       =\r\n                Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
