It is possible to touch with hands and receive energy. O=\r\nnce one young man came to my Jyotish class in Boston and touched my feet at=\r\n the end=A0to take blessings. Normally, when people to do that, I mentally =\r\nsay &quot;sarvam Sri Krishnarpanamastu&quot; and imagine that the obeisance is going =\r\nto Lord Krishna. But, this time, I could clearly feel some energy leaving m=\r\ne. It was a very tangible feeling.
