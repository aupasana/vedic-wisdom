Shakti is the sum total of all the b=\r\neings with various agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing vari=\r\nous karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphala that is commensura=\r\nte with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. anothe=\r\nr being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cum=\r\nulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rul=\r\nes that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for th=\r\neir delivery.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At any time, s=\r\nome karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in t=\r\nhis life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this =\r\nlife&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anyt=\r\nime soon. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based o=\r\nn the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The assignment and ordering of these pools will=\r\n constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new actions and adds th=\r\nem to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in ter=\r\nms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and hence the po=\r\nols may be re-arranged.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As one engages in remedial measures=\r\n such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, c=\r\nhange one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings =\r\n(including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of k=\r\narmaphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of d=\r\nelivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable=\r\n karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within th=\r\ne same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or =\r\npushed up in order within the same pool.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0W=\r\nhen someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behind it (=\r\nthis is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arranging k=\r\narmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people around =\r\none, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to g=\r\nive karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala =\r\nanytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the k=\r\narma that it is trying to manipulate.

However, even great souls have a l=\r\not of negative karmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lo=\r\nt of positive karmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, c=\r\nurses and blessings can often make some difference.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; st=\r\nory Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If one thinks =\r\nthat one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened.

The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially and impas=\r\nsionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of actions an=\r\nd fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil persons=\r\n to the noblest of saints.

The best we can do with them, with s=\r\nome effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing i=\r\ns to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfi=\r\nsh actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and=\r\n selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are =\r\ngood karmas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When it comes to manip=\r\nulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through co=\r\nnscious effort and current action, yes, it is possible and general guidelin=\r\nes are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific im=\r\npact of each action. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcomin=\r\ng a karma has to be commensurate with the karma itself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You need only small force to push a cat out of your w=\r\nay, but need a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As=\r\ntrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ---=\r\n-----\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;_____________________=\r\n___________\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40y=\r\nahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sub=\r\nject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appo=\r\ninted by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possibl=\r\ne for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king.

The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s =\r\nkarma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s kar=\r\nma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39;=\r\n karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or =\r\noath. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and ar=\r\ne actually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amo=\r\nunt of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usua=\r\nlly make an assumption. We assume that there is a person, and separate from=\r\n the person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from=\r\n time to time. We then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas=\r\n from our karmic pipeline.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that=\r\n a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you ar=\r\ne nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, you=\r\nr vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your =\r\nvaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier said than=\r\n done.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a =\r\nblessing.

I vaguely remember Vimalananda men=\r\ntioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On s=\r\nimilar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elde=\r\nrs? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalin=\r\nga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; what do thi=\r\ns items really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones fo=\r\nr planets =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; do they bring forward good kar=\r\nmas or they create new ones?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous=\r\n &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cr=\r\nied out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worshi=\r\np God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but la=\r\nter tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth=\r\n. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to re=\r\ncollect this episode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadh=\r\nana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that ch=\r\nanges?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanking you,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Digamber\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\r\n--562241088-1722989076-1362379713=:79926\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: =\r\nauto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;VAR id=3Dyui-ie-cursor&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv1907127576yui_3_7_2_18_1362375052103_4=\r\n3&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv1907127576yui_3_7_2_18_1362375052103_=\r\n47&gt;&nbsp;Prarabda karma is which was already done and sanchitha and agami a=\r\nre what we going to do&nbsp; .

A&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\nsoul&nbsp;goes through millions of births and deaths and in&nbsp; each&nbsp=\r\n; birth&nbsp;&nbsp; goes through millions&nbsp; of experiences . In that so=\r\njourn there could be many good and bad deeds . The nature&#39;s law &nbsp;is no=\r\nthing goes waste . Each and every&nbsp; thing&nbsp; ,whether by words or th=\r\noughts or by actions is recorded&nbsp; and has to be accounted for .Soul is=\r\n immortal and imperishable .So it has to repay for its doings ,and thus the=\r\n karmic debts have to be paid and in some areas karmic credits have to be r=\r\neceived . A chain is a chain whether it is of gold or of iron .Hence we\n ar=\r\ne&nbsp; bound by our deeds&nbsp; some in the form of punishments ,some in t=\r\nhe form of rewards .In astrology these traits are shown in good periods and=\r\n bad periods .&nbsp; So after doing remedial&nbsp; measures we can reduce t=\r\no certain extent the intensity of the effect of bad karma ,but totally we c=\r\nan&#39;t get rid of the bad effect in case of prarabda karma . But for every th=\r\ning there is an exception and we are not taking the case of exceptions . In=\r\n so far as sanchitha and agami karmas are concerned&nbsp;,that is what we a=\r\nre&nbsp;accumulating and going to accumulate ,our Ishtadevatha , stands by =\r\nus and our intense trust and faith in her and the sadhana we do &nbsp;,will=\r\n burn away the seeds of vasanas. What we do day become vasana at a later da=\r\nte. Vasanas lead to samskarams ,samskarams lead to actions again actions be=\r\ncome vasanas ,thus this is all an endless circle .If we are in deep debts a=\r\nnd while repaying the debts ,if we donot incur further debts we\n become fin=\r\nally&nbsp; free of debts . Alternatively in some extraordinary cases we may=\r\n get a help from known or unknown quarters which helps us to get rid of our=\r\n debts .That is possible ,though&nbsp; the chances are very rare . Ishtadev=\r\natha stands by us in doing this ,by burning the vasanas ,by making not to c=\r\nommit mistake further and by giving strebgth in facing the ordeals&nbsp; an=\r\nd&nbsp; by going in the righteous path against all odds .&nbsp; regards&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ls&lt;VAR id=3Dyiv190712757=\r\n6yui-ie-cursor&gt;&lt;/VAR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;BR class=3Dy=\r\nui-cursor&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,=\r\n16,255) 2px solid; MARGIN-TOP: 5px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZ=\r\nE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, seri=\r\nf; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-BOT=\r\nTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0; MARGIN: 5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT=\r\n: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGH=\r\nT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3Dhr contentEditable=3Dfalse rea=\r\ndonly=3D&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; =\r\nreema_sriganesh &lt;reema_sriganesh@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT=\r\n-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Monday, March 4, 2013 11:04 AM&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Ka=\r\nrma, Phala, Remedies, Blessings, Curses etc (Re: few questions)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1547259962&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1547259962ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;|| Om Gurave Namah ||&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Namaskaar,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you please define Sanchita, Agami, and Prarabdha =\r\nKarma?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;|| Om Tat Sat ||&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-=\r\nwisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Leela =\r\nSastry wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;prayaschitham ensures chitthashud=\r\ndhi which in it&#39;s turn destroys=C3=82&nbsp; sanchitha and agami karmas .Pra=\r\nrabda karma=C3=82&nbsp; =C3=82&nbsp;is like a let out arrow , which has to =\r\nbe faced only and has to be spent out only .

However, even great souls have a lot of nega=\r\ntive karmas in their optional pool and even evil people have a lot\n of posi=\r\ntive karmas in their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and=\r\n blessings can often make some difference.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru C=\r\nharitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp; *=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If one thinks that one can escape=\r\n the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human b=\r\neings, who may show favoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them.=\r\n The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The S=\r\nhe-aspect of God is the power that impartially and impassionately manages t=\r\nhe fine balance and order within this play of actions and fruits. All being=\r\ns\n are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of=\r\n saints. She administers just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions us=\r\ning available agents.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline an=\r\nd will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, wi=\r\nth some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thi=\r\nng is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, s=\r\nelfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas=\r\n and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others =\r\nare good karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas await=\r\ning karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action, yes, it is pos=\r\nsible and general guidelines are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be cer=\r\ntain about the specific\n impact of each action. One thing is for sure - rem=\r\nedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate with the karma =\r\nitself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You n=\r\need only small force to push a cat out of your way, but need a large force =\r\nto push an elephant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; --------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;___=\r\n_____________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Subj=\r\nect: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;Dear=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a sp=\r\necial elephant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next kin=\r\ng. Thus, it was possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king. Wh=\r\nose karma is this?=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This i=\r\ns the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) This is t=\r\nhe karma of the beggar turned king.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma ma=\r\nde him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pic=\r\nk the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pi=\r\nck the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom=\r\n, and accept the\n result.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oa=\r\nth. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are =\r\nactually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amoun=\r\nt of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to p=\r\neople and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume t=\r\nhat there is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. Th=\r\nese karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone=\r\n to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches =\r\nus that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And=\r\n you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other wor=\r\nds, your\n vaasanaas are your karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have chang=\r\ned your karma. Or course, that is easier said than done.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Any moment when your mind be=\r\ncomes quiet is a blessing.

I vaguely =\r\nremember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora t=\r\nrilogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens when you=\r\n get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tan=\r\ntric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =C3=\r\n=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; what do this items really do if they work? =\r\nSomething similar with wearing gemstones for planets =C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra=\r\n&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shr=\r\ni Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;.=\r\n At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later\n tells his=\r\n shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please exc=\r\nuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this =\r\nepisode from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadhana change ka=\r\nrmaphal to a great extent or it is just our perception that changes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanking you,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Digamber&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--562241088-1722989076-1362379713=:79926--\r\n\n"}}
