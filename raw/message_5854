Backgroun=\r\nd is that I am definitely going through a bad patch after my dad&#39;s passing =\r\nabout 7 months ago. Recently, in my dreams I have witnessed intense sufferi=\r\nng (and when witnessing it I somehow &quot;knew&quot; it was the worst suffering poss=\r\nible in this universe). Note that I say witnessed and not experienced. In t=\r\nhe dream one moment I was outside in the bright sunlight, then suddenly was=\r\n drawn into an underground railway station and into a train I didnt want to=\r\n be in. A woman on the train told me it is going to Praarthak, Pravarthak (=\r\nsome such word). I wanted to get out, and take the next train back. But it =\r\nkept taking me on. I knew somehow it was going to take me to 7 stations, I =\r\ndont know how. At each of the 7 stations, all underground without light, we=\r\nre &quot;half formed people&quot; in absolute, unbelievable darkness, pain and misery=\r\n. They were in a sense &quot;trying to get their identity together&quot; without as m=\r\nuch as a ray of hope or light. The suffering was too intense. I felt like t=\r\nhey/their pain would overwhelm me and draw me into them/the pain/their-clos=\r\ned-suffering-filled-darkness for eternity, but I was not them. Simultaneous=\r\nly, I have had other dreams in which someone is around me, trying to get to=\r\n/into me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also been doing meditations in which I am trying to o=\r\npen my heart, let my emotions out (I am very reserved by nature). These med=\r\nitations are quite cathartic and give me peace at the end. But here is my f=\r\near: I feel this &quot;opening myself out internally&quot; is attracting some huge ex=\r\nternal negativity of some kind. Is this possible? Or is it simply my own ba=\r\nd karma of the past that is being revealed to me? How do I tell if this neg=\r\nativity is to be experienced and suffered (if it is my own), or is to be av=\r\noided (if it is someone else)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Priya,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Atul ji said, one has to experie=\r\nnce various positives and negatives \n&gt; &gt; before tasting Amrita, based on on=\r\ne&#39;s kaarmik debts and conditioning. \n&gt; &gt; People reap their good and bad kar=\r\nmas over time and go through \n&gt; &gt; pleasurable and painful situations. We ca=\r\nnnot change the whole world or \n&gt; &gt; make people avoid the fruits of their k=\r\narmas. When we observe people \n&gt; &gt; suffering, we should do something about =\r\nit if there is something we can \n&gt; &gt; do and it feels like the right thing t=\r\no do. Otheriwse, we should just \n&gt; &gt; observe and move on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Next tim=\r\ne something like this happens, try not to be scared or upset. \n&gt; &gt; Try to t=\r\nell yourself that you are just an observer. Feeling \n&gt; &gt; compassionate abou=\r\nt someone&#39;s problems is one thing and identifying with \n&gt; &gt; it and feeling =\r\nscred or upset is another. Try to distance yourself from \n&gt; &gt; it and think =\r\nof god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every experiences, pleasurable or painful, will eventually=\r\n pass away. \n&gt; &gt; Instead of focusing the mind on the passing clouds, one ne=\r\neds to learn \n&gt; &gt; to focus it on the sky behind the clouds. That alone is a=\r\n constant. \n&gt; &gt; Clouds do not stay forever.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
