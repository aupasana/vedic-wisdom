Th=\r\nat is not to discount on the methods, materials and other things but we can=\r\n certainly compromise those if our Bhavana and bhakti is strong.\n\nTo clarif=\r\ny further, I=E2=80=99ll provide some examples-\n\n* if one is run out of Flow=\r\ners and could not get it on some day, one can offer &#39;Akshataas&#39; to the deit=\r\ny by making Bhavana and requesting the deity to accept it as flowers.\n\n* As=\r\n Narasimha has mentioned so many times in his Homa manuals such things.\n   =\r\n  - wear Pavitra (Ring) of Darbha, if not then wear any ring, if that is no=\r\nt available then continue without it.\n\nFinally, Purnaahuti is symbolical of=\r\n our ego as we all know. The coconut offered in any Homa represents head of=\r\n the Sadhaka. it in its essence means Ego, Intelligence, pride, attachments=\r\n etc...,\n\nI wish to humbly ask a question to you here. Due to serious const=\r\nraint(s), if some one is not able to offer full coconut as Purnaahuti, then=\r\n can he not offer Half coconut or even a piece of coconut making a &#39;Bhavana=\r\n&#39; that it is his/her head which is offered and request the deity in the fir=\r\ne to accept it? What will be wrong in that and how it can be a big mistake =\r\neven if that differs slightly at gross level from the prescription of Shast=\r\nras?\n\nThanks again for your post.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Dear Friends,\n=\r\n&gt; At the time of Poorna Ahuti,  a  full coconut(poorna phalam)  is required=\r\n to be offered by chanting  the  Vedic Mantra&quot; Poornamadah  Poornamidam  Po=\r\nornaat  Poornamudatchyate   Poornasya   Poornamaadaaya  Poornamevaasishyate=\r\n&quot;.  Simply because half coconut burns faster than full coconut, in my humbl=\r\ne opinion we can not substtute a full coconut with a broken half of coconut=\r\n in Poorna Ahuti. Already our purohits are using camphor for lighting Agni.=\r\n  This is not the prescribed method of generating fire for Homam( Havan).So=\r\nme of them are also blowing fire with  a gush of wind from their mouth for =\r\n the purpose of creating flame  instead of  using hand fan or  by blowing t=\r\nhrough a cylindrcal pipe or blowing through Dharba grass.
