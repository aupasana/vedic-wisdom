I also do homam in a very small room with less ventilation and i have=\r\n found dry coconut better because of following reasons\n\ndry coconut does no=\r\nt produce black smoke hence blackening of walls is very minimal\n\ndry coconu=\r\nt burn seamlessly. i dont have to worry about fire once it starts. hence i =\r\ncan  concentrate more on the procedure\n\nvery less ghee is needed with cocon=\r\nut. two three drops per aahuti is more than enough.\n\nash after the homam is=\r\n very less. and quite a long homam can be done even in small homam kundam.\n=\r\n\ni cut coconut in pieces of 1.5 inch x 0.5 inch approx. they last longer as=\r\n compared to 1 x 1 inch if you put them on edges of fire\n\nwith the grace of=\r\n guruji\nregards\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Kumar &lt;srkumar5@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The paint should be changed to darker shades=A0to reduce t=\r\nhe effect and can last longer than white paint =A0and with white paint=A0 i=\r\nt is very difficult I think we have to get the paint done accordingly.. loo=\r\nks like there is no alternative=A0=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 7/16/11, Jitender D=\r\nahiya &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Jitender Dahiya &lt;dahiyajiten@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Soot in the room\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, July 16, 2011, 3:33 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Nam=\r\naste All,\n&gt; \n&gt; Since a lot of people aare doing homam in a room, can somebo=\r\ndy please let me know how do they handle the soot that gets deposited on th=\r\ne walls of the room.\n&gt; I m in pune.
