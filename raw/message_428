Similarly, all the \nVedas and Pura=\r\nnas have fixed certain days for rituals!  E.g., \nNirjala Ekadashi is a sort=\r\n of Tapasya only if we observe it in \nSummer, when we feel most thirsty, wh=\r\nereas in Winter, it is hardly \nworthwhile!  And that is what we will be doi=\r\nng after a few centuries-\n-celebrating that day in Winter--thanks to &quot;Vedic=\r\n astrologers&quot; and \ntheir &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;\n\nOne of your questions is even h=\r\nilarious!  You have said\n&lt;When Vedic yajna kanda says if vashat call is giv=\r\nen at wrong time\nsome mishap happens, yajamana&#39;s son may die, did it happen=\r\n really?&gt;\n\nMy counter question is:  If you have no faith in celebrating \nfe=\r\nstivals and muhurtas on correct days, why celebrate them at all, \nsince if =\r\nno harm has come by celebating them on wrong days, \ncertainly, no harm will=\r\n come by not celebrating them at all!  Why \nwaste your precious time and en=\r\nergy and money in celebrating them at \nall?\n\nAnother counter question is:  =\r\nSince you are defending &quot;Vedic \nastrology&quot; with all the might at your comma=\r\nnd, can you quote any \ninstances where it has done any good to any nation o=\r\nr country?  On \nthe other hand, we have instances galore where it has done =\r\nthe \nmaximum harm:  Our erstwhile Hindu neighbouring country is a glaring \n=\r\nexample of its &quot;suicide&quot; because of an extraordinary infatuation \nfor &quot;Vedi=\r\nc astrology&quot;.  So is the example of the BJP which had \nan &quot;akalamrityu&quot; by =\r\nadvanding the last election by several months on \nthe advice of its &quot;Minist=\r\ner of Astrology&quot;!\n\nSimilar was the case with &quot;the greatest Vedic astrologer=\r\n of \ntwentieth century&quot;---he overestimated his own life span on the basis \n=\r\nof &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; and instead of making preparations for \nYamaloka, he p=\r\nlanned, on the basis of his &quot;cherished science&quot;, to \ndeliver a lecture on &quot;=\r\nAstrology as a guide to preventing heart \nattacks&quot; but he met an &quot;astrologi=\r\ncally&quot; unscheduled end and that \nalso because of &quot;cardiac arrest!&quot;!  His jy=\r\notisha magazine also has \ngot stopped completely--that &quot;event&quot; also was not=\r\n foreseen by \nany  &quot;Vedic astrologer&quot;---since his own offspring fought amon=\r\ng \nthemselves like Kilkenny cats over the spoils of the &quot;Vedic jyotisha \nem=\r\npire&quot;.  And mind you, all his offspring were &quot;top notch Vedic \nastrologers&quot;=\r\n and even &quot;Vastu experts&quot; as per their own claims in \nthat very defunct mag=\r\nazine!\n\nThen another &quot;Vedic astrologer&quot; of repute made a fool of himself by=\r\n \ndeclaring that a genetleman of Betul would die at 4-30 pm on a \nparticula=\r\nr date abouit two years back, but unfortunately for \nthat &quot;Vedic astrologer=\r\n&quot;, that Betul man is still going strong!\n\nOf course, these are just tips of=\r\n iceberg and God only knows what \ndamage has been done by dint of &quot;Vedic as=\r\ntrology&quot; to the nation \notherwise!\nIs that the &quot;benevolent&quot; aspect of &quot;Vedi=\r\nc astrology&quot; you are talking \nabout and defending?\nThe most glaring damage =\r\nit has done is that our budhi has become \nTamasik---we have become &quot;budhi b=\r\nrashta&quot; since we have started \nviewing the adharma of celebrating all our f=\r\nestivals and muhurtas on \nwrong days as the real dharma and simultaneously =\r\ncalling and \ndefending those predictive gimmikcs that compel us to celebrat=\r\ne our \nfestivals etc. on wrong days as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;!\nI do not know wha=\r\nt other &quot;beneficial results&quot; you are expecting \nfrom &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;!\nWit=\r\nh regards,\nA K Kaul\n \n\n--- In hinducivilization@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bhadraiah=\r\n Mallampalli&quot; \n&lt;vaidix@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Shri Avtar Krishen Kaul,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Let=\r\n them quote even a single mantra from any of the Vedas or a\n&gt; &gt;single shlok=\r\na from any of the Puranas or any other shastra which \nhas\n&gt; &gt;advised us to =\r\nconsult some soothsayer before embarking on any \nplan!\n&gt; \n&gt; Agreed.
