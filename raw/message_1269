I like it very \nmuch. Good explaination and Tr=\r\nanslation in english.\n\nTheir site have a lot of material on chandi paath an=\r\nd many doubts can \nbe resolved by reading or searhing their site or even as=\r\nking \nquestions to her or swamiji too. They do respond via email.\n\nShe has =\r\na bengali/assamese accent.
