Even if one does a great job for the given des=\r\na, kaala and paatra \n&gt; (place, era and class), the rules given cannot be pe=\r\nrfect. They can be taken \n&gt; as a general guideline, but they cannnot be abs=\r\nolute.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding non-Brahmins:\n&gt; \n&gt; If a person is interested in Veda =\r\nand studies Veda, one IS a Brahmana. One \n&gt; who is interested in knowledge =\r\nand spirituality is a Brahmana. One who is \n&gt; interested in power and autho=\r\nrity over others is a Kshatriya. One who is \n&gt; interested in wealth is a Va=\r\nishya. One who is interested in pleasures in a \n&gt; Shoodra (that is why phal=\r\na sruti of Vishnu sahasra naama stotra promises \n&gt; these respective results=\r\n to the four varnas - see &quot;vedaantago braahmanah \n&gt; syaat...&quot;). Valmiki was=\r\n born in a shoodra family, but became a brahmana and \n&gt; a maharshi later. V=\r\nishwamitra was born in a kshatriya family, but became a \n&gt; brahmana and a m=\r\naharshi later and many veda hymns were actually revealed to \n&gt; the world th=\r\nrough him!\n&gt; \n&gt; The meaning of saying that only a Brahmana can deal with ve=\r\nda is that only a \n&gt; person interested in knowledge and spiritual progress =\r\n(and not money or \n&gt; power or pleasures) can learn and teach veda. Others (=\r\ninterested in money, \n&gt; power and pleasures) are not qualified for self-rea=\r\nlization. It has nothing \n&gt; to do with the the birth caste.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding =\r\nwomen:\n&gt; \n&gt; Veda is for self-knowledge. Study and contemplation of Veda is =\r\nfor \n&gt; self-realization. Spiritually speaking, Shiva is the potential energ=\r\ny and \n&gt; Shakti is the kinetic energy. Men are supposed to have more Shiva =\r\nthan \n&gt; Shakti in them and women are supposed to have more Shakti than Shiv=\r\na in \n&gt; them. If a man is really like Shiva, he can study and experience Ve=\r\nda and \n&gt; realize self and his wife can realize self through him. That woul=\r\nd be a good \n&gt; strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, men are hardly like Shiva today. In =\r\nfact, there is very little \n&gt; Shiva in anyone and there is more Shakti (kin=\r\netic energy) in women as well \n&gt; as men today. Moreover, most men do not do=\r\n any spiritual sadhana at all. The \n&gt; rules make no sense anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; In =\r\nthe old days, rishis pursued knowledge and spiritual sadhana, while their \n=\r\n&gt; wives ran the houses. The sadhana of rishis was sufficient for them and \n=\r\n&gt; their wives. Today&#39;s men are different. Whenever I go to a poojas at the =\r\n\n&gt; houses of friends, I see all women gathering at the pooja and chanting \n=\r\n&gt; mantras, while all men sit elsewhere and chat about sports, politics and =\r\n\n&gt; movies. The world is a changed place. Women cannot rely on their men to =\r\ndo \n&gt; spiritual sadhana for them and they are on their own. Men are not lik=\r\ne \n&gt; Shiva. Rules composed long back do not apply anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; Upasani mah=\r\naraj, who was worshipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, was a \n&gt; great =\r\nVedic scholar who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect his \n&gt; judgment=\r\n and its relevance today more than the relevance of an ancient \n&gt; dharma sh=\r\nastra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to time by \n&gt; reali=\r\nzed souls. It becomes stale otherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the problem with some r=\r\neligions that are based on a written text. \n&gt; The text may have been good f=\r\nor a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may have \n&gt; become stale now. Fortunat=\r\nely, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) does not \n&gt; depend on one specific text=\r\n. We emphasize sadhana to realize truth rather \n&gt; than adherence to a text.=\r\n This emphasis on active sadhana ensured a \n&gt; continuous flow of realized s=\r\nouls. We had many realized souls (like \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Samartha Rama=\r\ndas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, \n&gt; Ramana Maharshi etc) from time t=\r\no time and they refined our understanding. \n&gt; Religions that emphasized adh=\r\nerence to a text rather than active sadhana to \n&gt; realize truth depended on=\r\n an old text put together by one realized soul and \n&gt; they may have become =\r\nstale now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedi=\r\nc- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. ne=\r\nt\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original M=\r\nessage ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Jagmohan Nanaware&quot; &lt;jagmohan_nanaware@ ...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:57 PM\n&gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Women reading Vedas (Re: reading/learning the veda)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Excellent explanation from you Narasimha-ji!\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Just have some doubts:\n&gt; &gt; The code of conduct about reciting vedas (wh=\r\no can do it) are prescribed \n&gt; &gt; in Manusmriti.

She felt oneness with the Divine\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mother in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; Her undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Devi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sooktam were revealed to her then.

We use those riks in our =\r\nworship, meditation, homas and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sadhanas. Yet, should we i=\r\nnsist that women cannot recite Veda? If\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vagambhrani is amid us again=\r\n as a woman, should we stop her from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reciting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Devi sooktam?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint f=\r\nrom Maharashtra from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about 800\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years back. He was a great devot=\r\nee of Krishna and was a fully self-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master at a young =\r\nage. He reformed religion and corrected some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; corrupt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; traditions=\r\n. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He started to recite Ved=\r\na and the head of the Brahmin council\n&gt; &gt;&gt; forbade him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because he wa=\r\ns not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ever=\r\nyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the council\n&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreed.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins tried to stop him by\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n closing his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mouth. Then a buffalo standing next to him took over an=\r\nd chanted\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Veda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Astounded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell at =\r\nhis feet. The head\n&gt; &gt;&gt; apologized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as=\r\n the keepers of Veda, but you have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the real\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding and m=\r\nastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar taught the equality of all and di=\r\nd not distinguish\n&gt; &gt;&gt; between people\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; based on caste, creed or gende=\r\nr. He considered BhagavadGita as the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; essence\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Veda and wrote =\r\na fantastic commentary on it. His commentary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; departs from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the s=\r\ntandard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vaishnava\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; gurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesting take=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He said\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is bas=\r\ned on a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; misinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is=\r\n called\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is calle=\r\nd the &quot;purusha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sareera&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that the physical body comes f=\r\nrom mother and the soul comes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; father and that is why they =\r\nare called so. The soul or inner self\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thousand-headed pu=\r\nrusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that =\r\nVeda is supposed to be recited with the purusha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sareera.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Accord=\r\ning to him, it does not mean that women cannot read it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether men or=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women, they have to read it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; body, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not just with the physical body. So, according to him, =\r\nthe standard\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; convention is based on a flawed understanding. Accordin=\r\ng to him,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one simply\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reciting Veda with the mouth without the c=\r\norrect internal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; understanding is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only reading with the &quot;stree s=\r\nareera&quot; and hence not doing the right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; understanding them is quite another. When we make sound, there are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; four\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibrati=\r\non of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; material\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; belonging to the gross body (sthoola sareera) pr=\r\noduces vaikhari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sound and it is heard through the sens=\r\nes belonging to the gross\n&gt; &gt;&gt; body (ears).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But vibrations at the le=\r\nvel of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vibrations\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the lev=\r\nel of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; p=\r\nerceived thorough subtle perception.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om N=\r\namo Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mundane\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matters, the vibra=\r\ntions produced at levels above vaikhari will not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; auspicious.=\r\n There is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; people\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; fo=\r\nrget that what happens at the other layers of existence is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; equally, if=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, important!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you produce the correct vibra=\r\ntions at all levels (not just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Ve=\r\ndic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; full exper=\r\nience of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; o=\r\nf Vedic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; encouraged,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowledg=\r\ne alive).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference=\r\n between genders\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the gross body. When you go to the =\r\nsubtle body and astral body,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no difference at all. One=\r\n should realize that the role of gross\n&gt; &gt;&gt; body is too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; limited in t=\r\nhe correct recitation/experien ce of a Vedic mantra. It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\npurity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ar=\r\ne far\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more important.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To be fair a=\r\nnd balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Like I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\naid, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a f=\r\null\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; self&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult =\r\nfor it to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; come in one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shot. It comes in steps. When one is half=\r\n way down the path, one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; has to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; careful and under the vigilan=\r\nt guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When one is not fully realized and t=\r\nhe gross body has a role to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; play, there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are some differences ba=\r\nsed on the gender that come into play.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If a lady carrying a b=\r\naby in her womb has certain spiritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (which a good=\r\n Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; even be an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a=\r\nbortion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; awak=\r\nening\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an asce=\r\nnt of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness) . Though some peo=\r\nple\n&gt; &gt;&gt; may have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrong impression about Kundalini because of the =\r\ncorrupt practices\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section of so-called &quot;Kundalini sadhakas=\r\n&quot;, the fact is that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini merely\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represents one&#39;s ego-consc=\r\niousness. When one casually associates\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one sees with &quot;=\r\nself&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\nelf-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; reaches\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kun=\r\ndalini\n&gt; &gt;&gt; moves based\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is into B=\r\nhakti yoga or Raja yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or Karma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does not ma=\r\ntter. All paths lead to an awareness\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and more correct=\r\n concept of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization fina=\r\nlly. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reaches Sah=\r\nasrara at the end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; During the period when Kundalini is stuck =\r\nin Swadhishthana chakra,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sexual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive can multiply. Several yog=\r\nis get stuck in this stage and fail\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the tests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to progress furth=\r\ner. In general, women have a higher drive than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; men. If that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dri=\r\nve multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; really\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depends on the individual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have m=\r\nade\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some people come up with some rules. However, are those issues\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; sufficient to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In=\r\n fact, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; factors I wrote\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; above are probably irrelevant given =\r\nthe superficial understanding\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; present at this time and =\r\nthe superficial recitation of Veda that we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these days.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone, =\r\nit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is better\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru.=\r\n If you have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadguru who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, s=\r\nurrender and do as your guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; says! What\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is good for goose may n=\r\not be good for gander.

They can be taken &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as a general guideline, but the=\r\ny cannnot be absolute.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding non-Brahmins:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; If a person is interested in Veda and studies Veda, one IS a Brahmana=\r\n. One &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who is interested in knowledge and spirituality is a Brahman=\r\na. One who is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interested in power and authority over others is a K=\r\nshatriya. One who is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interested in wealth is a Vaishya. One who is=\r\n interested in pleasures in\n a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shoodra (that is why phala sruti of=\r\n Vishnu sahasra naama stotra promises &lt;BR&gt;&gt; these respective results to =\r\nthe four varnas - see &quot;vedaantago braahmanah &lt;BR&gt;&gt; syaat...&quot;). Valmiki w=\r\nas born in a shoodra family, but became a brahmana and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a maharshi =\r\nlater. Vishwamitra was born in a kshatriya family, but became a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; br=\r\nahmana and a maharshi later and many veda hymns were actually revealed to &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; the world through him!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The meaning of saying that =\r\nonly a Brahmana can deal with veda is that only a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; person intereste=\r\nd in knowledge and spiritual progress (and not money or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; power or p=\r\nleasures) can learn and teach veda. Others (interested in money, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; p=\r\nower and pleasures) are not qualified for self-realization. It has nothing =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to do with the the birth caste.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding women:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Veda is for self-knowledge. Study and contemplation of Ved=\r\na is for &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n self-realization. Spiritually speaking, Shiva is the pot=\r\nential energy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shakti is the kinetic energy. Men are supposed t=\r\no have more Shiva than &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shakti in them and women are supposed to ha=\r\nve more Shakti than Shiva in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. If a man is really like Shiva, =\r\nhe can study and experience Veda and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; realize self and his wife can=\r\n realize self through him. That would be a good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; strategy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, men are hardly like Shiva today. In fact, there is very l=\r\nittle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shiva in anyone and there is more Shakti (kinetic energy) in=\r\n women as well &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as men today. Moreover, most men do not do any spir=\r\nitual sadhana at all. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rules make no sense anymore.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; In the old days, rishis pursued knowledge and spiritual sadhana, whil=\r\ne their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wives ran the houses. The sadhana of rishis was sufficient=\r\n for them and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; their wives. Today&#39;s men are different. Whenever I g=\r\no to a\n poojas at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; houses of friends, I see all women gathering=\r\n at the pooja and chanting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantras, while all men sit elsewhere an=\r\nd chat about sports, politics and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; movies. The world is a changed p=\r\nlace. Women cannot rely on their men to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual sadhana for t=\r\nhem and they are on their own. Men are not like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shiva. Rules compo=\r\nsed long back do not apply anymore.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Upasani maharaj, who w=\r\nas worshipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; great Vedic=\r\n scholar who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; judgmen=\r\nt and its relevance today more than the relevance of an ancient &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dh=\r\narma shastra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to time by &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; realized souls. It becomes stale otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This i=\r\ns the problem with some religions that are based on a written text. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; The text may have been good for a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may\n ha=\r\nve &lt;BR&gt;&gt; become stale now. Fortunately, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) d=\r\noes not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; depend on one specific text. We emphasize sadhana to reali=\r\nze truth rather &lt;BR&gt;&gt; than adherence to a text. This emphasis on active =\r\nsadhana ensured a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; continuous flow of realized souls. We had many r=\r\nealized souls (like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba=\r\n, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramana Maharshi etc) from time to time =\r\nand they refined our understanding. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Religions that emphasized adhe=\r\nrence to a text rather than active sadhana to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; realize truth depend=\r\ned on an old text put together by one realized soul and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they may h=\r\nave become stale now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homa=\r\nm&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/\n homam&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedi=\r\ncastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Jagmohan Nanaware&quot; &lt;jagmohan_nanaware@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nTo: &lt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wis=\r\ndom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:57 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Wome=\r\nn reading Vedas (Re: reading/learning the veda)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Excellent explanation from you Naras=\r\nimha-ji!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Just have some doubts:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The =\r\ncode of conduct about reciting vedas (who can do it) are prescribed &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; in Manusmriti.

Can you throw some lig=\r\nht on this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ofcourse the best reference to descri=\r\nption of different yugas I have found &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is in &quot;Guru Charitra&quot;.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jagmohan&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/com=\r\npose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ym=\r\nailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@ &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thank you Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; Your &#39;rambling&#39; was indeed very interesting and enlightening, esp abt=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the stree sharira.

It is&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;\n attributed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to Vagambhrani, a female rish=\r\ni. She felt oneness with the Divine&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mother in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Her undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Devi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sooktam were revealed to her th=\r\nen. Those eight riks are really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fantastic.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are other riks in Rigveda that were reve=\r\naled to the world by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; female&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rishis. =\r\nWe use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ot=\r\nher&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sadhanas. Yet, should we insist that women cannot=\r\n recite Veda? If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vagambhrani is amid us again as a wo=\r\nman, should we stop her from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reciting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Devi sooktam?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great sai=\r\nnt\n from Maharashtra from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about 800&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nyears back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully self-&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; realized&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master at a young age. He reformed=\r\n religion and corrected some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; corrupt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n traditions. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin coun=\r\ncil&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; forbade him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because he was not &quot;=\r\nqualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; &gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the cou=\r\nncil&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As he started reciti=\r\nng Veda, the Brahmins tried to stop him by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; closing his&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mouth. Then a buffalo standing next to him took over and=\r\n chanted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Veda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Astounded by the\n mir=\r\nacle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; apologized&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as the keepers of Veda,=\r\n but you have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the real&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding=\r\n and mastery of Veda&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jnaneshw=\r\nar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; betw=\r\neen people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; based on caste, creed or gender. He consid=\r\nered BhagavadGita as the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; essence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of =\r\nVeda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His commentary&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; departs from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point=\r\n of view adopted by most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vaishnava&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; g=\r\nurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; &gt; One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesti=\r\nng take.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; He said&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that the belief tha=\r\nt women cannot recite Vedas is based on a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; misinterpre=\r\ntation. He said that the physical body we have is called&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is call=\r\ned the &quot;purusha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sareera&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said th=\r\nat the physical body comes from mother and the soul comes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nfrom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; father and that is why they are called so. The s=\r\noul or inner self&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thousand-he=\r\naded purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with th=\r\ne purusha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sareera.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; According to him,=\r\n it does not mean that women cannot read it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; Whether men =\r\nor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women, they have to read it with the purusha saree=\r\nra, i.e. inner&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; body, and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not just wi=\r\nth the physical body. So, according to him, the standard&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; convention is based on a flawed understanding. According to him,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; one simply&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reciting Veda with the mouth wi=\r\nthout the correct internal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; understanding is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing the right=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, reciting Veda and chan=\r\nting the verses is one thing and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding them i=\r\ns quite another. When we make sound, there are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; four&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibra=\r\ntion of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; material&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; &gt; belonging to the g=\r\nross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; level of&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sound and it is heard through the senses belonging to th=\r\ne gross&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; body (ears).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But vibrations =\r\nat the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vibrati=\r\nons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the level of astral body (kaarana sareera) are=\r\n also there and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; can be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; perceived tho=\r\nrough subtle perception.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If one=\r\n is chanting &quot;Om Namo Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mun=\r\ndane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matters, the vibrations produced at levels above=\r\n vaikhari will not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; auspicious. Th=\r\nere is so much stress on what we do physically and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; people&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; forget that what happens at the other layers of exist=\r\nence is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; equally,\n if not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, impor=\r\ntant!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you produce the correc=\r\nt vibrations at all levels (not just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; physical)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; th=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra. A&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; full experience of a sin=\r\ngle Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, s=\r\no much&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of Vedic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholarship these da=\r\nys is only superficial (but it has to be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; encouraged,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive)=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Forget the man vs woman contr=\r\noversy. The difference between genders&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; &gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and astral bod=\r\ny,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there\n is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no difference at all. O=\r\nne should realize that the role of gross&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; body is too&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &gt; limited in the correct recitation/experien ce of a Vedic m=\r\nantra. It&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purity of the subtl=\r\ne body and the lightness of the astral body that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are far&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more important.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To be fair and bala=\r\nnced, I need to throw light on the other angle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Like I&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable o=\r\nf producing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a full&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization =\r\n(actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; self&quot;).&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult f=\r\nor it to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; come in one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shot. It comes =\r\nin steps. When one\n is half way down the path, one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; has to =\r\nbe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadgu=\r\nru.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When one is not fully reali=\r\nzed and the gross body has a role to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; play, there&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; &gt; are some differences based on the gender that come into play.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If a lady carrying a baby in he=\r\nr womb has certain spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; (which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; even be an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; abortion (or a great siddha bei=\r\nng born, on the other extreme).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; awakening&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of =\r\nself-awareness) and an ascent of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kundalini (i.e. an a=\r\nscent of\n self-awareness) . Though some people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; may have a&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrong impression about Kundalini because of the corru=\r\npt practices&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section of so-call=\r\ned &quot;Kundalini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini merely=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represents one&#39;s ego-consciousness. When one casuall=\r\ny associates&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the body&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one sees with =\r\n&quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As o=\r\nne&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Ku=\r\nndalini ascends in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sookshma sare=\r\nera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reac=\r\nhes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or n=\r\not, Kundalini&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moves based&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on how evo=\r\nlved one is. Whether one is into Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nor\n Karma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does not matter. All pat=\r\nhs lead to an awareness&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; an=\r\nd more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; During the period when Kundalin=\r\ni is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sexual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fail&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the tests&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to progress further. In gen=\r\neral, women have a higher drive than&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; men. If that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; drive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However=\r\n, it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depends on the individua=\r\nl and we cannot generalize.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n Th=\r\nus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; have made&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some people come up with some rules. =\r\nHowever, are those issues&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sufficient to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; ban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; factors I wrote&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; above are probably irrelevant =\r\ngiven the superficial understanding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of Veda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; present at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda that we=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; find&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these days.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to mi=\r\nsguide anyone, it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is better&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to not g=\r\nive any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If you have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\nadguru who&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surrend=\r\ner and do as your guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; says! What&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns good for goose may not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; taught to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; goose may be good only for goose and n=\r\not for gander.
