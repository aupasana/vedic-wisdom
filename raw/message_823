Hi=\r\ns reasoning was that an \n&gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never In=\r\nspire & attract \n&gt; &gt; millions of people for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) =\r\nIf Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat to \n&gt; &gt; satisf=\r\ny his poetic genious then how come he himself features in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; story=\r\n? if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but then WHY \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll writ=\r\ne another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why \n&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself=\r\n Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never =\r\nborn, then how come so many Saints of \n&gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nne can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that \n&gt; &gt; perticular =\r\nForm, they could see the same form of the supreme \n&gt; &gt; reality...the suprem=\r\ne power can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is=\r\n that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and \n&gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never we=\r\nre a Devotee of that form of \n&gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case=\r\n, without devotion & \n&gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; they got to see the form of Shri Krushn=\r\na?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Any thoughts about this?

Vyasji has give=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; immaginary characters and incidents but his intention was to spr=\r\nead &lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledge of Vedas/Upanishadas thru Gita. There was a discussi=\r\non &lt;BR&gt;&gt; between Krishna and Arjuna in a normal form and not in Sanskrit=\r\n. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; advised Arjuna to start war after giving him the theory of Ka=\r\nrma.\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vyasji just gave a poetic form in sanskrit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dr.Ashwin Rawal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 23/12/08,=\r\n utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Mahabhaarat is an epic or historical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; reality !!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 23 Decembe=\r\nr, 2008, 12:17 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Garu &amp; Members,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There is a long pending question with me and that is =\r\nHistorical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reality or otherwise of our many revered personali=\r\nties/ events.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Take for instance, &#39;Mahabhaarat&#39; &=\r\namp; &#39;Shri Krishna&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I would try to give some vi=\r\new points gathered from all these years &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from various\n sources=\r\n and my own thinking as well-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) Mahatma Gandhi =\r\ndidn&#39;t belive that Mahabhaarat was a reality.he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thought that =\r\nit was &#39;epic&#39;-creation of a poet. he seems to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; to belive logically the creation of 100 sons etc...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; 2) How can parents name their children as &#39;DURYodhan&#39;, &#39;Du:Shasan&#39; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; etc.. i am not sure about the meaning of the names but it imp=\r\nlies &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something perverted. knwoledgable person in sanskrit can=\r\n shed some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; light on this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) Mahab=\r\nhaarat was a Grand Poem created by super-intelligent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; author, &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Maharshi Vyaas and hence Gita was also his own creation and &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; krsihna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was just a &#39;imaginary&#39; central character of his gr=\r\nand work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; !.....!..... !&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; 1) Dr. Raman, in Notable Horoscopes has strongly written\n that Shri &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Krishna was a historically reality. His reasoning was that an &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never Inspire &amp; attra=\r\nct &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; millions of people for thousans of years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat =\r\nto &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic genious then how come he himself featur=\r\nes in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; story? if let&#39;s consider even that as a po=\r\nssibility but then WHY &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll write another book just on Shri =\r\nKrishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;K=\r\naalpanik Paatra&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never b=\r\norn, then how come so many Saints of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his for=\r\nm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perticular Form, they could see the same form of the supreme=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reality...the supreme power can take\n any form for the Bhakt=\r\na.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devotee of that =\r\nform of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, without de=\r\nvotion &amp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; they got to see the form of Shri=\r\n Krushna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; !....!....!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Any thoughts about this? How to conclusively establish the Truth &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nin &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this case?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bring your gang together.
