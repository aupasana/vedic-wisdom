It is like a living God/Guru. &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; BTW, those who love Gopala, can visit the baby Gopa=\r\nla kept in the 2nd floor of a &lt;br&gt;&gt; building which Ananadamayi Ma hersel=\r\nf used to worship. It is one very unique and &lt;br&gt;&gt; powerful deity. Many =\r\nstories and miracles associated with that Gopala. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; -Regards &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage. &lt;br&gt;&gt; Hota hain shab-o-r=\r\noz tamasha mere aage &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaa=\r\nn mere nazdeek &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ___________________________________&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n From: Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@... &lt;br&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Sent: Sun, 15 May, 2011 7:33:08 AM &lt;br&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] RE: a Gem of Wisdom from Maa Aanadamayi! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; Namaste, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The statement below is quite meaningful=\r\n. Overcoming one&#39;s ego is often not &lt;br&gt;&gt; possible without a big blow or=\r\n two to one&#39;s ego. However, if things work out &lt;br&gt;&gt; well in the end, on=\r\ne&#39;s ego ends up becoming lighter. The goal of spiritual &lt;br&gt;&gt; sadhana is=\r\n to overcome ego completely and any development that makes ego lighter &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; is useful. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; When the influence of sad=\r\nguru or an enlightened being comes into one&#39;s life, one &lt;br&gt;&gt; may someti=\r\nmes be pushed to a corner and almost come to the point of breaking. &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; However, one need not worry. When an enlightened being is playing with on=\r\ne, &lt;br&gt;&gt; whatever happens happens for good. Whether one realized it then=\r\n or not, one will &lt;br&gt;&gt; eventually make progress. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbs=\r\np; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best regards, &lt;br&gt;&gt; Narasimha &lt;br&gt;&gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------- &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twitter ID: @h=\r\nomam108 &lt;br&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------- &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; On Sat, May 14, 2011 at 1:38 AM, vedic_p=\r\nathak wrote: &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; Namaste, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I c=\r\name across below line while reading an article: Seemed very true to me and =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; worthy of Sharing &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; [&quot;The association wit=\r\nh an enlightened being consists in getting blows for the &lt;br&gt;&gt; ego&quot;, Ana=\r\nndamayi Ma once remarked] &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Pranaams, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\r\n--5-8055722479-4565769224=:5--\r\n\n"}}
