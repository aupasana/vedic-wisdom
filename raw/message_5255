If one later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;pride \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;without =\r\nsacrificing self-preservation, one may still do so. This is \n&gt; &gt;conditional=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;surrender. In the case of god also, surrendering to god when on=\r\ne&#39;s life is a \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;mess and one is helpless may still be conditional s=\r\nurrender. But, when the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;surrender is unconditional and one sees god =\r\nas the controller of all without \n&gt; &gt;any \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;conditions attached, ir=\r\nrespective of whether life is good or bad, one becomes \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;purer and=\r\n purer and one&#39;s self-control become better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; A po=\r\nwerless person may also become angry. But, as you said, his anger is \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n&gt;&gt;powerless to do much harm.

That is secondary. IF there is a =\r\nmantra you \n&gt; &gt;use, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;use it sincerely and with devotion. Use it a=\r\ns a tool to increase your \n&gt; &gt;surrender \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and devotion. At that en=\r\nd, THAT is what matters and brings results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A person=\r\n with a broken leg needs to use a walking stick until the leg \n&gt; &gt;cures \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and becomes fit. How big or heavy the stick is, what wood it is mad=\r\ne of, what \n&gt; &gt;is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the carving on it, etc, is not that important.=\r\n The main purpose of the stick \n&gt; &gt;to \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;give complete rest to the =\r\nleg and help it cure fast. If one worries too much \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;about the beau=\r\nty and technical details of the stick and ends up putting \n&gt; &gt;stress \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  &gt;&gt;on the leg, the stick does not serve its purpose. The stick is helpfu=\r\nl only \n&gt; &gt;if \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;you consciously spare the leg from effort. Once th=\r\ne leg cures, you can then \n&gt; &gt;not \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;only walk but also run. Simila=\r\nrly, a lot of technical details of the mantra \n&gt; &gt;do \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;not matter =\r\nmuch. Use mantra to focus the mind and cure it of its conditioning \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;(i.e. impurity!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a  di=\r\nfference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, Chandan Sabharwal \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;chandan.sabharwal@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then what about tantras which proclaim that unless the 5 e=\r\nlements  are \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not purified first , every puja / ritual is =\r\nsimply abhichara ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandan=\r\n Sabharwal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nNarasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan-da=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice words!
