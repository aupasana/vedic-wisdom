Some tend to sensationalize, =\r\nsome tend of derogate, some merely skim the surface. I like the writings of=\r\n Sir Arthur Avalon, specially his book &quot;Shakti and ShaktA&quot;. It deals with t=\r\nhe broad philosophy of Tantra as a path. He was a British Judge of the Calc=\r\nutta High Court during the English rule in India, when he got initiated int=\r\no Tantra. He learnt Sanskrit and translated many of the rare Tantrik Manusc=\r\nripts into English and spend the rest of his life lecturing on Tantra acros=\r\ns various Universities. Most of the new age books on Tantra are but a rip-o=\r\nff from Arthur Avalon&#39;s work. You may also try reading &quot;Aghora - at the lef=\r\nt hand of God&quot; by Dr Svboda. That books actually throws much light on some =\r\nesoteric aspects of Tantra. But before all that, you have to first see if y=\r\nou like it. Not everyone really likes Tantra, which is ok. Infact of the\n p=\r\neople who are public figures, very few have the kind of insight and wisdom =\r\nas Dr Svboda does when it comes to understanding Tantra. Rest of the good p=\r\neople keep themselves private.\n\n\nI am not a fan of Osho, but I like one sta=\r\ntement of his where he says, &quot;In the Upanishads the Rishis asked &quot;Why?&quot;, in=\r\n the Tantras the Rishis asked &quot;How?&quot;. \n\n\nIn Yoga the idea is to restrain th=\r\ne inputs from the sense-organs and eventually discover the changeless state=\r\n. In Tantra the idea is to divinize the inputs from the sense-organs and ev=\r\nentually spiritualize yourself, transform the limited personality into a di=\r\nvine one and live in this world. End results of both the paths are practica=\r\nlly same, but the perspectives and paradigms are different.=C2=A0\n\nIt is ve=\r\nry difficult to meet a genuine Bhairavi, even in this age when society has =\r\nbecome relatively &#39;free&#39; \n\nwith respect to women expressing themselves and =\r\nsexuality in general. What the beat generation and hippie movement and wome=\r\nn&#39;s-lib movements are doing today, the Tantras had done it ages ago but on =\r\na firm plank of practical spirituality. The term Bhairavi refers to a form =\r\nof the Divine Feminine energy (Aadya Shakti), a Goddess in her own rights, =\r\nwhose energy, if it were to possess a woman, would make her so fearless and=\r\n rooted into herself that she would not mind transgressing and breaking soc=\r\nial mores and thus evoke either fear or awe or a sense of disowning from a =\r\nsociety conditioned over centuries to believe in fixed ideas of spiritualit=\r\ny and moral behavior. On a practical side, every genuine Bhairavi always, a=\r\nlways looks a good decade or two younger than their physical age, and tend =\r\nto have some very distinct and remarkable facial features. In Vaishnava Tan=\r\ntras, which have become extinct now, Krishna was considered a MahaBhairava =\r\nand Radha was His\n Bhairavi. \n\nAnyway, if you are meant to meet one, you wi=\r\nll I am sure. \n\n&lt;&lt;it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and pu=\r\nt a bit of \nheart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for n=\r\not giving\n me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she m=\r\nade me,\n it&#39;s her own fault). &gt;&gt;\n\nHomas with heart are a good thing. Eventu=\r\nally it strengthens the inner voice and helps one to progress. Fire is a po=\r\nwerful medium of worship.\n\n________________________________________________=\r\n____\n\nBTW, the concept of Virodha Bhakti is more complex. One must intensel=\r\ny and continuously hate God with a vengence if that has to have any effect.=\r\n Occasionally being angry or accusative is not the same, because that is ra=\r\nrely equal to hatred. People often get angry on those they actually love. I=\r\nn recorded history, apart from two or three people, no one has succeeded in=\r\n attaining God by actually hating him/her/it.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nBa=\r\nzeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\nHota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aag=\r\ne\n=C2=A0\nEk khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\nEk baat hain ijaz-e-ma=\r\nsiah mere aage.\n\n\n________________________________\n From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sun=\r\nrise_1080@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Sunday, 17 J=\r\nune 2012 7:23 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;m=\r\naterial sadhana&quot;\n \n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\nNamaste Rajarshi ji,\n\nThank you for the very =\r\ninteresting information about tantra, a subject I know very little about. \n=\r\n\nIt sounds fascinating. Making an idol of Durga from the mud collected from=\r\n the house of a widow and a prostitute! I interpret that ritual to demonstr=\r\nate that Durga abides in the heart of a prostitute as much as she does in t=\r\nhe heart of a saint, and so the soil from both their houses is equally sacr=\r\ned. \n\nI&#39;m glad to hear you say that tantra has so many women of high spirit=\r\nual calibre...that&#39;s very inspiring. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about t=\r\nhem.\n\nI recently read a wonderful book about the women saints of India, cal=\r\nled &quot;Daughters of the Goddess&quot;, written by an American devotee of the Godde=\r\nss (Linda Johnsen). She asked the same question &quot;Where are the women saints=\r\n of India?&quot;. A Pandit ji replied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t stand on public =\r\nstages and give seminars, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went =\r\non a pilgrimage to India and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other l=\r\niving realised saints in the female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to =\r\nmeet some of the yoginis and Bhairavis you mention.\n\nI&#39;m curious about tant=\r\nra and would like to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual =\r\npractice,  but I&#39;m open to learning about other paths (tantra probably incl=\r\nudes Japa for all I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be=\r\n great. I see Durga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing th=\r\ne Sadhana with me (because I&#39;m too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as th=\r\ne goal (actually they&#39;re the same in my head and are both my goal as my div=\r\nine parents). The cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddes=\r\ns alone could give them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Kat=\r\nyayani asking for Krishna, and She gave Him to them! \n\nPlease could you rec=\r\ncommend some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read and educ=\r\nate myself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My only =\r\nworhip of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her alternately)=\r\n is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha=\r\n) randomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Si=\r\nvananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams =\r\nto my practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Har=\r\ni with it (it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit=\r\n of heart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not givin=\r\ng me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, i=\r\nt&#39;s her own fault). \n\nThanks again for the message, and here&#39;s to tantra, t=\r\nhe path that treats women as equals! \n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Very auth=\r\nentic questions! Allow me to add some perspective to it, which may or may-n=\r\not be helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, wo=\r\nmen were not \n&gt; allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the G=\r\noddess). Why \n&gt; aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male=\r\n saints is \n&gt; probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the poi=\r\nnt of \n&gt; covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya=\r\n), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the \n&gt; scr=\r\niptures).&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; I assume from your words that you have been exposed to som=\r\ne standard view-points about Durga, (Avidya/Maya and all that stuff). In so=\r\nme branches of the Adwaitha philosophy it is said that Shakti (Durga) is Ma=\r\nya and Avidya. Irony being that, adherents of these branches were hardly th=\r\ne folks, historically speaking, who chief deity was Ma Durga.\n&gt; \n&gt; The path=\r\n that *actually* worshiped Her, was/is Tantra, which believes, there is no =\r\n&quot;Avidya&quot; at all. Brahman/the-state-called-Atman is true, and so is the worl=\r\nd of duality which is but a manifestation/projection of that core. In the p=\r\nath of Tantra, which was neither mainstream nor geographically widespread, =\r\nthere was never any restriction to females with respect to sadhana. Not onl=\r\ny were women initiated, but there were fantastic women of exceptional spiri=\r\ntual caliber, and they used to be classified based on the levels they had a=\r\nchieved as &quot;uttara-sadhikas&quot;, &quot;bhairavis&quot; and &quot;yoginis&quot;. While mainstream H=\r\ninduism was busy burning widows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Ta=\r\nntras boldly declared Sati-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-syste=\r\nm totally, and allowed women the status of spiritual preceptors when they c=\r\nould attain certain states. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhair=\r\navi who taught him Tantra. The first person to worship\n&gt;  UgraTara south of=\r\n the Vindya Hills was the wife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who w=\r\nas initiated into this worship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has =\r\nthe caliber to teach a Ramakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act a=\r\ns gurus for average folks? Sure. But then, history does not even record her=\r\n real name. Why? Because, the system of Tantra as well as those who followe=\r\nd the path - both men and women - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahmi=\r\nnical Hinduism; thus they never gained any popularity, except for the wrong=\r\n reasons. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Every worship of Durga that happens anywhere today is In=\r\ndia is still a watered-down version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi=\r\n Homa was first mentioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal ev=\r\nery rule of Durga Puja is from the various Tantric schools. [For example, w=\r\nhen creating an idol of Durga, the mud has to be collected from 4/5 differe=\r\nnt places such as from home of a prostitute, a river-bed, a widow&#39;s house, =\r\netc etc.] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So it is not that those who followed the path of Ma Durg=\r\na never had women saints. Infact, they had more women in their folds who we=\r\nre accorded the highest spiritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But s=\r\nince Tantra itself was never popular, neither were these saints popular. An=\r\nd things like female foeticide were unheard of in places where the worship =\r\nof the Goddess was popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshiper=\r\ns of Ma Kali - who were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dar=\r\ne to offer a woman as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath =\r\nsince Tantras strictly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a wor=\r\nshiper of the Goddess. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women=\r\n, objectively it would not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga o=\r\nr Kali or one of Her forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mer=\r\ne aage\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek ba=\r\nat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;=\r\n  From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com =\r\n\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karm=\r\nic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nreading, time is running out, who knows when you will reach the\n&gt; &gt; cremati=\r\non ground, chant and chant.

I wash my hands of the whole thing.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; So don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told =\r\nyou to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ok rant over.

On a practical side, every genuine\n Bhairavi always, al=\r\nways looks a good decade or two younger than their physical age, and tend t=\r\no have some very distinct and remarkable facial features. In Vaishnava Tant=\r\nras, which have become extinct now, Krishna was considered a MahaBhairava a=\r\nnd Radha was His Bhairavi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, if you are meant to meet one, yo=\r\nu will I am sure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, =\r\nbut I try and put a bit of \nheart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I b=\r\nlame Durga for not giving\n me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afra=\r\nid, but as she made me,\n it&#39;s her own fault). &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Homas with he=\r\nart are a good thing. Eventually it strengthens the inner voice and helps o=\r\nne to progress. Fire is a powerful medium of worship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;______________=\r\n______________________________________&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;BTW, the concept of Virodha B=\r\nhakti is more complex. One must intensely and continuously hate God with a =\r\nvengence if that has to have any effect. Occasionally being angry or accusa=\r\ntive is not the same, because that is rarely equal to hatred. People often =\r\nget angry on those they actually love. In recorded history, apart from two =\r\nor three people, no one has succeeded in attaining God by actually hating h=\r\nim/her/it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_261_13399459513176=\r\n9&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;T=\r\nimes New Roman&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-si=\r\nze: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot;&gt;Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya =\r\nmere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style=\r\n-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot;&gt;Hota hain shab-o-=\r\nroz tamasha mere aage&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-styl=\r\ne-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;COLOR:#000099;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 13=\r\npx;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;E=\r\nk khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan\n class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;E=\r\nk baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 1=\r\n2pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  =\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunr=\r\nise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bol=\r\nd;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sunday, 17 June 2012 7:23 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability fo=\r\nr Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dn=\r\ns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2046356106&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv204=\r\n6356106ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNamaste Rajarshi ji,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThank you for the very interesting information about tantra, a sub=\r\nject I know very little about. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt sounds fascinating. Making an i=\r\ndol of Durga from the mud collected from the house of a widow and a prostit=\r\nute! I interpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart =\r\nof a prostitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soi=\r\nl from both their houses is equally sacred. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m glad to hear you =\r\nsay that tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very i=\r\nnspiring. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about them.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI recently re=\r\nad a wonderful book about the women saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of t=\r\nhe Goddess&quot;, written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen).=\r\n She asked the same question &quot;Where are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pand=\r\nit ji replied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t stand on public stages and give sem=\r\ninars, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to =\r\nIndia and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised sain=\r\nts in the female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yo=\r\nginis and Bhairavis you mention.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m curious about tantra and woul=\r\nd like to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  =\r\nbut I&#39;m open to learning about other paths (tantra probably includes Japa f=\r\nor all I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be great. I s=\r\nee Durga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana w=\r\nith me (because I&#39;m too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (act=\r\nually they&#39;re the same in my head and are both my goal as my divine parents=\r\n). The cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone cou=\r\nld give them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani aski=\r\nng for Krishna, and She gave Him to them! &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlease could you reccom=\r\nmend some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read and educate=\r\n myself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My only wor=\r\nhip of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her alternately) is=\r\n repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) r=\r\nandomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivan=\r\nanda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added homams to =\r\nmy practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari w=\r\nith it (it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put a bit of=\r\n heart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not giving m=\r\ne any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, it&#39;s=\r\n her own fault). &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThanks again for the message, and here&#39;s to tant=\r\nra, the path that treats women as equals! &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In =\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Very authentic questions!

And what =\r\nis the point of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she i=\r\ns the Avidya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does =\r\nin all the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; scriptures).&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I assume from =\r\nyour words that you have been exposed to some standard view-points about Du=\r\nrga, (Avidya/Maya and all that stuff). In some branches of the Adwaitha phi=\r\nlosophy it is said that Shakti (Durga) is Maya and Avidya. Irony being that=\r\n, adherents of these branches were hardly the folks, historically speaking,=\r\n who chief deity was Ma Durga.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The path that *actually* =\r\nworshiped Her, was/is Tantra, which believes, there is no &quot;Avidya&quot; at all. =\r\nBrahman/the-state-called-Atman is true, and so is the world of duality whic=\r\nh is but a manifestation/projection of that core. In the path of Tantra, wh=\r\nich was neither mainstream nor geographically widespread, there was never a=\r\nny restriction to females with respect to sadhana. Not only were women init=\r\niated, but there were fantastic women of exceptional spiritual caliber, and=\r\n they used to be classified based on the levels they had achieved as &quot;uttar=\r\na-sadhikas&quot;, &quot;bhairavis&quot; and &quot;yoginis&quot;. While mainstream Hinduism was busy =\r\nburning widows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Tantras boldly decl=\r\nared Sati-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-system totally, and al=\r\nlowed women the status of spiritual preceptors when they could attain certa=\r\nin states. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhairavi who taught hi=\r\nm Tantra. The first person to\n worship&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  UgraTara south of the Vind=\r\nya Hills was the wife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who was initia=\r\nted into this worship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has the calib=\r\ner to teach a Ramakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act as gurus f=\r\nor average folks? Sure. But then, history does not even record her real nam=\r\ne. Why? Because, the system of Tantra as well as those who followed the pat=\r\nh - both men and women - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahminical Hin=\r\nduism; thus they never gained any popularity, except for the wrong reasons.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Every worship of Durga that happens anywhere=\r\n today is India is still a watered-down version from the Tantras. The conce=\r\npt of ChanDi Homa was first mentioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. =\r\nIn Bengal every rule of Durga Puja is from the various Tantric schools. [Fo=\r\nr example, when creating an idol of Durga, the mud has to be collected from=\r\n 4/5 different places such as from home of a prostitute, a river-bed, a wid=\r\now&#39;s house, etc etc.] &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So it is not that those=\r\n who followed the path of Ma Durga never had women saints. Infact, they had=\r\n more women in their folds who were accorded the highest spiritual status t=\r\nhan in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itself was never popular, neit=\r\nher were these saints popular. And things like female foeticide were unhear=\r\nd of in places where the worship of the Goddess was popular. Even the misgu=\r\nided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - who were guilty of rampant =\r\nhuman-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woman as a sacrifice to Ma Ka=\r\nli, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras strictly forbid harming the =\r\nfemale of any specifies for a worshiper of the Goddess. So if blame has to =\r\nbe laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it would not fall on those w=\r\nhose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of Her forms.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-r=\r\noz tamasha mere aage&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-s=\r\nulemaan mere nazdeek&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  From: sunr=\r\nise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: Saturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re:=\r\n Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ym=\r\nailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;sc=\r\nsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; First of=\r\n all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; re=\r\nading, time is running out, who knows when you will reach the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n cremation ground, chant and chant.
