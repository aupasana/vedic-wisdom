Even if by some luck, through a conflu=\r\nence of various factors, mind becomes &#39;satisfied&#39;, it is usually not for lo=\r\nng.\n\nthe following is a repost of the simplest procedure that Narasimha pos=\r\nted a while back\n\nMaterials needed: Homa kundam, wooden/copper/ silver \nspo=\r\non/ladle, melted ghee and pieces of dried coconut (or wood or dried cowdung=\r\n \ncakes).\n \n(0) Sit facing east and place homa kundam in front \nof you.\n \n(=\r\n1) Place some dried coconut pieces or wood or \ndried cowdung cake pieces in=\r\n homa kundam (fire pit).\n \n(2) Light a camphor and place it in the homa kun=\r\ndam \nwhile saying &quot;om bhuurbhuvassuvarom&quot; and make sure that the pieces pla=\r\nced \nin homa kundam catch fire.\n \n(3) Pour ghee drops with a wooden/copper/=\r\n silver \nspoon/ladle in the fire while saying the following:\n \nom prajaapat=\r\naye svaahaa\nom indraaya svaahaa\nom agnaye svaahaa\nom somaaya svaahaa\nom bhu=\r\nurbhuvassuvaH svaahaa\n \n(4) Thinking of Ganesha in your mind, pour ghee \ndr=\r\nops in fire while saying the following:\n \nom gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\no=\r\nm gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\nom gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\nom gam gaNap=\r\nataye namaH \nsvaahaa \n(5) Pick any deity and any mantra. Thinking of the \nd=\r\neity of the mantra, pour ghee drops (or any other valid offering - see manu=\r\nal) \nwhile saying the mantra. Just add svaahaa at the end of the mantra. If=\r\n the \nmantra already has a svaahaa at the end, there is no need to add one =\r\nmore \nsvaahaa.\n \nIt is also fine to pick a collection of verses \n(e.g. Vish=\r\nnu sahasra naama stotram, Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram, \nLalita sa=\r\nhasra naama stotram, Aditya hridayam, Subrahmanyashtakam etc). At the \nend =\r\nof each verse, add svaahaa and make an offering in fire. When the stotram \n=\r\nends, you can go back to the beginning and repeat.\n \nDo this for as much ti=\r\nme as you want to. But make \nsure that you do this step for atleast 10-15 m=\r\ninutes.\n \n(6) When you are done, pour ghee drops in fire \nwhile saying the =\r\nfollowing:\n \nom bhuuH svaahaa\nom bhuvaH svaahaa\nom suvaH svaahaa\nom bhuurbh=\r\nuvassuvaH svaahaa\nom shrii viShNave svaahaa\nom namo rudraaya pashupataye sv=\r\naahaa\n \n(7) Try to surrender your mind as completely to god \nas you can. Si=\r\nt absolutely still and meditate for a few minutes with any \nmantra.\n \nDone!=\r\n\n\nif one can accept that mind may never be satisfied even with the most ela=\r\nborate procedure with the finest materials, then it may be possible to expe=\r\nrience the undiluted essence of this worship.\n\nBest Regards\n\nAjaya\n\n\n--- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; NAMASK=\r\nAR\n&gt; \n&gt; I seeks help on regarding this topic...may Rajarshi, Krishnendu, Ar=\r\nnab, Utpal or anyone please take my issue...\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards,\n&gt; Biswajit\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; PRANAM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Narasimha Ji and Others,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometimes=\r\n a trim down version is very useful for me when there is time constraint fo=\r\nr daily Ganapati Homam...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Currently the short-procedure takes abou=\r\nt 45 minutes for me, yes I know there is a super-short procedure, but that =\r\nlacks many Mantra/Sanskrit-verse and sometimes mind is not satisfied with t=\r\nhe bare-minimum. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, could you please suggest/mark the various st=\r\neps with important Mantras on priority basis on the short-procedure of the =\r\nGanapati Homam, so that one could trim down the homam process in the case o=\r\nf time constraint but mind should be satisfy enough for the purpose...\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Biswajit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
