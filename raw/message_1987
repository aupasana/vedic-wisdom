Some=\r\ntimes i doubted my own sincerety...sometimes i thought my karmas must indee=\r\nd be very deep rooted. \n\nIn my years of trying to find answers thru astrolo=\r\ngy i blamed 3 retro planets for the deep rooted karmas. In terms of your po=\r\nsting from the archives i see things in a slightly different light. \n\nSun i=\r\ns conjoined with combust retro Mercury which in turn is closely conjoined w=\r\nith Ketu making it a malefic. Sun is aspected by retro Mars and of course R=\r\nahu. The only saving grace is that Jupiter is also there with Sun. So maybe=\r\n there are lots of subtle karmas to be burnt.\n\nAs for the Moon it is aspect=\r\ned by retro exalted Saturn from the house of rin (6th) as well as retro Mar=\r\ns (8th H) and conjoined with lagnesh Venus (self). So maybe there are lots =\r\nof gross karmas to be dissolved thru tarpana. And because Moon is with Lagn=\r\nesh maybe tarpana is even more necessary.\n\ni sincerely believe in the energ=\r\nies around us and a whole subtle world waiting to be accessed / experienced=\r\n. Even though at present there is no direct experience of such a world, may=\r\nbe as things progress...there may be tranformations...to enable a better un=\r\nderstanding of these things...\n\nSorry, for asking who is Rama at the end of=\r\n Ramayana...but i would still like to know how deities are invoked in fire.=\r\n I have been performing the bare minimum homam that u described in one of y=\r\nour messages. i follow all the 7 steps described there. In step number 5 wh=\r\nere u say &quot;pick any deity and any mantra&quot;, i recite &quot;om gam ganapataye nama=\r\nh&quot;. In step no.6 while pouring ghee i recite &quot;om bhuh swahaa, om bhuvah swa=\r\nhaa, om suvah swaaha, om bhurbhuvahsuvah swahaa, om shri vishnave swahaa, o=\r\nm namo rudraaye pashupataye swaaha&quot;. Then i place a piece of dry coconut in=\r\n the hom and sit for meditation.\n\nIs the deity invoked at this point?\n\nIf i=\r\n want to include pitri tarpana also in this, how do i go about it?\n\nDon&#39;t k=\r\nnow if i am done! There is a long way to go....\n\n\nBest regards,\nvinita\n\n\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Not so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a bri=\r\nef pitri tarpana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without =\r\nreason.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The thoughts of the minds around us=\r\n do have a subtle impact on our mind. When too many depressed, sad or frust=\r\nrated people are around you, it will have a negative effect on you. Similar=\r\nly, when some peaceful and blissful people or elevated souls are around you=\r\n, it will have a positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around=\r\n you does have an impact on you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is particularly true with respe=\r\nct to the minds of people who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you. Wh=\r\nen minds of such people are in great distress or great excitement, it has a=\r\nn impact on your mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaar=\r\nmik debt has some strong desires and unable to progress to a higher loka or=\r\n be reborn, his thoughts and desires will have an impact on your mind.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Thus, we invest our mental energy praying for their relief. While offerin=\r\ng balls of solid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray that the ances=\r\ntor may get an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining desires. While le=\r\naving water in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor&#39;s desires may be satis=\r\nfied and the ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. By praying for helpin=\r\ng an ancestor, you are indirectly helping yourself, by removing a powerful =\r\nnegative influence on your mind and getting rid of some weaknesses.\n&gt;  \n&gt; U=\r\nnfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of fashio=\r\nn today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously if they do it at=\r\nleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says that he will pick pit=\r\nri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can perform.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used to perform a fire r=\r\nitual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Rituals use external symbols t=\r\no induce internal changes. These two rituals are really important and usefu=\r\nl rituals.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A small comparison of homam and tarpana is reproduced from=\r\n vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:\n&gt;  \n&gt; --------------------------\n&gt; One w=\r\nord on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas and the medium i=\r\ns fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medium is water. Both sa=\r\ndhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whether watery signs/pl=\r\nanets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In homam,=\r\n devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpa=\r\nna, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the min=\r\nd) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have genes from (and ri=\r\nna with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousn=\r\ness of the deceased ancestor is still having those thoughts, you will also =\r\nsuffer from such thoughts due to the connection and may even commit some ba=\r\nd karmas because of the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by =\r\nworking on giving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousne=\r\nss is attached to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousne=\r\nss will not affect your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims t=\r\no cut off a strong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously c=\r\nommitted bad karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progres=\r\ns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identif=\r\nication is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on yo=\r\nur individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are gross=\r\ner forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-i=\r\ndentification is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You ma=\r\ny note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora c=\r\nhart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them respective=\r\nly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Devas and pitris have different ways of working and influencing u=\r\ns and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all of us an=\r\nd have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in fire=\r\n and satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Naras=\r\nimha,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for this valuable manual. Could you enlighten me on =\r\nthe difference between Pitri Tarpana and Shraddham? I believe Shraddham is =\r\nperformed once a year on the thithi of demise of one&#39;s father (to be perfor=\r\nmed by the eldest son). There are some variants such as performing it durin=\r\ng the Shraddha Paksham instead of on the actual thithi, every year. Also, h=\r\nave heard of a Gaya Shraddham, which is to be performed once in a lifetime,=\r\n and which makes it unnecessary to perform yearly Shraddham subsequently. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Have tried to search for material on this but have not succeeded =\r\nso far. At least if you can provide information on some sources, it would b=\r\ne a great help.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; &gt; Ram\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, =\r\n12/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R.
