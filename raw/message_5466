Ever since my chi=\r\nldhood, primarily because of my upbringing, I have been trying and observin=\r\ng a lot of &quot;Good&quot; things. I have been reading texts on spirituality and was=\r\n a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda&#39;s writings. I always found Kabir&#39;s fo=\r\nllowing lines, as a best (and most compact) commentary on the two prominent=\r\n paths of spirituality: -\n\n\n&quot;Ek kahoon to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&quot;H=\r\nai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat kabir vicharee&quot;\n\n\ni.e.\n&quot;If I say One, it is not,=\r\n If I say two, it is contemplation&quot;\n&quot;Let it be what it is, says Kabir after=\r\n contemplation&quot;\n\n\nUntil last year, my faith was getting stronger and strong=\r\ner in my beliefs. Last year made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of =\r\npersonal time to think. I have come up with several doubts (just a few give=\r\nn below) about spirituality and God and Goodness, and I have started to fee=\r\nl getting drifted towards atheism (susprisingly am writing all this on Vaik=\r\nuntha Ekadashi, when am observing a fast).

Where is the supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism is a=\r\n different issue, but last year made me realize that materialistic troubles=\r\n made me very weak spiritually too. So, I dont see them to be connected som=\r\nehow.\n- I do understand that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels are low, and=\r\n so called Godly correction of the wrong doing, takes its own time. But doe=\r\nsn&#39;t that promotes the bad karma in itself, specially in this yuga? And how=\r\n long can one wait?\n- Suicide is considered a greatest sin, as it is throwi=\r\nng away the best gift we get from the lord. But, I am not sure that if peop=\r\nle do it for fun. God presents a person with tough situations in the name o=\r\nf testing times, and some day the limit is reached. Then isn&#39;t god accompli=\r\nce in this so called crime.\n- In first place, why does he need to test us?\n=\r\n\n\nAs I said that all these question make me feel that I am losing the faith=\r\n in His goodness. All my spiritual progress if any has been corrupted by th=\r\nese testing times. And no help came to me(I could not figure out). And thos=\r\ne who did offer, faced a lot of troubles themselves and are also suffering =\r\nnow. This is what makes me go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this tha=\r\nt I have passed my agony to someone.\n\n\nDespite all these thoughts that have=\r\n pre-occupied my mind for quite some time, I feel that I still survive a ch=\r\nance to get back to my faith in real terms and not driven by materialistic =\r\ndesire. This is the reason I am writing this mail. May be someone can make =\r\nme see what I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting totally crazy, in=\r\nsane and moving towards atheism and quit possibly committing the so called =\r\n&quot;Sin&quot;.\n\n\nRegards,\nSri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-408700431-1292605095=:53743\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;And on your lines..........&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;=\r\nAnd those who did offer, faced a lot of troubles themselves and are also su=\r\nffering now.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If my solution works for you&nbs=\r\np;then we will see how troubles can touch you or me brother,Parshurama neve=\r\nr used to teach a power of Brahmastra to Kshatriya but for Shri&nbsp;Shivji=\r\n=3D his bead is universal,anyone can wear them-humans,animals each and ever=\r\nyone is capable to wear Rudraksha,if you have time go and read Shri Shivama=\r\nhapurana and a stroy of donkey who got moksha because of Rudraksha.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Don&#39;t worry no troubles will knock my doors for this divine help,wear t=\r\nhe ultimate pride of The God and see what happens next !&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hari: O=\r\nm,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Shambhave Nama: .&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 12/17/10,=\r\n Astro Seeker &lt;I&gt;&lt;astro.seeker@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BL=\r\nOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px;=\r\n MARGIN-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Testing Times&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Date: Friday, December 17, 2010, 7:58 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1907110400&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1907110400ygrp-te=\r\nxt&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;D=\r\near All,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have tried to make spiritual progress=\r\n for long, and made little progress (but not significant).
