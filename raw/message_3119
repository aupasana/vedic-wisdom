The author tells some of Bama&#39;s ideas in his book of\ninterviews wi=\r\nth saints: Tantrabhilasir Sadhu-sangha:\nMa (the Mother goddess) is asleep i=\r\nn the muladhara chakra and should be\nawakened- if she is not awake, who is =\r\nthere to give one liberation? Only\nshe can do this.... The first sign of th=\r\ne awakening of Kundalini is that\nthe person does not feel satisfied with th=\r\ne ordinary state of life- one\ngets a great urge within to get over this con=\r\nfinement. The awakening of\nKundalini gives men great pleasure, a kind of pl=\r\neasure that ordinary men\nnever attain ... as you pass through and move from=\r\n one chakra to\nanother, you feel the manifestations of the varied bhavas of=\r\n Kundalini\nSakti. But what is important, as a result of kundalini Shakti&#39;s\n=\r\nfunctions in every chakra, is the kind of bhava it creates, a different\nbha=\r\nva in each place, and the feeling of these bhavas brings such a state\nof bl=\r\niss that it cannot be described.\nHe felt that the soul departs the body thr=\r\nough the spinal channel at\ndeath, through an aperture in the skull, and it =\r\nenters a state of\nemptiness and peace, nirvikalpa samadhi. This is the home=\r\n of Tara Ma,\nwhich is beyond the material world, the heaven worlds, and the=\r\n home of\nKali. Tara&#39;s grace is necessary to reach this state.\nSome incident=\r\ns in the masters life\nThe Widow&#39;s Marriage\n\nOne day a young, beautiful girl=\r\n and her father came to see Bama Kshepa.\nThe\nyoung girl bowed down to the M=\r\naster and offered him some Indian sweets\nwhich\nshe herself had prepared. Ba=\r\nma was extremely pleased with her and said,\n&quot;I\nam blessing you. You will be=\r\n blessed in the future with a beautiful\nson.&quot;\n\nThe girl cried out, &quot;Father,=\r\n Father, look what this sadhu is saying! How\ncan I have a child when I have=\r\n lost my husband? I am a widow.&quot;\n\nBama said, &quot;You are a widow. So what! You=\r\n will be remarried. My words\nwill\nprove true.&quot;\n\nIn three months&#39; time a ver=\r\ny rich young man fell in love with her.\nAlthough in those days it was not a=\r\nt all appreciated if a widow\nremarried,\nthis girl did get married in a spec=\r\nial Hindu Vaishnava manner. Needless\nto\nsay, in a year&#39;s time after she got=\r\n married, she was blessed with a\nbeautiful\nson.\nThe Dying Man\n\nA young man =\r\nsuffering from a serious case of tuberculosis was brought by\nhis relatives =\r\nto Bama. The young man&#39;s days were numbered. Bama said to\nthem,\n&quot;Why did yo=\r\nu bring him to me? Am I a doctor? You rascals, you will never\ngive me peace=\r\n of mind.&quot;\n\nThen the Master stood up and started strangling the patient. Ev=\r\nerybody\nwas\nstunned. The man was already so week. The disciples started cry=\r\ning\nbecause\nif the young man died, the Master and all of them would be in s=\r\nerious\ntrouble.\n\nBut Bama continued to strangle and abuse the man like anyt=\r\nhing, saying,\n&quot;When\nyou do bad things, unbearable things, don&#39;t you know yo=\r\nu will pay the\npenalty?&quot;\nThen he said, &quot;All right, I have forgiven you,&quot; an=\r\nd he threw the man\ndown\non the ground. Everybody thought he was dead.\n\nBut =\r\nin a few minutes, to everyone&#39;s astonishment, the young man stood up\nand sa=\r\nid, &quot;I am so hungry. Please give me something to eat. I have never\nfelt thi=\r\ns kind of hunger in my life.&quot; The dying man was now totally\ncured.\nThe rela=\r\ntives left the Master&#39;s house offering utmost gratitude to Bama,\nwhom they =\r\naffectionately called the &quot;insane spiritual Master.&quot;\n\nThe Suicide Attempt\n\n=\r\nOnce in the thick of the night a middle-aged man named Nimai was tying a\nro=\r\npe to the branch of a tree and was about to hang himself. He could not\nsupp=\r\nort his family, and for this reason the members of his family had\ntremendou=\r\ns\ndisrespect for him. Therefore he wanted to commit suicide.\n\nAt that momen=\r\nt Bama appeared in his subtle body and said, &quot;What are you\ndoing?\nYou rasca=\r\nl, don&#39;t you know that committing suicide is the worst possible\nsin? Don&#39;t =\r\nyou believe it?&quot;\n\nNimai said, &quot;All right, I will not commit suicide, but I =\r\nwill never go\nhome\nagain.&quot;\n\nBama said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to go home. Come and=\r\n stay with me, in your\nreal\nhome. God will take care of your family, I assu=\r\nre you.&quot;\n\nBama&#39;s words proved true. Very soon, two of Nimai&#39;s older sons go=\r\nt jobs\nand\nwere in a position to support the rest of the members of the fam=\r\nily.\n  The Leper\nBama had a dear attendant named Nanda, who had developed l=\r\neprosy. Even\nthen, Bama used to take food from him regularly and not from o=\r\nther\ndisciples. Gradually, Nanda&#39;s case became extremely serious. His hands=\r\n\nand arms were totally covered with infected wounds and it was a very\nugly =\r\nsight. So he stopped coming to\nhis Master&#39;s place.\n\nOne day, Bama&#39;s attenda=\r\nnts said to their Master, &quot;Master, you have the\ncapacity to cure your dear =\r\ndisciple, Nanda. Why don&#39;t you cure him?&quot;\n\nBama said to them, &quot;All right, b=\r\nring him today.&quot;\n\nWhen Nanda came, Bama started striking him, saying, &quot;Can =\r\nyou count on\nyour fingertips how many times you have done unthinkable thing=\r\ns? I say\nyou can&#39;t, you rascal. I have forgiven you and I am curing you, bu=\r\nt in\nthe future never, never do anything immoral or undivine.&quot;\n\nIn a month&#39;=\r\ns time Nanda was totally cured. Then he once again started\npreparing meals =\r\nfor Bama and serving him with utmost love and devoted\nsurrender.\n  Calcutta=\r\n Kalighat temple\nAt the Calcutta Kalighat temple, while in a state of bhava=\r\n, he tried to\nlift the statue of the Mother and take her on his lap. When s=\r\ntopped by\nthe priests, he shouted, &quot;I do not want your black Kali! She look=\r\ns like\na demoness coming to devour [someone]. My Tara Ma is beautiful, with=\r\n\nsmall feet. I do not want your black Kali- my Akasa Tara is good enough\nfo=\r\nr me.&quot; People would call on him, asking him to pray to their household\nimag=\r\nes, to enliven them with his bhava. He would fall into trance when\nhe visit=\r\ned their statues, and often he performed neither worship nor\nchanting of ma=\r\nntras. He would loudly call into the air for the Mother,\nand many observers=\r\n saw the statue appear to take the form of a human\nbeing.\nHis Holiness&#39;s wo=\r\nrship of Maa Tara\nHe took a handful of flowers marked with sandal paste and=\r\n stood before\nthe goddess. He cursed her and threw the flowers at the statu=\r\ne. He wet\nthe flowers with his tears. Although the flowers were thrown with=\r\n an\nattitude of abuse instead of reverence using mantras, they arranged\nthe=\r\nmselves into a neat and beautiful garland around the goddess&#39; neck,\nand the=\r\n observers were amazed at the mantraless form of worship of the\nmadman. He =\r\nthen went into trance which continued all day, and he emerged\nfrom it on th=\r\ne following day. He was not a priest who followed\nschedules- often the time=\r\n for worship would have passed and no one could\nfind Bama anywhere. He woul=\r\nd later be seen in trance under a Hibiscus\ntree, on in the jungle, having a=\r\nrguments with the goddess.\nBama,Maa Tara&#39;s dearest son\nHe would eat food to=\r\n be offered to the goddess before the worship\nceremony was finished thus ma=\r\nking it impure and unsanctified. The\ncaretakers of the temple were angry at=\r\n this and beat him severely. He\ninsisted that the goddess Tara asked him to=\r\n take food in this way. After\nthis, the temple owner, the Rani of Natore, h=\r\nad a dream:\n\nShe dreamt that the stone image of Mother Tara was leaving the=\r\n temple at\nTarapith and going to Kailasa. Tara Ma looked very sad, and tear=\r\ns were\nflowing down her face, and she wore no mark on her forehead. She was=\r\n\nbewildered and emaciated. Her back was bleeding and full of cuts, and\nvult=\r\nures and jackals followed behind her, lapping the blood from her\nwounds.\nIn=\r\n fear, the Rani asked, &quot;O Ma, why do you show me these terrible\nthings, and=\r\n why are you leaving us?&quot;\n\nThe goddess answered, &quot;My child, I have been in =\r\nthis sacred place\n(mahapitha) for ages. Now your priests have beaten my dea=\r\nr mad son, and\nas a mother, I have taken these blows upon myself. See how m=\r\ny back is\nbleeding, I am in great pain ... For four days I have been starvi=\r\nng,\nbecause they have not allowed my mad son to eat my ritual food. So for\n=\r\nfour days I have refused to take their offerings of food ... My child,\nhow =\r\ncan a mother take food before feeding her child? You must arrange\nfor food =\r\nto be offered to my son, before it is offered to me, at the\ntemple. If not,=\r\n I will leave there permanently.&quot; Bama got his priest job\nback, and people =\r\nbegan to visit him, to come as devotees, or simply to\nsee him.\nShortly befo=\r\nre his Mahasamadhi in 1911, he became withdrawn and spent\nmost of his time =\r\nin trance and meditation. He ceased to talk with his\ndisciples, speaking on=\r\nly rarely about death and Tara Ma. His love-hate\nrelationship with her cont=\r\ninued until his death in 1911. \n\r\n--1-8940631562-6467792184=:3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sa=\r\nns-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bama, who practiced a form of kundalini yog=\r\na, was interviewed by Promode Chatterji.

T=\r\nhen he once again started preparing meals for Bama and serving him with utm=\r\nost love and devoted surrender.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Ari=\r\nal, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Calcutta Kalighat temp=\r\nle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-fami=\r\nly: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetic=\r\na, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;At the Calcutta Kalighat temple, while in a state=\r\n of bhava, he tried to lift the statue of the Mother and take her on his la=\r\np. When stopped by the priests, he shouted, &quot;I do not want your black Kali!=\r\n She looks like a demoness coming to devour [someone]. My Tara Ma is beauti=\r\nful, with small feet. I do not want your black Kali- my Akasa Tara is good =\r\nenough for me.&quot; People would call on him, asking him to pray to their house=\r\nhold images, to enliven them with his bhava. He would fall into trance when=\r\n he visited their statues, and often he performed neither worship nor chant=\r\ning of mantras. He would loudly call into the air for the Mother, and many =\r\nobservers saw the statue appear to take the form of a human being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nb&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: =\r\nArial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-styl=\r\ne-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-=\r\nserif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;His Holiness&#39;s worship of Maa Tara&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helve=\r\ntica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-weight: n=\r\normal;&quot;&gt;He took a handful of flowers marked with sandal paste and stood bef=\r\nore the goddess. He cursed her and threw the flowers at the statue. He wet =\r\nthe flowers with his tears. Although the flowers were thrown with an attitu=\r\nde of abuse instead of reverence using mantras, they arranged themselves in=\r\nto a neat and beautiful garland around the goddess&#39; neck, and the observers=\r\n were amazed at the mantraless form of worship of the madman. He then went =\r\ninto trance which continued all day, and he emerged from it on the followin=\r\ng day. He was not a priest who followed schedules- often the time for worsh=\r\nip would have passed and no one could find Bama anywhere. He would later be=\r\n seen in trance under a Hibiscus tree, on in the jungle, having arguments w=\r\nith the goddess.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-sty=\r\nle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nfamily: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bama,Maa Tara&#39;s d=\r\nearest son&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, =\r\nHelvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;He would eat food to be offered to the godd=\r\ness before the worship ceremony was finished thus making it impure and unsa=\r\nnctified. The caretakers of the temple were angry at this and beat him seve=\r\nrely. He insisted that the goddess Tara asked him to take food in this way.=\r\n After this, the temple owner, the Rani of Natore, had a dream:&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;She dreamt that the stone image of Mother Tara was leaving the temple at =\r\nTarapith and going to Kailasa. Tara Ma looked very sad, and tears were flow=\r\ning down her face, and she wore no mark on her forehead. She was bewildered=\r\n and emaciated. Her back was bleeding and full of cuts, and vultures and ja=\r\nckals followed behind her, lapping the blood from her wounds.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In f=\r\near, the Rani asked, &quot;O Ma, why do you show me these terrible things, and w=\r\nhy are you leaving us?&quot;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The goddess answered, &quot;&lt;i&gt;My child, I =\r\nhave been in this sacred place (mahapitha) for ages. Now your priests have =\r\nbeaten my dear mad son, and as a mother, I have taken these blows upon myse=\r\nlf. See how my back is bleeding, I am in great pain ... For four days I hav=\r\ne been starving, because they have not allowed my mad son to eat my ritual =\r\nfood. So for four days I have refused to take their offerings of food ... M=\r\ny child, how can a mother take food before feeding her child? You must arra=\r\nnge for food to be offered to my son, before it is offered to me, at the te=\r\nmple. If not, I will leave there permanently&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;&nbsp;Bama got his priest=\r\n job back, and people began to visit him, to come as devotees, or simply to=\r\n see him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial=\r\n, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 12px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-spa=\r\nn&quot; style=3D&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;Shortly before his &lt;i&gt;Mahasamadhi&lt;/i&gt; in =\r\n1911, he became withdrawn and spent most of his time in trance and meditati=\r\non. He ceased to talk with his disciples, speaking only rarely about death =\r\nand Tara Ma. His love-hate relationship with her continued until his death =\r\nin 1911.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--1-8940631562-6467792184=:3--\r\n\n"}}
