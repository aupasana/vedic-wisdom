The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have=\r\n all kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force=\r\n that can be used to change or move something karmically.\n\nSuppose you see =\r\nsomething or someone beautiful and the enemy of &quot;desire&quot; (one of shadripus =\r\n- six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuse=\r\ns you and the enemy of &quot;anger&quot; tries to attack your mind. How does your min=\r\nd fight back?\n\nJust as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind=\r\n needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the en=\r\nemies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts sh=\r\nakti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on th=\r\ne mind is negated.\n\nWhen you eat, you get physical energy.\n When you exerci=\r\nse, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Similar=\r\nly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats from=\r\n the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time in =\r\npatterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), i=\r\nt stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.\n\nJust as physical ene=\r\nrgy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual energy =\r\nhelps you fight internal enemies who attack you.\n\nIf your surrender is perf=\r\nect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas withou=\r\nt committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless lea=\r\nf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have a c=\r\nonditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable=\r\n to committing NEW karmas, don&#39;t you think some energy is needed?\n\nDon&#39;t lo=\r\nok at spiritual shakti as\n something that enables you to do great deeds in =\r\nthe world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude an=\r\nd inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something t=\r\nhat enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome your o=\r\nwn weaknesses.\n\n* * *\n\n4. If you are living every second without any goals/=\r\nagendas/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberated a=\r\nnd then your point is meaningful.\n\nBut, if you do have some some goals, som=\r\ne wishes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize tha=\r\nt those wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmi=\r\ncally) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) ac=\r\ncumulated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy an=\r\nd stop you from getting bound further.\n\nSome people make the mistake of thi=\r\nnking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from\n moksha.=\r\n That is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely=\r\n worth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.\n\nSuppose you have =\r\na trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash=\r\n and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new tras=\r\nh that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you kee=\r\np collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can a=\r\nlso, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.\n\nBest r=\r\negards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.or=\r\ng\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writi=\r\nngs: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 2010 11:42:=\r\n03 +0000\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadhana\n&gt; From: Man=\r\nish Pandit &lt;mm.pandit@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Brahmacharya and\n virya:\n&gt; \n&gt; In a ml of semen, there are million=\r\ns of sperm, most living beings with\n&gt; potential to form a jiva.\n&gt; Look at t=\r\nhem under a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.\n&gt; They s=\r\nwim really energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try not to\n&gt; kil=\r\nl tadpoles normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be ok to take God&#39;s\n&gt; =\r\nname and kill them?\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is that those poor beings are destined f=\r\nor short life and death\n&gt; normally.\n&gt; If you realised this and stopped your=\r\nself by Brahmacharya, still you would\n&gt; have nightly emissions. Partly, ric=\r\nh food, partly lots of Kama related\n&gt; thoughts are responsible.\n&gt; Whenever =\r\nyou think of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by\n&gt; conscious=\r\n effort and look at the thought, you will clearly see the\n&gt; copulation happ=\r\nening in your thought in the head.\n&gt; That is problematic, but\n essentially =\r\nit means that sex starts in the mind\n&gt; only. Control the mind and things ar=\r\ne generally fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing is the prostatic fluid itself, if yo=\r\nu get a slight erection\n&gt; say after 20-30 days of strict Brahmacharya, you =\r\nwill notice that although\n&gt; there is no emission of sperm, some prostatic f=\r\nluid comes out (this is a\n&gt; form of Shukra-Acharya. ... prostatic fluid nou=\r\nrishes sperm and ....\n&gt; &quot;teaches&quot; it) This also represents a loss of shakti=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, so, how to stop it??\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and =\r\nkeep Bramhacharya for a few days,\n&gt; someday you may be destined for a fall =\r\nfrom Brahmacharya, for example, if\n&gt; some great looking heroine comes to yo=\r\nu and drops her clothes without asking,\n&gt; how many of you will be able to r=\r\nesist, keeping in mind that sexual imagery\n&gt; from films may have already sp=\r\noiled the mind. Most difficult...\n .\n&gt; There are only two ways, total contr=\r\nol, which very few can do or total\n&gt; gratification followed by terrific sad=\r\nhana.\n&gt; Here is where Tantra is superb, none of these so called gurus can m=\r\natch a\n&gt; true sadhaka of tantra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name j=\r\nust as\n&gt; sitting in a smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are a=\r\nfraid of\n&gt; Her in the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which bi=\r\nnds normal\n&gt; humans.\n&gt; Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhan=\r\na of a sexual nature.\n&gt; These are two separate things. Sadhana of this sort=\r\n tricks the mind in many\n&gt; ways already discussed before.\n&gt; I would suggest=\r\n that Shiva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind\n&gt; of control wh=\r\nich most people cannot imagine.\n&gt; First, you will stick to one partner for =\r\nthe sadhana, that is a kind of\n&gt; Brahmacharya in itself.\n&gt; Two, the sadhana=\r\n when it\n matures, will be so good that ordinary sex will be\n&gt; thrown out o=\r\nf the window.\n&gt; Three, a naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the=\r\n way it did when\n&gt; you first started.\n&gt; Four, the play of the deity within =\r\nyour respective bodies will give you\n&gt; knowledge which normal people do not=\r\n have.\n&gt; Five, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and=\r\n the\n&gt; deities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? The La=\r\nw of\n&gt; karma applies to everybody.\n&gt; Six, The bliss of not having to think =\r\nof sex will occur for many months on\n&gt; end.\n&gt; The aashirvaad given by the s=\r\nperm for not being killed (millions of such\n&gt; beings), is so tremendous tha=\r\nt the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies\n&gt; tremendously. Notice that i still =\r\nsay sadhaka, not &quot;Great exhalted Guru&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or all that rubbish.=\r\n\n&gt; As far as I am concerned, very few people are qualified\n enough to be a =\r\nGuru(\n&gt; I do not think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my ch=\r\nildren).\n&gt; True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost =\r\nimpossible\n&gt; to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do ever=\r\nything such a\n&gt; being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?\n&gt; And th=\r\ne punishment for Guru Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.\n&gt; Unfortun=\r\nately, sometimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/\n&gt; Guru comes to=\r\n their door, they foolishly direct that person elsewhere, such\n&gt; is the for=\r\nce of maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Love\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@yahoo. c=\r\nom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n &gt; =\r\n&gt; The argument involving Virya is not satisfying to me:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. This expla=\r\nnation is explaining predominantly from a male point of view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Accor=\r\nding the modern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or\n&gt; &gt; not, th=\r\ne Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why so much focus=\r\n or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the\n&gt; &gt; common argument is th=\r\nat we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our\n&gt; &gt; karma. But, why b=\r\nurn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way of\n&gt; &gt; burning kar=\r\nma seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the\n&gt; &gt; mind. =\r\nIn order to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need\n&gt; &gt; ener=\r\ngy. I trust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Is=\r\n not the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to\n&gt; &gt; anticipate/w=\r\nish for an experiance\n while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do\n&gt; &gt; sadhan=\r\na with out any anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nor even obtaining Moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is =\r\nto keep the mind in Brahman all the\n&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not resul=\r\nt in any more karma because, your mind is\n&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence=\r\n you do not identify yourself in your actions.\n&gt; &gt; You do them because you =\r\nhad to do them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoiding c=\r\nertain actions but, try\n&gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about God w=\r\nhile doing any/every thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in m=\r\ny child hood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the best dev=\r\notee as he keeps\n&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints =\r\nhim by\n naming some\n&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter u=\r\ntters the name of Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada protests=\r\n and then Vishnu gives him a\n&gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it=\r\n on his head and walk around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant G=\r\nod&#39;s name while you are doing sex.

The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have all kind=\r\ns of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force that can=\r\n be used to change or move something karmically.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose you see som=\r\nething or someone beautiful and the enemy of &quot;desire&quot; (one of shadripus - s=\r\nix internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuses y=\r\nou and the enemy of &quot;anger&quot; tries to attack your mind. How does your mind f=\r\night back?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as you need energy to fight external enemies, your m=\r\nind needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the=\r\n enemies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts=\r\n shakti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on=\r\n the mind is negated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you eat, you get physical energy.\n When y=\r\nou exercise, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body=\r\n. Similarly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it =\r\neats from the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends=\r\n time in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsan=\r\ng etc), it stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just =\r\nas physical energy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this sp=\r\niritual energy helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If y=\r\nour surrender is perfect and you are going through the good and bad fruits =\r\nof your karmas without committing new karmas, your point is right. You are =\r\nlike a weightless leaf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, =\r\nif you still have a conditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from sha=\r\ndripus and vulnerable to committing NEW karmas, don&#39;t you think some energy=\r\n is needed?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don&#39;t look at spiritual shakti as\n something that enable=\r\ns you to do great deeds in the world. Though that too is possible, that is =\r\na ego-promiting attitude and inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spir=\r\nitual shakti as something that enables you to fight back your own internal =\r\nenemies and overcome your own weaknesses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. If you are=\r\n living every second without any goals/agendas/ wishes/anticipat ions at al=\r\nl, then you are all already liberated and then your point is meaningful.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, if you do have some some goals, some wishes, some anticipations, =\r\nsome agendas etc, then you should realize that those wishes and anticipatio=\r\nns have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmically) and they bind you furth=\r\ner. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumulated through exertion of =\r\nself-control to negate that kinetic energy and stop you from getting bound =\r\nfurther.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people make the mistake of thinking that desire of mok=\r\nsha is also a desire and can stop you from\n moksha. That is true. However, =\r\nit is better than many other desires and definitely worth having. It can be=\r\n jettisoned when the time comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose you have a trash can in whi=\r\nch you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash and hang on to th=\r\ne trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new trash that comes in wi=\r\nll be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you keep collecting trash=\r\n and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can also, when you are =\r\nabsolutely sure that no trash is being generated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;N=\r\narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n-&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A rel=3D&quot;n=\r\nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;\n href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://Sara=\r\nswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 2010 11:=\r\n42:03 +0000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadhana&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; From: Manish Pandit &lt;&lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dmm.pandit%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;mm.p=\r\nandit@gmail. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofoll=\r\now&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dpvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@charter. net&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On Brahmach=\r\narya and\n virya:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In a ml of semen, there are millions of s=\r\nperm, most living beings with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; potential to form a jiva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Loo=\r\nk at them under a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; They swim really energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try =\r\nnot to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kill tadpoles normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be o=\r\nk to take God&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; name and kill them?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The point is t=\r\nhat those poor beings are destined for short life and death&lt;BR&gt;&gt; normall=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you realised this and stopped yourself by Brahmacharya, still=\r\n you would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have nightly emissions. Partly, rich food, partly lots o=\r\nf Kama related&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thoughts are responsible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever you think=\r\n of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conscious ef=\r\nfort and look at the thought, you will clearly see the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; copulation h=\r\nappening in your thought in the head.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That is problematic, but\n ess=\r\nentially it means that sex starts in the mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only. Control the min=\r\nd and things are generally fine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The other thing is the pr=\r\nostatic fluid itself, if you get a slight erection&lt;BR&gt;&gt; say after 20-30 =\r\ndays of strict Brahmacharya, you will notice that although&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there is=\r\n no emission of sperm, some prostatic fluid comes out (this is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fo=\r\nrm of Shukra-Acharya. ... prostatic fluid nourishes sperm and ....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;teaches&quot; it) This also represents a loss of shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Right=\r\n, so, how to stop it??&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and =\r\nkeep Bramhacharya for a few days,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someday you may be destined for a=\r\n fall from Brahmacharya, for example, if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some great looking heroine=\r\n comes to you and drops her clothes without asking,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how many of you=\r\n will be able to resist, keeping in mind that sexual imagery&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from f=\r\nilms may have already spoiled the mind. Most difficult...\n .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There =\r\nare only two ways, total control, which very few can do or total&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gr=\r\natification followed by terrific sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Here is where Tantra is s=\r\nuperb, none of these so called gurus can match a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; true sadhaka of ta=\r\nntra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name just as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sitting in a=\r\n smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are afraid of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her =\r\nin the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which binds normal&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; humans.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana o=\r\nf a sexual nature.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; These are two separate things. Sadhana of this s=\r\nort tricks the mind in many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ways already discussed before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nI would suggest that Shiva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; of control which most people cannot imagine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; First, you wil=\r\nl stick to one partner for the sadhana, that is a kind of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahmacha=\r\nrya in itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Two, the sadhana when it\n matures, will be so good t=\r\nhat ordinary sex will be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thrown out of the window.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Three, a=\r\n naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the way it did when&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n you first started.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Four, the play of the deity within your respect=\r\nive bodies will give you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledge which normal people do not have.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Five, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? =\r\nThe Law of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; karma applies to everybody.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Six, The bliss of no=\r\nt having to think of sex will occur for many months on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; end.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The aashirvaad given by the sperm for not being killed (millions of such&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; beings), is so tremendous that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; tremendously. Notice that i still say sadhaka, not &quot;Great exhalted =\r\nGuru&quot; or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or all that rubbish.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As far as I am con=\r\ncerned, very few people are qualified\n enough to be a Guru(&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do no=\r\nt think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my children).&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost impossibl=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do everyth=\r\ning such a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; And the punishment for Guru Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, sometimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Guru comes to their door, they foolishly direct that person elsewhe=\r\nre, such&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the force of maya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Love&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;&lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpvklnrao=\r\n%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;pvklnrao@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;\n &gt; &gt; The argument involving Virya is not satisfying to me:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 1. This explanation is explaining predominantly from a male point=\r\n of view&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. According the modern doctors, whether or not =\r\nyou do intentionally or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not, the Virya does not stay. It gets =\r\nsecreted any way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why so much focus or affinity for ac=\r\ncumulation of energy? Yes, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; common argument is that we need=\r\n to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karma. But, why bu=\r\nrn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bur=\r\nning karma seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind. In order to realise this and condition our mind, do we rea=\r\nlly need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; energy. I trust, what we need is the resolve and pers=\r\nistant effort.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Is not the goal is not to have a goal? =\r\nWe are advised not to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; anticipate/wish for an experiance\n while=\r\n doing sadhana. Once we manage to do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana with out any anti=\r\ncipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or even ob=\r\ntaining Moksha?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Br=\r\nahmacharya is to keep the mind in Brahman all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time, then o=\r\nur actions do not result in any more karma because, your mind is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; focusing on brahman and hence you do not identify yourself in your actio=\r\nns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You do them because you had to do them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoiding certain act=\r\nions but, try&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about God wh=\r\nile doing any/every thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds=\r\n me a story I read in my child hood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On=\r\nce Narada gets to proud that he is the best devotee as he keeps&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him by\n naming some=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters the =\r\nname of Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada protests =\r\nand then Vishnu gives him a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him t=\r\no put it on his head and walk around.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nf can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s name while you are doing sex. If&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; you can manage to decrease amount of joy you derise out of sex, the=\r\nn you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the correct path. Nigraha will come automatically=\r\n if you stop enjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOT=\r\nE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;/P&gt;\n\n    &lt;/DIV&gt;\n     \n\n
