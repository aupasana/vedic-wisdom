Fire will go away by itself after a while. If you use firewood and have a big fire, it may burn for a while. If you use dry coconut pieces and have a small fire, it will go away quite quickly.\n \nIt is a good idea to stay with fire until it goes off. But it is admissible to finish the ritual and leave the fire and take care of other things. But, in either case, let fire go off by itself.\n \nSuppose you call someone for lunch and serve a lot of food. Suppose the person is still eating. Do you remove food from him and push him out of your house? Of course not, for that would be quite rude. You give him enough time to eat the food. If you have less time and *have* to stop soon, you should factor that in when you call him for lunch and serve less food to start with.\n \nTreat fire as a real person (he IS) and have respect and love for him. He serves as a portal connecting you to gods and rishis. Depending on your vaasanas and connections, blessings of some deity or rishi can come to you through fire. Of course, this may not be perceptible to you, but those blessings may slowly transform you. No wonder several religions considered fire sacred and taught fire rituals in the past.\n \nLike I said earlier, it is the presence of a deity or a rishi *within you* that is concentrated in an idol or kalasha or fire or some other object when you imagine that deity or rishi in that idol or kalasha or fire or other object and pray. However, some layers within you are suppressed when you are sitting in front of a fire of decent size and your ability to concentrate a divine aspect within you into that fire is higher compared to when you are working with an idol.\n \nI have a special arrangement in my pooja room with a 2 ft x 2 ft fireplace that is open on all 4 sides and constructed like a homa kundam, with a chimney going up. But other people are doing in US and UK with simpler and more regular arrangements. I will let those people respond to your last question.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \n---- metllapalli &lt;metllapalli@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Devotees,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am new to homam and this group. I was reading the homam manual. Each and every detail has been explained with great clarity, but it doesn&#39;t mention as to how to turn off the fire after the homam&#39;s done. What&#39;s the ideal method of putting it off? \n&gt; Also I live in US, every room has a fire alarm and outside its very cold. Anyone living in US and doing havan. How do you manage any ideas would be of great help?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks all,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sudha\n\n\n"}}
