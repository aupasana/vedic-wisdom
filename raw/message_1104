I was also under the impression that you were\n&gt; refferring to coconut shell, which by and large is a no-no for\n&gt; homam&#39;s. It looks like you performed the entire homa with one copra\n&gt; only, and ghee, and the 2nd addition of 1/2 coconut for poornahuti.\n&gt; Does cow dung produce smoke?\n&gt;\n&gt; rgds\n&gt;\n&gt; shubha\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Many\n&gt; priests do wear shirts when performing homas in winter here, in\n&gt; Boston, USA.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Honestly, the clothes that we wrap around the body to hide the\n&gt; true body are not a major issue and have very little bearing on our\n&gt; sadhana. The layers of conditioning by various gunas that we wrap\n&gt; around our ego-consciousness to hide the true Self IS the major\n&gt; issue that blocks our spiritual progress. The former is a symbol and\n&gt; the latter is the real thing that matters. Shedding those layers\n&gt; surrounding the ego is far more important than removing shirt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Actually, though I live in cold climate, the room in which I\n&gt; recorded the video was comfortable enough and I could have done\n&gt; without the shirt. But I consciously chose to record it with a shirt\n&gt; on, in order to not send a wrong message to those living in cold\n&gt; climates and having to do homam in cold garages. Instead of sticking\n&gt; to unnecessarily strict rules and ending up not doing homam as\n&gt; often, I want people to relax rules that do not matter and do it as\n&gt; often as they can. I want to de-emphasize things that do not matter\n&gt; that much.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; World is going to go through interesting times and we need many\n&gt; serious sadhakas - those who may be wearing many clothes on the body\n&gt; but shed off as many layers as possible on their ego - doing homam\n&gt; on a regular basis.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I use more materials in my daily Chandi homam (because I use a\n&gt; bigger homa kundam for it) than I used in the video, but again that\n&gt; was a conscious choice. I did not want something elaborate. I wanted\n&gt; to demonstrate how a very simple homam can be performed quite easily\n&gt; with very few materials and a simple setup. Even a very simple\n&gt; procedure like this will make a big difference in the world, if a\n&gt; lot of people are doing this sincerely everyday.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;   From: Radhakrishnan Jambunatha\n&gt;&gt;   To: sivacharya@yahoogroups.com ; Narasimha P.V.R.\n&gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, February 03, 2009 10:17 PM\n&gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [sivacharya] Fw: Maha Ganapathi Homam Video (based\n&gt; on the manual)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         Dear Sri Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         r u living in a foreign country.

What is in Google Video\n&gt; is one file that is\n&gt;&gt;           20 min 28 min long (and 92 MB in size). It is\n&gt; downloadable to your computer\n&gt;&gt;           and you can play it using free software QuickTime. On\n&gt; YouTube, it is stored\n&gt;&gt;           as three parts and has a higher quality. You can play\n&gt; those three parts\n&gt;&gt;           directly from YouTube.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           If you go to the homam homepage (see below) and go to\n&gt; Maha Ganapathi Homam\n&gt;&gt;           page, you will see all related links right there.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           To limit the video size, we made everything bare\n&gt; minimum. The veda mantra\n&gt;&gt;           and beeja mantra are chanted 8 times each and Atharva\n&gt; seersham once. You can\n&gt;&gt;           of course use higher counts and do it longer.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Thanks to Ravi for his effort!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;           Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
