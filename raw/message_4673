All those objects of sight depend upon the seer. The p=\r\nurpose\nof all objects of sight is only to point to the seer. The purpose of=\r\n all\ncreation is verily to get at the creator.=E2=80=99\n\nSri Bhagavan clear=\r\nly concluded his explanation in favour of simultaneous\ncreation by saying: =\r\n=E2=80=98Without the seer, the seen, be they worlds or gods,\ncannot exist. =\r\nAll those objects of sight depend upon the seer.=E2=80=99\n\nThe debate revol=\r\nves around two Sanskrit terms, srishti-drishti vada and\ndrishti-srishti vad=\r\na. Srishti-drishti vada means the theory of gradual\ncreation, that is, the =\r\ntheory that God created the world and the soul.\n\nAccording to the theory of=\r\n parinama vada, Brahman does not appear as the\nworld and the soul, as a rop=\r\ne appears to be a snake, but undergoes a change\nand becomes them in the sam=\r\ne way that clay becomes a pot. This theory\nmaintains that Brahman has actua=\r\nlly (and not merely apparently) undergone\ntransformation and change. It als=\r\no maintains that the effects, namely, the\nworld and the soul, are as real a=\r\ns their cause, Brahman.\n\nDrishti-srishti vada means the theory of simultane=\r\nous creation, and is also\nknown as the theory of false appearance. Accordin=\r\ng to this theory, Brahman\nis the sole reality that never undergoes any chan=\r\nge, and the world, the soul\nand God are false appearances that rise into ex=\r\nistence simultaneously with\nthe seer. This theory maintains that all object=\r\ns depend for their apparent\nexistence upon the seer. Whereas in gradual cre=\r\nation, objects are seen\nbecause they have been created, in simultaneous cre=\r\nation, objects are\ncreated because they are seen.\n\nThe question of which cr=\r\neation theory is taught in Ulladu Narpadu has been\nanswered by Bhagavan him=\r\nself in verse 83 of the Garland of Guru=E2=80=99s Sayings.\n\nThrough the ven=\r\nba verse that begins, =E2=80=98Because we perceive the world...,=E2=80=99\nG=\r\nuru Ramana =E2=80=93 who teaches the one true beneficial attainment [jnana]=\r\n that is\nneeded by the people of the world =E2=80=93 declared, out of his l=\r\nove for us, the\ndoctrine of illusory appearance to be the truth that bestow=\r\ns the ultimate\nbenefit, avoiding the consideration of other doctrines.\n\nIn =\r\nthis verse Bhagavan states that since he wrote Ulladu Narpadu, it is\nunders=\r\ntood that he teaches only the doctrine of false appearance, or\nsimultaneous=\r\n creation, and that he has set aside all other theories. It\nshould also be =\r\nclear from reading the text of Ulladu Narpadu that Sri\nBhagavan is teaching=\r\n that the seer and the seen rise together.\n\nIn verse seven it states, =E2=\r\n=80=98Although the world and the mind rise and set\ntogether, it is by the m=\r\nind alone that the world shines=E2=80=99 and in verse\ntwenty-six it states,=\r\n =E2=80=98If the ego comes into existence, all else will come\ninto existenc=\r\ne. If the ego does not exist, all else will not exist.=E2=80=99\n\nAlthough B=\r\nhagavan taught the theory of simultaneous creation, this theory\nshould not =\r\nbe elevated to the status of an absolute truth. Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\nactu=\r\nal experience is ajata, which is a denial of all creation theories,\nsimulta=\r\nneous or otherwise, since it is the experience that neither the\nworld, the =\r\nsoul nor God has ever come into existence. Ajata is the final\nexperience, n=\r\not a theory that can be taught, for there is no room in this\nexperience for=\r\n such differences as a teacher and a person to be taught.\n\nBhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s teachings assume that we are aware that the world rises and sets\nwith =\r\nthe rising and setting of the seer. The first words of Ulladu Narpadu\nare =\r\n=E2=80=98Because we see the world=E2=80=99, and this assumption that we see=\r\n the world\nbecomes the basis for this teaching on creation. If he was inten=\r\nding to\nattempt to teach ajata, he would not have admitted the existence of=\r\n the\nworld at all, and if he had intended to teach gradual creation he woul=\r\nd have\nsaid, =E2=80=98Because the world is created=E2=80=99.\n\nAlthough Sri =\r\nBhagavan sometimes used to speak from the standpoint of gradual\ncreation wh=\r\nile replying to questioners, in his main works (for example, in\nWho am I?, =\r\nin verses 6, 7, 14, 23 and 26 of Ulladu Narpadu, and in verses 6\nand 7 of A=\r\nrunachala Ashtakam), he clearly teaches only the theory of\nsimultaneous cre=\r\nation. As he has explained in Self Enquiry in the answer to\nquestion 10, th=\r\ne theory of gradual creation is taught only for immature\naspirants, while t=\r\nhe theory of simultaneous creation is taught to mature\naspirants. The same =\r\nidea is expressed by him in Day by Day (15th March 1946)\nand in Talks no. 6=\r\n51 where he concludes: =E2=80=98But the true seeker can be content\nwith yug=\r\napat srishti, instantaneous creation.=E2=80=99\n\nThe Ulladu Narpadu selectio=\r\nn has been translated by Robert Butler, while the\ntwo Arunachala Ashtakam v=\r\nerses have been taken from Sri Arunachala Stuti\nPanchakam, Sadhu Om and Mic=\r\nhael James=E2=80=99 translation of and commentary on\nBhagavan&#39;s Arunachala =\r\npoems:\n\n6\n\nThe world is of the form of the five senses. It is nothing other=\r\n. Those five\nsenses are perceived through the five organs of sense. Since t=\r\nhe mind alone\nperceives the world through the medium of the senses, can the=\r\nre be a world\napart from the mind? Speak!\n\n7\n\nAlthough the world and the mi=\r\nnd arise and subside together, it is through\nthe mind that the world shines=\r\n forth. That which is the perfection that\nshines without appearing or disap=\r\npearing, as the place where both the world\nand the mind appear and disappea=\r\nr, is the Real.\n\n14\n\nIf the first person [I] exists, the second and third p=\r\nersons [you, he, she,\nit and they] will also be in existence. But if, upon =\r\none=E2=80=99s investigation\ninto the reality of its nature, the first perso=\r\nn is destroyed, the second\nand third persons will also cease to be, and one=\r\n&#39;s own nature, shining\nalone, will be verily the state of the Self.\n\n23\n\nTh=\r\nis body does not say =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. And no one says =E2=80=98When I a=\r\nm asleep I do not\nexist=E2=80=99. After the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 arises, all=\r\n else arises. Investigate with a keen mind\nwhence this =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =\r\narises.\n\n26\n\nIf the ego arises, all else will arise. If the ego is not, not=\r\nhing else will\nexist. The ego, truly, is all. Know that simply to enquire w=\r\nhat it is, is to\nrenounce everything.\n\nArunachala Ashtakam 6\n\nYou, the Hear=\r\nt, the light of consciousness, the one reality, alone exist! A\nwonderful sa=\r\nkti exists in You as not other [than You]. From [it a] series of\nsubtle sha=\r\ndowy thoughts [rise and] by means of [the reflected light of]\nconsciousness=\r\n in the whirl of prarabdha are [simultaneously] seen [as]\nshadowy world pic=\r\ntures, both inside [on] the mirror of the thought-light and\noutside through=\r\n the [five] senses such as the eyes, just like a cinema\npicture which exist=\r\ns [by being projected] through a lens. O Hill of Grace,\nwhether they [the w=\r\norld pictures] stop [appearing], or whether they continue\n[to appear], they=\r\n do not exist apart from You.\n\n7\n\nIf the thought =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 does n=\r\not exist, no other thing will exist.

[Then, by scrutinising] what is the rising place of =E2=80=98I=\r\n=E2=80=99, merge [within]. Diving within [in this manner], if one reaches t=\r\nhe Heart-throne [one will become] verily the Sovereign under the shade of o=\r\nne umbrella. [There] the dream known as =E2=80=98inside and outside=E2=80=\r\n=99, the two karmas, death and birth, pleasure and pain, and darkness and l=\r\night, will not exist, and the limitless ocean of the light of grace, called=\r\n Aruna Hill, which dances motionlessly in the court of the Heart, alone [wi=\r\nll exist].=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2010/02/bhagavans-let=\r\nter-to-ganapati-muni.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blo=\r\ngspot.com/2010/02/bhagavans-letter-to-ganapati-muni.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;c=\r\nlear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:=\r\n0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);fo=\r\nnt-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-lef=\r\nt:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000feaf109ab808cda048ba1270b--\r\n\n"}}
