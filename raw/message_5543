I suggest Sri.Narasimha forward thi=\r\ns for opinion of &quot;Heads of Departments of Sanskrit&quot; in India or elsewhere i=\r\nncluding the universities on the East coast.\n\nthe word lakShmI is an exampl=\r\ne of an exception to general pattern of declensions of i I ending words. Si=\r\nr Monier Wiliams has made a special note of this i. These are according to =\r\nthe rules of pANiNI&#39;s ashThadhyAyI and has been mentioned in Whitney too.\n\n=\r\nSanskrit words have generically \n(a) a general pattern (according to pAniNi=\r\nya rules)\n(b)exceptions for some specific words (these too are recorded by =\r\npANiNI\n(c) exceptions in veda mantra for certain words (these too are recor=\r\nded by pANiNI - and other grammarians including shri vopadeva, sayana, halA=\r\nyudha etc. \n\nnevertheless the dhAtu is &quot;lakSh&quot; that has meaning aim and obj=\r\nective - It is possible that shri - Narasimha has not considered the except=\r\nions - And perhaps he may like to recall these from memory in childhood or =\r\nlook up proper references.\n\n124.
