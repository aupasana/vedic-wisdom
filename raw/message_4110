If the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is to rule a big kingdom=\r\n, you cannot escape and do penances in a forest. But you can either rule th=\r\ne kingdom with a proud and attached mind or with a calm mind. If the role g=\r\niven to you (e.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a mighty king (Shivaji=\r\n) in resisting the invading muslim kings, you cannot escape it.

Even as we engage in actions that we believe to be our =\r\ndharma, we should work on our attitude and increase surrender. When one has=\r\n surrendered to god and is able to look at pleasure and pain, praise and ce=\r\nnsure in the same way, then one&#39;s dharma will be far clearer to one. One wh=\r\nose mind is densely conditioned by duality and desires will see one&#39;s dharm=\r\na through the coloring of that conditioning and may misjudge.

One may identify with body, with a group of people, with a =\r\ndeity etc. As is the identification, so is the conditioning and so is one&#39;s=\r\n vision of one&#39;s dharma.\n\n \n\nThough everyone is playing their allotted role=\r\n, some have densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearl=\r\ny and pursuing adharma.

Dharma depends=\r\n on the desh-kaal-patra. Swami Ramdas - an amsa of Hanuman - inspired Shiva=\r\nji Maharaj to fight against the Moghuls. Had it not been so, today Kashi wo=\r\nuld have remained Muhammadabad and Mathura and Prayag would have become Mec=\r\nca and Medina.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; However at the same time I am sure there=\r\n were probably other self-realized saints in India who never bothered thems=\r\nelves with the political situation of the land. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So eve=\r\nryone to his/her path. If you feel a strong urge for something, probably yo=\r\nur swa-dharma crosses through those points.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regards&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 1/4/10, krishna Kanth &lt;=\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:kritels%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dkritels%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;kritels@yahoo. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hi.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Why is he interfering in=\r\n all these instead of keeping quiet?=E2=80=99&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Many a t=\r\nimes even i think why all these spiritual men like Kanchi Kamakoti Peetadhi=\r\npathi has to talk about the ongoing Political crisis and land into controve=\r\nrsies.

What m=\r\nore is there for us to do?

The next day=\r\n there will be people to criticise it. Our business is to keep quiet. If we=\r\n enter into all these, people will naturally ask, and justifiably, =E2=80=\r\n=98Why is he interfering in all these instead of keeping quiet?=E2=80=99 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Similarly if Mahatma Gandhi keeps quiet leaving aside all=\r\n his activities,they will ask, =E2=80=98Why is he keeping quiet instead of =\r\nengaging in all these activities?=E2=80=99 He must do what he has come for.=\r\n We must do what we have come for.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Source: DAY =\r\nBY DAY WITH BHAGAVAN From the Diary of A.
