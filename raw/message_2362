In certain paths of sadhana (Matangi worship, for example), woman\nis at her most auspicious when she is menstruating. So to compare this state\nto a person being smelly or sweaty is, I think, a mischaracterization.\n\nYes, there are elements of ritual impurity. But it is also true that the\ntime of menstruation is a time ofi inner purification and cleansing (on a\nphysicial and spiritual level) for women that men (unfortunately for them)\ndo not have access to. In a way, external sadhana is required for men to\nobtain the fruits of the automatic purification women attain through\nmenstruation.\n\nThat is another reason why women are advised to take complete rest during\ntheir menses--not that they&#39;re going to contaminate everything around them,\nbut the process of cleansing going on within is a subtle and sensitive\nprocess that is optimized when a woman can fully rest.\n\nAlso, a woman&#39;s work never ends, so this practice is a way of ensuring women\nget their much needed rest, including rest from sadhana.\n\nI just wanted to add this, because I think sometimes women get the wrong\nimpression that they are somehow debased or otherwise inauspicious during\ntheir time of menstruation and therefore kept away fromthe privilege of\ndoing worship. But that is a very crude view and I think the more nuanced\nunderstanding that our ancient rishis (and yoginis) had was that this is a\nspecial time for women when external sadhana is not required since internal\ncleansing is going on and a time when her energies and kundalini are\nnaturally sensitized and heightened, so special care should be taken.\n\nAlso, there is no restriction on doing manasika japa (without moving the\nlips) for a woman during this time.\n\nOn Fri, Aug 28, 2009 at 10:29 AM, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear narayana,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for this knowledge.
