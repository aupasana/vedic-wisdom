But Ayurveda excels at preventative medicine, and is als=\r\no pretty good in treatment of many non-acute chronic conditions.\n\nUnfortuna=\r\ntely there is very little emphasis on the science of eating in allopathic m=\r\nedicine- something that has always surprised me. I&#39;ve educated myself on th=\r\ne basics of Ayurveda and have some understanding of the importance of the d=\r\nigestive agni, the doshas, and the influence of different foods on the body=\r\n and mind. I&#39;ve had a few ayurvedic treatments myself, and intend to study =\r\nthis subject further once I&#39;ve completed my allopathic medical training.\n\nI=\r\nn the West (and certainly among Allopathic doctors, although Ayurveda is gr=\r\nadually attracting interest, it is not yet as widely accepted as Acupunctur=\r\ne (the efficacy of which has apparantly been proved by various studies). So=\r\n I can&#39;t really advice my patients to take Triphala or consult an Ayurvedic=\r\n doctor, much as I would like to- I&#39;m simply not allowed to as Ayurveda is =\r\nnot yet &quot;evidence-based medicine&quot;. I&#39;m sure the time will come when studies=\r\n will prove the efficacy of Ayurvedic remedies and this science will become=\r\n more mainstream. In the meantime, what I can do, is emphasise some Ayurved=\r\nic principles to my patients- such as the importance of regular meal times,=\r\n freshly prepared food, and adequate sleep. I&#39;m sure this would prevent a l=\r\not of diseases from developing the first place. \n\nThanks for the advice, it=\r\n is much appreciated. \n\nOm Dum Durgayai Namaha\n\nAparna \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  STEP in overcoming=\r\n one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analog=\r\ny. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  body-=\r\nmind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the pala=\r\nce over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occa=\r\nsionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for=\r\n out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In f=\r\nact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothin=\r\ng in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization with=\r\nout any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasi=\r\nshtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get=\r\n something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One=\r\n may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have p=\r\nut enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be un=\r\nprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (beca=\r\nuse of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want L=\r\nATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one ma=\r\ny pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sic=\r\nk man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for h=\r\nealth. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any kn=\r\nowledge or money. In another \n&gt; &gt;&gt; case, one may deeply desire to act in a =\r\nfamous film. One may be reborn \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in a famou=\r\ns film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; experience. Basically, people keep =\r\ngoing in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are=\r\n &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one d=\r\neeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one=\r\n&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be bo=\r\nrn in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is=\r\n enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, =\r\nif one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap.

If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the bo=\r\ndy&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awar=\r\neness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a=\r\n great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep d=\r\nesire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a r=\r\ne-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awarenes=\r\ns (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. T=\r\nhe person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and g=\r\net stuck badly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with=\r\n undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions=\r\n heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recomme=\r\nnd is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, ove=\r\nrcome your\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I=\r\n want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/thin=\r\ngs/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It i=\r\ns a negative attachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to=\r\n resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progre=\r\nss. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. W=\r\nhen you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wil=\r\nl automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to=\r\n a personal deity.

Though people may be offended by my=\r\n words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I =\r\nwill pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise,=\r\n I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business de=\r\nal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has =\r\nno place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is l=\r\nosing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrende=\r\nr is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or=\r\n highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrend=\r\ner is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (=\r\nand during) Death.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and w=\r\nith many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may st=\r\nill be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does=\r\n not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or end=\r\nangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above=\r\n, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s condition=\r\ning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  protection! God&#39;s protection may =\r\nseem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through=\r\n the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realiz=\r\ne that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while =\r\nyou have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anyti=\r\nme. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desire=\r\ns, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self=\r\n. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kun=\r\ndalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spiritua=\r\nlity Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n From: Leela Sastry \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to=\r\n stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the s=\r\no called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow the oth=\r\ner entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the=C2=A0 p=\r\nsyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all =\r\nthe other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Cons=\r\ntant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human=\r\n mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment=\r\n, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc=\r\n etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now=\r\n self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more i=\r\nntense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good =\r\nguru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it c=\r\nan also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, som=\r\ne of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and gi=\r\nven half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They tak=\r\ne hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the =\r\nsame. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  vital. 4 - While =\r\nsomeday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti =\r\nawekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this=\r\n. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffici=\r\nent to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aur=\r\na of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and he=\r\nlps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various =\r\nreasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can al=\r\nlow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances o=\r\nf causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possi=\r\nblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, =\r\neven if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right kno=\r\nwledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often d=\r\noing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n&gt;  work.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  Sometimes it wil=\r\nl have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting p=\r\noint is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - M=\r\nens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto ma=\r\nmAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 Feb=\r\nruary 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kun=\r\ndalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am do=\r\ning a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of some=\r\none who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundali=\r\nni since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of=\r\n energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kun=\r\ndalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We h=\r\nave not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests nor=\r\nmal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we=\r\n call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unw=\r\nanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and rese=\r\narch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients=\r\n are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments =\r\nfor deranged\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to f=\r\norcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feel=\r\ning that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill=\r\n herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad.=\r\n She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from.=\r\n I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one wa=\r\ns to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve t=\r\nhe suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength t=\r\no bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her,=\r\n and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really =\r\nis pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in th=\r\nis situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest.=\r\n It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kund=\r\nalini\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s will.
