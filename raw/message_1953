The subtler the level, the longer =\r\nthe signal can carry without decaying.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIf one=\r\n has some shakti accumulated with a specific mantra, one&#39;s chanting of that=\r\n mantra is infused with that shakti.\n=C2=A0\nThe energy infused when one cha=\r\nnts a mantra is carried mainly in the subtler levels of sound. The energy c=\r\narried at the physical level (vaikhari) of sound is very small compared to =\r\nthe energy carried in the subtler levels. However, the vaikhari level sound=\r\n contains the key to the subtler levels for most people.\n=C2=A0\nI can expla=\r\nin this using an analogy. One may have a powerful concept or idea in mind t=\r\nhat one is thinking of. Most other people cannot read one&#39;s mind and cannot=\r\n access that concept or idea. However, if one expresses the idea in words, =\r\npeople will be able to access that idea. Most of the power is in the idea a=\r\nnd not in the exact words used. However, the written/spoken words that are =\r\ntangible to others act as a key to one&#39;s thoughts. World can now access the=\r\n power of one&#39;s idea!\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, the exact letters or words of a man=\r\ntra are not really alive with energy. But, when one does sadhana with the m=\r\nantra, one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is infused with some power. Other peopl=\r\ne cannot access that power normally. But, once one says the mantra in an au=\r\ndible form (just like expressing the idea in tangible words above), the pow=\r\ner in one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even=\r\n though the power is not really in the audible sound produced, the audible =\r\nsound acts as a key to the inaudible sound and world can now access the pow=\r\ner of one&#39;s chanting (just as the written words act as a key to one&#39;s idea =\r\nand the world can now access the power of one&#39;s idea).\n=C2=A0\nWhen you chan=\r\nt a mantra silently, you are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the wo=\r\nrld. When you chant a mantra loud, you are sharing your shakti with the man=\r\ntra with the world. Some of it can be wasted and some of it can be tapped b=\r\ny someone.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIf leaves, flowers and fruits are p=\r\nlucked from a small plant, it will not grow and it will die. Similarly, one=\r\n&#39;s shakti with a mantra will not grow if one keeps saying that mantra loud =\r\nnow and then. As one keeps chanting a mantra silently, while maintaining so=\r\nme yama and niyama, one will slowly accumulate shakti with it.\n=C2=A0\nIf yo=\r\nu do not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra, that is fine too.. Th=\r\nat is NOT an impediment to self-purification and self-realization. However,=\r\n certain tasks in this dual world require an accumulation of enough shakti =\r\nwith a mantra. If one&#39;s guru wants one to do something in future and asks o=\r\nne to accumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one has to do it.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nManish&#39;s guru was a realized man. His name was Nakhat=\r\ne Maharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed by a darshan of=\r\n Bhadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of 21 years. He r=\r\nemained in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the dual world to =\r\nperform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.\n=C2=A0\nEven a reali=\r\nzed man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example, when he g=\r\nave a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite old-fashi=\r\noned. He did not say the mantra in Manish&#39;s ear. Instead, he asked Manish t=\r\no sit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish&#39;s temples. He a=\r\nsked Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantra in Devan=\r\nagari script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw and did sad=\r\nhana with that mantra.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThese methods are used =\r\nfor a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are two main reasons:\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n(1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated with that mantra, becau=\r\nse there is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but giving indiscriminately =\r\nis unwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to optimize what one does.=\r\n\n(2) Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If one gets a million bucks easily,=\r\n one can waste it. Instead of giving million dollars to someone, it will be=\r\n better if you teach one how to work hard and make money.\n=C2=A0\nSharing va=\r\nrious thoughts and spiritual truths and inspiring people to do sadhana=C2=\r\n=A0is one thing and sharing one&#39;s accumulated shakti with a mantra with peo=\r\nple another.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAs I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, =\r\nI want to mention a small story about him.\n=C2=A0\nWhen Nakhate Maharaj left=\r\n this world, his sishyas had an interesting experience. Manish was in UK me=\r\nditating at that time. He suddenly felt that his guru was in front of him. =\r\nHe opened his eyes and saw that Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of hi=\r\nm physically. He held his palm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his h=\r\nand as if saying good bye. Then he disappeared. When Manish called India la=\r\nter, he found out that Nakhate Maharaj left his body at the same time in In=\r\ndia. He also found out that his other sishyas too had the same experience i=\r\nn different parts of the world around the same time.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nN=\r\narasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Jyotisa Shisya \n=\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nSent: Sunday, June 07, 2009 10:45 AM\nSu=\r\nbject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Help me Regarding SAVITRU GAAYATHRI MANTHRAM\n=\r\n\n|om|\nDear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams\n=C2=A0\nPlease forgive me if I am s=\r\neen to be impertinent in my question based on the lines in bold below.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nWhy must the Guru upadesa be kept secret and not shared with anyone who=\r\n might benefit?

Surrender to your chosen deity, see that deity in all peo=\r\nple and serve people around you. See god in all people. If possible, think =\r\nof starting a small movement in the slums of Chennai (or wherever you live)=\r\n. Go, serve people there, help them to the best of your ability and teach t=\r\nhem about god.
