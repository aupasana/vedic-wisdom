Such blanket statements are in=\r\ncorrect\n&gt; &gt; and gloss over nuances and create a totally wrong picture.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nWhat I said is not a &quot;blanket statement&quot;, but an explicit teaching of\n&gt; Vas=\r\nishtha to Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is also absolutely consistent with\n&gt;=\r\n Upanishadic learning.\n&gt;\n&gt; You talk about taking the words of a great inste=\r\nad of speculating. In fact,\n&gt; did Vimalananda *explicitly* write that Ramak=\r\nrishna is only a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot;\n&gt; and not a siddha or a natha or a rishi, th=\r\nat Vivekananda is not a rishi or\n&gt; natha or siddha or paramahamsa, and so o=\r\nn? In my case, my statement above is\n&gt; explicitly and unambiguously stated =\r\nby Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda&#39;s\n&gt; question &quot;will siddhis help me i=\r\nn god realization&quot; in the negative,\n&gt; Ramakrishna also affirmed this teachi=\r\nng of Vasishtha. Krishna also\n&gt; essentially refers to the same thing in Bha=\r\ngavad Gita when he talks about\n&gt; seeking small things from demigods vs seek=\r\ning &quot;me&quot; (Self). Vaishtha&#39;s words,\n&gt; however, are the clearest and most una=\r\nmbiguous.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yoga Vaasishtham was taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the =\r\npresence of\n&gt; Vishwamitra and other great sages and recorded by Valmiki. It=\r\n is the highest\n&gt; watermark of spiritual knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; Aghora series is ni=\r\nce, but can give wrong notions to some who may tend to\n&gt; be fascinated by e=\r\nxternal miracles. I have no doubt that Vimalananda had no\n&gt; confusions hims=\r\nelf, but some people reading those books can form\n&gt; misconceptions (though =\r\nit is still ok if that makes them do sadhana. The\n&gt; only problem is if they=\r\n start doing the bad karma of making negative\n&gt; judgments on greats thinkin=\r\ng they are blindly following Vimalananda). It is\n&gt; a good idea to balance t=\r\nhe perspective with some Vedantic understanding such\n&gt; as Yoga Vasishtham o=\r\nr Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Infact it also violates a point which you yourself m=\r\nade in an earlier\n&gt; mail. The\n&gt; &gt; external is connected to the internal. So=\r\nme siddhis are not possible\n&gt; unless one\n&gt; &gt; attains a very rarified level =\r\nof realization. And they manifest\n&gt; externally.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, some external sidd=\r\nhis are possible only at a very rarefied level of\n&gt; realization. But some w=\r\nith the same or higher level of realization may not\n&gt; possess the same exte=\r\nrnal siddhi. Thus external miracles cannot be used as\n&gt; measures of one&#39;s l=\r\nevel.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is like the analogy I gave of collecting fruits from the tre=\r\nes on the\n&gt; side of the road to the hilltop. Some keep tavelling on the roa=\r\nd and accept\n&gt; only those fruits that land in their lap by themselves. Some=\r\n get distracted\n&gt; from the journey and pursue the fruits actively. Collecti=\r\nng fruits is\n&gt; neither necessary nor sufficient for reaching the top. Thoug=\r\nh having a fruit\n&gt; that is available only at a very high altitude shows tha=\r\nt one has reached\n&gt; great altitude, it cannot be used as a measure of one&#39;s=\r\n progress, for\n&gt; someone may have climbed greater heights without collectin=\r\ng that (or any)\n&gt; fruit.\n&gt;\n&gt; External and internal do NOT have a one-to-one=\r\n correspondence. Just as you\n&gt; cannot tell what is inside a house by lookin=\r\ng at it from outside, so cannot\n&gt; you tell one&#39;s state of mind from looking=\r\n at one. One&#39;s spiritual maturity\n&gt; and attainment is in one&#39;s state of min=\r\nd.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a loved and revered spiritual figure is=\r\n percieved to be questioned,\n&gt; &gt; naturally a reaction is expected. I am not=\r\n surprised.\n&gt;\n&gt; When you said a while back, for example, that Vivekananda u=\r\nsed to\n&gt; contradict himself, I agreed. The issue is not just &quot;questioning&quot; =\r\na &quot;loved\n&gt; and revered spiritual figure&quot;. The issue is passing off what I s=\r\nee as\n&gt; needless, unjustified and baseless judgments, driven by misconcepti=\r\nons and a\n&gt; fascination for the external.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt;      Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org=\r\n/&gt;\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyot=\r\nish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;              =\r\n        Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Wed, Aug 3, 2011 at 4:22 AM, rajarshi nan=\r\ndy wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Hopefully, this will be my last mail on t=\r\nhis topic, since I see that I am\n&gt; merely reiterating myself.

I too was thinking of the exact same example. Good you\n&gt; mentioned. And=\r\n as I see it, this is similar to the analysis I was mentioning\n&gt; about &quot;ams=\r\nas&quot; - projections of Higher Divine beings. Fits the bill\n&gt; perfectly! Yes t=\r\nhat is why they were Nitya Siddhas.\n&gt;\n&gt; I see Siddhis in other beings as a =\r\nthermometer. It can be used to make some\n&gt; assessments. You too mentioned t=\r\nhe same in one of your mails. I respect all\n&gt; self-realized beings, but bas=\r\ned on mental tendencies I am drawn more towards\n&gt; some than others. Just li=\r\nke any other person, including you.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;You, on the other hand, are regar=\r\nding him as a &quot;paramahamsa&quot;, who\n&gt; according to you is &quot;lower&quot; than &quot;siddha=\r\ns, nathas and rishis&quot;.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I cannot, have not and will not comment on Ram=\r\nakrishna. He was, as per his\n&gt; words an Avatar too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Otherwise, as per V=\r\nimalananada&#39;s, the hirerchy is well defined. But what is\n&gt; also important i=\r\ns to remember great beings send their amsa for specific\n&gt; works, which is f=\r\nar more important. So one not needing to achieve a certain\n&gt; state, may not=\r\n do so.\n&gt;\n&gt; To get a better understanding, why don&#39;t we get some inputs fro=\r\nm someone\n&gt; who maybe more spiritually qualified to pass a judgement on the=\r\nse things,\n&gt; whether a Paramahamsa is same as a Siddha or a Nath or a Muni =\r\nor a Rishi\n&gt; instead of speculation? Your word vs my word will not settle t=\r\nhis.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; And you believe that you are a good yogi&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You assume muc=\r\nh. Mind reading, Sir, is not everyone&#39;s forte -:).

Mine is different. I don&#39;t know for sur=\r\ne if a\n&gt; person who merely reads can understand nuances or not, but I know =\r\nfor sure a\n&gt; person who does not want to understand will definitely never g=\r\nrasp a nuance!\n&gt; Conditionings of knowledge/percieved understanding of a si=\r\ntuation etc\n&gt; influences our thinking process.

I am not surprised.\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;Siddhis are not a me=\r\nasure of one&#39;s spiritual progress and neither\n&gt; necessary nor sufficient fo=\r\nr liberation.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; They maybe, or they may-not be.

Because t=\r\nhey did not mention &quot;I did so and so&quot; using\n&gt; the same terminology used by =\r\nVimalananda? Or because they did not show the\n&gt; same kind of external siddh=\r\nis that impressed you in Vimalananda (like\n&gt; sucking mercury in vajroli and=\r\n bring it out from hair)? *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *How do you suppose you can reliably c=\r\nonclude when someone has &quot;attained\n&gt; the specific stages&quot;?

He gave t=\r\nhe analogy of a bird that lays eggs at a\n&gt; very high altitude. While the eg=\r\ng is still falling, it hatches, bird comes\n&gt; out and starts flying right aw=\r\nay. He said these Nithya Siddhas (like\n&gt; Vivekananda) are like that, ever f=\r\nree and never deluded by maya. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *THAT, my friend, is a great sidd=\r\nhi too. Siddhis are defined relative to\n&gt; maya and isn&#39;t it a siddhi to be =\r\nuntouched maya? People who are so focused\n&gt; on the external seek to see sid=\r\ndhis in external things only and forget that\n&gt; the biggest siddhi one can g=\r\net is internal! *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **        *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *&gt; Added to this=\r\n the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; discipl=\r\nes of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special *\n&gt; *&gt; spiritua=\r\nl being, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Wel=\r\nl, they not only regarded him as &quot;higher than them&quot;, but they also\n&gt; regard=\r\ned him as the highest. They regarded him as the Supreme Being himself.\n&gt; Yo=\r\nu, on the other hand, are regarding him as a &quot;paramahamsa&quot;, who according\n&gt;=\r\n to you is &quot;lower&quot; than &quot;siddhas, nathas and rishis&quot;. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **        =\r\n*        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *&gt; I am merely quoting and putting together the analy=\r\nsis, statements of *\n&gt; *&gt; spiritually great people. It is not as complex as=\r\n you think! *\n&gt; *&gt; Saying that A is fatter than B, based one statements and=\r\n quotes from\n&gt; people who *\n&gt; *&gt; maybe in the know of things, is hardly a j=\r\nudgement. It could very well\n&gt; be a fact. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Fatness is external a=\r\nnd judgable. Internal things (e.g. A is happier than\n&gt; B) cannot be judged =\r\nthe same way. Same with spiritual attainment\n&gt; (siddhi=3Dattainment). It is=\r\n internal and not observable externally. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *&gt; For an ordinary man,=\r\n all saints maybe equally elevated. For Yogis,\n&gt; there maybe *\n&gt; *&gt; subtle =\r\ndifferences and depths. The truth lies in the nuances. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *And you =\r\nbelieve that you are a good yogi who has mastered the subtle\n&gt; differences =\r\nand depths and nuances, to judge greats? Don&#39;t tell me you are\n&gt; blindly fo=\r\nllowing a great yogi and so you must be correct. &quot;Nuances&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;subtletie=\r\ns&quot; cannot be grasped by one who merely reads and quotes!! *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **    =\r\n    *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Your whole premise is based on mixing up terms w=\r\nhich may be used by\n&gt; different people in a different sense (e.g. Paramaham=\r\nsa =3D highest soul) and\n&gt; using external factors to judge one&#39;s spiritual =\r\ncaliber. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *My two main messages: *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *(1) One need not pur=\r\nsue siddhis. Siddhis are not a measure of one&#39;s\n&gt; spiritual progress and ne=\r\nither necessary nor sufficient for liberation. *\n&gt; *(2) It is unwise to pas=\r\ns judgments on yogis like Vivekananda. Ramakrishna\n&gt; never tolerated anyone=\r\n speaking anything slightly critical of Vivekananda as\n&gt; he regarded Viveka=\r\nnanda as Narayana himself.

Can you tell me where this falls on\n&gt; Vimalanand=\r\na&#39;s scale? What do you think &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (nithya=3Deternal)\n&gt; means? Is=\r\n it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greater or in between? If six\n&gt; disciples =\r\nwere &quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; as you say, can\n&gt; he be =\r\na &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than them?&gt;&gt; *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Simple! =\r\nRamakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came down.\n&gt; An amsa=\r\n is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of the Rishi&#39;s\n&gt; consciou=\r\nsness that comes down for a secific purpose and once the purpose is\n&gt; serve=\r\nd, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore,\n&gt; v=\r\nery technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of=\r\n\n&gt; a Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis =\r\netc\n&gt; are projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is kept is ingorance=\r\n of\n&gt; their real being (Rishi) such that the play can go on (not my words,\n=\r\n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s words). They are Nitya-siddha because even if they take bir=\r\nth\n&gt; over and over, being parts of extremely higher beings, these\n&gt; emanati=\r\nons/projections/amsas will surely eventually go back to the source\n&gt; when t=\r\nhe work is done. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *However, in their forms as specific individual=\r\ns like Vivekananda, whether\n&gt; these amsa attain the specific stages which m=\r\nakes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi\n&gt; will determine if they are to be called so.=\r\n They may not need to do so since\n&gt; they are here for a purpose. But, the o=\r\nnly way a person can be called a\n&gt; siddha in true sense is when he, as Vima=\r\nlananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;,\n&gt; (some specific shaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and =\r\nmoves closer to the Centre and yet\n&gt; not merging into it, deeper and deeper=\r\n.  *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *There is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a cert=\r\nain sadhaka\n&gt; (his disciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to stay i=\r\nn the\n&gt; Swargadwara smashana and later someone build a small ashram for him=\r\n.\n&gt; Totapuri&#39;s ashram still exists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri =\r\nalso\n&gt; mentions a similar ideas of what is a siddha and higher. And how onl=\r\ny a\n&gt; Siddha and none less is a true Vigyani. He further mentions that Swam=\r\ni\n&gt; Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the stage of a Siddha. His work was=\r\n\n&gt; specific, he did the work and went off. He did not need to and therefore=\r\n did\n&gt; not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Added to=\r\n this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the\n&gt; disciples=\r\n of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual\n&gt; being=\r\n, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *&lt;&lt;It is no=\r\nt necessary that there is a clear order of greatness. Infinity\n&gt; is neither=\r\n greater than nor less than nor equal to infinity.&gt;. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *This is wh=\r\nat I call approximation. For an ordinary man, all saints maybe\n&gt; equally el=\r\nevated. For Yogis, there maybe subtle differences and depths. The\n&gt; truth l=\r\nies in the nuances. Anyway, Vivekananda&#39;s own words are more reliable\n&gt; for=\r\n me than yours on this matter. And my previous explanation actually\n&gt; clari=\r\nfies this statement of Sri Ramakrishna that Vivekananda was the\n&gt; &quot;ancient =\r\nRishis Nara&quot; who came down for the good of mankind. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *&lt;&lt;Wise men =\r\ntread cautiously and do not rush to judgment on others.&gt;&gt; *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *I am =\r\nmerely quoting and putting together the analysis, statements of\n&gt; spiritual=\r\nly great people. It is not as complex as you think! Saying that A\n&gt; is fatt=\r\ner than B, based one statements and quotes from people who maybe in\n&gt; the k=\r\nnow of things, is hardly a judgement.

This is a delicate area where many\n&gt; have misconceptions and I will try =\r\nto address them. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **        *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Maharshi Vasis=\r\nhtha&#39;s teaching to Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham.\n&gt; The goal of ex=\r\nistence and sadhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be\n&gt; neither specif=\r\nically sought nor specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self.\n&gt; If Nature gi=\r\nves one some siddhi(s), one should accept them with neither\n&gt; excitement no=\r\nr disappointment. But one should NOT run after them, for they\n&gt; are neither=\r\n necessary nor sufficient for self-realization and liberation.\n&gt; *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt;=\r\n *Vivekananda used the same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give\n&gt; =\r\nhis siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to=\r\n\n&gt; realize god. Ramakrishna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer\n=\r\n&gt; then! Of course, when Ramakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted the=\r\nm.\n&gt; Vivekananda&#39;s two actions demonstrate Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. *=\r\n\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **        *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Let us use the analogy of climbi=\r\nng a hill. Climbing hill is one&#39;s\n&gt; spiritual sadhana. Reaching the top is =\r\nliberation. Different people climb\n&gt; the hill from different sides and usin=\r\ng different paths. There may be trees\n&gt; with nice fruits on the sides of th=\r\ne road. They are siddhis or special\n&gt; abilities. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *If one gets di=\r\nstracted, starts climbing the trees and collecting fruits,\n&gt; one&#39;s journey =\r\ngets delayed and one may not reach the top. That is why\n&gt; Vasishtha says a =\r\nseeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *But if some fruits =\r\nfall in one&#39;s lap by themselves, one can keep them.\n&gt; Similarly, siddhis th=\r\nat come to one by themselves can be accepted by a\n&gt; seeker of Self. *\n&gt; *  =\r\n*\n&gt; *Now an important distinction: *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *There are some trees that ar=\r\ne found at lower altitudes also, but some\n&gt; really special trees are found =\r\nat very high altitudes only. If one has such\n&gt; a fruit, it shows that one h=\r\nas climbed great heights. Similarly, some\n&gt; siddhis do not mean much, but s=\r\nome siddhis are very special and only really\n&gt; elevated sadhakas can obtain=\r\n them (whether by trying or without trying). If\n&gt; a sadhakas demonstrates s=\r\nuch a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a\n&gt; lot. However, the key is =\r\nthat one who climbed the same or more distance may\n&gt; not have that or any o=\r\nther fruit. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **        *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Unlike in the examp=\r\nle of climbing hill, which is an external activity,\n&gt; spiritual progress in=\r\n real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to\n&gt; know for sure how=\r\n much progress one has made, how much self-control one has\n&gt; internally and=\r\n what exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind. We may try to judge it\n&gt; from external=\r\n factors such as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily\n&gt; accurate. =\r\n*\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Here, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one&#39;s=\r\n siddhis\n&gt; to judge how high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person wh=\r\no reached\n&gt; the absolute top may not have any fruits, while one person who =\r\nstill has\n&gt; ways to climb may have gotten some really nice fruit. Using ext=\r\nernaslly\n&gt; demonstrable siddhis that are neither necessary nor sufficient f=\r\nor\n&gt; Self-realization as a measure of one&#39;s progress is unsound. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt;=\r\n *Given that spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and\n&gt; comp=\r\nare people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a\n&gt; sarvaantaryaami=\r\n - a perfected being who has access to each being&#39;s internal\n&gt; state - can =\r\ndo that. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; **        *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Rajarshi, you are assu=\r\nming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa\n&gt; on Vimalananda&#39;s scale=\r\n. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a\n&gt; Paramahamsa; Abhedananda, Vive=\r\nkananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda\n&gt; is a rishi; and hence Vimala=\r\nnanda is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda\n&gt; by 2pwr16 to 2. *\n&gt; *  *=\r\n\n&gt; *Is Paramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a\n&gt; P=\r\naramahamsa because he is known so? See, how people are famously known may\n&gt;=\r\n or may not reflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is\n&gt; in=\r\nternal and you cannot see it. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *We do not know who Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa really is. He may not be just\n&gt; a paramahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s sc=\r\nale, but be a siddha or a natha or even a\n&gt; rishi. He may even be Vishnu hi=\r\nmself, as he himself said and some religious\n&gt; experts of that time declare=\r\nd based on various signs. If Ramakrishna\n&gt; Paramahamsa is Vishnu himself, V=\r\nivekananda, Abhedananda etc can definitely\n&gt; be rishis or naths in Vimalana=\r\nnda&#39;s scale. If your argument is that they\n&gt; cannot be because they did not=\r\n demonstrate siddhis compatible with that\n&gt; status, that is a non-point as =\r\nI explained above. The disagreement between\n&gt; then boils down a difference =\r\nin the relevance and importance of externally\n&gt; demonstrated siddhis. *\n&gt; *=\r\n  *\n&gt; **        *        * *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Why this is relevant and I spent som=\r\ne time on this is that some people\n&gt; seem to have misconceptions. The take =\r\nhome for some people from some books\n&gt; describing miracles and siddhis may =\r\nbe that siddhis are important. *\n&gt; *  *\n&gt; *Vasishtha is not only a rishi, b=\r\nut one of saptarshis. Please read what he\n&gt; taught Lord Rama in Yoga Vaasis=\r\nhtham. It is the essence of Veda and\n&gt; Upanishad. It will balance your view=\r\ns and mould your attitude. Read Yoga\n&gt; Vaasishtham. Siddhis are neither nec=\r\nessary nor sufficient for\n&gt; self-realization.

This came f=\r\nrom the\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s comments on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors=\r\n&quot; of *\n&gt; *&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding their attitude towards Tantr=\r\na). He *\n&gt; *&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and said their spiritual calib=\r\ner was of\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was 2 power 16. He a=\r\nlso talked\n&gt; about *\n&gt; *&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by V=\r\n. I want to share 2 *\n&gt; *&gt; cents of musings on that. *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------- *\n&gt; *&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Ra=\r\njarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple of days *\n&gt; *&gt; =\r\nback on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare *\n&gt; *&gt; f=\r\nlowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say *\n&gt; *&gt; w=\r\nhich is a better flower. They have different properties like color, *\n&gt; *&gt; =\r\nsize, shape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative *\n&gt; *&gt;=\r\n values depend on the purpose and they cannot be quantified universally.\n&gt; =\r\n*\n&gt; *&gt; How can any sane person then say that spiritual caliber of different=\r\n *\n&gt; *&gt; people can be compared and quanitified? The field of duality has *\n=\r\n&gt; *&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi has infinite aspects=\r\n\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a person as o=\r\nne *\n&gt; *&gt; number and compare them. *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Before one even attempts t=\r\no understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; R=\r\nishi), please note that different hierarchies exist\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; in scriptures =\r\nfor deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities *\n&gt; *&gt; where Vishnu =\r\nis supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where *\n&gt; *&gt; Shiva is supr=\r\neme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; supreme.=\r\n And so on. None of them is absolute. All of them are relative\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; and=\r\n for specific purposes, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are\n&gt; *\n&gt; *=\r\n&gt; people who take them as absolute and argue that so and so thing taught\n&gt; =\r\n*\n&gt; *&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so and so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But w=\r\ne *\n&gt; *&gt; know that none of the hierarchies is absolute. *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; One w=\r\nho has the nerve to think that one can compare the wisdom of *\n&gt; *&gt; Jnanesh=\r\nwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakrishna\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Pa=\r\nramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi\n&gt; Sai, *\n=\r\n&gt; *&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya, *\n=\r\n&gt; *&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath *\n=\r\n&gt; *&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc,=\r\n\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specifi=\r\nc *\n&gt; *&gt; limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all=\r\n, in\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrish=\r\nna, and so\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should no=\r\nt even try to. *\n&gt; *&gt; You should just appreciate them individually and aspi=\r\nre to be like any\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; of them that you like the most. *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Vi=\r\nmalananda&#39;s list may be correct from specific perspective. More *\n&gt; *&gt; impo=\r\nrtantly, his words should make one realize that there is always *\n&gt; *&gt; scop=\r\ne for further self-control (and the resulting mastery over the\n&gt; field *\n&gt; =\r\n*&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One should never rest and *\n&gt; *=\r\n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to\n&gt;=\r\n *\n&gt; *&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements l=\r\nike\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and =\r\nthinking\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is a=\r\nssumed to have\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. =\r\n*\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Even if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, do=\r\nn&#39;t assume\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; that you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately.=\r\n Because *\n&gt; *&gt; Ramakrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a P=\r\naramahamsa\n&gt; as *\n&gt; *&gt; per Vimalananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a na=\r\ntha or even a\n&gt; rishi? *\n&gt; *&gt; Or may be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume yo=\r\nu know for sure!!! Based\n&gt; on *\n&gt; *&gt; the details we know, can we be absolut=\r\nely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s *\n&gt; *&gt; stature based on his own classificati=\r\non? *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of rama=\r\nkrishna.\n&gt; 2exp16 *\n&gt; *&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably made thi=\r\ns statement based on *\n&gt; *&gt; what you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the=\r\n sake of argument, it is\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; not even 100% clear whether he was a real=\r\n person or an imagined *\n&gt; *&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wi=\r\nsely!) left the latter *\n&gt; *&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book=\r\n! *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is t=\r\no use a *\n&gt; *&gt; simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a me=\r\nasure of *\n&gt; *&gt; one&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare qui=\r\nte well. RK\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; told Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birt=\r\nh. Others would\n&gt; be *\n&gt; *&gt; back, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, =\r\nhe said there would be *\n&gt; *&gt; one more birth and he would be free forever a=\r\nfter that. Vimalananda, on\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; the other hand, had atleast one more bi=\r\nrth clearly as he said a body\n&gt; was *\n&gt; *&gt; waiting for him. That way, forge=\r\nt about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Abhedananda alone is super=\r\nior to Vimalananda! *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Again, please note that this is just one =\r\ndefinition. One can have many\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; definitions. The key is not to jump =\r\nto unwise conclusions on any *\n&gt; *&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is weightie=\r\nr than Y and so what he said\n&gt; must *\n&gt; *&gt; be more correct&quot;. *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; =\r\nPeople with lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative\n&gt; knowledge =\r\n*\n&gt; *&gt; to be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some peop=\r\nle\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; are doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Agh=\r\nora *\n&gt; *&gt; books. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or=\r\n as *\n&gt; *&gt; absolute. Written words are always relative and never absolute. =\r\n*\n&gt; *&gt; Discriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopeful=\r\nly\n&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; using experencial realization later on. *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; More impo=\r\nrtantly, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we\n&gt; should *\n&gt; *&gt; no=\r\nt commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments of greats\n&gt; *\n&gt;=\r\n *&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us. *\n=\r\n&gt; *&gt; ------------------------------- *\n&gt; *&gt; *\n&gt; *&gt; Best regards, *\n&gt; *&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha *\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--0015174c395ee6a77404a99f2773\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste Narasimhaji,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thank you so much for y=\r\nour lucid explanations of these key points, which are important though subt=\r\nle.

In my case, my statement above is explicitly and unambiguously =\r\nstated by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda&#39;s question &quot;will sid=\r\ndhis help me in god realization&quot; in the negative, Ramakrishna also aff=\r\nirmed this teaching of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentially refers to the sa=\r\nme thing in Bhagavad Gita when he talks about seeking small things from dem=\r\nigods vs seeking &quot;me&quot; (Self). Vaishtha&#39;s words, however, are =\r\nthe clearest and most unambiguous. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div alig=\r\nn=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Yoga Vaasish=\r\ntham was taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the presence of Vishwamitra an=\r\nd other great sages and recorded by Valmiki.

The only problem is if they start doing t=\r\nhe bad karma of making negative judgments on greats thinking they are blind=\r\nly following Vimalananda).

But some with the same or higher level o=\r\nf realization may not possess the same external siddhi.

Some keep tavelling on the road and ac=\r\ncept only those fruits that land in their lap by themselves. Some get distr=\r\nacted from the journey and pursue the fruits actively. Collecting fruits is=\r\n neither necessary nor sufficient for reaching the top. Though having a fru=\r\nit that is available only at a very high altitude shows that one has reache=\r\nd great altitude, it cannot be used as a measure of one&#39;s progress, for=\r\n someone may have climbed greater heights without collecting that (or any) =\r\nfruit. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;=\r\n2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0 &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0=\r\n00000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;External and internal do NOT have a one-=\r\nto-one correspondence.
