Bali&#39;s episode is one amongst some more when Lors Rama&#39;s Maryaada a=\r\nnd conduct is questioned. he is being criticised by some for Marich event, =\r\nSita&#39;s Agniparikha, Foresaking of Sita Mata etc...\n\nBut i strongly feel tha=\r\nt there will be much more depth in all that which we are not aware and even=\r\nts are just on the surface, which generally look at and form our opinions. =\r\nhowever people also provide counter arguments to justify all the above even=\r\nts for which Rama is questioned. like when you mentioned Vaali&#39;s killing, i=\r\n may say that to kill Vaali, there was no option but to Kill him the way he=\r\n was killed. and if we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against Dh=\r\narma towards his brother. However Rama also took the brunt of that Karma on=\r\n himself in the later life during Krishna Incarnation. BUT what is the use =\r\nof all these arguments? I have seen that (from my experience in Astrology a=\r\ns well as other areas) they never end.\n\nyou said &quot;we conclude that at that =\r\npoint of time Lord Rama was unaware of his divine nature at that time&quot;. i a=\r\nm sorry Rajarshi, but i am sure we can never conclude especially in case of=\r\n Realised souls and when they are incarnations of Lord Vishnu.\n\nplese corre=\r\nct me if my understanding is wrong.\n\nBelated Happy birthday.\n\nWarm Regards,=\r\n\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Utpalji\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &#39;Maryaada&#39; in every aspect of life.h=\r\ne abided himself by the general rules of society. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I have one issue=\r\n with Lord Rama.

But if the arr=\r\now, chain and beautiful necklace are all made of 22 caret gold, they are al=\r\nl equally pure. Simply because the necklace required more work, it is nore =\r\npurer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Rama and Krishna were both from Vishnu - pure sa=\r\nttwa. One is not more &quot;evolved&quot; than the other. They just served different =\r\npurposes (like the arrow and necklace made of the same 22 pure gold) and he=\r\nnce had different qualities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like I said, earlier, Rama and Krishn=\r\na are from the soul and mind principles of the cosmic being.
