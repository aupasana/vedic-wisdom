It is not a full stop or period, but just a comma. Let me tell a p=\r\narable.\n&gt; \n&gt; A person loved one dress and wore it always. He never removed =\r\nthe dress and kept the dress on him all the time and never considered the p=\r\nossibility of changing into a different dress. The idea of removing that dr=\r\ness was unbearable to that person. He thought he should wear that dress for=\r\never.\n&gt; \n&gt; The dress became so dirty and torn that it was time to change it=\r\n. A person looking extremely scary came up to the person oneday to remove t=\r\nhe dress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated with him and tore =\r\nit apart violently if one fought back. After this scary person removed the =\r\nold dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some people became so =\r\nafraid and ashamed when they lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed=\r\n around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve soon=\r\n gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; The clot=\r\nhes in this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy. The person loo=\r\nking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator is t=\r\nhe person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birth is the new c=\r\nlothes. Persons running away in fear or shame before new clothese are given=\r\n are like different kinds of spirits.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\negarding your visualization of your father using reiki, please note that al=\r\nl visualizations of the mind are imagery created by one&#39;s conscious and sub=\r\n-conscious conditionining.

Also, there is no reliable way to know if your prayers made any differen=\r\nce to the path taken by your father after the cremation.

And I have been reading the posts on this forum wi=\r\nth much awe and interest. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed =\r\naway peacefully (after struggling with renal failure and other complication=\r\ns) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father&#39;s body to the sm=\r\nashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brill=\r\niant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his e=\r\nxperience of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji=\r\n), and I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smasha=\r\nan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs=\r\n a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as =\r\nper the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a s=\r\nimilar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kiddin=\r\ng to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the=\r\n smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all ove=\r\nr my body...especially\n&gt; in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipas=\r\nsana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equanimously as I could, and told mysel=\r\nf that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, tha=\r\nt it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini ve=\r\nrsion of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a ta=\r\nngible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some black s=\r\nesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not even b=\r\naffled at my request) - and he went away saying he would try and returned b=\r\nack in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought some gh=\r\nee. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very=\r\n first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It was =\r\na very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (by=\r\n my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in th=\r\ne direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and s=\r\nat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew =\r\nto sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, and request=\r\ned them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already observed a bro=\r\nwn colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we =\r\nreached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to b=\r\nehave a little differently (silly me!!):). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I closed my eyes - t=\r\nhanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Rishis; =\r\nand seeked their support and blessings in my very first attempt in doing su=\r\nch a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on breath,=\r\n and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my breath f=\r\nor few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warning tha=\r\nt this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gaining sp=\r\niritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be differen=\r\nt. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his =\r\njourney in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further an=\r\nd felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about attemptin=\r\ng such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mentally sur=\r\nrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I =\r\nhave mundane desires. Everytime I have done\n&gt; homam in the past, I have ask=\r\ned you to purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe that it=\r\n won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karmas, if=\r\n I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I ask you=\r\n to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane de=\r\nsire that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peaceful. =\r\nI am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurities a=\r\nnd my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yours i=\r\nf he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After this mental dialogue, I t=\r\nhough of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Ma=\r\na Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am =\r\na little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are fo=\r\nrms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which =\r\nDevi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and inste=\r\nad saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my menta=\r\nl imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with t=\r\nhe colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was d=\r\nifferent, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colo=\r\nur with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying=\r\n to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has a=\r\nrrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts=\r\n about the desire and surrendering\n of\n&gt; my ignorance. I sought permission =\r\nfrom the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also remem=\r\nber clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and=\r\n to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definete=\r\nly NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I had a small mental=\r\n dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to d=\r\no, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And =\r\nthen I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that=\r\n I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any o=\r\nfferings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of =\r\nthe mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swa=\r\nha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Ch=\r\nandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting=\r\n her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes la=\r\nter, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a lit=\r\ntle distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about fiv=\r\ne/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog=\r\n had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT f=\r\nind the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me =\r\nto think I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless\n I\n&gt; continu=\r\ned. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my=\r\n eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a sma=\r\nll, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to =\r\nthe smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after des=\r\ncending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and =\r\nstarted jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen want=\r\ned to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the =\r\nhen was acting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which=\r\n looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the funera=\r\nl fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird =\r\nfor few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a =\r\ndog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for us to le=\r\nave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I\n&gt; continued the me=\r\nntal chanting. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time=\r\n for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the =\r\nexit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet =\r\nitself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my =\r\nimpudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three ti=\r\nmes, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonder=\r\ning how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire?=\r\n Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry=\r\n up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen e=\r\nxactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want any=\r\none to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied=\r\n the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again=\r\n for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and threw=\r\n it at the funeral\n&gt; pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and req=\r\nuested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including th=\r\ne yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the g=\r\nroup. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I looke=\r\nd at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was not t=\r\nhere before (could be because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; On the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt very very very =\r\nquiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because th=\r\ne thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgott=\r\nen, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within my =\r\nexistence that evening. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgemen=\r\nt, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have be=\r\nen a product of my own imagination - but the silence was real. And this exp=\r\nerience of silence was the most beautiful thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The next day, =\r\nI heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the =\r\none yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother=\r\n was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now th=\r\nat it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen t=\r\noo, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? I=\r\ns there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perfo=\r\nrm hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples?

He never rem=\r\noved the dress and kept the dress on him all the time and never considered =\r\nthe possibility of changing into a different dress.

A person looking extremely scary came up to the person o=\r\nneday to remove the dress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated w=\r\nith him and tore it apart violently if one fought back. After this scary pe=\r\nrson removed the old dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some =\r\npeople became so afraid and\n ashamed when they lost old clothes that they r=\r\nan away and roamed around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, =\r\nthey would&#39;ve soon gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as w=\r\nell.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The clothes in this parable are akin to the physical =\r\nbody we occupy. The person looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personif=\r\nication of Death. Creator is the person giving new clothes. New body taken =\r\nin the next birth is the new clothes. Persons running away in fear or shame=\r\n before new clothese are given are like different kinds of spirits.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding your visuali=\r\nzation of your father using reiki, please note that all visualizations of t=\r\nhe mind are imagery created by one&#39;s conscious and sub-conscious conditioni=\r\nning.

Also, there is no=\r\n reliable way to know if your prayers made any difference to the path taken=\r\n by your father after the cremation. The curiosity and the tendency to spec=\r\nulate will naturally last for sometime, but the bottomline is that you cann=\r\not really do much more than speculate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbs=\r\np; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding the hen/cock, it is associated with Koumaar=\r\ni, among the forms of Divine Mother.

And I have been reading the p=\r\nosts on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggl=\r\ning with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. W=\r\nhen we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites,=\r\n my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai =\r\n- 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Ho=\r\nmam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if =\r\nI would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how=\r\n wonderful it would be, if\n an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral =\r\n- so that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immed=\r\niately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I=\r\n quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do=\r\n such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started ex=\r\nperiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the s=\r\nensations as equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would=\r\n change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the leve=\r\nl of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam i=\r\nn my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, s=\r\no I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery=\r\n (now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) -=\r\n and he went away\n saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with=\r\n the above 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the ve=\r\nry first time that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It wa=\r\ns a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (=\r\nby my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in =\r\nthe direction opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and=\r\n sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephe=\r\nw to sit on either side, told them that I would like to meditate, and reque=\r\nsted them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already observed a b=\r\nrown colored dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as w=\r\ne reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to=\r\n behave a little differently (silly me!!):). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I\n closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents=\r\n, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my ver=\r\ny first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am u=\r\nsed to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I con=\r\ntinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I=\r\n remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the pur=\r\nest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and fou=\r\nnd the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulate=\r\ns some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmaye=\r\ne&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too=\r\n in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to=\r\n give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa,=\r\n I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have\n done&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have =\r\nbelieved and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ n=\r\nullification of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the sa=\r\nme speed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure min=\r\nd that I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya a=\r\nnd his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa=\r\n, so please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam.=\r\n Please pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; After this mental dialogue, I though of invoking=\r\n Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Ka=\r\nli etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comforta=\r\nble with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and th=\r\ne same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which\n Devi form I invo=\r\nke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-l=\r\nike pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my mental imagery. I tho=\r\nught of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with the colour of gan=\r\ngrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was different, and im=\r\nmediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colour with the colo=\r\nur of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) an=\r\nd I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has arrived. I did me=\r\nntal Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts about the desir=\r\ne and surrendering of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my ignorance. I sought permission from the de=\r\nity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also remember clearly=\r\n, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT giv=\r\ne me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT puni=\r\nsh me in any way for doing this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I had =\r\na small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I =\r\nwas going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (wi=\r\nth swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre=\r\n. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still c=\r\nontinued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then swit=\r\nched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was full=\r\ny aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. So=\r\nmetimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she wa=\r\ns crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet o=\r\nr a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in the direction which w=\r\nas opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a littl=\r\ne curious and wanted to see if the dog had\n come and was sitting somewhere =\r\naround. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed,=\r\n but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite t=\r\nhe deity, but nevertheless I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continued. Few minutes later, I heard =\r\nsome sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black he=\r\nn (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown).=\r\n It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a gr=\r\naveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wal=\r\nl. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and moving arou=\r\nnd the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral a=\r\nnd die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because =\r\nit was amused with the fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling =\r\ndown on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof =\r\nof the funeral platform. I watched\n the bird for few minutes, laughed at my=\r\nself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I=\r\n would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he =\r\nsaid 30 more minutes. So I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continued the mental chanting. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time=\r\n for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the =\r\nexit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet =\r\nitself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my =\r\nimpudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three ti=\r\nmes, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wonder=\r\ning how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire?=\r\n Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry=\r\n up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen e=\r\nxactly what was happening, I\n was a little scared because I did not want an=\r\nyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptie=\r\nd the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi agai=\r\nn for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and thre=\r\nw it at the funeral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again =\r\nand requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (inclu=\r\nding the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joine=\r\nd the group. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I was washing my hand=\r\ns and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tin=\r\nge to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesam=\r\ne seeds or jaggery??). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On the way back =\r\nhome and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I woul=\r\nd&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what ha=\r\nppened was not strong\n in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I think=\r\ning about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within my existence that even=\r\ning. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, ju=\r\nst a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my =\r\nown imagination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence =\r\nwas the most beautiful thing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The next =\r\nday, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but=\r\n the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my br=\r\nother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now that it is few days since that incident, I have =\r\nquestions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumpi=\r\nng &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the f=\r\nact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Sh=\r\nakti really\n grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visual=\r\nise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-cons=\r\ntructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not sure if these questions can be ans=\r\nwered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the above experien=\r\nce, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most a=\r\nppreciative.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Ra=\r\njarshi for the continued inspiration. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A=\r\nlso, apologies for the length of the note.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sharad&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INTER=\r\nNET now has a personality.
