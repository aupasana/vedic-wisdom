If priest was aware and sti=\r\nll did that, then I can\n&gt; understand the consequence.\n \nIf one goes in the =\r\npath of a tornado, aware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one will stil=\r\nl be consumed by it.\n \nIf the question is of fairness, well, is it fair tha=\r\nt tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of people ev=\r\nery year? Well, Natural order of the universe is neither fair nor unfair. I=\r\nt is just an &quot;order&quot;. Your actions gets opposite reactions. You experience =\r\nthe fruits of your actions, as determined by the order of nature. A person =\r\nmay happen to be doing what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may strike=\r\n there and kill him. If so, there must be a previous karma as a result of w=\r\nhich he is placed there at that time.\n \nIn the case of the priest in the st=\r\nory, his mistake is that he slapped a person worshipping god. If he had no =\r\nway of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing the wo=\r\nrship, he should&#39;ve given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere=\r\n devotee, rather than assuming it was a fool.\n \nSee, when Ramakrishna went =\r\nthere and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remarked =\r\nthat this is Viswanatha himself. However, others may not be so fortunate. Y=\r\nou only saw a body with some body parts and some clothes and nothing beyond=\r\n it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully. Ju=\r\nst because of external parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.\n \nH=\r\nitting a person who still has a limited self-identification is one thing an=\r\nd hitting a person who has no limited self-identification and identifies wi=\r\nth the entire universe or with a deity is different.\n \n*        *        *\n=\r\n \nIn any case, do not worry about that priest that much. For all you know, =\r\nhe may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact=\r\n a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not,=\r\n he was lucky to enact an important role in an interesting divine drama.\n \n=\r\n*        *        *\n \nJeevanmuktas may engage in actions that are difficult=\r\n to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. They become ins=\r\ntruments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swa=\r\nmi may help several people question, challenge and overcome their biases an=\r\nd learn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.\n \n*        *=\r\n        *\n \nRegarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints so=\r\nmetimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a spec=\r\nific set of people.\n \nThere is nothing wrong in having many deities in pooj=\r\na room and worshipping all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. Ho=\r\nwever, Vimalananda may not be concerned about such people. His teachings ma=\r\ny be addressed at some other people to come in the coming years who he has =\r\nrina with and who are meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some=\r\n work. There is an intended audience for every work and no work can be perf=\r\nect for all audience.\n \nIf the goal is either liberation or a deity&#39;s darsh=\r\nan (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to agree that focusing on one de=\r\nity is the best thing to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deitie=\r\ns and keep switching. A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled w=\r\nith that deity&#39;s name and mantra and other thoughts are driven away from th=\r\ne mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate several people to strive for=\r\n vision/company of deities. He probably thought some people he has a rina w=\r\nith would come to earth with such a potential.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThya=\r\ngaraja did compose songs on many deities. But, he first had a darshan of Ra=\r\nma. He spent several years chanting Rama&#39;s name and had a darshan. Then he =\r\ncomposed songs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as different em=\r\nanations from Rama. He saw Rama in all.\n \nSame with Aadi Shankara, Muththus=\r\nwamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and others.\n \nWhen one achieves perfection=\r\n in surrender to one deity, one&#39;s life is made. After that, one will see th=\r\ne same deity in all deities even if he worships 100 deities. If one is swit=\r\nching between ten deities before that, it may not be helpful in filling the=\r\n mind with thoughts of any of those deities. Mind sees those deities as dif=\r\nferent objects and may not fully surrender to any of them. Still, as I said=\r\n, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life. That&#39;s fine.\n \nBut, if you really =\r\nwant to taste the nectar of complete surrender, it is better to pick one de=\r\nity and fill the mind with his/her thoughts.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Exce=\r\nllent answers on each thread and mother showed her divine\n&gt; grace through y=\r\nou that I am able to find answers to many\n&gt; questions that my immature mind=\r\n keeps on asking! \n \nThough I had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I=\r\n am not a realized person. I too am a normal person with an immature mind. =\r\nBut my guru blessed me that I will be able to give excellent replies to spi=\r\nritual questions if I think of him and then write what comes to my mind.

I do understand that Telang S=\r\nwamy might have been a great yogi but my point is how are we to understand =\r\nthat greatness and in that context what is ununsual in the priest&#39;s reactio=\r\nn that God had to punish him that hard! If priest was aware and still did t=\r\nhat, then I can understand the consequence. I haven&#39;t yet the second book t=\r\nhough! Probably that will explain. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, I understand RamaKrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa&#39;s famous &#39;Dig at one place 10 feet instead of 1 foot at 10 places=\r\n if you want to find water&#39;. But contrary to that we find great saints / co=\r\nmposers / poets from India have indeed worshipped many forms of the God and=\r\n were successful in that approach as well. For instance, there is not a sin=\r\ngle deity form that was not worshipped by Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy D=\r\nikshitar. It was famous that Muththuswamy Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri=\r\n Vidyopasaka and he left his mortal coil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDev=\r\ni in the presence of many of his disciples. But he composed songs of deep d=\r\nevotion that have immense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramany=\r\na, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So were many great composers of Carna=\r\ntic Music in that path. In fact they were all great advaitis and never saw =\r\nany difference between any form of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a=\r\n great poet of Andhra who\n&gt;  translated Bhagavatam, in his opening invocato=\r\nry poems, pays homage to Lord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Br=\r\nahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in that order before declaring that he got the divine =\r\ninspiration from Lord Rama to write the Stories of Krishna! Where is the di=\r\nfference between any form of God here! I wonder. So, I was not able to comp=\r\nrehend why Vimalananda accuses many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just be=\r\ncause their puja mandirams are filled with many photographs/idols of differ=\r\nent murthis of Almighty.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nagraj \n \n \n&gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt;  \n&gt; Exc=\r\nellent answers on each thread and mother showed her divine grace through yo=\r\nu that I am able to find answers to many questions that my immature mind ke=\r\neps on asking! \n&gt;  \n&gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics =\r\nI found disturbing in the first book of Aghora are as follows: \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. On=\r\n the page 45 it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi V=\r\nishveshwara with his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reas=\r\non for this bizarre behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die,=\r\n because in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! =\r\nSince you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things=\r\n, I hope to find and answer here. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. In quite a few places, Vimalana=\r\nnda equates changing the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitutio=\r\nn, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankar=\r\na compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed i=\r\nn the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So=\r\n are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelash=\r\nuka where they wanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the ca=\r\nse of former and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the ot=\r\nher form is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of=\r\n Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally =\r\nin the love and awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, gane=\r\nsha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt;  \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, =\r\n3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha =\r\nPVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora b=\r\nooks..)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, March 2, 2010, =\r\n6:31 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How to achieve it effectivey?=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If it can be achieved easily, we will not have so many spiritual path=\r\ns and so many sadhanas.

Look at your belongings (spouse, children, job,=\r\n house, cars, wealth, name, fame, and even body) as the property of god. Im=\r\nagine that you are a temporary caretaker, just as a servant may be living i=\r\nn a rich person&#39;s house as the caretaker as that person stays away. Think o=\r\nf all that is in your hands as the sacred property of your master and take =\r\ncare like a committed servant. A servant takes the best care of his master&#39;=\r\ns property, but does not get attached. Do not be attached anything and yet =\r\ntake the best possible care. If something goes wrong, do not worry too much=\r\n and tell yourself that the master will take care of it when he gets a chan=\r\nce to look at it. Think for a moment how a servant taking care of the prope=\r\nrties of a master living away thinks and behaves.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one can attain th=\r\ne spirit and mental state of the servant in this analogy, one&#39;s life will b=\r\ne made.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Read what Manish wrote below:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you tak=\r\ne Time out of the equation (because a deity has a different time space fram=\r\ne which runs in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by w=\r\naiting with patience, then where will God go?

Only very advanced sadhakas=\r\n will be able to identify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rnas / karmic debts and know how/where/wh=\r\ny they are to be paid off. The rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of us have to follow dharma, wh=\r\nich includes standing up for what is right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and righteous and not be=\r\ning defeatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have written o=\r\nff the wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kris=\r\nhna urged him to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate and complex and delicate to b=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has reached certain very very high levels=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partial =\r\nvision.

He did so much sadhana of a deit=\r\ny that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. This deity was=\r\n a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of rare opportun=\r\nity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle, because Shiva is =\r\nthe greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows how to worship Krish=\r\nna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can you worship Krishn=\r\na perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was bes=\r\net with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happ=\r\nened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present ev=\r\nen before, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Kris=\r\nhna&#39;s lila or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have tr=\r\neated him as a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tr=\r\nicks on Him, but the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and r=\r\neplaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was ef=\r\nfectively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why a=\r\nt the end of the battle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perso=\r\nn who had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at =\r\nthe beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from=\r\n one end of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction,=\r\n it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the b=\r\nlood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at His side, others may not be =\r\nquite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doc=\r\ntor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thriving surgical career w=\r\nhen I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said something similar=\r\n about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to cr=\r\niminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Is=\r\nhwari) pranidhana.

She taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever you eve=\r\nr do in life, just try and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you ha=\r\nve with anybody, give whatever you can, turn away nobody from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your =\r\ndoor, who knows when God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does =\r\nnot mean that one is fatalistic and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that=\r\n terrific sadhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana a=\r\nnd a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncha Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being), are essential. Before I met=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas the=\r\nmselves, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, =\r\nhow will you lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God y=\r\nourself face to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the e=\r\nquation (because a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which run=\r\ns in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by wait=\r\ning with patience, then where will God go? God has to come, He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;=\r\nt escape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 27, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you see the old mail quo=\r\nted by Hemanth below, it will answer your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Just because a group of people think something is their dharma and d=\r\no it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not free them from karma.

As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s dharma becomes clearer to on=\r\ne. The sense of dharma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditioned mind is corrupted=\r\n by that conditioning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, even doing one&#39;s true =\r\ndharma does not mean one does not incur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma. If Nature selects =\r\nsomeone, because of one&#39;s prior conditioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts, to kill t=\r\nhousand bad people, and one fulfils dharma by killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thousand ba=\r\nd people, that person WILL incur new karma for it. Dharma (duty)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand moksha (liberation) are two different purusharthas and not one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Fulfilling dharma is helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to doing dharma, one needs to overcome ego (I-ness=\r\n) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense of doership goes down, the s=\r\npeed at which new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. Dharma becomes c=\r\nlearer. For liberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and the sense of d=\r\noership and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) without attachm=\r\nent and doership.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies =\r\nsome key concepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefully.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicast rologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am =\r\n&lt;mahalaxmyey@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard that Muslims used to behead m=\r\neditating sages head when they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Mus=\r\nlims dharma is to kill other religious people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims a=\r\nttact bad karma or sin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hem=\r\nanthks@. ..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even I think one has to follow Dharma.

If, based =\r\non one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature w=\r\nants a person to spread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of =\r\nall religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.

The time th=\r\nen was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth a=\r\nnd nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a g=\r\nreat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone fo=\r\nr it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma=\r\n to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected =\r\nwere on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arj=\r\nuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma =\r\nwas different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born=\r\n to renounce material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing =\r\nand live the simple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to e=\r\nmbrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others=\r\n. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: =\r\nHow does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some peop=\r\nle have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharm=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Thoug=\r\nh the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hind=\r\nuism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility w=\r\nas very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing b=\r\nirds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a=\r\n maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One star=\r\nts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what=\r\n one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one g=\r\nets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, t=\r\nhe misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; y=\r\nour\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not ju=\r\nst 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual=\r\n dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very =\r\nvery difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dh=\r\narma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that=\r\n tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nnoise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgme=\r\nnt combining discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide =\r\nwhat is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage i=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we =\r\nare not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. =\r\nWe should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we ar=\r\ne doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based o=\r\nn our best judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nituation is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;w=\r\nhat will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nis=\r\nhkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simp=\r\nlify our ego and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As =\r\nwe become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nlearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly ena=\r\nble us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurrin=\r\ng new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult =\r\nas people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is =\r\nnot following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is m=\r\ny dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nlittle attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In=\r\n deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. O=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place=\r\n is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrender=\r\ns to a spiritual master, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\ne master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought kil=\r\nling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a gur=\r\nu in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami=\r\n Vivekananda) was confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wante=\r\nd to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay i=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for hi=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not =\r\nknow who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature=\r\n expects from one can err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one=\r\n&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidanc=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that=\r\n I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare =\r\nthat as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fro=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thum=\r\nbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is.

Mr. VS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives many excuses and many dates =\r\nbut fails and ultimately does not pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back.

He follows=\r\n up for the money but with the attitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although h=\r\ne shows to his family and friends that he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned =\r\nand it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it w=\r\nas a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some pa=\r\nst rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr=\r\n.

Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestati=\r\nons of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is=\r\n permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of=\r\n god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of=\r\n Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea =\r\nis to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary ill=\r\nusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should =\r\nwe remind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies=\r\n? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have do=\r\nne and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oursel=\r\nves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ntemporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful an=\r\nd want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. =\r\nThis thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so=\r\n beautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions.

His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reject=\r\ns all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and think=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and f=\r\nocus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83?=\r\n =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both imperme=\r\nnant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the =\r\nSelf, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may =\r\ntry a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=83? But, please remember th=\r\nat eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the foo=\r\nd being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation =\r\nof Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eatin=\r\ng feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind =\r\nis dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will n=\r\not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain=\r\n properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thi=\r\nnking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedant=\r\nin also has the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when =\r\neating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming=\r\n Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly c=\r\nooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver fro=\r\nm the focus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an agh=\r\nora are telling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb th=\r\nat truth into every thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting hi=\r\nmself in an extreme situation where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad=\r\n dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic vers=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty la=\r\nddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the=\r\n mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on =\r\nthe nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other food, wh=\r\nat is the big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absor=\r\nb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgust=\r\ning. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exper=\r\nience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult ta=\r\nsks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because=\r\n of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someon=\r\ne is doing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having=\r\n a weakness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or get=\r\nting sexual thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing=\r\n guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce ce=\r\nlibacy and keep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is n=\r\nor a formula for overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such though=\r\nts may still come and distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy fo=\r\nr 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the min=\r\nd does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an ex=\r\ntreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascination f=\r\nrom the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different=\r\n activities (one pure and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them =\r\ninto one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an =\r\naghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex.=\r\n He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose=\r\n he persists to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that for several months/years. Even=\r\ntually, mind may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he i=\r\ns doing something impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no longer feel titillation. The =\r\nassociation in his mind between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nakedness and sex may be broken d=\r\nown. Seeing naked pictures physically or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentally may no longer e=\r\nvoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation. Any small=\r\n thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may not l=\r\nead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much t=\r\nime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction =\r\nand thrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken =\r\ndown. Overall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may =\r\nbe gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences=\r\n and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to br=\r\neak down some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these structures by engaging in certain practice=\r\ns that undermine those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof=\r\n method? Not really. It is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the person keeps on=\r\n engaging in the practice merely for sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks of sex everyt=\r\nime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation eve=\r\nrytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; re=\r\nady to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83? Bottomline is that an aghora takes problem=\r\ns and weaknesses head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on and sets up a high stakes fight with the=\r\nm, whereas a normal person may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; push the problems under the carpet=\r\n and fight slowly and with low stakes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a risky strategy is n=\r\not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83? Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;wh=\r\nat is Vedanta and what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical w=\r\nay to understand and absorb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by =\r\nsetting up a high stakes war plan. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is certainly not s=\r\nuitable for all and many may feel aversion. More\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerously, som=\r\ne people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understandin=\r\ng and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=83? Aghora stands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerate=\r\ns how one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure=\r\n very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various=\r\n spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paths and explains the basic reality.
