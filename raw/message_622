He actually said in his\nautobiography ( Hamari Viras=\r\nat aur Vasiyat, My Inheritances and Will,\nloosely translated) that once whe=\r\nn he was 14 years old and sitting for\nhis Morning Sandhya,  a divine figure=\r\n appeared, guru\nSarweshwaranandji. His Guru then made him realise his past =\r\nlives and\ngave him the work for this life.\nHe took him back as in a flash t=\r\no the past. He realised that he had\nbeen born as Thakur, before that Saint =\r\nKabir and before that Guru of\nChatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.\n\nI will try=\r\n to locate the exact link and send it.The general site is\nwww.awgp.org I re=\r\nmember the book is there on pdf in English somewhere\nonline. It&#39;s in the ve=\r\nry first few chapters.\n\n\n\nThanks\nShiv\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sir, I would like to sha=\r\nre one of my great Devine experience\nabout shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an u=\r\nnbelievable experience that I\nhave had. I have not added anything from my o=\r\nwn. I am writing exactly\nas was happened in my life. I am going back to the=\r\n period of 1973/74.\nKindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwark=\r\na.\nMy duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for\ne=\r\nxtra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\noffice and =\r\ndue to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone\noperators. =\r\nOne Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\nwas working as Ope=\r\nrator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\nRamkrishnadev. Wh=\r\nenever I was meeting him he was always talking about\nshri Thakur. We came c=\r\nlose day by day. There was a weekly gathering at\nhis home called SATSANGA. =\r\nHe was singing devotional songs created by\nhim and was weeping while singin=\r\ng. He was reading Ramkrishna\nKathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attend=\r\ning this weekly meeting\non Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. P=\r\natel was of 30\nthen. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after dut=\r\ny hours\nand were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; One day when we were at sea s=\r\nhore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\nsome guest have come to my ho=\r\nme and my wife is remembering me. My son\nwill come in a few minutes to call=\r\n me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. --\nAnd with my surprise his 8 years o=\r\nld son came to call him. \n&gt; At one another incident he told me that there w=\r\nill be a plane crash\ntomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impre=\r\nssed about him.\nHe could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka =\r\nby Bus, he\ntold me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Ye=\r\nt I\nwent to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured\no=\r\nn the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; This all incidents made me to believe tha=\r\nt he had some super power\nand this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I=\r\n was attracted to\nshri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple=\r\n of shri\nThakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered my=\r\nself\nto Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed=\r\n him\ndeeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace=\r\n. \n&gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\nwhile=\r\n taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking\nup at 5.45 =\r\nmorning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have\naccepted Shri Ramkris=\r\nhnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she\nargued with me a lot. =E2=\r\n=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision?\nRamkrishna Paramham=\r\nsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a\ngreat Saint but our Guru=\r\n should be living one, who can guide us, give\nus Mantra etc. etc. Better yo=\r\nu take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya\nsince you are doing Gayatri Mantra=\r\n=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general n=\r\not know\nmuch about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n=\r\nhasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; But I remember th=\r\nat Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\ntheir disciples to test hi=\r\nm before accepting him. I also decided to\ntest Thakur. I immediately told m=\r\ny wife that =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has\nnever come to our home. You =\r\nhave also not seen him. He has never asked\nme where I am living. Suppose Mr=\r\n. Patel is coming to our house within\n10 to 15 minutes, would you believe t=\r\nhat my selection for Thakur is\nperfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; She laughed at me=E2=\r\n=80&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; I pr=\r\nayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\ndecision and c=\r\nonvince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even\ntoday.=E2=80=\r\n=99\n&gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\nmorni=\r\nng with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this=\r\n way? Do you know what happened?\nYesterday was my night duty and I had just=\r\n come to my home at 05.30\nmornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hour=\r\ns. Suddenly Thakur\npulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your =\r\nfriend=E2=80=99s house. He\nis waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will =\r\nshow you his house=E2=80=9D\n&gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was=\r\n guiding me the way to\nyour house and pushing me too. What you want? Why yo=\r\nu are disturbing\nhim in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=\r\n=80=99\n&gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that\nMo=\r\nrning. \n&gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. The=\r\nre\nwere some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write\nit =\r\nsometime.\n&gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on th=\r\ne\nearth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to\nexaggerate.=\r\n=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us.\n&gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
