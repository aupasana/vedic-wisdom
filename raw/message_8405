Feelin=\r\ng and heart is more important than counting and numbers.\n\nBut how does feel=\r\ning come? Though japa! That is the paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is m=\r\nechanical sometimes, keep doing it. The mind will be purified and one day, =\r\nfeeling will come, devotion will arise.\n\nSome of my favourite quotations on=\r\n the power of japa:\n\nSwami Sivananda\n&quot;Religion Means &#39;To Do.&#39; It is only th=\r\ne one two little acts that you actually do, that constitute religion and sp=\r\nirituality. To rise early and take the name of the Lord for ten minutes is =\r\nwhat real dharma is.&quot;\nMore from him on japa \n\nhttp://www.sivanandadlshq.org=\r\n/teachings/japayoga.htm\n\nSwami Chidananda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)=\r\n\n&quot;One&#39;s day should start first with purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, mak=\r\ning clean! Cleanse, cleanse - by uttering God&#39;s Name, by thinking of God. T=\r\nhe Name of God is verily God Himself. Supreme Divinity is present here. Nam=\r\ne and God are not two. They are one and the same. Name is God!&quot;\n\nAnandamayi=\r\n Ma\n&quot;Listen! Do not let your time pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you =\r\nand do japa; or if this does not suit you, at least go on repeating the Nam=\r\ne of the Lord regularly and without interruption like the ticking of a cloc=\r\nk. There are no rules or restrictions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that =\r\nappeals to you most, for as much time as you can--the longer the better. Ev=\r\nen if you get tired or lose interest, administer the Name to yourself like =\r\na medicine that has to be taken. In this way you will at some auspicious mo=\r\nment discover the rosary of the mind, and then you will continually hear wi=\r\nthin yourself the praises of the great Master, the Lord of Creation, like t=\r\nhe never ceasing music of the boundless ocean; You will hear the land and t=\r\nhe sea, the air and the heavens reverberate with the song of His glory. Thi=\r\ns is called the all--pervading Presence of His Name.&quot;\n\nPriyank, thanks very=\r\n much for the message. Warren Buffet...cool! I will try and do homam more o=\r\nften- I really enjoy it. Will schedule one for tomorrow evening after work =\r\nif possible. Good start to the Navaratri (had never heard about this Navara=\r\ntri before). \n\nRakesh ji, thanks for the message. You are quite right. Even=\r\n breathing for God...that would be a great state to be in...no idea when I&#39;=\r\nm going to get there. Anyway peserverence is key. \n\nI think that nobody but=\r\n God can get us to do Sadhana. I believe that God walked every step of the =\r\nway on the path for the saints... nay, actually DID the sadhana for them ul=\r\ntimately. I know we have to &quot;make an effort&quot; and meet God halfway, but ulti=\r\nmately it is She and He who get us to make the effort. That&#39;s why I said &quot;D=\r\namn you Durga&quot;....because You made some people make that supreme effort....=\r\nYou alone were their Sadhana Shakti....and what about the rest of Your wret=\r\nched children? What sort of partial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mira=\r\n, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, but what about all of us eh? What sort of game is thi=\r\ns? Anyway, it&#39;s Her game, that&#39;s the bottom line... what can we do except p=\r\nlay along (we have to believe it&#39;s ultimately for our own good).\n\nOk chaps,=\r\n going to do some japa now.

I tried today, and boy, it was ha=\r\nrd...failed mostly, to be honest.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anan=\r\ndamayi Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every o=\r\nne of them was obsessed with this Name business. That means, there must be =\r\nsomething to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I really want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and=\r\n get obsessed with the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick)=\r\n a few times, and the Name helped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was un=\r\nwell, long story, but basically, I was conscious during these black outs, a=\r\nnd it felt like I was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts=\r\n except the Name &quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes sc=\r\nared the bejesus out of me, and each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUS=\r\nT DO MORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use =\r\nwhen I&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliable.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m trying to say, is I want to devise some practical ways to ge=\r\nt serious about this sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) =\r\nwas a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as =\r\nmany lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllable=\r\ns, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 c=\r\nrore of japa with feeling would result in Darshan of God in physical form, =\r\nface to face. That would be great! Really wanted to do it...but when I did =\r\nthe maths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every sin=\r\ngle day from now on, it would take me till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; But hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began my my first Purasc=\r\nharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a=\r\n measley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard cor=\r\ne people do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow=\r\n chanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper.=\r\n My mental chanting is gradually improving but very difficult to do for mor=\r\ne than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 la=\r\nkhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and t=\r\nhen start another Purascharana. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, two things help me get my=\r\n 11 rounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d me=\r\nntion it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One=\r\n is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the phon=\r\ne. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on my =\r\nfingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I ch=\r\neck carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traffic=\r\n (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pret=\r\nend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;=\r\nToilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two of japa at work, I=\r\n excuse myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I =\r\nthen very very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips m=\r\noving, no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of t=\r\nhis a day. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my w=\r\norking hours are long. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought =\r\nI&#39;d mention this for anyone else whose work life interferes with their japa=\r\n. At least, it provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n If anybody else has any thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name c=\r\nonstantly, kindly share. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n \r\n---301686607-255972760-1340143726=:69338\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Hi sunrise_1080,&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; What you have asked is a very relevant question.

Feeling and heart is more important than count=\r\ning and numbers.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBut how does feeling come? Though japa! That is t=\r\nhe paradox. Sivananda says, even if it is mechanical sometimes, keep doing =\r\nit. The mind will be purified and one day, feeling will come, devotion will=\r\n arise.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSome of my favourite quotations on the power of japa:&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nSwami Sivananda&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Religion Means &#39;To Do.&#39; It is only the one two li=\r\nttle acts that you actually do, that constitute religion and spirituality. =\r\nTo rise early and take the name of the Lord for ten minutes is what real dh=\r\narma is.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nMore from him on japa &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/japayoga.htm&quot;&gt;http=\r\n://www.sivanandadlshq.org/teachings/japayoga.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSwami Chidana=\r\nnda (ace disciple of Swami Sivananda)&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;One&#39;s day should start first wit=\r\nh purifying, with cleaning, sweeping, making clean! Cleanse, cleanse - by u=\r\nttering God&#39;s Name, by thinking of God. The Name of God is verily God Himse=\r\nlf. Supreme Divinity is present here. Name and God are not two. They are on=\r\ne and the same. Name is God!&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnandamayi Ma&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Listen! Do not le=\r\nt your time pass idly. Either keep a rosary with you and do japa; or if thi=\r\ns does not suit you, at least go on repeating the Name of the Lord regularl=\r\ny and without interruption like the ticking of a clock. There are no rules =\r\nor restrictions in this. Invoke Him by the Name that appeals to you most, f=\r\nor as much time as you can--the longer the better. Even if you get tired or=\r\n lose interest, administer the Name to yourself like a medicine that has to=\r\n be taken. In this way you will at some auspicious moment discover the rosa=\r\nry of the mind, and then you will continually hear within yourself the prai=\r\nses of the great Master, the Lord of Creation, like the never ceasing music=\r\n of the boundless ocean; You will hear the land and the sea, the air and th=\r\ne heavens reverberate with the song of His glory. This is called the all--p=\r\nervading Presence of His Name.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPriyank, thanks very much for the =\r\nmessage. Warren Buffet...cool! I will try and do homam more often- I really=\r\n enjoy it. Will schedule one for tomorrow evening after work if possible. G=\r\nood start to the Navaratri (had never heard about this Navaratri before). &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRakesh ji, thanks for the message. You are quite right. Even breat=\r\nhing for God...that would be a great state to be in...no idea when I&#39;m goin=\r\ng to get there. Anyway peserverence is key. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI think that nobody b=\r\nut God can get us to do Sadhana. I believe that God walked every step of th=\r\ne way on the path for the saints... nay, actually DID the sadhana for them =\r\nultimately. I know we have to &quot;make an effort&quot; and meet God halfway, but ul=\r\ntimately it is She and He who get us to make the effort. That&#39;s why I said =\r\n&quot;Damn you Durga&quot;....because You made some people make that supreme effort..=\r\n..You alone were their Sadhana Shakti....and what about the rest of Your wr=\r\netched children? What sort of partial mother are you hmm? You did it for Mi=\r\nra, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, but what about all of us eh? What sort of game is t=\r\nhis? Anyway, it&#39;s Her game, that&#39;s the bottom line... what can we do except=\r\n play along (we have to believe it&#39;s ultimately for our own good).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nOk chaps, going to do some japa now.

I tried tod=\r\nay, and boy, it was hard...failed mostly, to be honest.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Sivananda, Ch=\r\naitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obsessed with this=\r\n Name business. That means, there must be something to it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; I really want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed wi=\r\nth the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, an=\r\nd the Name helped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long story=\r\n, but basically, I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like =\r\nI was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Name=\r\n &quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesus=\r\n out of me, and each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; =\r\nit&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in deep=\r\n sh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliable.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; What I&#39;m trying to say, is I want to devise some practical ways t=\r\no get serious about this sadhana. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of Pur=\r\nascharana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables in the man=\r\ntra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetition=\r\ns). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in Da=\r\nrshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! Really wa=\r\nnted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate of=\r\n 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take me till a=\r\nge 83 to finish this. :( &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But hey, I decided t=\r\no make a start anyway, and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Na=\r\nrayanaya mantra, in January this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day=\r\n, with my mind wandering most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of =\r\nrounds with proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to sa=\r\ny the mantra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is g=\r\nradually improving but very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s=\r\n gonna take me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to =\r\ntake a 3 month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purasc=\r\nharana. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, two things help me get my 11 =\r\nrounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mentio=\r\nn it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend=\r\n I&#39;m on the phone. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count=\r\n the japa on my fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working da=\r\ny this way (I check carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while =\r\nstuck in traffic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pie=\r\nces on, and pretend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple o=\r\nf rounds. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The other thing that I find useful =\r\n(now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to =\r\ndo a round or two of japa at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes and lo=\r\nck myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the mantr=\r\na to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case anybod=\r\ny hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a day. This allows me to complete m=\r\ny 11 rounds a day, on days when my working hours are long. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention this fo=\r\nr anyone else whose work life interferes with their japa. At least, it prov=\r\nides a solution to doing a bit of japa at work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; If anybody else has any thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name =\r\nconstantly, kindly share. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best wishes, and Om=\r\n Namo Narayanaya, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aparna&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;=\r\n/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---301686607-255972760-1340143726=:69338--\r\n\n"}}
