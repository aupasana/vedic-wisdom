During the last\n=\r\nyear he served as one of his personal attendants. Neal Rosner came to Sri\nR=\r\namanasramam from the USA in 1968, attached himself to Venkatarathnam and\ndi=\r\nligently served him until his passing in 1976. Neal&#39;s immersion into the\nsp=\r\niritual heritage of India under the guidance of Venkatarathnam is\nelaborate=\r\nly described in his book On the Road to Freedom: A Pilgrimage in\nIndia.\n\nNe=\r\nal now resides in Amritanandamayi&#39;s Kerala Ashram and is known as Swami\nPar=\r\namatmananda.\n\nIn the following article, details regarding the life of Venka=\r\ntarathnam have\nbeen extracted from a 25-page essay written about Venkatarat=\r\nhnam by Neal\nRosner. He presented this manuscript to us thirty years ago at=\r\n Sri\nRamanasramam. We have also utilized some material from the above-menti=\r\noned\nbook.\n\nTHE following is what Sri Venkatarathnam personally told me abo=\r\nut himself.\n\nHe was born in Koduru, Krishna District on the 23rd of May 192=\r\n1, and at the\nage of three months his father died of a diabetic carbuncle. =\r\nAt seven his\nUpanayanam was performed and from that day onwards he never fa=\r\niled to repeat\nthe Gayatri mantra for even a day. Even when in Maharshi&#39;s s=\r\nervice, he would\nnot come into his presence without having done some Gayatr=\r\ni beforehand. From\nhis seventh year till his last he performed the yearly S=\r\nraddha of his\nparents. He had deep faith in this and believed that the pitr=\r\nus (departed\nones) would bless him with good health and Brahmajnana. Even w=\r\nhen he was\nphysically in a serious condition, he would somehow struggle and=\r\n do it.\n\nHe went to school in Gudivada, Hyderabad and Guntur in Andhra Prad=\r\nesh. At\nthis time he was somewhat opposed to Hindu orthodoxy and even wrote=\r\n a paper\nfor the uplift of Harijans, about which he laughed while recalling=\r\n later.He\nalso now and then would go to see movies of the bhakti type only.=\r\n He used\nthese occasions at the cinema to test how his mind would react. A =\r\nscorpion\nin Hyderabad once stung him, but being afraid to tell his elders, =\r\nhe simply\nbore the pain until they discovered it and sent him to a doctor. =\r\nWhenever he\nhad free time from his studies, he would either go to a temple =\r\nor do japa,\nsometimes a lakh (100,000) in one day.\n\n\nMarriage Proposal\n\nAft=\r\ner he graduated from school, he thought of using the money from a\nscholarsh=\r\nip he was awarded to go and live in Tiruvannamalai, but his\nbrothers wanted=\r\n him to get married. A rich family who offered a big dowry\nand a lucrative =\r\npost was arranged. Even though his mother knew his\ntemperament she had to k=\r\neep quiet since she was under the influence of her\nother sons. Venkatarathn=\r\nam said that they should first ask his guru, Dass\nGaru, for permission. The=\r\ny searched him out and after finding him proposed\ntheir idea. Dass Garu sai=\r\nd that it would be all right if Venkatarathnam got\nmarried. When the brothe=\r\nrs returned thinking victory was in their hands, Sri\nVenkatarathnam objecte=\r\nd, saying that according to Sastra, a brahmachari must\nfirst serve a Guru b=\r\nefore entering into Grihastashrama (married life). No\none accepted this eva=\r\nsive objection and so he told them that if such a thing\nis not written in t=\r\nhe Sastras, he was ready to burn the Sastras. He asked\nthem to immediately =\r\nbring the Bhagavata and Ramayana and he would set fire\nto them. Naturally t=\r\nhey did not want to be a party to this crime, and so\nthey helplessly let hi=\r\nm go to Arunachalam. He, however, told them that he\nwould go only on an exp=\r\nerimental basis and if it suited him there he would\nstay, otherwise he woul=\r\nd return. At this time one of his brothers declared,\n&quot;You will all see. He =\r\nwill become a sadhu for sure,&quot; and this came out to be\ntrue.\n\n\nAt Ramanasra=\r\nmam\n\nAt the Ashram he was put in charge of the book depot. He later laughed=\r\n when\ntelling this because it seems that one astrologer had told him that h=\r\ne would\nget married and do business and he really thought this is what happ=\r\nened\nbecause he had married Sri Ramana and was selling his books. Afterward=\r\ns he\nbecame an assistant of Sri Niranjanananda Swami, Sri Ramana&#39;s younger\n=\r\nbrother and the Sarvadhikari of the Ashram. Then he was put in charge of th=\r\ne\nAshram library and the books that were kept for the personal use of\nBhaga=\r\nvan. Bhagavan personally taught him to bind and stitch books and also\nto re=\r\nad.\n\n\nBhagavan&#39;s Attendant\n\nIn 1949, Shiv Mohan Lal asked Bhagavan if Sri V=\r\nenkatarathnam could join as\none of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s personal attendants.Bhaga=\r\nvan told that he had no\nobjection but that the office people must give the =\r\npermission, which they\ndid. Bhagavan was very strict in correcting him and =\r\nif anything was done\nimproperly it would be a matter of two days of continu=\r\nous chiding in front\nof all the devotees.\n\nOne evening Sri Venkatarathnam c=\r\name into the hall and quietly went behind\nthe Maharshi and started fanning =\r\nhim. In the morning Bhagavan had told that\nnobody should fan him. Now he ex=\r\nploded and scolded him saying, &quot;Oho, very\ngood, very special, this fellow t=\r\nhinks he is doing a great service. He has\nso much bhakti, much more than th=\r\ne rest of the bhaktas here. Why doesn&#39;t he\ngo and fan all of them and get t=\r\nhe punya (merit) of fanning the devotees of\nthe Guru? He thinks that by his=\r\n tapas he can make me bend to his will.&quot;\nBhagavan spoke like this on and of=\r\nf to every incoming devotee for nearly two\ndays. Finally, when alone with t=\r\nhe Maharshi, Sri Venkatarathnam broke down\nin tears and asked Bhagavan to f=\r\norgive him for having made Bhagavan exert\nhimself so much to correct his fa=\r\nult. Sri Bhagavan graciously said, &quot;Never\nmind, everyone makes a mistake,&quot; =\r\nand that was the end of the matter.\n\nBhagavan then had about six or seven a=\r\nttendants who would serve him taking\nshifts. When it came time to choose sh=\r\nifts, they asked Venkatarathnam which\nshift he wanted. He told them that he=\r\n would take that shift which remains\nafter everyone else had chosen for him=\r\nself. So he got the 10 P.M. to 4 A.M.\nshift, since everyone liked to sleep =\r\nat that time.\n\nThis turned out to be a blessing in disguise, because after =\r\n9.30 P.M. all\nthe bhaktas would go away to sleep and Venkatarathnam and Sri=\r\n Maharshi would\nbe left all alone for the night. It was at this time that S=\r\nri Venkatarathnam\ngot his heart&#39;s desire to be intimately close to Bhagavan=\r\n without others\naround fulfilled. Many nights were spent in spiritual talk =\r\nor simply gazing\non the Divine Face of the Maharshi.\n\n\nFailing Health\n\nBy t=\r\nhis time, Sri Bhagavan&#39;s health was already serious with sarcoma cancer\nin =\r\nthe left arm. At the sight of the blood while dressing the wound, Sri\nVenka=\r\ntarathnam would feel faint. Whenever he would come near Bhagavan,\nMaharshi =\r\nwould rebuke him thus, &quot;Don&#39;t come near me. You people come here\nthinking `=\r\n0h, Bhagavan is sick. He is dying&#39;. I don&#39;t want you to come near\nme when y=\r\nour mind is full of such thoughts. Stay away.&quot; Then Sri\nVenkatarathnam aske=\r\nd Bhagavan that without thinking that Bhagavan is sick or\nthat such and suc=\r\nh a thing must be done to relieve the suffering, how can he\nserve Bhagavan?=\r\n Bhagavan told him that he should simply play his part as in\na drama and do=\r\n whatever is necessary without having any feeling and to have\nthe mental at=\r\ntitude of a witness, attending to the work as the situation\ndemands. After =\r\nthis, he again was permitted to attend on the Maharshi.\nFollowing\nBhagavan&#39;=\r\ns instructions, he began to feel everything as Atma Vilasa (the\nDivine Play=\r\n) and that Bhagavan was simply playing a role as a sick person,\nalthough in=\r\n reality he was the Paramatma Himself.\n\n\nServing Mother\n\nIn 1952 he went to=\r\n serve his mother who was ailing with paralysis and wanted\nhim nearby. She =\r\nhad already spent a year or two at Arunachalam with him in\nthe presence of =\r\nthe Maharshi. When she first came to the Ashram, Sri\nVenkatarathnam went an=\r\nd prostrated to her and returned to the bookstall\nwhere he was working at t=\r\nhat time. On seeing this, Niranjanananda Swamy\nchided him for not showing h=\r\nis mother round the Ashram and finding her a\nplace to stay. He said, &quot;Oho, =\r\nI see, you are a gunatita (beyond all\ndifferences) and need not serve your =\r\nmother, is it?&quot; Then Sri Venkatarathnam\nwent and got her settled in a room,=\r\n since the Sarvadhikari had ordered him\nto do so.\n\nWhenever his mother woul=\r\nd sit in Bhagavan&#39;s presence, she would become\ncompletely unconscious of th=\r\ne world. Even after everyone had gone out for\nfood she would be sitting lik=\r\ne that in trance. She told her son this and he\nsuggested that she sit outsi=\r\nde near a window facing Bhagavan. He later\nrelated that she really had the =\r\nGrace of Bhagavan during her residence\nthere. When others told her that it =\r\nwas a sorry thing that one of her sons\nhad become a sadhu, she retorted and=\r\n said that because she was a woman she\ncould not live as a sadhu but her de=\r\nsire to do so had found its fulfillment\nin her son, Sri Venkatarathnam.\n\nWh=\r\nen he came to serve her in his home, she insisted on taking food only from\n=\r\nhis hands, even though he was not maintaining madi (orthodox procedures). H=\r\ne\nhad personally served and touched the body of the Maharshi and that\nconse=\r\ncrated everything he touched afterward, she thought. She always kept a\nphot=\r\no of the 21-year-old Maharshi by her head. Every day after bathing his\nmoth=\r\ner, he would read to her Bhagavatam, as this was her favorite book.\n\nAs her=\r\n end approached, Sri Venkatarathnam would everyday keep the Darbha\nSeyya (k=\r\nusa grass mat) under her cot, as it was her only wish that she\nshould die o=\r\nn the Darbha Seyya and not on the cot.On the last day he shifted\nher to the=\r\n ground in spite of the cold and damp weather and the objections\nof Venkata=\r\nrathnam&#39;s brothers. Then he kept her head in his lap and plunged\nhimself in=\r\nto dhyana. At that time the same experience of an infinite expanse\nof Grace=\r\n in the heart, which he had had in Sri Ramana&#39;s presence, occurred\nagain, a=\r\nnd it was while he was in this state that his mother expired in his\nhands.\n=\r\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?pg=3Dsep-oct\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1aa10a6fcc40483dbd9af\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sri Venkatarathnam lived with B=\r\nhagavan from 1944 to 1950.

Whenever he would come near Bhagavan, Maharshi would re=\r\nbuke him&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0thus, &quot;Don&#39;t come near me. You people come he=\r\nre thinking `0h, Bhagavan is sick. He is dying&#39;. I don&#39;t want you t=\r\no come near me when your mind is full of such thoughts. Stay away.&quot; Th=\r\nen Sri Venkatarathnam asked Bhagavan that without thinking that Bhagavan is=\r\n sick or that such and such a thing must be done to relieve the suffering, =\r\nhow can he serve Bhagavan?&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Bhagavan t=\r\nold him that he should simply play his part as in a drama and do whatever i=\r\ns necessary without having any feeling and to have the mental attitude of a=\r\n witness, attending to the work as the situation demands.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0After=\r\n this, he again was permitted to attend on the Maharshi.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Following Bhagavan&#39;s instructions, he began to fe=\r\nel everything as Atma Vilasa (the Divine Play) and that Bhagavan was simply=\r\n playing a role as a sick person, although in reality he was the Paramatma =\r\nHimself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Serving Mothe=\r\nr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In 1952 he went to serve h=\r\nis mother who was ailing with paralysis and wanted him nearby.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0=\r\nShe had already spent a year or two at Arunachalam with him in the presence=\r\n of the Maharshi. When she first came to the Ashram, Sri Venkatarathnam wen=\r\nt and prostrated to her and returned to the bookstall where he was working =\r\nat that time. On seeing this, Niranjanananda Swamy chided him for not showi=\r\nng his mother round the Ashram and finding her a place to stay. He said, &q=\r\nuot;Oho, I see, you are a gunatita (beyond all differences) and need not se=\r\nrve your mother, is it?&quot; Then Sri Venkatarathnam went and got her sett=\r\nled in a room, since the Sarvadhikari had ordered him to do so.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Whenever his mother would sit in Bhagavan&#3=\r\n9;s presence, she would become completely unconscious of the world. Even af=\r\nter everyone had gone out for food she would be sitting like that in trance=\r\n. She told her son this and he suggested that she sit outside near a window=\r\n facing Bhagavan. He later related that she really had the Grace of Bhagava=\r\nn during her residence there. When others told her that it was a sorry thin=\r\ng that one of her sons had become a sadhu, she retorted and said that becau=\r\nse she was a woman she could not live as a sadhu but her desire to do so ha=\r\nd found its fulfillment in her son, Sri Venkatarathnam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whe=\r\nn he came to serve her in his home, she insisted on taking food only from h=\r\nis hands, even though he was not maintaining madi (orthodox procedures). He=\r\n had personally served and touched the body of the Maharshi and that consec=\r\nrated everything he touched afterward, she thought. She always kept a photo=\r\n of the 21-year-old Maharshi by her head.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0Every day after bathing his mother, he would read to her Bhagavatam, =\r\nas this was her favorite book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As her end approached, Sri V=\r\nenkatarathnam would everyday keep the Darbha Seyya (kusa grass mat) under h=\r\ner cot, as it was her only wish that she should die on the Darbha Seyya and=\r\n not on the cot.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;On the last day he shifte=\r\nd her to the ground in spite of the cold and damp weather and the objection=\r\ns of Venkatarathnam&#39;s brothers. Then he kept her head in his lap and pl=\r\nunged himself into dhyana. At that time the same experience of an infinite =\r\nexpanse of Grace in the heart, which he had had in Sri Ramana&#39;s presenc=\r\ne, occurred again, and it was while he was in this state that his mother ex=\r\npired in his hands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?pg=3Dsep-oc=\r\nt&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?pg=3Dsep-o=\r\nct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;col=\r\nor:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bot=\r\ntom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=\r\n=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd1aa10a6fcc40483dbd9af--\r\n\n"}}
