But =\r\nat\nthe time, B. V. Narasimha Swami was gathering information and facts in o=\r\nrder\nto write a good biography of Sri Bhagavan in English. However, even be=\r\nfore\nthis English book was published, a Malayalam scholar came one day to h=\r\nave\ndarshan of Sri Bhagavan. As soon as he saw Sri Bhagavan he was inspired=\r\n to\nwrite his biography, since he had the habit of writing the life story i=\r\nn\nMalayalam of any great soul he happen to meet. So immediately after arriv=\r\ning\nhe began to gather information from some local people, asking them, &#39;Wh=\r\no is\nthis Ramana Maharshi?&#39; &#39;Where was he born?&#39; and so on.\n\nNot being fami=\r\nliar with Bhagavan or the understanding that the\nSelf-realization of a Jnan=\r\ni is itself his real greatness, some people\nnaturally imagined that Bhagava=\r\nn should possess all sorts of supernatural\npowers (siddhis) and they theref=\r\nore spread rumors which attributed such\npowers to him, thinking that they w=\r\nere thereby glorifying him. Though\nBhagavan Ramana taught that all siddhis =\r\nare as trivial as straw and are to\nbe regarded as treacherous friends by th=\r\ne spiritual aspirant, even he was\nnot spared from the rumors created by suc=\r\nh people. Unfortunately, it was\nonly from this type of people that the Mala=\r\nyalam scholar quickly gathered\nbiographical information on Bhagavan. Then, =\r\nwithin a day, he edited all his\nnotes and completed writing the biography.\n=\r\n\nNow, according to his biography Bhagavan was a householder, a lawyer from\n=\r\nMadurai who had three children. It was also reported that Sri Ramana\nexhibi=\r\nted a number of siddhis in various places. In this way, many fantastic\nbut =\r\nuntrue incidents were contained in that biography. When he had finished\nwri=\r\nting it, the Malayalam scholar brought the biography to Sri Bhagavan.\n\nAmon=\r\ng those living with Sri Bhagavan at that time, no one knew Malayalam\nexcept=\r\n Kunju Swami, and he happened to be absent on that day. Therefore,\nBhagavan=\r\n, who was himself well versed in Malayalam poetry and literature,\nread the =\r\nwhole biography from beginning to end, stopping only here and there\nto corr=\r\nect some spelling mistakes, and then returned it to the author\nwithout alte=\r\nring even a single statement or idea. Thinking that the\nbiography he had wr=\r\nitten was correct in every respect, having been seen and\ncorrected by Sri B=\r\nhagavan himself, the author was very happy.\n\nSoon the news spread among the=\r\n devotees in the Asramam that the life of Sri\nBhagavan had been written in =\r\nMalayalam. However, since no one knew that\nlanguage, they did not know what=\r\n was written in it. The next day Kunju Swami\nreturned to the Asramam and th=\r\ne devotees all eagerly told him, &quot;This new\ndevotee has written Bhagavan&#39;s b=\r\niography in Malayalam. Bhagavan has also\ngone through it and approved it af=\r\nter making all the necessary corrections.&quot;\n\nWith great surprise and joy, Ku=\r\nnju Swami received the biography from the\nMalayalam scholar and began to re=\r\nad through it. But when he saw the many\nuntrue reports written in it, he wa=\r\ns unable to bear it. He went to the\nauthor and tactfully said to him, &quot;Many=\r\n statements in this biography are\ntotally incorrect! I am afraid that you h=\r\nave not gathered your information\nfrom the proper sources.&quot;\n\nBut with great=\r\n confidence the author replied, &quot;There is not even a single\nmistake in it. =\r\nSee, Bhagavan himself has corrected it with his own pen\nwherever it was nec=\r\nessary. So I am confident that this alone is his correct\nlife history.&quot;\n\nWi=\r\nthout saying anything further, Kunju Swami brought the biography to Sri\nBha=\r\ngavan and complained, &quot;O Bhagavan! Your own handwriting is found here in\nma=\r\nny places, so you must have seen this. But how can this all be true?&quot;\n\n&quot;Are=\r\n all these other things true (pointing to the world), and is this alone\nfal=\r\nse?&quot; replied Sri Bhagavan with a peaceful smile.\n\nThough this sounds humoro=\r\nus, we should notice the profound teaching that\nlies hidden in it. From his=\r\n reply it is clear that the ever-attained\nexperience of Sri Bhagavan, who t=\r\neaches that the world is a mere false\nappearance, is that even the ego, the=\r\n individual who sees the world, is\nitself false. Those who do not know the =\r\nSelf cannot but feel slighted and\nangry if some historical facts in their l=\r\nife, which would have otherwise\ngiven them fame and glory, were omitted or =\r\nwritten about in a distorted\nmanner.\n\nIn this world, which is full of so-ca=\r\nlled great ones who strenuously seek\npraise and publicity for self glorific=\r\nation, how exalted is the greatness of\nBhagavan Ramana who was completely i=\r\nndifferent to any amount of disparaging\nwords written about him! In Bhagava=\r\nn&#39;s view, even the biography we now have,\nwhich records his life as we saw =\r\nit with our own eyes, is as true as this\nMalayalam biography. That is to sa=\r\ny, in Bhagavan&#39;s view, even his birth, his\nattainment of Self-realization, =\r\nhis renunciation and his life as Jagat-Guru\nare just as real or unreal as t=\r\nhis Malayalam biography!\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/200=\r\n5/?pg=3Djan-feb#article.2\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd20bc8793bfd048313b8b2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nSri Niranjananda Swami, the Sarvadhikari of Sri Ramanasramam, de=\r\nsired that the first major biography of Sri Bhagavan should be written in T=\r\namil.
