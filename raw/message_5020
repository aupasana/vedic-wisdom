Traditionally, daily morning rituals of learned brahmanas would consist of offering arghya to Sun, offering tarpana to devas, rishis and pitris (ancestral manes), meditation and a fire ritual.\n \nAs for bowing, one can bow to god present in every object before using an object. Learned ones bow to food and express respect/gratitude to it before eating it. Some do pooja to homa kundam, to ghee bowl and to the wooden spoons used for offering ghee, before the actual homam. Like this, one can bow (or mentally bow) and have an attitude of reverence, respect and gratitude for any object/person that one uses or interacts with. This is conducive to oneday truly realizing the divinity in all. Of course, the key is not the physical act of bowing, but the mental act of feeling reverence and gratitude.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- radha4krsna &lt;maha.ishwardas@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji & Learned Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the ideal/preferred timing for offering tarpana?\n&gt; \n&gt; Reverently,\n&gt; Mahesh\n \n---- radha4krsna &lt;maha.ishwardas@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha Ji & Learned Members,\n&gt; Namaste.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the begining of the &quot;Pitri Tarpana&quot; section it say..\n&gt; &quot;First place the water pot in front of you, bow to it and say the following. This means, &quot;may my ancestors come here and accept my water oblations&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The above instructions suggested to me that we are inviting the ancestors in the water pot (since we bowed down to the water pot). \n&gt; \n&gt; However, Narashima Ji&#39;s today&#39;s post clarifies that we invite the ancestors in the area and not the water pot. Is my understanding correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; If so what is the significance of bowing to the water pot?\n&gt; \n&gt; My appoloiges, if there questions sound very basic.
