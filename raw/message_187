This dasa applies to all people&#39;s charts.\n\nAs I said earlier, I am a little hesitant to teach Chandi homam publicly, \nunlike Mahaganapathi homam. If She inspires me in future to do so, I may.\n\nChandi homam is quite powerful. If one with strong desires performs it well \nfor a period of time, one can fulfil most desires. Thus, there is scope for \nabuse. Of course, the abuse cannot take place unless She wills it. It may be \nHer will to make someone use this in a particular way and some negative \nkarma to be generated. However, the law of &quot;equal reaction to actions&quot; is \nunbreakable and one will have to experience the fruits of the karma \nincurred. To a self-realized person, no karma sticks and hence no fruit of a \nkarma sticks. When someone like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana Maharshi \ngets throat cancer for example, they may remain unaffected by it and see the \nsuffering of the body in the same way a physical pleasure is seen. But, \nsomeone who is not there yet and someone who experiences fruits of different \nkarmas differently still (instead of looking at them the same way), needs to \nbe careful in choosing which karmas to undertake and which to avoid.\n\nOn the other extreme, if one performs Chandi homam well for a period of time \nwithout much desire, She can put one on the fast track and give a high level \nof detachment and very quick spiritual progresss. It can sometimes be too \nquick for the person.\n\nChandi is the union of Mahakaali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati - three root \nenergies behind the creation, sustenance and destruction of this universe. \nShe is the primordial energy of this universe. She is too powerful.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Gaurav Kapur&quot; &lt;groovyacharya@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, February 03, 2008 1:27 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji:\n&gt;\n&gt; Now that this question on spiritual growth has come.\n&gt; What dasha do you suggest to c spiritual growth.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Sanjeev ji,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It happens to everybody. People find their path,\n&gt;&gt; make some progress and then\n&gt;&gt; feel lost again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to\n&gt;&gt; March 2017. Taking Cancer\n&gt;&gt; as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house\n&gt;&gt; will be strong with\n&gt;&gt; Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in\n&gt;&gt; lagna. The 8th house\n&gt;&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords\n&gt;&gt; Saturn and Rahu\n&gt;&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th\n&gt;&gt; house axis strongly\n&gt;&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually\n&gt;&gt; speaking. Just keep\n&gt;&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and\n&gt;&gt; keep doing your sadhana.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and\n&gt;&gt; vimsamsa. This shows devotion\n&gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is\n&gt;&gt; empty and Mercury owns\n&gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests\n&gt;&gt; that worship of Lord\n&gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast\n&gt;&gt; spiritual progress.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@...\n&gt;&gt; (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask\n&gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia.\n&gt;&gt; Swami Suresh Battar is a\n&gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are\n&gt;&gt; available there, he may be\n&gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or\n&gt;&gt; circle shaped vessel\n&gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not\n&gt;&gt; iron) can be used. Good\n&gt;&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct\n&gt;&gt; experience through\n&gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just\n&gt;&gt; surrender to the Lord,\n&gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects\n&gt;&gt; our senses perceive in\n&gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of\n&gt;&gt; the Lord and that we are\n&gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own\n&gt;&gt; impurity. If we keep\n&gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is\n&gt;&gt; overly attracted to or\n&gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful\n&gt;&gt; sadhana. In addition, if\n&gt;&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in\n&gt;&gt; meditation, that too helps.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a\n&gt;&gt; commentary on BhagavadGita by\n&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a\n&gt;&gt; unique saint, who is\n&gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct\n&gt;&gt; dwaitic and adwaitic\n&gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings\n&gt;&gt; coming from knowledge\n&gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and\n&gt;&gt; writings coming from\n&gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More\n&gt;&gt; than 700 years ago,\n&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his\n&gt;&gt; physical body at the age\n&gt;&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT\n&gt;&gt; read a more competent or\n&gt;&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is\n&gt;&gt; quite an inspired work. A\n&gt;&gt; good English translation of this work is available\n&gt;&gt; at\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu\n&gt;&gt; philosophy in my opinion.\n&gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to\n&gt;&gt; come with him to forest,\n&gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the\n&gt;&gt; presence of Maharshi\n&gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned\n&gt;&gt; people, Maharshi Vasishtha\n&gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His\n&gt;&gt; teachings were captured\n&gt;&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga\n&gt;&gt; Vaasishtham&quot;. There is an inspired\n&gt;&gt; English translation available at\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful\n&gt;&gt; reading too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt;&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):\n&gt;&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt;&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Although this is my first writing in this group\n&gt;&gt; but i have been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reading the threads for almost one year now. And\n&gt;&gt; you people have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many\n&gt;&gt; times but now i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what\n&gt;&gt; brought me here( and to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember\n&gt;&gt; the thread where\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of\n&gt;&gt; Sani and now i have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this\n&gt;&gt; thread and from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make\n&gt;&gt; any decisions of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that\n&gt;&gt; there are many\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this\n&gt;&gt; group so if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my\n&gt;&gt; chart and guide me i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given\n&gt;&gt; below:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading\n&gt;&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there\n&gt;&gt; and doing some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have\n&gt;&gt; really seen and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this\n&gt;&gt; was random and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel\n&gt;&gt; that my spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am\n&gt;&gt; thinking of reading more to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read\n&gt;&gt; and from where to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi\n&gt;&gt; Homam on a regular\n&gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed\n&gt;&gt; except the homa kundam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so\n&gt;&gt; can anyone tell me\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in\n&gt;&gt; the ground.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i want to\n&gt;&gt; ask but if someone\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would be very\n&gt;&gt; thankful to him and i will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n\n\n"}}
