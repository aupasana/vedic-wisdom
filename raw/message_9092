Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agendas=\r\n engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha i=\r\ns the witness of it all.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphal=\r\na that is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the kar=\r\nmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act o=\r\nn part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are =\r\nvery complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and pick=\r\ning of agents for their delivery.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; At any time, some karmas fr=\r\nom one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; poo=\r\nl, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool an=\r\nd the rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The=\r\n way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balanci=\r\nng of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The assignment =\r\nand ordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in=\r\n various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter =\r\none&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequen=\r\ncing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As one engages in remedial measures such as prayers, fa=\r\nsting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerab=\r\nilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including planets, =\r\ndeities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who opera=\r\nte through other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). The karma=\r\n pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be downg=\r\nraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. Or, som=\r\ne desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in order w=\r\nithin the same pool.\n&gt; =C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with suffi=\r\ncient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thing can happen. =\r\nIt is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action =\r\nby one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s ka=\r\nrmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma th=\r\nat was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the =\r\nkarma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small=\r\n force, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific re=\r\nsult, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what ritual one=\r\n does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their opt=\r\nional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their opti=\r\nonal pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make=\r\n some difference.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Ch=\r\naritra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s acti=\r\nons, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show favor=\r\nitism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is =\r\na witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the p=\r\nower that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balance and order=\r\n within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, =\r\nfrom the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers j=\r\nust and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using available agents.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline an=\r\nd will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, wi=\r\nth some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thi=\r\nng is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, s=\r\nelfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas=\r\n and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others =\r\nare good karmas.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing =\r\npipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and curren=\r\nt action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shast=\r\nras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One =\r\nthing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be comme=\r\nnsurate with the karma itself.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You need only small force to push=\r\n a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Re=\r\nsources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;_________=\r\n_______________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Dear=C2=\r\n=A0Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elepha=\r\nnt was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it =\r\nwas possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is=\r\n this?=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma =\r\nof the ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of =\r\nthe beggar turned king.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s=\r\n karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chos=\r\nen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the eleph=\r\nant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such =\r\na kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; mea=\r\nns a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are for the=\r\n benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the day, som=\r\ne people with a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their tapas sh=\r\nakti through speech.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pi=\r\npeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that there is a person, an=\r\nd separate from the person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to =\r\nthe person from time to time. We then want someone to come and remove all t=\r\nhe &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us t=\r\nhat a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you=\r\n are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, =\r\nyour vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas=\r\n, you have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier said than done.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment =\r\nwhen your mind becomes agitated is a curse.

We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraks=\r\nha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80&quot; what do this items r=\r\neally do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets=\r\n =E2=80&quot; do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(3)=\r\n I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharasht=\r\nra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot chang=\r\ne `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru r=\r\nejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has only r=\r\neadjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact=\r\n word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. S=\r\no question I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent o=\r\nr it is just our perception that changes?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanking you,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Digamber\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
