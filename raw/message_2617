If one does sadhana for the same \ndeity, one progresses and achieves quickly.\n\nHowever, as I maintain always, our understanding of astrological formulas is \nimperfect. It is not at all easy to figure out the ishta devata from the \nhoroscope. Though there are guidelines from rishis, our understanding of \nthose guidelines is imperfect.\n\nA sadguru will be able to give you better guidance in this matter than an \nastrologer. I say it confidently despite being an astrologer who studied \nvarious ancient and modern Jyotish authors and experimented a lot.\n\n(2) Not knowing the specific form with which one has a strong connection is \nnot as big a hindrance as one may think. If one is not sufficiently pure to \nstart with, worshipping the correct deity does not magically make one \nrealized. It will still take a very very long time. On the other hand, if \none is sufficiently pure already, other deities will guide one towards ishta \ndevata automatically.\n\nSearching for ishta devata is not like searching for a lost object. A deity \nis intelligent unlike a lost object and a deity can pull you towards \nhim/her, if you have an intense desire to make spiritual progress and start \nmaking progress. After all, a mother or father may play hide and seek with a \nchild for a while, but they will not hide for too long if the child is lost \nand confused and unable to find the hiding parent!\n\nIf you learn to be like an innocent and helpless child and if you have a \ngenuine desire to make spiritual progress, your ishta devata will \nautomatically pull you towards him/her.\n\nSo I say that one should not worry too much about such things or run around \nastrologers whose knowledge is imperfect or sometimes downright incorrect. \nPray to whichever deity you feel like praying to and work on your attitude. \nSurrender to that deity. You will be sown your path.\n\n*        *        *\n\nHaving said that, my educated *guess* is that Vishnu will suit you. Probably \nLakshmi Narasimha.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, September 24, 2009 12:50 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] ISHTA DEVATA?\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Guruji\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; you have been always my inspiration and to follow your teachings on \n&gt; astrology and spiritual path, but there are lots of un-answered questions \n&gt; in mind, as resides far from you, have no direct communication with you \n&gt; (if bothered!), increasing day by day...my only way to find answers and \n&gt; increase knowledge is to follow your posts...\n&gt;\n&gt; there is no direct guidance to follow a specific way for me...i am \n&gt; assuming what is happening to me is to be happened! its may be \n&gt; pre-programmed for my life cycle...as i am searching my ISHTA DEVATA, \n&gt; nobody helping me to find him/her out...this is the least necessities for \n&gt; atleast a direct answer...\n&gt;\n&gt; DOB: 5th June, 1975 POB: Calcutta, TOB: 06.04 AM\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards,\n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt;\n&gt; NB: I have noticed some strange combination as follows...\n&gt; 1. my LAGNA LORD MERCURY becomes ATMAKARAKA\n&gt; 2. my 12th from D20 is GEMINI is empty, there is no aspect on it\n\n\n"}}
