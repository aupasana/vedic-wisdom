Everything needed is availab=\r\nle \n&gt; freely on the internet and one doesn&#39;t even need to register with us =\r\nto \n&gt; download the materials. They can anonymously download and try out. I =\r\n\n&gt; find out that someone is doing it, only if they voluntarily send me a \n&gt;=\r\n mail to tell me so or to ask a question!\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, the &quot;futile exercise=\r\n&quot; has already enabled atleast 2000 people to \n&gt; do homam by themselves and =\r\nso many people emailed me saying they&#39;ve been \n&gt; doing homam for a few mont=\r\nhs and see a lot of positive change in \n&gt; thmselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, whatever s=\r\nadhana one does, homam or japam or service to people or \n&gt; whatever, intern=\r\nal purity is what enables it to work.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, re=\r\ngarding the definition of &quot;purity&quot;, well, it can be defined in \n&gt; many ways=\r\n. You said: &quot;one should remember bhagavad gita - Do your duty \n&gt; without ex=\r\npecting anything in return&quot;. In other words, based on what one \n&gt; sees as o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma, one should perform actions firmly (as though one \n&gt; is passion=\r\nate about a particular end result), and yet absolutely \n&gt; prepared to face =\r\nany end result in the end (i.e. if the end result is \n&gt; different from the =\r\ngoal, one doesn&#39;t become sad and thinks of what to do \n&gt; NOW). Such a perso=\r\nn is most effective and untouched by karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can define purity as the=\r\n level at which the above principle guides \n&gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts, wo=\r\nrds and actions. Not just making lofty \n&gt; statements to impress others, but=\r\n having enough self-control internally \n&gt; to always focus on the current ac=\r\ntion, do the best possible action and \n&gt; be unaffected by the result in the=\r\n end. How well one can follow that \n&gt; principle is a measure of how pure on=\r\ne is. Other people may not be able \n&gt; to see how pure one is, but one&#39;s own=\r\n conscience does.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The catch is that the purer=\r\n one is, one knows one&#39;s dharma (duty) \n&gt; clearer. Each person&#39;s dharma is =\r\ndifferent, based on one&#39;s debts from \n&gt; previous lives and one&#39;s skills. Na=\r\nture expects different things from \n&gt; different people. Knowing one&#39;s dharm=\r\na is not easy. An impure and highly \n&gt; conditioned consciousness sees its d=\r\nharma through the colored glass of \n&gt; that conditioning and sees it incorre=\r\nctly. Nevertheless, if one keeps \n&gt; performing best actions with nishkama (=\r\ni.e. prepared for any end \n&gt; result), eventually one&#39;s conditioning drops, =\r\none becomes purer, one&#39;s \n&gt; conscience speaks louder and louder and one kno=\r\nws one dharma clearer and \n&gt; clearer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Conditioning or vasana is what m=\r\nakes you like and dislike things, want \n&gt; and avoid things/people etc. It i=\r\ns what makes it difficult to accept all \n&gt; end results of actions equally. =\r\nIt is what makes it difficult to engage \n&gt; in some actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; As one doe=\r\ns sadhana, one does not make much progress for a while. Once \n&gt; one crosses=\r\n a threshhold, one falls into the groove and starts making \n&gt; progress. One=\r\n&#39;s dharma starts to become clearer and one&#39;s conditioning \n&gt; starts to drop=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       =\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Venkat Rao &lt;mail2venkyra=\r\no@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pranaam Narasimha ji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Planetary kavachas are n=\r\not prescribed by Parasara as a remedy.The BPHS \n&gt; &gt; book i have gives speci=\r\nfic remedial measures for each planetary \n&gt; &gt; malevolence\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  (With ad=\r\nvancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in \n&gt; &gt; many religi=\r\nons and now finally in Hinduism too!

In the beginning, one may start with blind faith, =\r\nbut \n&gt; &gt; eventually one has to know by experience. Otherwise, it is not of =\r\nmuch \n&gt; &gt; use. The problem in the world right now is that there are many \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; relgions led by people who have not experienced god in any manner and \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; yet leading people. This has resulted in people fighting and killing \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; in the name of god.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, coming ba=\r\nck to your question, I did not say planetary kavachas \n&gt; &gt; are a much. In f=\r\nact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kavacham are \n&gt; &gt; better for most =\r\npeople. In fact, any prayer can protect one, if one \n&gt; &gt; does with enough i=\r\nntensity for enough duration.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I never s=\r\naid or will say that doing a particular ritual or mantra is \n&gt; &gt; the only w=\r\nay to solve a particular problem or to experience a \n&gt; &gt; particular aspect =\r\nof god. Just as one can reach a mountain top from \n&gt; &gt; various sides using =\r\nvarious paths, one can reach god using various \n&gt; &gt; paths. God is not elsew=\r\nhere, but within us. But, the conditioning \n&gt; &gt; accumulated thru many lives=\r\n makes us look at things with attraction \n&gt; &gt; and aversion and mind vibrate=\r\ns with attraction, aversion, pride, \n&gt; &gt; shame, anger, jealosy etc. If mind=\r\n becomes nearly still, one can be in \n&gt; &gt; bliss and the divine energy withi=\r\nn expresses outside. The goal of \n&gt; &gt; various relgions is to take the mind =\r\nto that state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many ways to facilitate that. Chanting a s=\r\nacred combinations \n&gt; &gt; of syllables with a focused mind is one way. In my =\r\nopinion, one can \n&gt; &gt; achieve one-pointedness of mind with any syllable com=\r\nbination. Mind \n&gt; &gt; achieving one-pointedness with any mantra and/or mental=\r\n imagery is a \n&gt; &gt; good thing. But depending the mantra/imagery, a differen=\r\nt kind of \n&gt; &gt; energy envelopes that focused mind, purifies it and affects =\r\nit. It \n&gt; &gt; just so happens that many great realized yogis came on the bles=\r\nsed \n&gt; &gt; land of India and cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; religions also, many people have experienced one-pointedness of mind \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n on a thought/imagery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A \n&gt; &gt; mu=\r\nslim can take a surah from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nufi saints did experience divinity like that. Also, there are paths \n&gt; &gt; ot=\r\nher than meditation. Serving others and trying to see god in all is \n&gt; &gt; a =\r\nvalid path too. Oneday, mind can experience god that way too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While=\r\n other areas of the world had their share of realized souls, \n&gt; &gt; India had=\r\n just too many of them. What is known today as Hinduism has a \n&gt; &gt; rich lib=\r\nrary of knowledge from their experiences and revelations. One \n&gt; &gt; can try =\r\na path that was traversed by others and is well-understood. It \n&gt; &gt; does no=\r\nt mean those on the other side of the mountain are doomed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing homams or not doing homams or any other hindu wo=\r\nrship method\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Japam and homam are not the monopoly of any religion a=\r\nnd not just \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hindu worship methods&quot;. People who meditated with special=\r\n chants and \n&gt; &gt; experienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in ever=\r\ny part of \n&gt; &gt; the world and in every religion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As for homam, sacre=\r\ndness of fire and the ability to connect to the \n&gt; &gt; divine faster when usi=\r\nng fire, was known to many religions. Not only \n&gt; &gt; Hindus, but native Amer=\r\nicans worshipped god in fire, Zoroastrians did \n&gt; &gt; it, ancient Greco-Roman=\r\ns did it, some Buddhists did it, some south \n&gt; &gt; Americans did it, some Sca=\r\nndinavians did it, and so on. There are \n&gt; &gt; references in Bible of even No=\r\nah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses \n&gt; &gt; having worshipped god in fire. For=\r\n example, GENESIS 8:20 says &quot;And \n&gt; &gt; Noah builded an altar unto the Lord; =\r\nand took of every clean beast, \n&gt; &gt; and of every clean fowl, and offered bu=\r\nrnt offerings on the altar&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; The Korban Olah (&quot;whole offering&quot;) of Jud=\r\naism, where a whole animal \n&gt; &gt; was burnt in fire, is very similar to &quot;poor=\r\nnaahuti&quot; (whole offering) \n&gt; &gt; of homam where a full coconut symbolizing he=\r\nad or ego is burnt in \n&gt; &gt; fire. The seven candles of minorah, an integral =\r\npart of judaism, \n&gt; &gt; remind us of the seven tongues of Agni.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; New T=\r\nestament refers to baptism with fire (baptism is purification by \n&gt; &gt; sprin=\r\nkling or dipping in holy water). John the Baptist says, &quot;I indeed \n&gt; &gt; bapt=\r\nize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me \n&gt; &gt; is m=\r\nightier than I =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C He will baptize you with the Holy S=\r\npirit and \n&gt; &gt; fire.&quot; (MATTHEW 3:11). Purification with fire is superior to=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; purification with water. Note that fire is clubbed with Holy Spirit \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; here. In Veda also, fire is used as a symbol of Self.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Many seek=\r\ners in many religions achieved the ascension of individual \n&gt; &gt; consciousne=\r\nss into cosmic consciousness using the medium of fire. With \n&gt; &gt; advancing =\r\nKali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in many \n&gt; &gt; religions and =\r\nnow finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like \n&gt; &gt; sub-period wit=\r\nhin Kali yuga is coming again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BTW, the under construction website =\r\nhttp://FireYoga.net has some more \n&gt; &gt; information along these lines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Ta=\r\nrpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Venkat Rao=\r\n &lt;mail2venkyrao@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Pranaam Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In t=\r\nhis world,population of Hindus are less compared to Muslims and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; there=\r\n are people following different religion.Most of the other \n&gt; &gt;&gt; religion d=\r\no not incorporate worshipping planets - be it  with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; -sincere worship =\r\nor insincere worship or doing homams or not doing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; homams or any other=\r\n hindu worship method.If that is the case how do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; we see planets prote=\r\ncting them.Please do not answer this with answers \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;fa=\r\nte&quot; as they are nothing but excuses since your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mail below claims to b=\r\ne very scientific and  result oriented for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; performed actions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Eg-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times everyday and does it =\r\nfor 40-60 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; days, then some kind of results can be expected.

Even the kavacha of 8th lord \n&gt; &gt;&gt; or 6th lord will =\r\nnot harm one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavach=\r\na, Venus will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; protect one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to sho=\r\nulders (3rd), \n&gt; &gt;&gt; untimely death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems i=\r\nn anus/genital \n&gt; &gt;&gt; area (8th) etc. There may be other things based on oth=\r\ner factors like \n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspects, occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature,=\r\n Venus may also \n&gt; &gt;&gt; protect in the matters of love, romance, creativity e=\r\ntc also. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Bottomline is that the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the=\r\n planet \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is conducive to will be protected by the planet&#39;s energy.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, but =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no harm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\naspects they want to protect and doing their kavacha will protect \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tho=\r\nse aspects.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dis=\r\npositor of lagna \n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even b=\r\netter will be to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; chant the kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Ou=\r\nt of all the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; kavachas I have seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; SrimadBhagavatam) and Chandi Kavacha are the most potent kavachas.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But please note that chanting a kavacha once or twice or even once o=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt;&gt; twice a day is hardly sufficient. If one has enough purity already,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; most mantras work right away. But most of us have very dense \n&gt; &gt;&gt; c=\r\nonditioning and the energy of mantras gets dispersed. The energy of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe planet/deity of the kavacha we chant cannot form a sheath around \n&gt; &gt;&gt; u=\r\ns easily. It requires intense sadhana for most people. If one chants \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\na kavacha 10-30 times everyday and does it for 40-60 days, then some \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nkind of results can be expected. Intense sadhana with any mantra is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; n=\r\needed for most people to see some results. Getting things done by a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; p=\r\nrofessional priest is also not that useful, as there are very very \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fe=\r\nw priests with the required purity, the ability to identify with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; your=\r\n problem and the ability to transfer the energy. For most people, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the=\r\n best solution is to learn and chant by themselves.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 AM, monkeymonkeyking10=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste all,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I sincerely hope our moderator for=\r\ngives this question which I also \n&gt; &gt;&gt; posted on the jyotish forum...I am a=\r\n bit unclear about Kavacha for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the planets.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, if=\r\n a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have problems \n&gt; &gt;&gt; during his dash=\r\na, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;counter-balanc=\r\ning&quot; planet that was strong in one&#39;s chart?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Raj=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
