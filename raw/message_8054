Arjuna was not a Jivan muktha or even vidEha muktha that life. =\r\nOne tradition states that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta Kannappa=\r\n) who becomes a devotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat itself the se=\r\ned for this was sown in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight for a wild b=\r\noar they hunted). It is in that Kannappa life that he attains to mukti at s=\r\nrI kALahasti. In Kurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a certain state of unco=\r\nnditioned awareness or consciousness due to the dilemma and circumstances o=\r\nf the war and Krishna utilized that receptivity(arising out of utter helple=\r\nssness and hence willingness to surrender) to give him glimpses of the Vira=\r\nt swarupam. You can liken the viswaroopam event to Ramakrishna making Naren=\r\ndra experience divinity by placing his feet on the chest. \n&gt; \n&gt; I think Nar=\r\nasimha gAru&#39;s second post on jIvan mukta was relatively straight and clear =\r\non the concept. The other points I&#39;ll add is that action done by tri-karana=\r\ns do result in consequence(s) to the doer (as long as the action was done w=\r\nhile doer holds conditioned identity). All this accumulates in the sanchita=\r\n (warehouse) of the doer and a portion of it gets allotted as prarabdha for=\r\n a given life. This prarabdha one has to experience whether they are libera=\r\nted or not. Removal of conditioning does drop the entire Sanchita (breaks t=\r\nhe thread that is holding the Sanchita to the being) but prarabdha itself h=\r\nolds as this was already allotted and in itself is the primary cause for th=\r\ne embodied life of that being. If you drop prarabdha you drop the body and =\r\nhence life too. Because that karmic structure is what glues the jIva and th=\r\ne sarIra. A jIvan mukta had dropped all conditioning and hence his bondages=\r\n to all sanchita is gone. No new bondage is established for newer actions (=\r\nagAmi) because the actions now are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance=\r\n(mAya). These actions themselves can have consequences but they are not tie=\r\nd to him and hence not attached/directed at him. They &#39;can&#39; even attack the=\r\nir prArabdha to alter it if neeeded, but as they had already become pure wi=\r\ntnesses than agenda driven conditioned individuals, they generally don&#39;t ge=\r\nt into that and experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn naturally.=\r\n They also have capabilities to create and accumulate &#39;conscious and measur=\r\ned quantity and quality of sanchita&#39; to be available as prarabdha for a fut=\r\nure life, if they intend to re-incarnate. However, whether the &#39;veil of mAy=\r\na&#39; was put consciously by oneself or was eternally present as we forgot tha=\r\nt we put it ourselves, as long as the veil is on us there will be an amount=\r\n of conditioning and ignorance. The main difference is that just as a man w=\r\nho puts a veil on his face sees blurred but is fully aware that he can anyt=\r\nime lift the veil at his own will to see through clearly, a re-incarnated a=\r\nvatAra also knows that the veil of mAya was put on for a purpose and can be=\r\n dropped once the purpose is served. The case of rest of us is that of a ma=\r\nn who put the veil a long time ago but totally forgot about that i.e. a) th=\r\nat the veil exists and is interfering with his vision and b) that the veil =\r\nwas put by himself and it is within his own control to remove it. Hence we =\r\ndo all sadhana to recognize that distinction between the veil and ourselves=\r\n and thus drop the veil. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -Prasad\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste - Well, I s=\r\ntill don&#39;t get it.

One&#39;s=\r\n experiences and actions are due to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the momentum set in motion by pr=\r\neviously present conditioning. One \n&gt; &gt; &gt; engages in them with no agendas, =\r\nlikes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a jeevanmukta operates the p=\r\nrevious identity till the momentum comes to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a screeching halt and th=\r\nen the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are returned to the or=\r\niginal sources from which they were borrowed and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; made sentient. But =\r\na jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while \n&gt; &gt; &gt; operating with an ident=\r\nity, for binding comes from the conditioning and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not from identifica=\r\ntion or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not any better o=\r\nr any extra freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to oper=\r\nate an identity after some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, that time depending on the strength=\r\n of prior momentum! It can be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; days or months or years or centuries o=\r\nr millennia.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for s=\r\nome beings (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operat=\r\ne an identity for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; very long time after conditioning drops off comp=\r\nletely. It may even be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the entire duration of Creation.

I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these are not e=\r\nasy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (external \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication). I p=\r\nray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than vaikhari i=\r\nn the following words so that people can understand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better (not yo=\r\nu Manish, the goal of answering your questions is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously not to=\r\n impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perhaps benefit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some others w=\r\nho may be ready - now or in future).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne problem is not identification. The problem is *conditioning* \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (li=\r\nkes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ident=\r\nification) evaporates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it=\r\n is normal mukti. If ahamkara (identification) remains while chitta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one engages in an action w=\r\nith zero conditioning, then there is no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karma and there are no rin=\r\nas created. Actions (physical or mental) by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves do not bind=\r\n one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bind one! It is the l=\r\nikes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta)=\r\n behind an action that bind one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If som=\r\nebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\nody and engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhowever subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), then \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction which will in \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one identified with when =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is exper=\r\nienced, all the conditioning may be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overcome and one may become je=\r\nevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion before one became jeeva=\r\nnmukta will continue to affect the body, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, =\r\ni.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with. But, because the=\r\nre is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, no likes a=\r\nnd dislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tries to modify=\r\n the happenings to what one is identifying with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more pain=\r\n in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning in chitta \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identify=\r\ning with a body, one does not view it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as something his own and som=\r\nething that must be kept in a particular \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. He identifies with=\r\n it, but has no agendas for it. All that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes from conditioning i=\r\nn chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (libera=\r\nted I-ness) views what one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of port=\r\nions borrowed from various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Merc=\r\nury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation =\r\nof Light itself. One does not view \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is m=\r\ne, I need to use it to pursue X or Y \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;thi=\r\ns is me. I am made of portions borrowed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e.=\r\n various manifestations of Light. I observe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what =\r\nthey do, and I have no agenda pursue using \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is =\r\nthe essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra =\r\nPushpam that we were discussing a while back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I repeat, identificat=\r\nion is not the problem. It is the conditioning \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives how one=\r\n uses what one identifies with, that is the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself better, thou=\r\ngh, given how \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, some people ma=\r\ny still get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. J=\r\nust keep doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thing!). I a=\r\nm grateful to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vasishtha for giving me this opp=\r\nortunity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got throat cancer because=\r\n of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the kaarmik =\r\npower of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at the tim=\r\ne) can be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debated.

I await your reply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind=\r\nest regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@ =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want to answer a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange between my guru Manish and me =\r\non \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quote=\r\nd at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone is interest=\r\ned in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following question posed =\r\nby Manish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind i=\r\ns this: was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer w=\r\nith throat \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (ac=\r\ncording to your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =\r\n=C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * =\r\nLet me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; loose=\r\nly (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\na jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ins=\r\nentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; b=\r\nut of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nrinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; continues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeev=\r\nanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; l=\r\neaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). =\r\nOn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ig=\r\nnored \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body kee=\r\nps \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in m=\r\notion \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned ex=\r\nperiences \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while aft=\r\ner the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas k=\r\neep working \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriya=\r\ns may sense \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that inp=\r\nut and register \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and=\r\n draw various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow fo=\r\nod, it hurts even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it=\r\n feels better&quot; etc). A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chit=\r\nta) says &quot;I should overcome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of =\r\nvarious things to do and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned=\r\n being has no such \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though one may feel and expres=\r\ns the pain and other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it diff=\r\nerently. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82  =C3=82=\r\n  =C3=82 * This is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at making \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; objective observations and rational deductions, but, by themselves, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither like something nor dislike =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallma=\r\nrk \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishn=\r\na was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to express y=\r\nour question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pai=\r\nn? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I hav=\r\ne already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body,=\r\n various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi =\r\nof a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is i=\r\nntact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthose things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi keep experiencing and doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous momentum set by the play \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are al=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infus=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat=\r\n is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people=\r\n who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not rea=\r\nlly jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the=\r\n state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; book. The ent=\r\nire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed an=\r\nd elaborate definition and characterization of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. The=\r\nre may be other books that explain better how to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadha=\r\nnas to progress spiritually and get closer to being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated one=\r\nday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living =\r\nactually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of cours=\r\ne, one can say that this is merely an intellectual exercise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as fa=\r\nr as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ever \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; becom=\r\ne a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confid=\r\nent tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. That is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; h=\r\now I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ig=\r\nnore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really, fulfilling all rnas, wait for =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilli=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called rnas?=\r\n If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out themsel=\r\nves, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body =\r\nhe or she \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actually =\r\nsees the rnas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not =\r\nto you. You are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you=\r\n want, Atma, etc. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light =\r\nwas never bound. So, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it =\r\nhave rnas? If these &quot;rnas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after =\r\none bcomes jeevanmukta, what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are =\r\nright. The mind thought, that, it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this l=\r\night. That is the original problem. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born wit=\r\nh. Rnas arise from this identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r n=\r\not that, so u r not bound, when the mind \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;M=\r\nukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginn=\r\ning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the =\r\nmind? When a mind identifies with light & bcomes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it h=\r\nv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on=\r\n and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject=\r\n to this? because, that person although aware of the light at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all=\r\n times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed d \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n mind to identify as that light at all times, key word being &quot;all&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with light \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebod=\r\ny, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, mo=\r\nst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light for=\r\never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanm=\r\nukti is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from light? In=\r\n fact, is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing t=\r\nhe play of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are contr=\r\nadictory \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back wh=\r\nat u owe. And \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r tru=\r\nly free. Words \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused.=\r\n Manish: Will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-=\r\n) But, as far as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained a=\r\ns clearly & \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. Manis=\r\nh: The question \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta=\r\n? If so, Why did he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he was not ident=\r\nifying with his actions? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretation of Vas=\r\nistha&#39;s definition??) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a single de=\r\nfinition. His entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmu=\r\nkta! Will answer ur RK qn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &lt;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/=\r\nterms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
