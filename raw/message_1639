An a=\r\nstronomical phenomenon resulting from proximity between two planets. It aff=\r\nects their power to produce any result. The planets involved in this relati=\r\nonship are rendered unable to bestow their beneficence, and become inauspic=\r\nious. Such a situation occurs when a planet other than Moon or the nodes (R=\r\nahu.or Ketu) is situated within 50 of the Sun. The planet so placed is cons=\r\nidered Asthagatha or combust. When such a relationship takes place with Moo=\r\nn, it is known as Saniaagama, or combination. Any of the five nonluminaries=\r\n within 50 of any other planet causes planetary warfare, or Graha yudiza, a=\r\nnd one of the two involved in this relationship is said to be vanquished an=\r\nd the other is a victor. The victorious planet produces powerful auspicious=\r\n effects, while the vanquished one becomes inauspicious. The house in which=\r\n this phenomenon occurs is destroyed and the individual suffers throughout =\r\nhis life in respect to that Bhava (q.v.). There are five kinds of planetary=\r\n warfare, viz., Bhedam, Ullekham, Amsumardhanam, Apasauyam, and Yuddham. Bh=\r\nedain occurs when two planets are within 50 of each other though in differe=\r\nnt asterisms. When they are between 30 and 50 of each other located in the =\r\nsame asterism, they are in Ullekha yuddham. When such planets are within a =\r\ndistance of 10 to 30 of each other in the same asterism, the relationship i=\r\ns known as Amsumardlianam. If the planets are within one degree of the othe=\r\nr, they are known as in Graha yuddham proper. If one of the two planets wit=\r\nhin 50 of each other is direct while the other is retrograde, they form Apa=\r\nsavya Yuddham. The effects of planetary warfare depends upon the conditions=\r\n classified under Poura Graha, Akranta Graha, and Akrita or Yayee Graha. Po=\r\nura Graha is a planet in a state of opposition to another. Akranta Graha is=\r\n the overpowered, chased, or eclipsed planet. Akriti Graha is generally agg=\r\nressive on the move. The Sun is Poura up to 11 a.m., Akranta at noon, and A=\r\nkrita or feeble in the afternoon. Moon is always overpowered. Mercury, Jupi=\r\nter, and Saturn are always in opposition (Poura), while Mars, Venus, Rahu, =\r\nand Ketu are always aggressive. The effect of Graha yuddha is conditioned b=\r\ny the mood of these planets as indicated above. A planet with earlier longi=\r\ntude is said to defeat the planet ahead of it. A planet in southern hemisph=\r\nere is considered defeated. But Venus is always victorious. The planet with=\r\n a fairly larger orb than the other becomes victorious.

XVII).\n\n=3D&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/astro-help-&quot;&gt;Visit this =\r\ngroup\n\n=3D&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/astro-help-&quot;&gt;Visit this group\n=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/astro-help-&quot;&gt;Visit this group\n\n=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.google.com/group/astro-help-&quot;&gt;Visit this group\n\n\n=3D&quot;http://groups.go=\r\nogle.com/group/astro-help-&quot;&gt;Visit this group\n\n\n\n"}}
