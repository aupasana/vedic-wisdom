Who are we ..\n&gt; to worry about ot=\r\nhers? They, their god and their gurus will feel \n&gt; sorry for them and do so=\r\nmething about them. Apne ko kya lena dena?

If I thought so, I would not be doi=\r\nng so many things I do, like replying to mails, putting together homam manu=\r\nals etc. My comment 3 came after the first 2. I was just trying to bring in=\r\n another angle after the first two.\n=A0\nOne cannot stop focussing inwards a=\r\nnd correcting oneself ever. Even a yogi who is able to change the spiritual=\r\n lives of millions cannot drop guard and has to be looking inwards. That wa=\r\ns my point.\n=A0\nIt is good to help others and try to be &quot;instrumental in th=\r\neir path to know the truth&quot;. However, after engaging in action that one&#39;s j=\r\nudgment says one should engage in, one should earnestly surrender the doers=\r\nhip to the Lord and move on. It is not worthwhile to cling on to the owners=\r\nhip of too many actions for too long as people normally do. In fact, it is =\r\na big problem. People don&#39;t realize it. One getting used to cancer and livi=\r\nng with it for 50 years=A0may forget how it is to live without that disease=\r\n. Similarly, a being used to living with this cancer (of persistent mental =\r\nownership of many many many actions) for many lives may forget how it is to=\r\n live without that disease!\n=A0\nAfter all rituals like pooja and=A0homam, w=\r\ne do say &quot;sarvam sree krishnaarpanamastu&quot; .=A0Though people say it without =\r\nunderstanding, it means that you surrender the action finished just now to =\r\nKrishna. After that, you are not the owner. You should really feel that way=\r\n.\n=A0\nOne can adopt that attitude to everything in life, do the action as p=\r\nerfectly as one can and then surrender the doership to the Lord. Unfortunat=\r\nely, many people do good things and cling on to the ownership within their =\r\nmind for too long. This causes many problems and also binds one. Pride that=\r\n they did something good or sadness that they missed something or happiness=\r\n that a good result came from that action or sadness that the intended resu=\r\nlt did not happen start eating one&#39;s mind later on and stop the mind from a=\r\ncting optimally on *future actions*. If one truly surrenders the ownership =\r\nof every action after the action finishes, one forms a distance between one=\r\nself and the results that the actions may bring later on. That distance is =\r\nreally needed for a stable and blissful state of mind and optimum output fr=\r\nom one&#39;s mind.\n=A0\n&gt; I remember reading in Scott Peck&#39;s book -The Roads Les=\r\ns Travelled, \n&gt; that to lose ones ego and to realize oneself, an ego must b=\r\ne present \n&gt; in the first place. I liked that statement very much because i=\r\nt is \n&gt; from his book that I am first reading a statement in that line of \n=\r\n&gt; thought. Everywhere people condemn ego and speak of losing ego as the \n&gt; =\r\nway to realize God. But nobody has ever said that an ego is necessary \n&gt; to=\r\n lose it.\n=A0\nQuite honestly, ego IS present in all beings by default, incl=\r\nuding the lowest beings like amoeba and bacteria. A discussion of the neces=\r\nsity of ego to be present is superfluous, as ego IS present anyway in all b=\r\neings. By the way, ego in our literature does not mean &quot;egotism&quot;=A0or self-=\r\nimportance or pride (which are the meaning in which the word is used these =\r\ndays). Ego simply means self-consciousness and self-awareness. They are alw=\r\nays there in all beings=A0and it is an uphill climb to lose them by introsp=\r\necting each thought, word and action of oneself.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimh=\r\na\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n=\r\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri =\r\nTarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- \n=A0\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups .com, &quot;jyothi_b_lakshmi&quot; &lt;jyot=\r\nhi_b_lakshmi@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Narasimhji,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all let m=\r\ne thank you for spending some time to reply to my \n&gt; questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I spec=\r\nifically liked the below comments of yours:\n&gt; &quot;A mind is a mind is a mind. =\r\nMind creates the world, not necessarily \n&gt; a human mind. All minds can crea=\r\nte a world. However, a human mind is \n&gt; more capable than other minds to br=\r\neak down that created world and \n&gt; return to the source. THAT is the point.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; May be the world we perceive now is the creation of human mind, and =\r\n\n&gt; as you said, there may be many other worlds created by many other \n&gt; min=\r\nds other than that of humans and since we are not the creators we \n&gt; are un=\r\nable to see/comprehend them. \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Your question is kind of an oxymoron. C=\r\nan good aghoris become &quot;well-\n&gt; known&quot; and come to limelight? :-)&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; (I =\r\ndid not know the meaning of oxymoron. Had to look dictionary :((. \n&gt; Well, =\r\nI understand your point. Aghoris cannot be well-known for \n&gt; obvious reason=\r\ns. May be Aghoris know that people who are not as much \n&gt; evolved as them w=\r\nill not be able to understand their path and hence \n&gt; stay away from public=\r\nity.=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; I am least interested in Vamamarga. I just had a curiosity to=\r\n know if \n&gt; any body was successful in that path. (Your reference to Vamama=\r\nrga \n&gt; and its dangers made me think of the success rate of that path and i=\r\nf \n&gt; really such people existed. That&#39;s all. (Personally, I DO NOT want \n&gt; =\r\nany Aghori to appear as my Guru, though I would wish a saint from \n&gt; Right =\r\nhand path to appear before me IFF and when I am eligible (if \n&gt; not in this=\r\n birth, in any future birth)!!. This is not biasing, just \n&gt; a personal tas=\r\nte. \n&gt; \n&gt; I enjoyed reading Aghora =96Kundalini- so well written and genuin=\r\ne. But \n&gt; as you said, the other book on Left Hand Path by Swaboda was a ki=\r\nnd \n&gt; of shock to me, initially. And it was good to know that such paths \n&gt;=\r\n also existed. But after that it didn&#39;t affect me at all because I \n&gt; under=\r\nstood it is just another path. Why should I bother about how and \n&gt; why it =\r\nis so when we have a more acceptable and beautiful path? \n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Now, I wo=\r\nuld like to reply to the 3rd comment of yours:\n&gt; &quot;(3) Actually, more than o=\r\nthers, feel sorry for yourself. Who are we \n&gt; to worry about others? They, =\r\ntheir god and their gurus will feel \n&gt; sorry for them and do something abou=\r\nt them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We \n&gt; are first responsible for ourselves. W=\r\nhen one cannot change self and \n&gt; focus attention on god fully within onese=\r\nlf, what is the point in \n&gt; lamenting about the spirituality or lack of it =\r\nin other people? So, \n&gt; we should all try to look inward and take a critica=\r\nl look at \n&gt; ourselves, given that we got a very very very valuable life as=\r\n a \n&gt; human being.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Here you made me feel as if I did a mistake in res=\r\nponding to my \n&gt; cousin as well as asking you the questions. I might be wro=\r\nng in both. \n&gt; But what I feel is though it might be irritating and meaning=\r\nless to \n&gt; answer the queries of an agnostic; we cannot override the chance=\r\n of \n&gt; us being instrumental in their path to know the truth. Every person,=\r\n \n&gt; who has a quest to find the truth, be it spiritually or \n&gt; scientifical=\r\nly (as my cousin who says he will try to solve the \n&gt; mystery of life in a =\r\nscientific way) will have to under go a lot of \n&gt; conflicts at the initial =\r\nstages. Since we are all accustomed to find \n&gt; answers through reasoning, e=\r\nverybody initially starts thinking \n&gt; logically to get an answer which ulti=\r\nmately leads to a dead end. Once \n&gt; that way ends, one starts looking withi=\r\nn, and after a lot of practice \n&gt; finally realizes that what logic couldn&#39;t=\r\n find, could be found by \n&gt; practice of concentrating within. This realizat=\r\nion that nobody can \n&gt; answer ones questions, but only oneself, is achieved=\r\n after a lot of \n&gt; queries which may be directed to oneself and to many. To=\r\n my cousin, I \n&gt; may be a part of that `many&#39;. It is not that I worry about=\r\n others \n&gt; spirituality, but I feel, just as many people acted as catalyst =\r\nin my \n&gt; spiritual journey, I too might act a as a catalyst, to others, eve=\r\nn \n&gt; if I don&#39;t have anything worthwhile to share, and even if I might not =\r\n\n&gt; be aware of my role. My inability to answer his question might be one \n&gt;=\r\n reason that will catalyze his thoughts further to know more about \n&gt; other=\r\n ways and may be, he will ultimately realize the truth. But till \n&gt; then, t=\r\nhe path and people on that path are important. I am saying \n&gt; this from my =\r\nexperience, when I was tortured by many spiritual quests \n&gt; and many people=\r\n&#39;s answers (be it satisfactory or unsatisfactory) \n&gt; helped me to advance. =\r\nSo I feel it might be the same with others. \n&gt; \n&gt; I remember reading in Sco=\r\ntt Peck&#39;s book -The Roads Less Travelled, \n&gt; that to lose ones ego and to r=\r\nealize oneself, an ego must be present \n&gt; in the first place. I liked that =\r\nstatement very much because it is \n&gt; from his book that I am first reading =\r\na statement in that line of \n&gt; thought. Everywhere people condemn ego and s=\r\npeak of losing ego as the \n&gt; way to realize God. But nobody has ever said t=\r\nhat an ego is necessary \n&gt; to lose it. Nobody ever spoke of the `necessity&#39;=\r\n and importance of \n&gt; ego to realize God. Scott Peck made it very clear tha=\r\nt if not having \n&gt; an ego is a sign of realization, then all children shoul=\r\nd be self-\n&gt; realized yogis, but in fact they are not. They become yogis wh=\r\nen they \n&gt; develop an ego and then lose it. May be this is the way Divine M=\r\nother \n&gt; wants it to happen. Someway, I liked what Scott Peck said. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; With Respects,\n&gt; Jyothi\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups .com, &quot;Narasimha =\r\nP.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Jyothi ji,\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secon=\r\ndly, can you please help me with a question? ..snip..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He was asking m=\r\ne if yoga, be it jnana yoga, bhakti yoga \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or any one, is the only way=\r\n to attain moksha/realisation, then \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will other living organi=\r\nsms like ameoba, bacteria and all will do \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attain moksha? Arent=\r\n they also living organisms? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..snip.. He said, if what I am saying i=\r\ns correct, only human \n&gt; beings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be evolved and other organisms =\r\nwill never attain moksha. I \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathless for a moment and did n=\r\not know how to answer him. I \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, becaus=\r\ne I thought I could answer all \n&gt; questions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the mystery o=\r\nf life) that I couldnt answer \n&gt; him. ..snip..\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Well, sadhana (e=\r\nffort) is what a being does. Phala (fruits) are \n&gt; decided by the Lord. If =\r\nGod wants, a bacteria can get moksha too. \n&gt; However, *usually* god has som=\r\ne rules of action and reaction to \n&gt; uphold and hence does not act out of o=\r\nrder. So the chance of a \n&gt; baterium to get moksha is negligible (except at=\r\n the end of this \n&gt; creation cycle).\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; It is indeed true that amo=\r\neba or bacteria have very very small \n&gt; chance of moksha in THAT life. Howe=\r\nver, nobody stops them from doing \n&gt; some good karma (possibly by *chance*)=\r\n, get a higher birth and \n&gt; eventually be born as a human and do some sadha=\r\nna.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; When I wrote &quot;by chance&quot;, it may make some uncomfortable. B=\r\nut that \n&gt; is the fact. Whatever action we perform with a sense of *I-ness*=\r\n \n&gt; behind that action becomes a karma (action) and an equal and opposite \n=\r\n&gt; phala (fruit/reaction) will come. Suppose one donates one&#39;s eyes and \n&gt; f=\r\neels good about the noble act and the person getting the eyes uses \n&gt; the n=\r\newly gotten vision to look at some beautiful women, be tempted \n&gt; and rape =\r\nthem, the donor will get part of that karma! The laws of \n&gt; karma are compl=\r\nex. Thinking like &quot;this is a noble karma. So it is \n&gt; good only&quot; is incorre=\r\nct. Each action results in a series of \n&gt; developments and begets some karm=\r\na for the person. Of course, if an \n&gt; act is with committed with ego but no=\r\nt an intention to affect a \n&gt; particular development, the part of the karma=\r\n begotten from that \n&gt; development is smaller (than it would be if that dev=\r\nelopment was \n&gt; intended). Thus, even bacteria and amoeba can beget karma f=\r\nrom the \n&gt; results of their actions. But it is very small and accumulates \n=\r\n&gt; slowly. Highly taamasik beings such as trees, amoeba and bacteria \n&gt; take=\r\n a looooong time to make progress on the ladder of kaarmik \n&gt; evolution.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; I want to make three comments:\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; (1) One need not feel =\r\nsorry for the amoeba and bacteria because \n&gt; they are mostly a long way fro=\r\nm moksha. Not all beings need to get \n&gt; moksha right away. If that is neede=\r\nd, god did not need to create this \n&gt; world. If there is unmanifested Brahm=\r\nan and nothing else in this \n&gt; universe, that will solve all problems. But =\r\nthe fact is that \n&gt; manifested Brahman with infinite objects at varying lev=\r\nels of karmic \n&gt; evolution is not really a problem! That is exactly what is=\r\n needed for \n&gt; the Lila to unfold.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; (2) If you want to feel sorr=\r\ny, feel sorry not for amoeba and \n&gt; bacteria, but for those who got the val=\r\nuable human birth and yet act \n&gt; like amoeba and bacteria spiritually. Pity=\r\n those who are stuck in the \n&gt; cycle of happiness and sadness, elation and =\r\ndepression, hopes and \n&gt; despairs etc, without realizing that the play will=\r\n end soon and what \n&gt; birth one will get next is uncertain!!\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; (3=\r\n) Actually, more than others, feel sorry for yourself. Who are we \n&gt; to wor=\r\nry about others? They, their god and their gurus will feel \n&gt; sorry for the=\r\nm and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We \n&gt; are first respo=\r\nnsible for ourselves. When one cannot change self and \n&gt; focus attention on=\r\n god fully within oneself, what is the point in \n&gt; lamenting about the spir=\r\nituality or lack of it in other people? So, \n&gt; we should all try to look in=\r\nward and take a critical look at \n&gt; ourselves, given that we got a very ver=\r\ny very valuable life as a \n&gt; human being.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; His question gave m=\r\ne a sleepless night. I thought a lot about it. \n&gt; If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole world=\r\n as a maya exist only in human&#39;s mind (as per my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding, our =\r\nmind creates this world, when through yoga, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/ego collapse happen=\r\ns, there is no world or anything and we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; submerge as oneness in the o=\r\nmnipotent power), if it is a creation \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, then there should =\r\nnot be any world when the human species \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinct. Right? \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; &gt; A mind is a mind is a mind. Mind creates the world, not necessaril=\r\ny \n&gt; a human mind. All minds can create a world. However, a human mind is \n=\r\n&gt; more capable than other minds to break down that created world and \n&gt; ret=\r\nurn to the source. THAT is the point.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am asking you becaus=\r\ne, you were instrumental (though \n&gt; unknowingly) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in opening the wide=\r\n horizon of spiritual knowledge to me years \n&gt; back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; through just one=\r\n reply to one of my questions related to \n&gt; Kundalini. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; am always i=\r\nndebted to you for that and now I realise how stupid \n&gt; my \n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions=\r\n were at that time.) \n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; I am glad to know that. I am actually a f=\r\nool who does not know much \n&gt; and cannot help anyone. But the blessings of =\r\nmy gurus may work \n&gt; through me sometimes and benefit some.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nirst: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to know if you have heard of any vamacharis in In=\r\ndia \n&gt; who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; followed Vama Marga successfully and realised God. All tr=\r\nue \n&gt; saints I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have heard are followers of the Satwik path/right han=\r\nd tantra. So \n&gt; &gt; &gt; always wonder, did any body succeed in the other way? A=\r\nnybody who \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known as a Vamamarga saint?\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Your =\r\nquestion is kind of an oxymoron. Can good aghoris become &quot;well-\n&gt; known&quot; an=\r\nd come to limelight? :-)\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; I know one masterly aghori reasonably =\r\nwell. However, he is not \n&gt; restricted to one path. All paths are his own a=\r\nnd he does not \n&gt; distinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and also=\r\n Vedic \n&gt; sadhanas like Vedic homas with the same attitude. He chants Vedic=\r\n \n&gt; mantras too. For example, when he chants Sri Rudram, it produces \n&gt; ama=\r\nzing energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When he thinks of \n&gt; Krish=\r\nna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads and other \n&gt; Vedanta=\r\n texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen \n&gt; intellect shi=\r\nnes forth like a Sun and illuminates the thinking of a \n&gt; ready audience. I=\r\n have never seen anyone who has such a perfect \n&gt; understanding of the esse=\r\nnce of Upanishads and exudes it in thoughts, \n&gt; words and actions. He has w=\r\nife and children, has a full-time job and \n&gt; engages in several external ac=\r\ntivities and is never idle. But his \n&gt; level of detachment with the work he=\r\n does so expertly is far higher \n&gt; than even ascetics who renounce everythi=\r\nng and *try* to develop some \n&gt; detachment.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that =\r\nhe is an aghori, but he is also a jnaana yogi, \n&gt; bhakti yogi, karma yogi a=\r\nnd raaja yogi. He is a vaidika and he is an \n&gt; aghori. All paths are his an=\r\nd he views all the same way. I don&#39;t know \n&gt; if all really good aghoris are=\r\n like that or just he.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; In any case, it is irrelevant to you if =\r\nany aghori succeeded or \n&gt; not. If YOU are meant to succeed in aghota, you =\r\nwill. If not, you \n&gt; will not. To be safe, until the right time and right p=\r\nerson comes, \n&gt; one should not venture into aghora. I want people to apprec=\r\niate \n&gt; different things for what they are and not have unhealthy biases, b=\r\nut \n&gt; it does not mean everybody should try everything. Nuclear engineers \n=\r\n&gt; hating politicians, politicians hating lawyers and lawyers hating \n&gt; doct=\r\nors is bad. But one should become what one is supposed to!\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A =\r\nfew years back, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini by Robert Svoboda. \n&gt; In \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; that book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. But except in that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbook, I couldnt find any references to this person anywhere. Not \n&gt; even \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; in net. (The only references were the ones related to Robert \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sw=\r\naboda&#39;s book and as his Guru).=A0=A0 \n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Well, he guarded his priv=\r\nacy and made sure that the books came out \n&gt; only after he left the body. M=\r\noreover, his real name was not that. \n&gt; Also, he led his spiritual life in =\r\nrelative seclusion and not many \n&gt; knew him. No wonder you can&#39;t find info =\r\non him.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is: Whether he is real or not, one can benef=\r\nit from \n&gt; teachings attributed to him. The knowledge present in the aghora=\r\n \n&gt; series of books is nothing short of amazing. It may shock you, but it \n=\r\n&gt; can change your thinking from inside out and give you a clearer \n&gt; unders=\r\ntanding. Vimalananda not only managed to impart great \n&gt; understanding to S=\r\nvoboda, but also ensure that Mother Taaraa Herself \n&gt; would speak through S=\r\nvoboda and the knowledge would come out perfect. \n&gt; Other books authored by=\r\n Svoboda may not have the same brilliance, but \n&gt; those books came out just=\r\n as Vimalananda intended.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; There are many things in the book whi=\r\nch could not have come from a \n&gt; normal person. They came from someone who =\r\nhad a perfect, steady and \n&gt; unwavering understanding of the absolute truth=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; BTW, you cannot meet a good and genuine aghori unless there i=\r\ns a \n&gt; rina and *he* wants you to meet him.\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n ---------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\nhomam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarp=\r\nana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt; --- In soh=\r\namsa@yahoogroups .com, &quot;jyothi_b_lakshmi&quot; \n&gt; &lt;jyothi_b_lakshmi@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed reading both your =\r\nmails.

He was asking me if yoga, =\r\nbe it jnana yoga, bhakti \n&gt; yoga \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or any one, is the only way to atta=\r\nin moksha/realisation, then \n&gt; what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will other living organisms like=\r\n ameoba, bacteria and all will do \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attain moksha? Arent they al=\r\nso living organisms? (He has done his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; research in Bio Informatics, h=\r\nence his priority to bacteria and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ameoba). He said, if what I am say=\r\ning is correct, only human \n&gt; beings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be evolved and other organ=\r\nisms will never attain moksha. I \n&gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; breathless for a moment and =\r\ndid not know how to answer him. I \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, b=\r\necause I thought I could answer all \n&gt; questions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the myst=\r\nery of life) that I couldnt answer him. His \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question seemed stupid, =\r\nbut when I thought of it, isnt that a \n&gt; valid \n&gt; &gt; &gt; question?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; His question gave me a sleepless night. I thought a lot about it. \n&gt; If \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole world as a maya exist only in human&#39;s mind (as per my \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; understanding, our mind creates this world, when through yoga, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; min=\r\nd/ego collapse happens, there is no world or anything and we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; submerg=\r\ne as oneness in the omnipotent power), if it is a creation \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; min=\r\nd, then there should not be any world when the human species \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nxtinct. Right? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont know if I have convey my doubt clearly.=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you be able to share your knowledge on this? \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am asking you because, you were instrumental (though \n&gt; unknowin=\r\ngly) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in opening the wide horizon of spiritual knowledge to me years =\r\n\n&gt; back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; through just one reply to one of my questions related to \n&gt; =\r\nKundalini.

Can good aghoris b=\r\necome &quot;well-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; known&quot; and come to limelight? :-)&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (I=\r\n did not know the meaning of oxymoron. Had to look dictionary :((. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Well, I understand your point. Aghoris cannot be well-known for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; o=\r\nbvious reasons. May be Aghoris know that people who are not as much &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; evolved as them will not be able to understand their path and hence &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; stay away from publicity.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am least interested=\r\n in Vamamarga. I just had a curiosity to know if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; any body was succ=\r\nessful in that path. (Your reference to Vamamarga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and its dangers =\r\nmade me think of the success rate of that path and if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really such =\r\npeople existed. That&#39;s all. (Personally, I DO NOT want &lt;BR&gt;&gt; any Aghori =\r\nto appear as my Guru, though I would wish a saint from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Right hand =\r\npath to appear before me IFF and when I am eligible (if &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n not in th=\r\nis birth, in any future birth)!!. This is not biasing, just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a pers=\r\nonal taste. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I enjoyed reading Aghora =96Kundalini- so wel=\r\nl written and genuine. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as you said, the other book on Left Han=\r\nd Path by Swaboda was a kind &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of shock to me, initially. And it was=\r\n good to know that such paths &lt;BR&gt;&gt; also existed. But after that it didn=\r\n&#39;t affect me at all because I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; understood it is just another path. =\r\nWhy should I bother about how and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; why it is so when we have a more=\r\n acceptable and beautiful path? &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now, I would like t=\r\no reply to the 3rd comment of yours:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;(3) Actually, more than other=\r\ns, feel sorry for yourself. Who are we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to worry about others? They=\r\n, their god and their gurus will feel &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sorry for them and do someth=\r\ning about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are first responsible fo=\r\nr ourselves. When one cannot change self and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n focus attention on g=\r\nod fully within oneself, what is the point in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lamenting about the =\r\nspirituality or lack of it in other people? So, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; we should all try =\r\nto look inward and take a critical look at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ourselves, given that w=\r\ne got a very very very valuable life as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; human being.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Here you made me feel as if I did a mistake in responding to my &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; cousin as well as asking you the questions. I might be wrong in both. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But what I feel is though it might be irritating and meaningless t=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; answer the queries of an agnostic; we cannot override the chance=\r\n of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; us being instrumental in their path to know the truth. Every p=\r\nerson, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who has a quest to find the truth, be it spiritually or &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; scientifically (as my cousin who says he will try to solve the &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; mystery of life in a scientific way) will have to under go a lot of &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; conflicts at the initial stages. Since we\n are all accustomed to find =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; answers through reasoning, everybody initially starts thinking &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; logically to get an answer which ultimately leads to a dead end. Once=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that way ends, one starts looking within, and after a lot of prac=\r\ntice &lt;BR&gt;&gt; finally realizes that what logic couldn&#39;t find, could be foun=\r\nd by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; practice of concentrating within. This realization that nobod=\r\ny can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; answer ones questions, but only oneself, is achieved after a=\r\n lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; queries which may be directed to oneself and to many. To m=\r\ny cousin, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; may be a part of that `many&#39;. It is not that I worry a=\r\nbout others &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirituality, but I feel, just as many people acted as=\r\n catalyst in my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual journey, I too might act a as a catalyst=\r\n, to others, even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; if I don&#39;t have anything worthwhile to share, an=\r\nd even if I might not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be aware of my role. My inability to answer =\r\nhis question might be one &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n reason that will catalyze his thoughts =\r\nfurther to know more about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; other ways and may be, he will ultimate=\r\nly realize the truth. But till &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then, the path and people on that p=\r\nath are important. I am saying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this from my experience, when I was=\r\n tortured by many spiritual quests &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and many people&#39;s answers (be i=\r\nt satisfactory or unsatisfactory) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; helped me to advance. So I feel =\r\nit might be the same with others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I remember reading in S=\r\ncott Peck&#39;s book -The Roads Less Travelled, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that to lose ones ego =\r\nand to realize oneself, an ego must be present &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in the first place.=\r\n I liked that statement very much because it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from his book that=\r\n I am first reading a statement in that line of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; thought. Everywher=\r\ne people condemn ego and speak of losing ego as the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; way to realize=\r\n God. But nobody has ever said that an ego is necessary &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to lose it=\r\n. Nobody ever spoke of the\n `necessity&#39; and importance of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ego to r=\r\nealize God. Scott Peck made it very clear that if not having &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an eg=\r\no is a sign of realization, then all children should be self-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reali=\r\nzed yogis, but in fact they are not. They become yogis when they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; d=\r\nevelop an ego and then lose it. May be this is the way Divine Mother &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; wants it to happen. Someway, I liked what Scott Peck said. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; With Respects,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyothi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;sohamsa@=\r\nyahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Jyothi ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Secondly, can you please help me with a question? ..snip..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yoga, bhakti yoga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; or any one, is the only way to attain moksha/realisation, then &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; will other living organisms like ameoba, bac=\r\nteria and all will do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attain moksha? Arent t=\r\nhey also living organisms? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ..snip.. He said, if what I a=\r\nm saying is correct, only human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will be =\r\nevolved and other organisms will never attain moksha. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; breathless for a moment and did not know how to answer him. I =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; really &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, because I thought=\r\n I could answer all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; questions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the my=\r\nstery of life) that I couldnt answer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; him. ..snip..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nb=\r\nsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, sadhana (effort) is what a being does. Phala (fruit=\r\ns) are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; decided by the Lord. If God wants, a bacteria can get moksh=\r\na too. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, *usually* god has some rules of action and reactio=\r\nn to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; uphold and hence does not act out of order. So the chance of =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n baterium to get moksha is negligible (except at the end of this=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; creation cycle).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is indeed tr=\r\nue that amoeba or bacteria have very very small &lt;BR&gt;&gt; chance of moksha i=\r\nn THAT life. However, nobody stops them from doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; some good karma=\r\n (possibly by *chance*), get a higher birth and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eventually be born=\r\n as a human and do some sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When I wr=\r\note &quot;by chance&quot;, it may make some uncomfortable. But that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the f=\r\nact. Whatever action we perform with a sense of *I-ness* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; behind th=\r\nat action becomes a karma (action) and an equal and opposite &lt;BR&gt;&gt; phala=\r\n (fruit/reaction) will come. Suppose one donates one&#39;s eyes and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fe=\r\nels good about the noble act and the person getting the eyes uses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe newly gotten vision to look at some beautiful women, be tempted &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; and rape them, the donor will get part of that karma! The laws of &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;\n karma are complex. Thinking like &quot;this is a noble karma. So it is &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; good only&quot; is incorrect. Each action results in a series of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dev=\r\nelopments and begets some karma for the person. Of course, if an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a=\r\nct is with committed with ego but not an intention to affect a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; par=\r\nticular development, the part of the karma begotten from that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; deve=\r\nlopment is smaller (than it would be if that development was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; inten=\r\nded). Thus, even bacteria and amoeba can beget karma from the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; resu=\r\nlts of their actions. But it is very small and accumulates &lt;BR&gt;&gt; slowly.=\r\n Highly taamasik beings such as trees, amoeba and bacteria &lt;BR&gt;&gt; take a =\r\nlooooong time to make progress on the ladder of kaarmik &lt;BR&gt;&gt; evolution.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I want to make three comments:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) One need not feel sorry for the amoeba and bacte=\r\nria because &lt;BR&gt;&gt; they are mostly a long way from moksha. Not all\n being=\r\ns need to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; moksha right away. If that is needed, god did not ne=\r\ned to create this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world. If there is unmanifested Brahman and noth=\r\ning else in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; universe, that will solve all problems. But the f=\r\nact is that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; manifested Brahman with infinite objects at varying le=\r\nvels of karmic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; evolution is not really a problem! That is exactly =\r\nwhat is needed for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Lila to unfold.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; (2) If you want to feel sorry, feel sorry not for amoeba and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n bacteria, but for those who got the valuable human birth and yet act &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; like amoeba and bacteria spiritually. Pity those who are stuck in the &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; cycle of happiness and sadness, elation and depression, hopes and &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; despairs etc, without realizing that the play will end soon and wha=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; birth one will get next is uncertain!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; (3) Actually, more than others, feel sorry for\n yourself. Who are w=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to worry about others? They, their god and their gurus will feel=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sorry for them and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena=\r\n? We &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are first responsible for ourselves. When one cannot change s=\r\nelf and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; focus attention on god fully within oneself, what is the p=\r\noint in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lamenting about the spirituality or lack of it in other pe=\r\nople? So, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; we should all try to look inward and take a critical loo=\r\nk at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ourselves, given that we got a very very very valuable life a=\r\ns a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; human being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; His questio=\r\nn gave me a sleepless night. I thought a lot about it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the whole world as a maya exist only in human&#39;s mind (as per my =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding, our mind creates this world, when through=\r\n yoga, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind/ego collapse happens, there is no world or a=\r\nnything and we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; submerge as\n oneness in the omnipotent po=\r\nwer), if it is a creation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, then there s=\r\nhould not be any world when the human species &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; extinct. Right? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; A mind is a mind is a m=\r\nind. Mind creates the world, not necessarily &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a human mind. All min=\r\nds can create a world. However, a human mind is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; more capable than =\r\nother minds to break down that created world and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; return to the sou=\r\nrce. THAT is the point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am asking =\r\nyou because, you were instrumental (though &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unknowingly) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; in opening the wide horizon of spiritual knowledge to me years &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; back &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through just one reply to one of my questions=\r\n related to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kundalini. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; am always indebted to =\r\nyou for that and now I realise how stupid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; qu=\r\nestions were at that time.) &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am glad to=\r\n know that. I am actually a fool who does not know much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and cannot=\r\n help anyone. But the blessings of my gurus may work &lt;BR&gt;&gt; through me so=\r\nmetimes and benefit some.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First: &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to know if you have heard of any vamacharis in =\r\nIndia &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; followed Vama Marga successfully and =\r\nrealised God. All true &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saints I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have heard are =\r\nfollowers of the Satwik path/right hand tantra. So &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; alway=\r\ns wonder, did any body succeed in the other way? Anybody who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; well-known as a Vamamarga saint?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Your question is kind of an oxymoron. Can good aghoris become &quot;wel=\r\nl-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; known&quot; and come to limelight? :-)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; I know one masterly aghori reasonably well. However, he is not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nrestricted to one path. All\n paths are his own and he does not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dis=\r\ntinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadha=\r\nnas like Vedic homas with the same attitude. He chants Vedic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantr=\r\nas too. For example, when he chants Sri Rudram, it produces &lt;BR&gt;&gt; amazin=\r\ng energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When he thinks of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kr=\r\nishna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads and other &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Vedanta texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; intellect shines forth like a Sun and illuminates the thinking of a &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; ready audience. I have never seen anyone who has such a perfect &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; understanding of the essence of Upanishads and exudes it in thoughts, &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; words and actions. He has wife and children, has a full-time job and =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; engages in several external activities and is never idle. But his =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; level of detachment with the work he does so expertly is far highe=\r\nr &lt;BR&gt;&gt; than even\n ascetics who renounce everything and *try* to develop=\r\n some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is t=\r\nhat he is an aghori, but he is also a jnaana yogi, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bhakti yogi, ka=\r\nrma yogi and raaja yogi. He is a vaidika and he is an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aghori. All =\r\npaths are his and he views all the same way. I don&#39;t know &lt;BR&gt;&gt; if all r=\r\neally good aghoris are like that or just he.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; In any case, it is irrelevant to you if any aghori succeeded or &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n not. If YOU are meant to succeed in aghota, you will. If not, you &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n will not. To be safe, until the right time and right person comes, &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; one should not venture into aghora. I want people to appreciate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ndifferent things for what they are and not have unhealthy biases, but &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; it does not mean everybody should try everything. Nuclear engineers &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; hating politicians, politicians hating lawyers and lawyers hating &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; doctors\n is bad. But one should become what one is supposed to!&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A few years back, I had read AGHORA -Kunda=\r\nlini by Robert Svoboda. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that book one Aghori=\r\n Vimalananda is mentioned. But except in that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; book, I co=\r\nuldnt find any references to this person anywhere. Not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; even &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; in net. (The only references were the ones related to Robert &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Swaboda&#39;s book and as his Guru).&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Well, he guarded his privacy and made sure that the b=\r\nooks came out &lt;BR&gt;&gt; only after he left the body. Moreover, his real name=\r\n was not that. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, he led his spiritual life in relative seclusi=\r\non and not many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; knew him. No wonder you can&#39;t find info on him.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is: Whether he is real or not, on=\r\ne can benefit from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; teachings attributed to him. The knowledge pres=\r\nent in\n the aghora &lt;BR&gt;&gt; series of books is nothing short of amazing. It=\r\n may shock you, but it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can change your thinking from inside out an=\r\nd give you a clearer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; understanding. Vimalananda not only managed t=\r\no impart great &lt;BR&gt;&gt; understanding to Svoboda, but also ensure that Moth=\r\ner Taaraa Herself &lt;BR&gt;&gt; would speak through Svoboda and the knowledge wo=\r\nuld come out perfect. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Other books authored by Svoboda may not have=\r\n the same brilliance, but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; those books came out just as Vimalananda=\r\n intended.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are many things in the bo=\r\nok which could not have come from a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; normal person. They came from =\r\nsomeone who had a perfect, steady and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unwavering understanding of =\r\nthe absolute truth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, you cannot meet a=\r\n good and genuine aghori unless there is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rina and *he* wants you=\r\n to meet him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n =\r\nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedica=\r\nstrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.srijagannath.org/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan =\r\nnath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;sohamsa@yah=\r\noogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;jyothi_b_lakshmi&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;jyothi_b_lakshmi@&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Enjoyed reading both your mails. =\r\nThis reminds me of a koan riddle:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A MA=\r\nSTER was asked the question, &quot;What is the Way?&quot; by a curious&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; monk.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;It is right before your eyes,&quot; said the master=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Monk: &quot;Why do I not see it for myself?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Master: &quot;Because you are thinking of yourself.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Monk: =\r\n&quot;What about you? Do you see it?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Master: &quot;So long as you =\r\nsee double, saying I don&#39;t\n and you do, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\non, your eyes are clouded,&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Monk: &quot;When there is neither =\r\n&#39;I&#39; nor &#39;You&#39; can one see it?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Master: &quot;When there is nei=\r\nther &#39;I&#39; nor &#39;You,&#39; who is the one that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wants to see it?=\r\n&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Can I request two favours from you?&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; First: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like=\r\n to know if you have heard of any vamacharis in India &lt;BR&gt;&gt; who &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; followed Vama Marga successfully and realised God. All true &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; saints I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have heard are followers of the Satwik pat=\r\nh/right hand tantra. So &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; always wonder, did any body succ=\r\need in the other way? Anybody who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; well-know=\r\nn as a Vamamarga saint?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A few years ba=\r\nck, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini by Robert Svoboda. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; that book\n one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. But except in that =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; book, I couldnt find any references to this person anywh=\r\nere. Not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in net. (The only references were=\r\n the ones related to Robert &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Swaboda&#39;s book and as his Gu=\r\nru).&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, can you pl=\r\nease help me with a question?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A week back, I was elaborat=\r\ning about realisation and yoga, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; meditation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nall such to one of my cousins who did not actually understand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; what I said. He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yoga,=\r\n bhakti &lt;BR&gt;&gt; yoga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or any one, is the only way to att=\r\nain moksha/realisation, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will other li=\r\nving organisms like ameoba, bacteria and all will do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; attain moksha? Arent they also living organisms? (He has done his =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; research in Bio Informatics, hence his priority to bact=\r\neria and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ameoba). He said, if what I am saying is correc=\r\nt, only human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will be evolved and other =\r\norganisms will never attain moksha. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; breat=\r\nhless for a moment and did not know how to answer him. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; really &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; felt sad (and ashamed, because I thought I could answer al=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; questions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; related to the mystery of life) tha=\r\nt I couldnt answer him. His &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; question seemed stupid, but =\r\nwhen I thought of it, isnt that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; valid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; questio=\r\nn?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; His question gave me a sleepless ni=\r\nght. I thought a lot about it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the whole wor=\r\nld as a maya exist only in human&#39;s mind (as per my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; under=\r\nstanding, our mind creates this world, when through yoga, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;\n mind/ego collapse happens, there is no world or anything and we &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; submerge as oneness in the omnipotent power), if it is a creatio=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind, then there should not be any world w=\r\nhen the human species &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extinct. Right? &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I dont know if I have convey my doubt clear=\r\nly.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you be able to share =\r\nyour knowledge on this? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (I am asking =\r\nyou because, you were instrumental (though &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unknowingly) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; in opening the wide horizon of spiritual knowledge to me years &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; back &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through just one reply to one of my questions=\r\n related to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kundalini. I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; am always indebted to =\r\nyou for that and now I realise how stupid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; qu=\r\nestions were at that time.) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; With\n Res=\r\npects,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyothi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntd&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-735866783-1219395225=:83457--\r\n\n"}}
