I promise to make you my tutor, but first learn the\nscripture well.&quot;\n\nThe brahmana went on his way thinking &quot;How foolish it is of the king to say\nthat I have not mastered the Bhagavata, seeing that I have been reading the\nbook over and over all these years.&quot;\n\nHowever, he went through the book carefully once more and appeared again\nbefore the king. The king told him the same thing again and sent him away.\n\nThe brahmana was sorely vexed, but thought that there must be some meaning\nin the behaviour of the king. He went home, shut himself up in his room, and\napplied himself more than ever to the study of the book.\n\nBy and by, hidden meanings began to flash into his mind and the vanity of\nrunning after the bubbles of riches and honour,kings and courts, wealth and\nfame appeared to his unclouded vision.\n\nFrom that day forward he gave himself up entirely to attaining perfection by\nthe worship of God, and never thought of returning to the king.\n\nA few years after, the king thought of the brahmana and went to his house to\nsee what he was doing. Seeing him, now radiant with Divine light and love,\nhe fell upon his knees and said: &quot;I see that you have now realised the true\nmeaning of the scriptures.
