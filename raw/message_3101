Nobody knew till the end whether he was a H=\r\nindu or a Muslim. He lived in a mosque and did namaz, but also maintained a=\r\n continuous fire with him like Hindu yogis. He did that inside a mosque, wh=\r\nich is considered blasphemous as Islam considers fire to be very inauspicio=\r\nus! He gave sublime interpretations of Qoran and also Bhagavad Gita and oth=\r\ner Hindu scriptures. He never hesitated to tell a Hindu, &quot;Allah will do goo=\r\nd to you&quot; or to tell a Muslim, &quot;Ram will bless you&quot;. Hindus and Muslims ali=\r\nke considered him their own and worshipped him. Even today, there is a spec=\r\nific ritual at his tomb in Shirdi, where Hindus stand on one side of the to=\r\nmb and Muslims on the other and they worship him together, using their own =\r\nmethods.\n \nIt was heartening to me when I saw it. I saw a ray of hope in th=\r\ne age of religious intolerance and fundamentalism and killing in the name o=\r\nf god.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWe have many religions and movements, most o=\r\nf them started by people of varying levels of self-realization, who taught =\r\nguidelines that were quite helpful and relevant to the spiritual progress o=\r\nf people around them at their times. Just as raw grains remain fresh for a =\r\nlong time while cooked grains become stale fast, similarly uninterpreted an=\r\nd intangible essence of the teachings of scriptures remains fresh for a lon=\r\ng time while interpreted, tangible and clear guidelines that are ready for =\r\ndigestion by followers become stale (irrelevant/inapplicable) fast. Great t=\r\neachers effectively cook the raw grains of scriptural essence using the hea=\r\nt of their wisdom and the water of their compassion and serve cooked food r=\r\neady for consumption by people around them.\n \nWhen people stick to some irr=\r\nelevant details and miss the essence, it can result in clashes and conflict=\r\ns. The purpose of religion is to aid in finding god. Unfortunately, no univ=\r\nersal thumbrules can be given for finding god. A good religion will not dep=\r\nend on a single text or person and will depend on a string of self-realized=\r\n souls who re-interpret previous texts based on their realization from time=\r\n to time. That is certainly true with sanatana dharma.\n \nThe last paragraph=\r\n in the following post is quite relevant in this context.\n \nhttp://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1601\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJ=\r\nyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannat=\r\nh Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------- \n \n----- Original Message -----=\r\n \nFrom: &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, November 19, 2009 5:11 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: Poetry of Bulle Shah - Sufi\n\n\nDear Rajarshi,\n\nThanks for the information=\r\n on Wajid Ali Shah.\n\n***\n&gt;Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the=\r\n perfected man.

And then he asked Angel and Shaytan to Salute the =\r\nMan which was obeyed by Angel but not by Shaytan. Shayatn then on started c=\r\norrupting minds of Men by influencing them to pray to the statues (images -=\r\n idolatary) and like wise getting them away from Allah.\n\nI may be little wr=\r\nong in the above understanding.\n\n***\n &gt; However, one who does Homa need for=\r\n a=C2  deity need not worry &gt;about these in the least.

Waji=\r\nd Ali Shah - the nawab of Oudh was one such person. Vimalananda says he was=\r\n a Kinnara who had incarnated on this plane. Quite possible. He used to go =\r\nmad for love of Krishna and keep playing teh dance of Gopis for Krishna. Al=\r\nthough he used to do his five times=C2 Namaz as well. There were other such=\r\n Sufis too I have heard who were devoted to Krishna.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; That is what =\r\nDr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, men are God, hills are God, Sun=\r\n, moon and everything is God while We say that everything is of Allah (God)=\r\n.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Trust Dr Naik when he is speaking on the Koran. Do not trust him=\r\n when he speaks on anything else. He does know his Koran well.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Loo=\r\nk at this logically. Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the perf=\r\nected man. If that perfected man could not have a directed communion with A=\r\nllah ever, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermed=\r\niary,=C2 why should any=C2 other muslim ever have a direct connection with =\r\nAllah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; There is one idea in Isl=\r\nam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire. \n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Actually as far as =\r\nI know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The entities =\r\nwhich live by fire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They are another clas=\r\ns who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry=\r\n information from earth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns f=\r\nor different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hin=\r\ndu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do actua=\r\nlly use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Maybe they are something lik=\r\ne spirits or beings of some astral plane. \n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; However, one who does H=\r\noma need for a=C2 deity need not worry about these in the least. When a dei=\r\nty like Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothing else will dare interfe=\r\nre.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; But the real reason why most muslims have an issue with fire i=\r\ns because in one Hadith it is mentioned prophet Muhammed disliked fire beca=\r\nuse it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire to them is a symbol of the final time=\r\ns where the sinners and the kufrs will be thrown by Allah into a huge fire.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180=\r\n degree apart in different directions or actually they try to make it such =\r\nthat they never meet.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. In my reading =\r\nof Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use half truths=\r\n when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly and wholeso=\r\nmely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - specially Hin=\r\ndus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C2 An explanation for this mayb=\r\ne digressing and long.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; But generally, if I were born in a muslim f=\r\namily, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day out and t=\r\nrust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as the perfected m=\r\nan, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would consider Zakir Na=\r\nik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamental that unless one =\r\nis ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there cannot be a reconci=\r\nliation.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb started memorizing the koran for 9 ye=\r\nars. At the end of the nine years he started his temple demolishion campaig=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is no wonder that more than 90 percent of muslim youth, even =\r\nthose highly educated consider Zakir Naik to be a gift of Allah to the Umma=\r\nh and the greatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and &#39;comparitive religions&#39; alive on =\r\nearth. I am speaking from personal interaction. \n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; At some point I u=\r\nsed to get very angry with muslims. Now I don&#39;t. I find them to be a victim=\r\n more than any one, and a victim who is not even aware of the fact that he =\r\nis a victim! A victim not of USA=C2 or Zionists or Hindus or anyone. A vict=\r\nim of the idea called Islam.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; The above statement may seem controve=\r\nrsial, but it is not a casual remark.\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n =C2 \n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhai=\r\nrava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Re: Poetry of Bulle Shah - Sufi\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n Date: Thursday, 19 November, 2009, 7:33 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Ra=\r\njarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for these informations on Sufis.

As you can well understand from his poetry, his realization was quit=\r\ne different from traditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite dislike=\r\nd by muslims of his time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nMost people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C2 to be a branch of Islam. My perso=\r\nnal view is different. In most of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi san=\r\nts like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince m=\r\ne that their personal realization was quite different from Islamic doctrins=\r\n. As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian and I=\r\nndia. The mystics of these areas, specially Persia, after it was over run b=\r\ny Islam, in order to protect their philosophy garbed it with Islamic termin=\r\nologies and names. Otherwise they would have faced sure shot slaughter. Tha=\r\nt was a means of self preservation which in turn, over years, helped a lot =\r\nof muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=C2 than that which come=\r\ns from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; For example Rumi tal=\r\nks a about something similar to=C2 reincarnation in some of his poems while=\r\n the following one does talk about communion with God:\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; I searc=\r\nhed for God among the Christians and on the Cross and therein I found Him n=\r\not.\n&gt; &gt; I went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of Him was th=\r\nere.\n&gt; &gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went as far as Qandha=\r\nr but God I found not.\n&gt; &gt; With set purpose I fared to the summit of Mount =\r\nCaucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.\n&gt; &gt; Then I directed my se=\r\narch to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God was not there even.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from ibn Sina but found Him not=\r\n within his range.\n&gt; &gt; I fared then to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experienc=\r\ne of a great divine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from hi=\r\nm&quot; but God was not there even in that exalted court.\n&gt; &gt; Finally, I looked =\r\ninto my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; Co=\r\nmmunion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creato=\r\nr is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Thoug=\r\nh in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretati=\r\non is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; The person who changed the life of Rumi was also an=\r\nother Sufi called=C2 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend=\r\n which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead. One day th=\r\ne mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a d=\r\nead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. =\r\nHe tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name=\r\n, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for d=\r\noing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as p=\r\ner true Islam - and executed him.\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mans=\r\nur-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally mean=\r\ns I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional=\r\n Islam. \n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduc=\r\ned Qwaalis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to wor=\r\nship lord Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; Generally, =\r\nexcept for the famous=C2 Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect fo=\r\nr most Sufis saint. \n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; Though Sufis always showed a different mo=\r\nre subjective interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim scholars =\r\nwere never fooled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. Even to=\r\nday. And I do not blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the hadith=\r\ns with tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta or any=\r\n sort of God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into my vi=\r\news of what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a true,=\r\n traditional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find the fa=\r\nshionably spiritual higher middle class.

Wajid Ali Shah - the nawab of Oudh was one such person. Vimalananda \nsays=\r\n he was a Kinnara who had incarnated on this plane. Quite possible. He used=\r\n \nto go mad for love of Krishna and keep playing teh dance of Gopis for Kri=\r\nshna. \nAlthough he used to do his five times=C2 Namaz as well. There were o=\r\nther such \nSufis too I have heard who were devoted to Krishna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That is \nwhat Dr. Zakir highlighted. You say tree is God, men are =\r\nGod, hills are God, \nSun, moon and everything is God while We say that ever=\r\nything is of Allah \n(God).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Trust Dr Naik when he is sp=\r\neaking on the Koran. Do not \ntrust him when he speaks on anything else. He =\r\ndoes know his Koran well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Look at this logically. Isl=\r\nam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, \nthe perfected man. If that perf=\r\nected man could not have a directed communion \nwith Allah ever, and needed =\r\na Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in \nintermediary,=C2 why should a=\r\nny=C2 other muslim ever have a direct connection with \nAllah? Therefore Isl=\r\nam forbids this idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is one idea \nin Islam that=\r\n *Shayatan* was created from the fire. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actually \nas f=\r\nar as I know - I maybe wrong - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The \nen=\r\ntities which live by fire as per Islam are called the Jinns. They are anoth=\r\ner \nclass who mostly dwell in the smoke that comes from fire. They supposed=\r\nly carry \ninformation from earth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for =\r\nthe \nsame.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult pr=\r\nactitioner \nuse Jinns for different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exac=\r\nt correspondence \nto Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I =\r\nknow people who do \nactually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. May=\r\nbe they are something \nlike spirits or beings of some astral plane. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, one \nwho does Homa need for a=C2 deity need not wor=\r\nry about these in the least. When a \ndeity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in=\r\n present, nothing else will dare \ninterfere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But the r=\r\neal reason why most muslims have an issue \nwith fire is because in one Hadi=\r\nth it is mentioned prophet Muhammed disliked \nfire because it reminded him =\r\nof Hellfire. Fire to them is a symbol of the final \ntimes where the sinners=\r\n and the kufrs will be thrown by Allah into a huge \nfire.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; sadly in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, \nthey run 180 degr=\r\nee apart in different directions or actually they try to make \nit such that=\r\n they never meet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. \nIn my=\r\n reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use \nh=\r\nalf truths when it comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly a=\r\nnd \nwholesomely. The difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - sp=\r\necially \nHindus/Buddism/Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C2 An explanation f=\r\nor this maybe \ndigressing and long.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But generally, if =\r\nI were born in a \nmuslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadith=\r\ns day in and day out \nand trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and =\r\nMuhammed as the perfected \nman, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motio=\r\nn, I would consider Zakir Naik \nto be 100 % correct. The differences are so=\r\n fundamental that unless one is ready \nto whitewash and ignore a LOT of thi=\r\nngs, there cannot be a \nreconciliation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Remember, Aurn=\r\nagzeb started memorizing the \nkoran for 9 years. At the end of the nine yea=\r\nrs he started his temple \ndemolishion campaign.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I=\r\nt is no wonder that more than \n90 percent of muslim youth, even those highl=\r\ny educated consider Zakir Naik to be \na gift of Allah to the Ummah and the =\r\ngreatest &#39;scholar&#39; of Islam and \n&#39;comparitive religions&#39; alive on earth.

This parallel of \ndifferent ritua=\r\nls has a meeting point in both of our hearts. sadly in the view \nof the peo=\r\nple like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different \ndirections=\r\n or actually they try to make it such that they never meet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In \nvedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; \nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; If you are asking specifically about Bulle Shah, he was a Sufi \nsaint of=\r\n the 15th Century in area of modern Pakisthan. As you can well \nunderstand =\r\nfrom his poetry, his realization was quite different from traditional \nIsla=\r\nmic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his time. He was =\r\na \npacifist and a true saint.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Most people co=\r\nnsider \nSufism or Sufiana=C2 to be a branch of Islam. My personal view is d=\r\nifferent. In \nmost of the poetry I have read of famous Sufi sants like Jal=\r\n=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn \nMu=E1=B8=A5ammad Balkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me that the=\r\nir personal realization was quite \ndifferent from Islamic doctrins. As such=\r\n the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in \npre Islamic Persian and India. Th=\r\ne mystics of these areas, specially Persia, \nafter it was over run by Islam=\r\n, in order to protect their philosophy garbed it \nwith Islamic terminologie=\r\ns and names. Otherwise they would have faced sure shot \nslaughter. That was=\r\n a means of self preservation which in turn, over years, \nhelped a lot of m=\r\nuslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=C2 than that \nwhich comes f=\r\nrom the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nFor =\r\nexample Rumi talks a about something similar to=C2 reincarnation in some of=\r\n \nhis poems while the following one does talk about communion with God:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I searched for God among the Christians and on=\r\n the Cross \nand therein I found Him not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I went into the ancie=\r\nnt temples of \nidolatry; no trace of Him was there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I entered =\r\nthe mountain cave of \nHira and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found =\r\nnot.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; With set \npurpose I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus=\r\n and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s \nhabitation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Then I directed my =\r\nsearch to the Kaaba, the resort of \nold and young; God was not there even.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I \ninquired about him from ibn Sina but =\r\nfound Him not within his range.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; I fared then to the scene of =\r\nthe Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine \nmanifestation only a &quot;two bow-l=\r\nengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there \neven in that exalted cour=\r\nt.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart and \nthere I saw Him; H=\r\ne was nowhere else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Communion \nwith God is a=\r\nn idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always \nseperate=\r\n from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses \nR=\r\numi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all that=\r\n was \nan attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The person who changed the life of Rumi w=\r\nas also another \nSufi called=C2 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a pop=\r\nular legend which says \nShams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead=\r\n. One day the mullas caught \nup with him and asked him to demonstrate. Sham=\r\ns went to a dead body and said, \n&quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But noth=\r\ning happened. He tried a few times and \nyet nothing happened. Finally he sa=\r\nid, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body \nwoke up. Immediate the Mulla =\r\ncaught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot \ninvoke anyone for help othe=\r\nr than Allah as per true Islam - and executed \nhim.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who \nwas executed for proc=\r\nlaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. This \nstatement is a=\r\nlso considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in \nInd=\r\nia. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva f=\r\nor \na son before Shivaji was born.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Generally=\r\n, except \nfor the famous=C2 Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep respect=\r\n for most Sufis \nsaint. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though Sufis always=\r\n showed a different more \nsubjective interpretation of Koran, however the g=\r\nenuine Muslim scholars were \nnever fooled. Most of them considered Sufis to=\r\n be non Islamic. Even today. And I \ndo not blame them. An honest reading of=\r\n the Koran and the hadiths with tell you \nin no uncertain terms that the ph=\r\nilosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God \ncommunion is unacceptable to Islam.=\r\n I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ails \nIslam, but Sufis can be safely=\r\n called unIslamic if a true, traditional and \nauthentic version of Islam is=\r\n to be followed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, \nSufi ideas are quite =\r\nfamous in modern day cities where we find the fashionably \nspiritual higher=\r\n middle class.
