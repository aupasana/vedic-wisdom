When doing Chandi Homam, you can skip your Ganapathi Homam for t=\r\nhat day.

(Narayan&#39;s own inspiring message in this regard c=\r\nan be read at http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 727). =\r\nAfter the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji emailed the first copy to Naraya=\r\nn. Such was Narayan&#39;s dedication that he started going through the manual o=\r\nver and over. A few days later I met Narayan and enquired about the Homam m=\r\nanual and all. He very casually mentioned that he was doing the Homam menta=\r\nlly. I was dumbstruck. I said &quot;What?&quot;. He said he would perform the whole p=\r\nrocedure as mentioned in the document, IN MIND. Imagining taking the vow, i=\r\nmagining Agni pratishtapana, imagining invoking Ganesha, imagining offering=\r\n ahutis, everything, start to finish in mind. I was really bowled over by h=\r\nis creative thinking. That is how Narayan practiced. Later, Narasimhaji gif=\r\nted us Homa Kundam and\n we started our Homas. After few months passed by an=\r\nd I had to go on couple of trips where I could not carry my Homa Kundam and=\r\n all the samagri. I implemented Narayan&#39;s idea and did my homam mentally fo=\r\nr those few days. It then helped me avoid that feeling that I missed my hom=\r\nam.
