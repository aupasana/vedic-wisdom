Twenty two children dying from poisoned free food at a =\r\nlocal school....no proper medical care...headteacher and her husband (who a=\r\npparently sold the food) abscond...no justice for the families.\n\nTo those w=\r\nho would like to support the people of Bihar, have a look at this excellent=\r\n organisation run by nuns, monks and yogis (Bihar Yoga). They are based in =\r\nMunger and Rikhia and run free schools and clinics, provide clothes and hel=\r\np build wells and do various other practical things in these villages and t=\r\nhe surrounding areas.\n\nI personally know a doctor who worked at their clini=\r\nc for a year who confirmed that they are genuine and well worth supporting.=\r\n\n\nIt is not possible to donate via their website, but you can email and ask=\r\n for their account details which they will then provide if you wish to make=\r\n an online transfer from your bank to theirs.\n\nWe are very fortunate that o=\r\nur children/nieces/nephews will never face such a horrible ordeal- it&#39;s wel=\r\nl worth supporting these people who face such tragedies every day. \n\nhttp:/=\r\n/www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/17/india-school-lunch-poisoning-children=\r\n-pesticides\n\nhttp://biharyoga.net/sivananda-math/sm-donations/\n\n\n\n"}}
