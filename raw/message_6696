That is the best thing that you are following. =C2=A0\n\nInstead =\r\nof going to temple for every simple task. try to extend you time period and=\r\n set a specific time to go to temple every day.

Think tha=\r\nt you are going in the evening any way.\n\nAnd one more thing, think =C2=A0th=\r\nis way when you are brain is telling you to go to temple every time. There =\r\nis some thing that you have to do to temples. Some thing Good.

It doesn&#39;t mean you love god if you go to temple or y=\r\nou hate him if you don&#39;t.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; There are types of Bhakthis or prayers=\r\n humans offer to god. Yours is the most beautiful kind of prayer. praying t=\r\nhe god out of fear and hatred.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are people who did the same, say =\r\nfor example Ravana, Hiranyakasyapa. Marrecha from Ramayana has also same ki=\r\nnd of problem. Interesting part is GOD didn&#39;t do any thing to them until th=\r\ney crossed their limits.\n&gt; \n&gt; They all hate the god. Just believe in one th=\r\ning, when it comes to god. What ever you feel about GOD. it doesn&#39;t change =\r\nhow god sees you.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you can not see you in the form he is in temples,=\r\n See him in the form you like. For example, if you like parents start prayi=\r\nng to them daily imagining them as God you want to pray.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; If I ha=\r\nve to go in details, If you want to pray to Siva today, Start seeing you fa=\r\nther as Shiva and start seeing you mother as parvathi.=C2=A0\n&gt; I do the sam=\r\ne, I pray Lord Lakshmi Devi who looks exactly like mother.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; you d=\r\nont have to feel wrong for hating god. The more you hate the god the more y=\r\nou become close to god. you dont believe me.

But I want to tell you that I hate God beca=\r\nuse one part of my brain always tells me from behind to go to a certain tem=\r\nple on accomplishing some task.And then I counter that thought saying that =\r\nI will not go to temple even if my work gets done. This way whole of my ene=\r\nrgy is exhausted in getting these obsessive thoughts and countering them. I=\r\n hate god because he forces me to do so.I was a very religious girl even si=\r\nnce by childhood.&lt;br&gt;\nBut now I cant see him.&lt;br&gt;\nThanks&lt;br&gt;\nAS&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, vi=\r\nswa raghava &lt;raghavaviswanathkrishna@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I =\r\ndid not understand your problem. Is that your problem with going to temple =\r\nor hating the god. It doesn&#39;t mean you love god if you go to temple or you =\r\nhate him if you don&#39;t.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There are types of Bhakthis=\r\n or prayers humans offer to god. Yours is the most beautiful kind of prayer=\r\n. praying the god out of fear and hatred.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There are peop=\r\nle who did the same, say for example Ravana, Hiranyakasyapa. Marrecha from =\r\nRamayana has also same kind of problem. Interesting part is GOD didn&#39;t do a=\r\nny thing to them until they crossed their limits.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; They a=\r\nll hate the god. Just believe in one thing, when it comes to god. What ever=\r\n you feel about GOD. it doesn&#39;t change how god sees you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n If you can not see you in the form he is in temples, See him in the form y=\r\nou like. For example, if you like parents start praying to them daily imagi=\r\nning them as God you want to pray.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If I have to go=\r\n in details, If you want to pray to Siva today, Start seeing you father as =\r\nShiva and start seeing you mother as parvathi.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I do the same=\r\n, I pray Lord Lakshmi Devi who looks exactly like mother.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; you dont have to feel wrong for hating god. The more you hate the g=\r\nod the more you become close to god. you dont believe me. There are three s=\r\ntories in puranas which say that Lord Vishnu mentions the same fact.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I apologies if I have mentioned any thing wrong and hope this =\r\nhelps you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Viswanath&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-336470449-1309460376=:83886--\r\n\n"}}
