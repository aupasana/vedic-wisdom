Yet, =\r\none has no\n&gt; individualized conditioning or I-ness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Very very very few =\r\nbeings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can\n&gt; reach that state. =\r\nFor most others, that state is not really a possibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; I ga=\r\nve an analogy earlier to explain various aspects of consciousness,\n&gt; using =\r\nparts of a computer.\n&gt;\n&gt; ahamkaara (I-ness) - CPU\n&gt; chitta (conditioning) -=\r\n DRAM\n&gt; buddhi - ALU or logic coprocessor\n&gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt; jnanen=\r\ndriyas - input channels\n&gt; karmendriyas - output channels\n&gt; praanas - on-boa=\r\nrd power supply\n&gt; deha (body) - mechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt;\n&gt; Normally,=\r\n CPU is running a complex program where a lot of input channels\n&gt; and outpu=\r\nt channels are active. DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is\n&gt; refreshin=\r\ng it frequently. ALU is running several algorithms based on stored\n&gt; data a=\r\nnd a lot of I/O data gets stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time.\n&gt; This i=\r\ns analogous to a person&#39;s normal state.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a st=\r\nate where the computer is in a power\n&gt; standby. On-board power supply is ha=\r\nrdly supplying any power, all input and\n&gt; output channels are turned off, I=\r\n/O controller is turned off and ALU is not\n&gt; running any algorithms. If a c=\r\nomputer goes into power standy and exits it\n&gt; quickly, it will resume what =\r\nit was doing before. Similarly, a person\n&gt; reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and =\r\nleaving it quickly will resume previous\n&gt; activities. If a computer stays i=\r\nn the power standby for too long, it will\n&gt; be turned off and its state may=\r\n be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. If one stays\n&gt; in nirvikalpa samadhi for t=\r\noo long, one will simply merge in Brahman and\n&gt; cannot resume previous acti=\r\nvities.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sahaja samadhi is akin to a computer running a bare minimum pro=\r\ngram that\n&gt; accesses a program running on a central super computer on a net=\r\nwork. CPU,\n&gt; ALU, memory etc are running on a central super computer and ou=\r\nr individual\n&gt; computer&#39;s CPU simply has a small routine that accesses the =\r\nresults of the\n&gt; algorithm running on the super computer and controls the l=\r\nocal I/O\n&gt; controller accordingly. There isn&#39;t much data stored locally and=\r\n there is no\n&gt; algorithm running locally. One&#39;s praanas are supplying power=\r\n, one&#39;s\n&gt; jnanendriyas are getting inputs and one&#39;s karmendriyas are engagi=\r\nng in\n&gt; actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling this Input/Ouput activity and a=\r\nhamkara\n&gt; (CPU) is controlling all this by running a small program that acc=\r\nesses a\n&gt; super computer that is monitoring all the computers of the world =\r\nand\n&gt; deciding what this computer should do.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; As I said, very =\r\nvery very few beings can reach sahaja samadhi and it is\n&gt; beyond the reach =\r\nof even the greatest yogis. As I said, most yogis cannot\n&gt; even reach nirvi=\r\nkalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvikalpa samadhi, come back to\n&gt; regular consci=\r\nousness after a while and start to accumulate conditioning\n&gt; again (chitta,=\r\n i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some program or the other,\n&gt; however small,=\r\n and accumulating more data in DRAM and building up an\n&gt; algorithm in ALU. =\r\nMinimization of I-ness is possible, but elimination of\n&gt; I-ness while embod=\r\nied is very difficult! If any limited I-ness is left and\n&gt; any conditioning=\r\n (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) is left, then it\n&gt; is NOT sahaja=\r\n samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited individual I-ness\n&gt; and conne=\r\ncting the supreme universal I-ness directly to one&#39;s mind and body.\n&gt;\n&gt; I c=\r\nannot make judgments on individual claims, as it is none of my business.\n&gt; =\r\nI will take on individuals only when they interfere with my dharma and my\n&gt;=\r\n sense of dharma dictates that I should take them on.\n&gt;\n&gt; But the bottomlin=\r\ne is that sahaja samadhi state is no joke and only yogis\n&gt; of an absolutely=\r\n tremendous caliber reach it. Those who reach this state are\n&gt; like the god=\r\n - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me give another analog=\r\ny. This life is like a long dream. Saviklapa\n&gt; samadhi is like wakig up *wi=\r\nthin* the dream. Nirvikalpa samadhi is like\n&gt; waking up from the dream. Sah=\r\naja samadhi is like being in the dream and yet\n&gt; being awake.\n&gt;\n&gt; This may =\r\nconfuse people, but this analogy shows how complex and difficult\n&gt; sahaja s=\r\namadhi is. The previous computer analogy highlights how things work\n&gt; in a =\r\nsahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and =\r\nhow is it different from nirvikalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; Hari\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e65c88acb226930477b6c133\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Does this mean a Yogi or teacher w=\r\nho can easily get into nirvikalpa samadhi be able to read=A0&lt;div&gt;a student&=\r\n#39;s mind who might be several miles away?

The previous computer analogy highlights how things =\r\nwork in a sahaja samadhi, but does not show why and how difficult it is.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n &lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;br&gt;\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarp=\r\nana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSpirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFree Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_bl=\r\nank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nJyotish writings: &lt;a href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.Sri=\r\nJagannath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; What is sahaja samadhi and how is it different from nirvikalpa samadhi?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; best regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Sr=\r\ni Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sahaj S=\r\namadhi all times.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;c=\r\nolor:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0016e65c88acb226930477b6c133--\r\n\n"}}
