As we move further, percentage o=\r\nf faith increase overtime and that of logic decrease. At one time, you have=\r\n to leave all the logic. At a stage, During his lessons to M Shri Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahansa told him to leave all reasoning. Shri Ramakrishna repeated/h=\r\nighlighted this to him many times.\n\nIn start of spirituality we find that b=\r\nooks are our best guide. They answer our questions very well. But after som=\r\ne time a stage comes when we feel that books are infact &#39;over-guiding&#39; us. =\r\nThey are trying to give words to our emotions and trying to limitize our fe=\r\nelings. I think it is right time to quit reading. I am also feeling so abou=\r\nt myself. But dont know if I am thinking right.\n\nSometime back someone said=\r\n to me &quot;I was reading Geeta when Shri Krishna said to Arjuna &#39;Oh Arjuna, st=\r\nop reading all the books...&#39;. I didnt read even Geeta from that shloka onwa=\r\nrds&quot;\n\nThanks for the links Chandraprakash ji.\n\nMay Lord keep showing the ri=\r\nght way to all of us.\n\nDeep regards\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Chandra prakash,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Any intelligent, rational man is an atheist. Until, of course he &gt;&gt;is ini=\r\ntiated into religion.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Pure rational intelligence will be thoroughly l=\r\nogical and would want evidences (which can be perceived by physical senses)=\r\n for anything and everything. Same goes for existence of God/Nature/Self/et=\r\nc...so the by product is lack of belief in the core essence and purpose of =\r\nreligion i.e. Spirit.\n&gt; He/she will naturally lack faith (Shradhdhaa). When=\r\never, in life, due to bitter experiences and/or past Samskaaraas, Logic tak=\r\nes backseat and Faith is born, the person is initiated in to religion. It i=\r\ns actually Initiation in to internal religion which may or may not reflect =\r\nexternally. However, it is my opinion that, it is better to depend upon Log=\r\nical mind while inquiring for truth until faith is born  established and ev=\r\nen after that in the journey.\n&gt; I think, Dr. Atual&#39;s view point matches the=\r\n above. And you already know all these!\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I am tired of logi=\r\nc as my profession is the area of PLCs (i.e. Programmable *Logic* Controlle=\r\nrs :) and writing Process *logic* for long.
