[vedic-wisdom=\r\n] &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:\n\n=C2=A0   \n\nNamaste,\nI was seeing t=\r\nhis thread. Two small comments, feel free to ignore them if they don&#39;t make=\r\n sense.\nFirstly it is indeed true that for many traditional practices a Gur=\r\nu is needed, however it is neither sanguine nor fail-proof, by which I mean=\r\n there are often cases where even Guru may not be able to save a disciple f=\r\nrom a certain kind of experience. One of the main reasons being in this poi=\r\nnt of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who has the Shakti an=\r\nd the Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the disciple from al=\r\nl experiences or prepare the disciple properly and make experiences digesti=\r\nble is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who can really control=\r\n these stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very very rare, and it d=\r\noes not matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outside of all sampra=\r\ndaya.=C2=A0\nIn such an environment doing ones own sadhana without waiting f=\r\nor a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Regarding homas there are two kinds of =\r\nhomas. One where it is a process to connect to God using Agni Tattwa. When =\r\none prays in a temple to an idol one is trying to use Prithiwi Tattwa. Othe=\r\nrwise, in principle, both are similar. Of course practical differences exis=\r\nt and that is due to the difference in the nature of the two great elements=\r\n.=C2=A0\nThen there is the homa done for Kriya-s or specific results. That i=\r\ns complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR mentions in his manuals=\r\n that he does not encourage such homas or one should ideally use these only=\r\n for the purpose of worshiping deities.\n\nI started my first homa in 2007 wh=\r\nen I did not know PVR or even this website. Infact I come from an environme=\r\nnt when is not particularly religious or ritualistic and I had frankly neve=\r\nr even seen a homa. But the year before that I had a strange and chance enc=\r\nounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addressed as a Guru - and h=\r\ne inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curious and started sadhana =\r\nwith mantra japa. Then one day I felt a strong desire to do homas. I asked =\r\nsome people around me and all of them unanimously told me not to do so. I s=\r\ntill did anyway. =C2=A0Since then it has been nearly 9 years I have been do=\r\ning homas to different deities. Of course in between now and then I have co=\r\nme across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped me or directed me or tol=\r\nd me a step here and step there, rest I just kept walking. This led to some=\r\n experiences too over the years. But none of these yogis were really tradit=\r\nional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give me formal diksha.\nOne of the main sad=\r\nhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chandi homas. I remember one d=\r\nay I came across a very traditional individual who was shocked when I told =\r\nhim that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it cannot be done like this an=\r\nd it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong negative consequences are b=\r\nound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now I tend to get bit aggressi=\r\nve when I find condescending people. So I told him that I have done more th=\r\nan 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped counting) and not only done=\r\n them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Shakti peethas, in deserte=\r\nd locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Shakti sadhana, where man=\r\ny ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if he really believed what =\r\nhe said, that would mean that the Mother must have allowed me to do these, =\r\nfor I did not face any wrath but only more opportunities to intensify the s=\r\nadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me doing things in a non-t=\r\nraditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.=C2=A0\nI am not saying or su=\r\nggesting that tradition is wrong, it is there for a purpose but getting the=\r\n spirit of the rules in Tradition is far more important than blind followin=\r\ng of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity, not the other way round. And=\r\n given the point in time where we are, I am afraid there will be more and m=\r\nore souls who will worship and eventually interact with Deities outside of =\r\nformal traditions. For a soul who has done sadhana and wants to do so, will=\r\n always do so, Nature and the Deity will make it happen, irrespective of wh=\r\nether s/he lines up with a tradition or not, whether s/he is born in India =\r\nor South Pole. This is the new reality.\nOn the other hand if the mind has d=\r\noubts about consequences of going in a non-traditional manner, then one is =\r\nbetter off not doing so. Because doubts make the sadhana go wrong, and the =\r\nmind itself will cause more obstructions that anyone or anything else. Mind=\r\n can be our best friend in the path, or our worst enemy.\n\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=\r\n =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\nComing to the dream that you saw, I would say it was a ver=\r\ny significant dream. =C2=A0Snakes in dreams can have various meanings. Not =\r\nall are good. But this one seems to me like a indication of a very specific=\r\n kind of spiritual expeirence to come, or would have come to you, had you n=\r\not made any change =C2=A0in your routine sadhana.=C2=A0\nSpirituality has tw=\r\no parts. We start off with a desire to experience God, we do whatever we th=\r\nink can help us in that, which can lead to experiences which tell us we may=\r\nbe come a bit closer. Then comes digesting them. To do so one has to have a=\r\n stable mental and emotional condition.\nFrom what you described my sanguine=\r\n feeling is that a strong experience was coming your way, but doubt and fea=\r\nr stopped it and made it recede back. Now spiritual experiences are not lik=\r\ne daily states of consciousness. If they were, they would be no good. They =\r\nare different. And that came make us feel unnerved at times.\nDid this happe=\r\nn due to homa? I think it was destined for you at some point. It could as w=\r\nell have happened one early morning as you were having a cup of tea without=\r\n lifting a finger. What sadhana does - by which I mean homa, japa, yoga wha=\r\ntever - is change the patterns of karma and accelerate the experiences that=\r\n would have come to you anyway. But more than that it helps your mind-body =\r\nto stabilize which is vital to be able to integrate and digest an experienc=\r\ne when it comes.=C2=A0\nSo without thinking about it I would suggest that yo=\r\nu keep doing sadhana, whatever it maybe. As you do more, you nervous system=\r\n will grow stronger, your emotional, and mental sheath with become calmer a=\r\nnd stabler and maybe the next time the Snake comes you won&#39;t feel unnerved!=\r\n -:)\nWish you all the best.\n-Regards=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\nI have a hundred live=\r\ns before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with=\r\n heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobind=\r\no\n     From: &quot;ManiBhushan surya manibhushan@...

One of the main reasons being in this point=\r\n of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who has the Shakti and =\r\nthe Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the disciple from all =\r\nexperiences or prepare the disciple properly and make experiences digestibl=\r\ne is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who can really control t=\r\nhese stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very very rare, and it doe=\r\ns not matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outside of all samprada=\r\nya.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184727&quot;&gt;In such an environment doi=\r\nng ones own sadhana without waiting for a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Re=\r\ngarding homas there are two kinds of homas. One where it is a process to co=\r\nnnect to God using Agni Tattwa. When one prays in a temple to an idol one i=\r\ns trying to use Prithiwi Tattwa. Otherwise, in principle, both are similar.=\r\n Of course practical differences exist and that is due to the difference in=\r\n the nature of the two great elements.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_1=\r\n6_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_=\r\n1446544625582_184813&quot;&gt;Then there is the homa done for Kriya-s or specific r=\r\nesults. That is complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR mentions =\r\nin his manuals that he does not encourage such homas or one should ideally =\r\nuse these only for the purpose of worshiping deities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_14465=\r\n44625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184846&quot;&gt;I started m=\r\ny first homa in 2007 when I did not know PVR or even this website. Infact I=\r\n come from an environment when is not particularly religious or ritualistic=\r\n and I had frankly never even seen a homa. But the year before that I had a=\r\n strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addr=\r\nessed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curio=\r\nus and started sadhana with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a strong desir=\r\ne to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanimously to=\r\nld me not to do so. I still did anyway. &nbsp;Since then it has been nearly=\r\n 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in between=\r\n now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped m=\r\ne or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just kept wa=\r\nlking. This led to some experiences too over the years. But none of these y=\r\nogis were really traditional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give me formal diks=\r\nha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_14=\r\n46544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_185296&quot;&gt;One of t=\r\nhe main sadhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chandi homas. I rem=\r\nember one day I came across a very traditional individual who was shocked w=\r\nhen I told him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it cannot be done l=\r\nike this and it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong negative consequ=\r\nences are bound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now I tend to get b=\r\nit aggressive when I find condescending people. So I told him that I have d=\r\none more than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped counting) and no=\r\nt only done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Shakti peethas,=\r\n in deserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Shakti sadhana=\r\n, where many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if he really bel=\r\nieved what he said, that would mean that the Mother must have allowed me to=\r\n do these, for I did not face any wrath but only more opportunities to inte=\r\nnsify the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me doing things=\r\n in a non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_18=\r\n4339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_185519&quot;&gt;I am not saying or sug=\r\ngesting that tradition is wrong, it is there for a purpose but getting the =\r\nspirit of the rules in Tradition is far more important than blind following=\r\n of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity, not the other way round. And =\r\ngiven the point in time where we are, I am afraid there will be more and mo=\r\nre souls who will worship and eventually interact with Deities outside of f=\r\normal traditions. For a soul who has done sadhana and wants to do so, will =\r\nalways do so, Nature and the Deity will make it happen, irrespective of whe=\r\nther s/he lines up with a tradition or not, whether s/he is born in India o=\r\nr South Pole.

Because doubts make the sadhana go wrong, and the mind itself w=\r\nill cause more obstructions that anyone or anything else.

To do so one has to have a stable mental and emotional condition.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;n=\r\none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;From w=\r\nhat you described my sanguine feeling is that a strong experience was comin=\r\ng your way, but doubt and fear stopped it and made it recede back. Now spir=\r\nitual experiences are not like daily states of consciousness. If they were,=\r\n they would be no good. They are different. And that came make us feel unne=\r\nrved at times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_18433=\r\n9&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_14465446255=\r\n82_184339&quot;&gt;Did this happen due to homa? I think it was destined for you at =\r\nsome point. It could as well have happened one early morning as you were ha=\r\nving a cup of tea without lifting a finger. What sadhana does - by which I =\r\nmean homa, japa, yoga whatever - is change the patterns of karma and accele=\r\nrate the experiences that would have come to you anyway. But more than that=\r\n it helps your mind-body to stabilize which is vital to be able to integrat=\r\ne and digest an experience when it comes.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D=\r\n&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;lt=\r\nr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;So without thinking about it I =\r\nwould suggest that you keep doing sadhana, whatever it maybe. As you do mor=\r\ne, you nervous system will grow stronger, your emotional, and mental sheath=\r\n with become calmer and stabler and maybe the next time the Snake comes you=\r\n won&#39;t feel unnerved! -:)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_14465446=\r\n25582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_=\r\n1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;Wish you all the best.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yu=\r\ni_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; =\r\nid=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=\r\n=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;=\r\n id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br =\r\nclear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;signature&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625=\r\n582_184329&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_185490&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184328&quot;&gt;&lt;i id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_=\r\n1_1446544625582_184327&quot;&gt;&lt;b id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184326&quot;&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i=\r\n&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184325&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184331&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new=\r\n roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rg=\r\nb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_1342435=\r\n27249950&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_185488&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives b=\r\nefore me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, /&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will =\r\nwith heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri =\r\nAurobindo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_1342=\r\n43527249952 yui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy=\r\n;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;yQTDBase yqt2596242270&quot; id=3D&quot;yqt57689&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184324&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:Helvetica=\r\nNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, Sans-Serif;font-size=\r\n:12px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184323&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, Sans-Serif=\r\n;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184322=\r\n&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;   &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\n&quot;ManiBhushan surya manibhushan@...

The mantras I was chanting were reverb=\r\nerating in me in the night and some times in the day. One night I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw whether to call it dream but one snake with radiating light chanting the =\r\nmantra &nbsp;was &nbsp; Coming nearer to my head as if it was trying to tak=\r\ne me into that. Then I waved it &nbsp;with &nbsp;no no . Immediately it dis=\r\nappeared. Surprisingly the reverberation also stopped. After two days I was=\r\n down with fever and electric shocks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am not doing homam.
