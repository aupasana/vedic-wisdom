He positively asserts that, on t=\r\nhe dawn of knowledge, karma naturally and necessarily ceases to function. K=\r\narma of any kind is, according to Shankara, a hindrance to final emancipati=\r\non of the soul, and the performance of karma involves one in the cycle of s=\r\namsara. It is only Brahmajnana that rends asunder the knots of ignorance an=\r\nd bestows moksha on the soul.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sannyasa is absolutely necessary whether=\r\n it be vividisha-sannyasa or vidvat-sannyasa.
