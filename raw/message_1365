Over and above the temple now there is Sheelnath maharaj &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Dhuni Sanstan and also Swami VishnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s Ashram located &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the valley of the hill where Mother Chamunda temple is situat=\r\ned.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mother in this temple manifested many times and gave g=\r\nuidance and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there ar=\r\ne others who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; benefited too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; They all stayed at th=\r\ne Temple in devas. It is said even today many\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mahatmas in Sooksma=\r\n sareer come to pray Chamunda Devi on a regular &lt;BR&gt;&gt; basis.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Best Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mitesh&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- ------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih =\r\nShaantih ||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
