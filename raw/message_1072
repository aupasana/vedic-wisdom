I mentioned name of Shivaji as he was having all that \nchara=\r\ncteristics required to really create edifice from scratch. he \npossessed ta=\r\nct, shrewdness, maneuvering, velour, organizing ability, \nflexibility to re=\r\nspect situation, etc... and could create, \nEffectively, the Hindvi Swarajya=\r\n during times of total Darkness. \nShivaji could achieve that because he was=\r\n mentored by Samarth Ramdas, \nJija Mata and supported by sooooo many.. Baji=\r\nprabhu, Tanaji,Dadoji \nKondadev, Murarbaji to name few.\n\nOn the contrary, T=\r\nhe Great Maharana Pratap, couldn&#39;t achieve for us \nwhat Shivaji achieved be=\r\ncause of the contemporary Traitors in \nRajputana land. Most infamous exampl=\r\ne is Mansingh. Disputes of \nEgoistic brave Rajput Kings has cost our mother=\r\nland so horribly.\nHere, it is my personal opinion that Maharana actually co=\r\nuld n&#39;t \nsucceed in uniting The Rajput kings against the great Akabar.\n\n***=\r\n\nas you rightly mentioned, Sikhs must be highly respected. they have \ngiven=\r\n their lives for saving Hindus. if they wouldn&#39;t have come \nforward volunta=\r\nrily, I fear, what would have been left in Punjab area?\nand we crack jokes =\r\non them. I try my best not to entertain any jokes \nwhich are on Sardarjis.\n=\r\n\n\nArya Samaji movement of Swami Dayaananda Saraswati was one noteworthy \nth=\r\ning happened which was also effective in checking conversion.\n*** \n\nFinally=\r\n i mention here that Vedic Sanskruti (Sanaatan Dharama) has \nsurvived the t=\r\nest of times (Unlike Babylon, Greek culture) because of \nSpiritual strength=\r\n. Spiritualist of all the level has born in this \nland in plenty every time=\r\n, known &amp; unknown. Ramdas was there so \nShivaji came, Thakur, Vivekanan=\r\nda, Sainbaba, Raman Maharshi were \nthere so we got Tilak maharaj, Sardar, G=\r\nandhiji, Subhash chandra, and \nband of people who struggled for Independenc=\r\ne.\n\nlastly, if Sanaatan Dharma people, in the current times also doesn&#39;t \nc=\r\nare and doesn&#39;t invest their resources to Convert people from other \nfaith,=\r\n if they maintain this one principal steadfastly, lives \nspiritual life as =\r\nmuch as possible, i am sure, Santan Dharma will \nnever ever be finished.\n\ny=\r\nours \n\nutpal\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Amit Trivedi &l=\r\nt;sonat64@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rajarshiji/Utpalji,\n&gt; Namaskaara=\r\nm,\n&gt; Though Shivaaji Mahaaraja&#39;s contribution to Hinduism is sterling \na=\r\nnd undebatable-he had Samrtha Raamdaasa as his guru who kindled in \nhim an =\r\nambition after explaining him the Kshaatra Dharma -this \nCommentary is a ve=\r\nry famous Grantha : Daasa Bodha in Maraathi.\n&gt; Of course-Shivaaji Mahaar=\r\naja&#39;s mother Jeejabai was no less \ninspiring !\n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO- Hinduism in=\r\n places like&nbsp; Northern Indian region like \nMathura,as mentioned by Raj=\r\narshiji were saved from the Islamic tirade \nby Sikh Gurus like Guru Gobind =\r\nSinghji who fought the iconoclasts at \na very tender age of Nine years !
