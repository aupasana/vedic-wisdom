This has involved o=\r\nut-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indi=\r\nan origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and s=\r\nhe searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything phys=\r\nically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due t=\r\no deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves =\r\nas having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- =\r\nthis has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psyc=\r\nhiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western med=\r\nicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged kundalini, we struggle to =\r\nhelp them.\n\nMany yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience w=\r\nith this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wa=\r\nkened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from=\r\n the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is so=\r\nmething she cannot escape from.\n\nI wondered what solution there could be to=\r\n her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifes=\r\nts as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure=\r\n her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good sa=\r\nmaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not k=\r\nnow of)- their suffering really is pitiable. \n\nAnd let us be careful in our=\r\n sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is w=\r\nhy the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be y=\r\nour instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini rising bit to God&#39;s will.\n\nOm Dum D=\r\nurgayai Namaha\n\nAparna \n\n\n \r\n--1004636618-2143224444-1362048605=:71347\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;In Tantra=\r\n, to focus on Kundalini, one needs a few things going.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1 - Bhuta Sud=\r\ndhi.
