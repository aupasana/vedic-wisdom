I was writing in a flow and never checked w=\r\nhat I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read through them. As they say, =\r\n&quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nDuring the day time, we roamed a=\r\nround shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never visited any of =\r\nthe temples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;t we visit t=\r\nhem?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot;=C2=A0Aren&#39;t we=C2=A0going to the most=\r\n powerful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently agreed. This is somethin=\r\ng about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or standard places=\r\n of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside temple and stand an=\r\nd stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, &quot;There is somethin=\r\ng here.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nDuring evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnar=\r\nam Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=C2=A0during the 16th century. The pl=\r\nace is called Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. A=\r\ns we walked inside the Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are st=\r\nrong energies in here. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=C2=A0 p=\r\nranam=C2=A0at the samadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the =\r\nAshram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating fo=\r\nr 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=A0 Manish, on being=C2=\r\n=A0questioned, said that many sadhanas have been done here in this place fo=\r\nr long by people with no mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are stron=\r\ng here. While looking around the Ashram we found some quotations which were=\r\n written in small wooden boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed =\r\nto one quotation. Translated to English, it read, &quot;If you have to give your=\r\n head off to get a sadguru, you\n have=C2=A0got it cheap&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nBy 8 PM we=\r\n sat for dinner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient t=\r\nime before going to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach w=\r\nhile performing any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in =\r\nthe body is fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that =\r\ndigests ideas/concepts/ experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which e=\r\nxists in the subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order for=\r\n one to &quot;digest&quot; various experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when =\r\nthe Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are =\r\nextremely focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget =\r\nfood, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and =\r\ndecrease in Jathara Agni.\n=C2=A0\nAs we sat eating our food and talking on d=\r\nifferent topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here is a =\r\nthread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha and=\r\n=C2=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. \n=C2=A0\nManish said, &quot;It is the same s=\r\net of=C2=A0souls who come back=C2=A0again and again in different bodies and=\r\n personalities at different times, who=C2=A0are responsible for this land. =\r\nThere was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, =\r\nShankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They can come as kings, yo=\r\ngis, or any other form which is necessary for them to accomplish their dhar=\r\nma. And their dharma is connected to this land=C2=A0which we call India=C2=\r\n=A0today.This land is connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Ri=\r\nshis sent people when needed.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardonin=\r\ng Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey h=\r\nis Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fate.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&quot;One very senior R=\r\nishi has decided to=C2=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so sh=\r\nall it happen.=C2=A0Ved=C2=A0Dharma will be re established here along the l=\r\nength and breadth. Nothing, however powerful or mightly, be it an individua=\r\nl or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0can stand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;=C2=A0 Arunish=\r\na asked a pertinent question here. &quot;What were the Rishis doing for=C2=A0one=\r\n thousand years?&quot;. Manish laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend a=\r\n thousand years simply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=C2=A0one day=\r\n=C2=A0wake up from meditation=C2=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=C2=A0a=\r\nnd all sorts of non-spiritual things going on here. So He decides, it is ti=\r\nme to get back and re create the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=\r\n=C2=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changi=\r\nng a country is child&#39;s play for Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me =\r\nslowly. Therefore it is so important to keep doing sadhana, in some manner =\r\nor the other.\n=C2=A0\nAs night approached midnight, Manish and I left for th=\r\ne Manikarnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Man=\r\nikarnika, for now. We walked long the=C2=A0deserted ghats, sliently. I aske=\r\nd him if it is ok doing a=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2=\r\n=A0yes why not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the=\r\n divine feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the sta=\r\nte of highest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his b=\r\nody and mind such that it can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=C2=A0worshipping t=\r\nhe divine Mother is the best way.=C2=A0That is why Vimalananda says, &quot;Let t=\r\nhe Mother show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted to Vimalanand=\r\na. Manish said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Maha=\r\nkala exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda d=\r\nid Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika. &quot; Then staring at the pitch black =\r\nganges, Manish chuckled lightly and\n added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; This =\r\nwas again an old conversation we had started=C2=A0before which Mainsh conti=\r\nnued, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were t=\r\no stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flowin=\r\ng through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has created a=\r\n army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books=C2=A0are like a Bible=C2=A0f=\r\nor sadhakas,=C2=A0arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I asked him if =\r\nit was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied tha=\r\nt yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important question =\r\nis whether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. I=\r\nnterestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention =\r\nthat a time will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas. Strange, or m=\r\naybe not so. Who knows how deep things run. \n=C2=A0\nWe reached the samshan =\r\nby half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place where we had sat on=\r\n the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body had been burnt a=\r\nlready. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacef=\r\nully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more. In the middle =\r\nof the homa Manish would slowly lift his=C2=A0palm upwards=C2=A0and with th=\r\ne next ahuti=C2=A0immediately the fire would leap higher. He did this quite=\r\n a few times, when=C2=A0the flames were getting weaker. I countinued with t=\r\nhe Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and when he required an=\r\nything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came towards us and excla=\r\nimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. This homa was=\r\n faster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, straight Chandi homa. =\r\nAgain in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around som=\r\ne of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I was\n enjoying it. A f=\r\new people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a r=\r\nule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the=\r\n head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom R=\r\naja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram B=\r\naba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because o=\r\nf this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. =\r\nI was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many people in the s=\r\namshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run=\r\n away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why there are people h=\r\nere even so late in the night.\n=C2=A0\nOnce the final purnahuti was given, w=\r\ne sat for meditation. Though this homa got over faster than previous days, =\r\nthe meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if=\r\n my mind would just burst forth and expand across the length and breadth of=\r\n the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 mi=\r\nnutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slight=\r\nest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and sli=\r\nghtly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remark=\r\ned, &quot; I could have just left my body and gone off. It did not matter that I=\r\n had a flight to catch the next day, or anything else. I was on the verge o=\r\nf death. Just at that moment the cow and brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added=\r\n, &quot;What a sight it would have been for the people to see, how the body can =\r\nbe left at will&quot;.=C2=A0 I did not know what to say. \n=C2=A0\nWe stood there =\r\nwatching another pyre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had beco=\r\nme black with deep=C2=A0red patches all over. The dom came forward, and wit=\r\nh the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo stick)=C2=A0from the side of the=\r\n corpse, lifting up the burning torso into the air and placing it again, st=\r\nrategically, in the middle of the pyre. The smooth=C2=A0motion of lifting u=\r\np the half burnt torso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo stick,=C2=\r\n=A0into the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift =\r\npieces of food - meat=C2=A0or vegetables, both dead -=C2=A0from our plates =\r\nto our mouths. Manish asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled back in ackno=\r\nwledgement. Then he commented=C2=A0that I should write about this experienc=\r\ne in the coming days. Let people know.\n=C2=A0\nBy this time I remembered tha=\r\nt when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog=C2=A0had run off wi=\r\nth one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! Lea=\r\nve the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish said we had a rna with this sams=\r\nhan. We had been here before, in some life.\n=C2=A0\nAs we were returning, Ma=\r\nnish said one of the point (the three peaks)=C2=A0of Shiva&#39;s trishul passes=\r\n through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot; samshan. Anyone who tri=\r\nes anything negative here will face troubles. The trishul of Shiva guards t=\r\nhis place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary disturbance inside the sams=\r\nhan. That is also why there are people here even at 2 am in the morning. Th=\r\nere is safety in numbers. As long as ones intentions are genuine and good, =\r\nManikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nWhile walking along =\r\nthe ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=A0totally deserted, Manish instructed me not t=\r\no stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it=C2=\r\n=A0with one=C2=A0hand and kept moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish=\r\n. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thought and recollected =\r\nthat yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a =\r\n&quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once t=\r\nhe ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do not wait along the ba=\r\nnks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water=C2=A0late in the nig=\r\nhtt. There are things in the water. Generally they may not do anything, but=\r\n why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika =\r\nGhat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to l=\r\nive in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-i=\r\nntoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is their city.\n=C2=A0\nNe=\r\nxt morning, as we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked=\r\n about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both =\r\npaths of=C2=A0Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one =\r\nmust get the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I=C2=\r\n=A0enquired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to=\r\n be done before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish=C2=A0laughed =\r\nand replied,=C2=A0&quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;=\r\n.=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nWhile talking about Ramayana with Aru=\r\nnisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice became slow and heavy=\r\n,=C2=A0&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s body is deep blue with a golden tinge all=C2=A0=\r\naround him. Like a sun blazing. That=C2=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by =\r\nVishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable=\r\n. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands=C2=A0is so fast that=\r\n a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed =\r\na forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2=A0ma=\r\nntra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of =\r\nhis right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2=\r\n=A0command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy. \n=C2=A0\nAnd Ra=\r\nma removed even=C2=A0his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human be=\r\ning when he defeated Ravana which=C2=A0means; he even removed the last vest=\r\nige of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder th=\r\nen, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the nam=\r\ne of Sri Rama?&quot;. \n=C2=A0\nHe spoke with such an energy which cannot be defin=\r\ned, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.\n=C2=A0\nThus en=\r\nds my recounting of our fascinating trip to Kasi.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Raj=\r\narshi\n\n\n\nRama Naama Satya Hai..\n\n--- On Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajar=\r\nshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;=\r\n\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogro=\r\nups. com\nDate: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Na=\r\nrasimha\n=C2=A0\nIt may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life al=\r\nl the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess ga=\r\nme. \n=C2=A0\nGreat analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he=C2=\r\n=A0completed a beautiful=C2=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=C2=A0one =\r\ndivine chess player, and it is totally His game. \n=C2=A0\nBefore I continue =\r\nwith the narration, I would like to mention a few points which I found I ha=\r\nd not clearly mentioned in my last mail:\n=C2=A0\n\nAt the end of the third da=\r\ny of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the =\r\npyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write ab=\r\nout this experience in a public forum. Therefore my mails.\n=C2=A0\n\nCaveat: =\r\nA homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhana, and it is not en=\r\ntirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said=C2=A0only someone w=\r\nho has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, =\r\nor someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing t=\r\nhe homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, =\r\nby reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. =\r\n\n=C2=A0\n\nMany people have a negative=C2=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and A=\r\nghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the phil=\r\nosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV cha=\r\nnnels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted indiv=\r\niduals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are talking =\r\nabout, and their accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is on=\r\ne of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It is ne=\r\nither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We=\r\n must follow our chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respect fo=\r\nr other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken this p=\r\nath. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were=\r\n all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master=\r\n Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand objective=C2=A0account =\r\nof how a\n powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am =\r\njust the cronicler.\n=C2=A0\n\nThere are many people in this age who have a de=\r\nsire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, bu=\r\nt have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2=\r\n=A0people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a fig=\r\nment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousan=\r\nds of years ago. But to go about it and=C2=A0actually be able to do this sa=\r\ndhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or r=\r\nules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=C2=A0an=\r\nd let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and pa=\r\ntience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature=\r\n will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every indiv=\r\nidual=C2=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2=A0kind.=\r\n=C2=A0 In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanad=\r\na says :\n\n\n&quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. L=\r\net them know what is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a =\r\nfew will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself w=\r\nill make arrangements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they wi=\r\nll be taught according to their capabilities. The progression will go on; t=\r\nhere is nothing to fear&quot;.\nTherefore have faith, do sadhana.=C2=A0 \n\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nBack to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. M=\r\nanish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are avail=\r\nable on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past midnight we were wa=\r\nlking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be se=\r\nen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we =\r\nfound a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stop=\r\nped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started m=\r\nentally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journ=\r\ney smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the=\r\n other side who chased the dogs away.=C2=A0Without looking at me=C2=A0Manis=\r\nh said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big=\r\n for your breeches&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nAs we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this i=\r\ns a wonderful place.=C2=A0I did not think too much about it then since my m=\r\nind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next=\r\n day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I sud=\r\ndenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish s=\r\nmiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the =\r\nenergies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that=\r\n the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not s=\r\nay anything.=C2=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was f=\r\nrom Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to st=\r\nay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idio=\r\nt.\n=C2=A0\nBack to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled =\r\nwith people. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manis=\r\nh kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people started st=\r\naring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through to the m=\r\niddle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing=\r\n the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in=\r\n thousands of years there has not been a single minute when there has not b=\r\neen a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in Indi=\r\na. There was one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenl=\r\ny I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not=\r\n want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my conc=\r\nern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only th=\r\ne bull,=C2=A0 but there is something else as well. I did not ask him what. =\r\nSo we\n went to another side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish,=\r\n &quot;Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated=\r\n one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the people standing aro=\r\nund the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire i=\r\ns too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were man=\r\ny curious onlookers, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could =\r\nhear the dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at.=\r\n This is something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people=\r\n would have objected, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of=\r\n this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries.=\r\n Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these things or heard from=\r\n their families and thus they do not disturb. \n=C2=A0\nThe homa, as usual wa=\r\ns awesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous night. The heat was ve=\r\nry strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous=\r\n night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this py=\r\nre. This was strange because=C2=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, an=\r\nd all of them chose this specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs h=\r\nave a far subtler sense perception than average humans like me. This homa w=\r\nas extended longer. Every now and then Manish would suddenly look at a cert=\r\nain direction intently for a few second. I too would turn and look that way=\r\n but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or m=\r\nade some gestures, the dogs too would start barking at that direction. At o=\r\nne point I almost felt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense thin=\r\ngs which I=C2=A0 - being such an=C2=A0ordinary person -=C2=A0obviously had =\r\nno clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path=C2=A0I could hear\n chants o=\r\nf &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brough=\r\nt in. \n=C2=A0\nSuddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of smok=\r\ne, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at th=\r\nat. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and =\r\nleaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As th=\r\ne Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shado=\r\nw pass over=C2=A0the pages of the=C2=A0book. I thought it was some relative=\r\n who was standing behind me.=C2=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find t=\r\nhere was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again. T=\r\nhis time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying=\r\n to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=C2=A0 Manish later said, as one does sadhana t=\r\nhe deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if sli=\r\nghtly.=C2=A0It is not an imagination but reality and this can=C2=A0happen n=\r\not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing=\r\n sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nWhile offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut rolled =\r\noff from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes use to str=\r\noke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=C2=A0had b=\r\neen a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natural strokin=\r\ng the pyre=C2=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered if=C2=A0there was any=\r\n company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily take it=\r\n. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=C2=A0Inte=\r\nrestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra coconut while=\r\n buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood why.\n=C2=A0\nIn the=\r\n middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who was st=\r\nanding nearby and told him=C2=A0that the person whos body was in the pyre h=\r\nas just left and that=C2=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. I=\r\nt was already late in the night. The person did not know what to say. Sudde=\r\nnly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad bei=\r\nng done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was menta=\r\nlly wondering about what is going on. Then another of the relatives came fo=\r\nrward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok=\r\n and asked them to sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of t=\r\nhe homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse=C2=A0 I =\r\nsaw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to=\r\n see!\n=C2=A0\nThere is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=C2=A0at the end t=\r\no finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to p=\r\nour water on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. F=\r\ninally at the end they came to Manish and=C2=A0asked if they could pour som=\r\ne Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will hap=\r\npen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water=\r\n but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after=\r\n some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi=C2=A0samne kha=\r\ndi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reve=\r\nntially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=C2=A0Manish&#39;s feet, bu=\r\nt Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distrib=\r\nuted some flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very =\r\nlate in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had a=\r\nddressed earlier) came\n running with tears in his eyes asking for forgivene=\r\nss for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he h=\r\nas done no wrong, everything is all right.=C2=A0 Later Manish said, if it w=\r\nas some other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup=\r\n of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a c=\r\nertain saint (a famous saint)=C2=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without=\r\n responding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied in=\r\nterior=C2=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the=\r\n night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India s=\r\no unique, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred =\r\n&#39;educated&#39;=C2=A0people are too rational to understand these things. God lov=\r\nes the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam t=\r\no the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my head to m=\r\ny heart, there was nothing\n below, no legs, no stomach ,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I =\r\nwas simply floating on thin=C2=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he just =\r\ngave a=C2=A0curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nAs we were wa=\r\nlking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lad=\r\ny who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhan=\r\nas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her while med=\r\nitating.&quot; For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is practically dif=\r\nficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre.=\r\n Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manis=\r\nh. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above)=\r\n, I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish =\r\nquitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had seen last night =\r\nin his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionless. &quot; At =\r\nthat time there was nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it is so =\r\nimportant to keep doing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemp=\r\nlating which is of no good,=C2=A0so that you are ready when\n Nature decides=\r\n to give you a push. \n=C2=A0\nAfter passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=\r\n=C2=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed li=\r\nke any other tourist, specially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=\r\n=C2=A0and the=C2=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close t=\r\no Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked s=\r\neeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.\n=C2=A0\nThus ended=\r\n my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Ma=\r\nnikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\nRajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\n\nRama Naam Satya=\r\n Hai\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon s=\r\nuch errors and read through them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;During the day t=\r\nime, we roamed around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never=\r\n visited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temples? =\r\nWon&#39;t we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot;&nbsp;Aren&#39;t we&nbsp;g=\r\noing to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently agreed. =\r\nThis is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or=\r\n standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside tem=\r\nple and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, &quot;T=\r\nhere is something here.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;During evening we wen=\r\nt to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kas=\r\ni&nbsp;during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before ent=\r\nering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish=\r\n became silent, then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we medi=\r\ntated for sometime, Manish did&nbsp; pranam&nbsp;at the samadhi of Baba Bha=\r\ngwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered =\r\nNirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnik=\r\na Samshan.&nbsp; Manish, on being&nbsp;questioned, said that many sadhanas =\r\nhave been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane desire=\r\ns. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram=\r\n we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Manish=\r\n called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to English=\r\n, it read, &quot;If you have to give your head\n off to get a sadguru, you have&n=\r\nbsp;got it cheap&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;By 8 PM we sat for dinner. =\r\nWe used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before going =\r\nto the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while performing a=\r\nny sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is fixed=\r\n. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/con=\r\ncepts/ experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the subt=\r\nle body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to &quot;digest&quot; =\r\nvarious experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jathara Agni =\r\nis less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremely focused=\r\n on something and working intently on the same, we forget food, we do not f=\r\neel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jatha=\r\nra Agni.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we sat eating our food and talking=\r\n on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here =\r\nis a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunish=\r\na and&nbsp;me) had before coming to Kasi. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Man=\r\nish said, &quot;It is the same set of&nbsp;souls who come back&nbsp;again and ag=\r\nain in different bodies and personalities at different times, who&nbsp;are =\r\nresponsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Pr=\r\nithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, =\r\n&quot;They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for th=\r\nem to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land&n=\r\nbsp;which we call India&nbsp;today.This land is connected to the Rishis. Th=\r\nis is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed.&nbsp;Prithviraj mad=\r\ne one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who =\r\nmade Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fate.&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;One very senior Rishi has decided to&nbsp;ch=\r\nange this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.&nbsp;Ved&nbs=\r\np;Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Nothing,=\r\n however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or&nbsp;group,&nbsp;can s=\r\ntand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;&nbsp; Arunisha asked a pertinent questio=\r\nn here. &quot;What were the Rishis doing for&nbsp;one thousand years?&quot;. Manish l=\r\naughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years simply in s=\r\namadhi, meditating. Then suddenly&nbsp;one day&nbsp;wake up from meditation=\r\n&nbsp;and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone&nbsp;and all sorts of non-spiritual=\r\n things going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create =\r\nthe Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about&nbsp;what a Rishi can do. One=\r\n Rishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child&#39;s play f=\r\nor Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so imp=\r\nortant to keep\n doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manik=\r\narnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnik=\r\na, for now. We walked long the&nbsp;deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him i=\r\nf it is ok doing a&nbsp;homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said&nbsp;yes =\r\nwhy not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine=\r\n feminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of h=\r\nighest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and=\r\n mind such that it can hold shakti&nbsp;for which&nbsp;worshipping the divi=\r\nne Mother is the best way.&nbsp;That is why Vimalananda says, &quot;Let the Moth=\r\ner show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Mani=\r\nsh said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala ex=\r\nists powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Maha=\r\nkala sadhana here in Manikarnika. &quot; Then staring at the pitch black ganges,=\r\n\n Manish chuckled lightly and added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; This was aga=\r\nin an old conversation we had started&nbsp;before which Mainsh continued, &quot;=\r\nAll these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand=\r\n infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flowing throu=\r\ngh them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has created a army o=\r\nf sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books&nbsp;are like a Bible&nbsp;for sadh=\r\nakas,&nbsp;arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I asked him if it was =\r\npossible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied that yes i=\r\nt was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important question is whet=\r\nher one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. Interest=\r\ningly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention that a =\r\ntime will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas. Strange, or maybe no=\r\nt so. Who knows how deep things run. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We reach=\r\ned the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place wher=\r\ne we had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body h=\r\nad been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came=\r\n and sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more.=\r\n In the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his&nbsp;palm upwards&n=\r\nbsp;and with the next ahuti&nbsp;immediately the fire would leap higher. He=\r\n did this quite a few times, when&nbsp;the flames were getting weaker. I co=\r\nuntinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and when=\r\n he required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came towar=\r\nds us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;=\r\n. This homa was faster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, straigh=\r\nt Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pus=\r\nhing around some of the coconut pieces to make them\n burn properly. I was e=\r\nnjoying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Ka=\r\nsi there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of th=\r\ne Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old t=\r\nimes, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporar=\r\ny of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe =\r\nit is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for t=\r\nhese sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many =\r\npeople in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, ev=\r\neryone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why the=\r\nre are people here even so late in the night.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nOnce the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa=\r\n got over faster than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, =\r\nwas superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and ex=\r\npand across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I =\r\nhad to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditati=\r\nng for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still =\r\nlike a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That =\r\nmade him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just left my body a=\r\nnd gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, o=\r\nr anything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow a=\r\nnd brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would have been for=\r\n the people to see, how the body can be left at will&quot;.&nbsp; I did not know=\r\n what to say. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We stood there watching another=\r\n pyre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with de=\r\nep&nbsp;red patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo sti=\r\nck inserted it (the bamboo stick)&nbsp;from the side of the corpse, lifting=\r\n up the burning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in =\r\nthe middle of the pyre. The smooth&nbsp;motion of lifting up the half burnt=\r\n torso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo stick,&nbsp;into the thin, =\r\ndark, night-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - m=\r\neat&nbsp;or vegetables, both dead -&nbsp;from our plates to our mouths. Man=\r\nish asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then h=\r\ne commented&nbsp;that I should write about this experience in the coming da=\r\nys. Let people know.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;By this time I remembered=\r\n that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog&nbsp;had run of=\r\nf with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai!=\r\n Leave the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish said we had a rna with this =\r\nsamshan. We had been here before, in some life.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;As we were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)&nbsp=\r\n;of Shiva&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;saf=\r\ne&quot; samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The=\r\n trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary d=\r\nisturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even =\r\nat 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intenti=\r\nons are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While walking along the ghats&nbsp;which were&n=\r\nbsp;totally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red =\r\nlungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it&nbsp;with one&nbsp;hand and k=\r\nept moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if =\r\nI had got some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint=\r\n smell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of=\r\n similar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you =\r\nare out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not =\r\nmove too close to the water&nbsp;late in the nightt. There are things in th=\r\ne water. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The pro=\r\ntection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriy=\r\na Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this G=\r\nanges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas woul=\r\nd roam around\n naked. It is their city.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Next m=\r\norning, as we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked abo=\r\nut Vedas.&nbsp;Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both path=\r\ns of&nbsp;Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must=\r\n get the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I&nbsp;en=\r\nquired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be d=\r\none before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish&nbsp;laughed and r=\r\neplied,&nbsp;&quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.&nbs=\r\np;I was dumbstruck.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While talking about =\r\nRamayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice beca=\r\nme slow and heavy,&nbsp;&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s body is deep blue with a golde=\r\nn tinge all&nbsp;around him. Like a sun blazing. That&nbsp;was the kavacha =\r\ngiven to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It=\r\n was impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands&nbs=\r\np;is so fast that a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours =\r\nhe had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.&nbsp;Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga.=\r\n It was a&nbsp;mantra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga ha=\r\nd become part of his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at=\r\n the slightest&nbsp;command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the enem=\r\ny. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And Rama removed even&nbsp;his Gayatri Kav=\r\nacha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Ravana which&nb=\r\nsp;means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a God, and f=\r\nought like a human. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north India go=\r\nes crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?&quot;. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he w=\r\nas there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Thus ends my recounting of our fascinating trip to Kasi.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRO=\r\nNG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: n=\r\navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT color=3D#00007f&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&l=\r\nt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDE=\r\nR-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@y=\r\nahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2&lt;BR&gt;To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv252821719&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vA=\r\nlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It may sou=\r\nnd weird, but this is what happens in real life all the time.

Manish had given this analogy to us after he&n=\r\nbsp;completed a beautiful&nbsp;Ganapati homa last August. There is&nbsp;one=\r\n divine chess player, and it is totally His game. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;Before I continue with the narration, I would like to mention a few po=\r\nints which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikar=\r\nnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish sud=\r\ndenly said, in the coming days you will write about this experience in a pu=\r\nblic forum. Therefore my mails.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRON=\r\nG&gt;Caveat&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor&nbsp;sadhan=\r\na, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is said&=\r\nnbsp;only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can t=\r\nry this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Man=\r\nish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)&nbsp;I was only doing the Chand=\r\ni Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try=\r\n out this sadhana. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;Many people have a=\r\n negative&nbsp;bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due t=\r\no lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of thes=\r\ne sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films e=\r\ntc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly inc=\r\norrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts s=\r\ntart with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the r=\r\neach the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a=\r\n path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen pat=\r\nh but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many gre=\r\nat saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is con=\r\nsidered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga =\r\nSwami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are inten=\r\nded to give a first hand\n objective&nbsp;account of how a powerful sadhana =\r\nin the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/U=\r\nL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;There are many people in this age who have a =\r\ndesire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, =\r\nbut have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such&n=\r\nbsp;people that these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a fi=\r\ngment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousa=\r\nnds of years ago. But to go about it and&nbsp;actually be able to do this s=\r\nadhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or =\r\nrules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now&nbsp;a=\r\nnd let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and p=\r\natience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Natur=\r\ne will one day make arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every indi=\r\nvidual&nbsp;because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so&nbsp;kind=\r\n.&nbsp; In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalana=\r\nda says :&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Pub=\r\nlish this book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let them know wh=\r\nat is what. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few will be sin=\r\ncere. They will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will make arrang=\r\nements for them to learn just as She did for me, and they will be taught ac=\r\ncording to their capabilities. &lt;U&gt;The progression will go on; there is noth=\r\ning to fear&lt;/U&gt;&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;P dir=3Dltr&gt;Therefore have faith, do =\r\nsadhana.&nbsp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Back to the=\r\n narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said =\r\nit is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on thi=\r\ns night which can destroy Ashuras.&nbsp;Past midnight we were walking towar=\r\nds Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere=\r\n on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pac=\r\nk of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wonder=\r\ning if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally cha=\r\nnting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. =\r\nCoincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side=\r\n who chased the dogs away.&nbsp;Without looking at me&nbsp;Manish said, &quot;So=\r\nmetimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your b=\r\nreeches&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish =\r\nsaid this is a wonderful place.&nbsp;I did not think too much about it then=\r\n since my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to com=\r\ne. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shoo=\r\nting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became cal=\r\nm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapash=\r\nya and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since =\r\nI knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however =\r\nI did not say anything.&nbsp;Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someon=\r\ne who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami=\r\n used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a con=\r\nfirmed idiot.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Back to midnight. We reached Man=\r\nikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait=\r\n. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we=\r\n came in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfully made wa=\r\ny for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at =\r\nthe middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/=\r\n10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a s=\r\ningle minute when there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it i=\r\ns one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which M=\r\nanish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand =\r\nright next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked danger=\r\nous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other si=\r\nde of the samshan. It not only the bull,&nbsp; but there is something else =\r\nas well. I did not ask him\n what. So we went to another side. The dom there=\r\n came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log&nbsp;kaun se chita me baith=\r\nna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead =\r\nand asked the people standing around the chita to make space for us to sit.=\r\n He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;l=\r\nl sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space fo=\r\nr us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to dis=\r\nturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about Manik=\r\narnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not here. Manish=\r\n later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done=\r\n in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsleve=\r\ns seen these things or heard from their families and thus they do not distu=\r\nrb. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre =\r\nwas larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus =\r\nwas stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten m=\r\ninutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange=\r\n because&nbsp;there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose =\r\nthis specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler se=\r\nnse perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. =\r\nEvery now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intent=\r\nly for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. Bu=\r\nt, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, t=\r\nhe dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost fe=\r\nlt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I&nbsp; - b=\r\neing such an&nbsp;ordinary person -&nbsp;obviously had no clue about. In th=\r\ne middle of the Chandi\n path&nbsp;I could hear chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai=\r\n&quot; and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of sm=\r\noke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at =\r\nthat. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire an=\r\nd leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As =\r\nthe Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human sha=\r\ndow pass over&nbsp;the pages of the&nbsp;book. I thought it was some relati=\r\nve who was standing behind me.&nbsp;I looked back and was a shocked to find=\r\n there was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again.=\r\n This time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and sayi=\r\nng to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).&nbsp; Manish later said, as one does sadhana=\r\n the deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if s=\r\nlightly.&nbsp;It is not an imagination but reality and this can&nbsp;happen=\r\n not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doi=\r\nng\n sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While offering coconuts into the =\r\nfire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick w=\r\nhich the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I=\r\n wondered if I&nbsp;had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I stran=\r\ngely felt natural stroking the pyre&nbsp;the way the domes do. I even wonde=\r\nred if&nbsp;there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job=\r\n, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom =\r\nat Manikarkina!&nbsp;Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bough=\r\nt one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I unde=\r\nrstood why.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In the middle of the homa, suddenl=\r\ny Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him&n=\r\nbsp;that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that&nbsp;t=\r\nhey (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in the ni=\r\nght. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him,=\r\n do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only pr=\r\naying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what is =\r\ngoing on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum l=\r\nog ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down =\r\nand continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish aske=\r\nd me to observe the skin on the corpse&nbsp; I saw the skin on the face had=\r\n caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water&nbsp;at the end to fins=\r\nh the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour wa=\r\nter on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally=\r\n at the end they came to Manish and&nbsp;asked if they could pour some Gang=\r\nes water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to=\r\n the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but n=\r\nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some =\r\nmore ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi&nbsp;samne khadi hai=\r\n. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventiall=\r\ny bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch&nbsp;Manish&#39;s feet, but Mani=\r\nsh would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed s=\r\nome flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very late i=\r\nn the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had\n addres=\r\nsed earlier) came running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for=\r\n having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has don=\r\ne no wrong, everything is all right.&nbsp; Later Manish said, if it was som=\r\ne other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of te=\r\na. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain=\r\n saint (a famous saint)&nbsp;who used to live in Kasi. Manish without respo=\r\nnding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied interior=\r\n&nbsp;Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the night=\r\n. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India so uniq=\r\nue, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educa=\r\nted&#39;&nbsp;people are too rational to understand these things. God loves the=\r\n simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the =\r\nfire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my\n head to my hea=\r\nrt, there was nothing below, no legs, no stomach ,&nbsp;as if&nbsp;I was si=\r\nmply floating on thin&nbsp;air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=\r\n&nbsp;curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish su=\r\nddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who=\r\n has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know h=\r\now to go about it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and per=\r\nform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a=\r\n Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to=\r\n meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to =\r\nthe Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreig=\r\nner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is=\r\n the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;Sh=\r\ne has desire, but directionless. &quot; At that time there was nothing more we c=\r\nould do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana =\r\non your own, instead of merely contemplatin\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
