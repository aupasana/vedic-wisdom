The self-realized\nones can impart knowledge unto=\r\n you because they have seen the truth.&quot;\n\nBhagavad Gita 4:34\n\n\nWHAT IS DIKSH=\r\nA?\n\nThe formal process of entering the systematic spiritual path of\nSanatan=\r\na Dharma is known in the Sanskrit language as &quot;Diksha&quot;, or\nspiritual initia=\r\ntion.  The ancient process of Diksha initiation is\nconsidered to be of cruc=\r\nial importance throughout the entire Vedic\ntradition as one enters a more s=\r\nerious and disciplined course of\npractice of Dharma spirituality.  Through =\r\nundergoing the ancient Vedic\nceremony of Diksha, one openly embarks on the =\r\npath of Yoga,\nmeditation, and spiritual practice under the skilled tutelage=\r\n of a\nrecognized Guru, or Spiritual Teacher.  In addition, the Diksha\nproce=\r\nss signifies one&#39;s acknowledged welcoming into the family of the\ngreat trad=\r\nition of Sanatana Dharma.  \n\nOn Saturday, May 31st, from 3-5 PM, Sri Dharma=\r\n Pravartaka Acharya, the\nResident Spiritual Preceptor (Acharya) of the Hind=\r\nu Temple of\nNebraska, will be conducting a large public Diksha initiation c=\r\neremony\ndesigned to both accept formal shishyas (students), and as an\nhisto=\r\nrical welcoming ceremony of several dozen Americans to their path\nof Sanata=\r\nna Dharma.  This will be the very first time in history that\na welcoming ce=\r\nremony to Hinduism of this size and significance will\nhave ever been public=\r\nly performed.  \n\nThis sacred Hindu ceremony will take place in the temple r=\r\noom of the\nHindu Temple of Nebraska before God and the presence of the Deva=\r\ns and\nDevis.  \n\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nTo be considered as a possible shishya and =\r\ncandidate for this\nimportant initiation ceremony, you must contact Sri Acha=\r\nryaji and be\ninterviewed for eligibility before May 20, 2008.  Sri Acharyaj=\r\ni can be\nreached at: (402) 896-4294, info@....\n\nCandidates fo=\r\nr Diksha initiation must observe the following requirements:\n\n=95\tAcceptanc=\r\ne of the philosophical principles of Dharma.  \n\n=95\tStrict vegetarianism.\n\n=\r\n=95\tFollowing the Yamas & Niyamas of the Yoga system.\n\n=95\tAcceptance of th=\r\ne Vedic scriptures as your spiritual guide.\n\n=95\tBelief in the principles o=\r\nf karma/reincarnation.  \n\n=95\tSincerity, humility, and a willingness to pra=\r\nctice the path of\nDharma under the guidance of a qualified Guru.  \n\nDo not =\r\nmiss this historic opportunity to spiritually transform your\nlife, and to b=\r\ne publicly accepted to the family of Sanatana Dharma.  \n\n\nhttp://www.dharma=\r\ncentral.com\n\n\n\n"}}
