How can =\r\ni again experience the Beloved.\nThat then is the experience of mantra when =\r\nit is done correctly.\nWhen the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that th=\r\ne deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as tha=\r\nt Deity(Devata).\nThere then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity=\r\n commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be =\r\nit that which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra=\r\n devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self identific=\r\nation is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution continues.\nRemember=\r\n, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me which is black magic. It i=\r\ns all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as =\r\nPrachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be tha=\r\nt of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death of the body, =\r\nsuch a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was originally a Nath =\r\nor a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings. \nAttacking su=\r\nch a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads of the attacker=\r\ns and some people may realise this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jal=\r\nandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake=\r\n). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here there is only ac=\r\ntion and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, and you will get a =\r\nresult of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes =\r\nlater. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with the universe and =\r\nhas very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because you=\r\nr attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the un=\r\niverse).\nIf people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,=\r\n Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2=\r\n=A0then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification with =\r\nthe body and so their actions are those which are generally termed as black=\r\n magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they have been usi=\r\nng after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\nImagine if somebody is=\r\n worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or sh=\r\ne is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repition=\r\ns of a mantra(because of his previous effort).\nOn the other hand somebody d=\r\noing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bi=\r\nnd every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.\nAccording=\r\n to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy=\r\n sadhana.\nIf one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 re=\r\nititions of the Savitri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0Gayatri, but the real =\r\nGayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\nSame time every day.\nSame pl=\r\nace.\nSame materials.\nSame direction.\nAs little movement as one can.\nCount o=\r\nn rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\nComplete restraint on sex(from=\r\n the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a bear=\r\nd.\nDo not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty befor=\r\ne you start.\nContinue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times=\r\n.\nSee the difference in your personality before and after.\nLong and short ,=\r\n what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadhana, and persi=\r\nst with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.\nI hope this cla=\r\nrifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n=C2=A0\nKind Love an=\r\nd Regards\nmanish\nYou may post this on the list as a clarification from me i=\r\nf you feel that this is suitable.\n=C2=A0\nOn Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, N=\r\narasimha P.V.R.

If one does not want to command god and wants to be a beggar who =\r\nwill take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras and =\r\nall the umpteen technicalities.=C2=A0These thousands of mantras and umpteen=\r\n technicalities are for commanding thousands of different results from god.=\r\n That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding wo=\r\nrks slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.\n=C2=A0\nAls=\r\no, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black =\r\nmagic, which can be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spirit=\r\nually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings suc=\r\nh as gods is possible only for a spiritually=C2=A0elevated person with no o=\r\nr extremely small ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an ego=\r\nistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succ=\r\needing in completely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I=\r\n will repeat something from the previous mail to clarify:\n=C2=A0\n\nThe unive=\r\nrse has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects.=\r\n There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly,=\r\n there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control=\r\n the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reve=\r\nrberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This pe=\r\nrfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal =\r\nchanges by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the =\r\nmantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and =\r\ncorresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n=C2=A0\nEach set =\r\nof &quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various man=\r\ntras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging self-awareness in a ma=\r\nntra fully and getting a specific result from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; f=\r\nrom god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essentially that.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nBut the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sa=\r\ndhaka of very low ego can command specific results from god (not for selfis=\r\nhness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached=C2=A0instrument=\r\n of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and tech=\r\nnicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThose are hardly of use to so many people out there with dense egos =\r\nseeking specific selfish results. They cannot command specific results from=\r\n god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn due=\r\n to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they use all the techni=\r\nques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astrology. Instead o=\r\nf wasting their time with these technicalities, they will be better off lea=\r\nrning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n=C2=A0\nJust pick any prasiddha mant=\r\nra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so many techni=\r\ncalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait =\r\nfor him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and wheneve=\r\nr he gives.\n=C2=A0\nKeep praying every day or every second when you are able=\r\n to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your actions. Wh=\r\nen you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it is his =\r\nand that=C2=A0he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly t=\r\nhe dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is =\r\nfaaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekday,=\r\n right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from questi=\r\nonable sources!).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThere may be a mountain wi=\r\nth thousands of paths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it.

Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific=\r\n path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is usele=\r\nss to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). =\r\nIt is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, w=\r\nho can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with v=\r\nery little ego).\n=C2=A0\nEven when you encounter a person who has legs and c=\r\nan actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mo=\r\nuntain and traverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astr=\r\nologers who are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take c=\r\nustomized mantra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a res=\r\nult quickly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. Th=\r\ne power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result o=\r\nbtained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mant=\r\nra is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view sh=\r\nows a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do hav=\r\ne to survive the climb along the long path.\n=C2=A0\nWe need to emphasize the=\r\n attitude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing t=\r\nhe choice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many g=\r\nreat spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasi=\r\nze picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasize=\r\nd having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, =\r\npersistence, discipline, humility etc!!!!=C2=A0*That* is a lot more importa=\r\nnt and useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day et=\r\nc and impress god.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; when should the worship =\r\nof a graha be done?

You keep sa=\r\nying Parasara says so and yet there is nothing forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rashi =\r\nis associated with the Aditya as the rashi come into existence because of t=\r\nhe Sun, which is the agni tattva. Vara is also agni tattva among the pancha=\r\nnga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi. Karma has been advi=\r\nsed in the vaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora of the lords of the =\r\nrashi related to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting and other such karma=\r\n related to rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Moon is the significator of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content*=\r\n related to the maya manifestation of everything in life. Suffering is caus=\r\ned as we do not fathom the karma associated that resulted in suffering and =\r\nfasting is a a means of self punishment and correction related to the raash=\r\ni where the aroodha is. Just as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin=\r\n, fasting on vaara related to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins as=\r\nsociated with the suffering in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfact=\r\nion as the *moon* content has not been addressed, at least the initiation o=\r\nf the aroodha occurs and people find their partners, get married and get al=\r\nong with life. Proof lies in the pudding and with so many cases where peopl=\r\ne have fasted on UL days and have got result, we have found faith in these =\r\nteachings reinforced. Why fast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting t=\r\nhe flaw associated with the raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it\n is r=\r\nelated to the material effects of the bhava and that is what people are loo=\r\nking for when they come to th astrologer. You have done well to recall my t=\r\neachings in this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should worship a female deity and women shold worship a=\r\n male deity for the UL fasting. I wonder if they really follow this.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhy not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun is always good for the Upa=\r\npada (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limited this to day fasting and =\r\nnot night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This is my interpolation. [ sati=\r\nsfied J ] Elders would have given long periods of fast starting from the va=\r\nara, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of child! You think I should b=\r\ne doing that! You think anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself before asking m=\r\ne to advise those hard penance kind of fasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who says the Moon has no=\r\nthing to do with the arudha. It is the sustainer. Now people to an astrolog=\r\ner when they are looking for getting married and hardly anyone comes these =\r\ndays asking for prolonging marriage.

His section on remedial measures is full of=\r\n various homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himse=\r\nlf and I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do=\r\n them by themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you g=\r\none through the Navagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana and other pura=\r\nnic literature?\n&gt; \n&gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for mo=\r\nst of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth=\r\n doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshat=\r\nra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on any hous=\r\ne or arudha in the chart.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya dosha is to be pe=\r\nrformed on Amavasya, when should the worship of a graha be done? Let us say=\r\n someone wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this wor=\r\nship should be done?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* f=\r\nrom Parasara.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dv=\r\naipaayana) got his knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, whe=\r\nre did they get it from?\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. Pe=\r\nople are mentioning complicated principles that are not found in classics o=\r\nr works of rishis and scaring people that performing austerities such as fa=\r\nsting on certain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insu=\r\nlt to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and ba=\r\nsed on hasty thinking. There may be a little difference between doing an au=\r\nsterity on different days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to t=\r\nhe difference between doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wr=\r\nong day&quot; does not cause danger as being suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am=\r\n sorry. I missed the context and just saw some mails that were forwarded to=\r\n me amidst my writing. But them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in =\r\nthat many many have benefitted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, o=\r\nur shastras primarily talk about worshipping various deities on various day=\r\ns, based on the energy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, cer=\r\ntain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on =\r\nthe deity and irrespective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analog=\r\ny. If a rich man comes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific=\r\n day, a beggar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mo=\r\nod of the giver is more important.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E2=84=A2s not right...at least people who read this will think. Let=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s say Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi de=\r\nvata of the Sun and is not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C a day after Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyad=\r\nhi devata of Mercury and is worshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. =\r\nNOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C again a day after! So what happened to the en=\r\nergy equation? J\n&gt; \n&gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is mo=\r\nre important and the variations based on individual horoscope are less impo=\r\nrtant. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations. But they are sma=\r\nller and, more importantly, I question if they are actually well-understood=\r\n by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and =\r\nover-selling unreliable principles of questionable origin and scaring peopl=\r\ne on that basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not u=\r\nnderstood even the basics of Sanatana dharma! Some behave as if there is a =\r\nbattle going on between Shiva and Vishnu =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C it=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s hilarious to see how these are just attempts to convert=\r\n Hinduism into a religion they have left rather than trying to learn what H=\r\ninduism means. Being newly converted there is a bellicose patriotism in the=\r\nm to prove their faith to the *new god* they have found and every other God=\r\n must be the devil in disguise!! It will take years for many to learn that =\r\nthere is no devil. It=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s a figment of their imaginati=\r\non and whatever is devilish is the dark side of mankind himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shast=\r\nra is useless\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; and the Rishi=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=80=9E=C2=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wh=\r\nen any one mantra would suffice.

Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it i=\r\ns limited and we should take our limitations into consideration.\n=C2=A0\nThe=\r\n universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many ob=\r\njects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accord=\r\ningly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly c=\r\nontrol the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantr=\r\na reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. T=\r\nhis perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes int=\r\nernal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific t=\r\no the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the univers=\r\ne and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n=C2=A0\nHow=\r\never, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one=\r\n who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fu=\r\nlly in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quit=\r\ne evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely =\r\nextremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantra and m=\r\nantras do not=C2=A0work for them as they are supposed to.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nJust repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anyt=\r\nhing. Some people may think that certain results come when they repeat a ma=\r\nntra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may wor=\r\nk for one person quickly and another may spend the whole life chanting it a=\r\nnd nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is neede=\r\nd for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult than one may th=\r\nink.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nA highly learned scholar in the court of =\r\na king may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants from king.=\r\n An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather than trying to com=\r\nmand (and failing for sure).\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, most people are better off b=\r\negging god for what they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to=\r\n command what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great =\r\nscholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, =\r\npatience and=C2=A0persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar need=\r\ns the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet =\r\nfor most people is to learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n=C2=A0\nWhat =\r\npeople today need for material and spiritual progress through remedial meas=\r\nures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of too=\r\nls such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to comman=\r\nd a specific result from god.\n=C2=A0\nIt is worth noting that so many great =\r\nspiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pi=\r\ncking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized hav=\r\ning the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persi=\r\nstence, discipline, humility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and u=\r\nseful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and im=\r\npress god.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne more thing. We have many mantra=\r\ns given by rishis, but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how=\r\n to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers toda=\r\ny do not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules co=\r\nming from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfe=\r\nction. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irre=\r\nspective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and=\r\n 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for=\r\n debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s ast=\r\nrologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has =\r\na sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an=\r\n astrology theoretician.\n=C2=A0\nIf not, there is no foolproof way to know t=\r\nhe right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel a=\r\nttracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude=\r\n. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at =\r\ngod&#39;s door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you s=\r\nucceed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of succes=\r\ns than great scholars.\n=C2=A0\n\nAny prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panc=\r\nhakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krish=\r\nna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=\r\n=C2=A0etc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. W=\r\nithout the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothin=\r\ng.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nI hope this sufficiently clarifies my sta=\r\nnd.

So one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by =\r\nwater element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (p=\r\nrosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that f=\r\nasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire=\r\n element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasim=\r\nha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri=\r\n creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are cre=\r\nated by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lo=\r\nrded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=\r\n=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represen=\r\nted by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n=C2=A0\nThus, 12=\r\nth house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field =\r\nof maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and=\r\n Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be =\r\nassociated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the=\r\n tripod method in dasa judgment.\n=C2=A0\nThus, it is actually more logical t=\r\no say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL an=\r\nd UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n=C2=A0\nIs the above &quot;*more correc=\r\nt* answer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradi=\r\ntion?\n=C2=A0\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; The mantra one meditates wi=\r\nth at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective than at other times.=\r\n The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion or speech will ena=\r\nble far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then me=\r\nditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Ra=\r\nth:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best blessing for good=\r\n mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger cau=\r\nsing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct e=\r\nating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than complete fasting.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then =\r\none is destined to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus =\r\nall energy on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one =\r\nshould meditate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaaha=\r\naro). In any case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eat=\r\ning are heavily restrained in effectiveness.\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concept=\r\ns is quite illogical.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is th=\r\ne very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the interface betwee=\r\nn fire and water.

But the question is of contact. If I am thinki=\r\nng of fire in my mind while standing in water, it does not kill the fire. T=\r\nhere is no contact.\n=C2=A0\nMy point is that the examples given have no real=\r\n identifiable contact between water and fire.\n=C2=A0\nOne can be creative an=\r\nd come up with a lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Ve=\r\nnus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis=\r\n marked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occup=\r\nied by Moon and Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can sa=\r\ny fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes ganda=\r\nnta and serious danger.\n=C2=A0\nIt is not enough to show some fire and some =\r\nwater. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical =\r\nextrapolations.\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt; Three years back=\r\n you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two years back =\r\nand again recently that you are leaving jyotish.

You pick a=\r\nny weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent=\r\n) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at t=\r\nhe end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that practice for a certain d=\r\nuration of time (say, a few months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a=\r\n vow and keep the vrata for the duration.

Of course you a=\r\nre right as it will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishin=\r\ng to marry should not fast on UL days and should choose any day (all days a=\r\nre the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do=\r\n a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (o=\r\nr maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, =\r\nthe marriage will happen!

To say that a wrong choic=\r\ne means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross=C2=A0exaggeration.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nThe main thing is that you need milk and sugar.

It is funny that I should be typing this email on=\r\n an Ekadashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscope=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I write on dvadasi when so many vasihnava also fast =\r\nand keep great austerities. J Any difference?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point an=\r\nd view about the question raised. 2nd bhava is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, =\r\nsustainer, and if we fast on the day of UL in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring in=\r\nsult to Vishnu who provides the food for us.\n&gt; \n&gt; My dear Zoran, please all=\r\now me to express my disagreement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Austerities can never be seen as an =\r\ninsult to Vishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasti=\r\nng) or speech (mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up foo=\r\nd or speech is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmach=\r\narya) is not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though=\r\n Brahma was very angry that his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed=\r\n celibate. So He created others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remaine=\r\nd celibate? Why should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is =\r\nit an insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signifi=\r\ncation of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation process...which is w=\r\nrong Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagn=\r\na or 7th which is....you know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th hous=\r\ne as it is necessary for procreation. It is only the link of this with the =\r\nBrahma graha that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people a=\r\nre as eligible for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on th=\r\ne following of dharma and ashrama.\n&gt; \n&gt; Various gods bestow various things =\r\non us, some at the gross physical level and some at the subtle spiritual le=\r\nvel. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things, we make progress at =\r\nthe subtle level.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (an=\r\nd subtle internal energy associated with it) is used for digesting it and f=\r\nor generating physical energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is =\r\nunused and available for other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a r=\r\nesult, one can better digest mantras and spiritual food available all aroun=\r\nd one.\n&gt; \n&gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is =\r\nfar more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherwis=\r\ne spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra medita=\r\ntion. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize th=\r\ne effect of the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Corre=\r\nct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days when one f=\r\nasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn a=\r\nnd this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many ti=\r\nmes better than complete fasting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have n=\r\not heard this about 2nd lord and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upap=\r\nada is a rashi and carries energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the=\r\n day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energ=\r\ny to vara, and gandanta may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger=\r\n. So, what is the way out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara =\r\nonly and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so S=\r\nurya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? Wha=\r\nt is happening?\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Go=\r\nuri rules over the element of water and one worships Gouri at the time of m=\r\narriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could e=\r\nven say that UL/marriage is represented by water element and fasting on UL =\r\nlord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity and well-being) to one=\r\n&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord=\r\n should be prohibited as it brings the fire element represented by weekday =\r\nto the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the May=\r\na and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the c=\r\nreator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everything through the =\r\nshakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her due to the lordships=\r\n of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a =\r\n*more correct* answer.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of =\r\ngandanta concepts is quite illogical.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretch=\r\ning ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the =\r\ninterface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, =\r\nthe fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart=\r\n but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Now one more thing: Marriage is a yoga between two souls and why not sug=\r\ngest fasting on the yoga day of the UL lord?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What! What=\r\n a brilliant suggestion...why don=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you start it?=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now suppose instead of 11th house if Mercury goes to=\r\n 12th house or 4 \n&gt; &gt; house then you cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi fo=\r\nr the same \n&gt; &gt; because these thithis are ruled by Mercury only and fasting=\r\n on these \n&gt; &gt; tithis will create serious doshas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Picking tithi based =\r\non house (12th house - Dwadashi, 4th house - Chaturthi) is illogical as the=\r\nre are 12 houses only and more tithis.\n&gt; I have realized one thing over the=\r\n years - If something is not structurally sound, it is most likely false kn=\r\nowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] J No comments\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I can categorica=\r\nlly declare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi=\r\n and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday o=\r\nr tithi and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. =\r\nYou can take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (sa=\r\ny, a few months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the v=\r\nrata for the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the =\r\nvrata, there is nothing like it!\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine=C2=A0 s=\r\ntatement but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other teaching=\r\ns of the seers is of not much relevance. Of course you are right as it will=\r\n be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry should n=\r\not fast on UL days and should choose any day (all days are the same) or any=\r\n tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mant=\r\nra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few year=\r\ns ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will h=\r\nappen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If you keep such a vrata sincerely, you will make positive progress tow=\r\nards achieving your purpose and definitely not go backwards, irrespective o=\r\nf what is said by technical calculations based on our half-baked Jyotish kn=\r\nowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; My friends, use the Jyotish knowledge available, b=\r\nut do realize that it is imperfect and corrupted. Why is only the UL lord i=\r\nmportant? So many planets may have so many kinds of influence on UL in a ch=\r\nart. And UL is one of several factors showing marriage. There may be variou=\r\ns influences in a chart showing marriage. Is our thumb rule of using UL lor=\r\nd&#39;s weekday missing some important factors? Quite possible!\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Ra=\r\nth:] That is a very nasty statement. Once again you have used adjectives (*=\r\nimperfect, corrupted*) which is not becoming of you. Why must you use nasty=\r\n statements? Can=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you say things nicely? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thre=\r\ne years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two=\r\n years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is gett=\r\ning very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is=\r\n PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different levels=\r\n of their understanding and intelligence. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you have the time to lis=\r\nten to the Jaimini Lectures at http://sohamsa.com/js/ do so as it will show=\r\n you the depths of this knowledge you cannot imagine exists in jyotish. The=\r\n derivation of the chnhandas and what not all. Thumb rules are meant for be=\r\nginners. The day you decided to give up jyotish, you got stuck in the thumb=\r\n rules but then its ok with me. I always wished you the best in whatever yo=\r\nu do.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection, if a thumb rul=\r\ne allows you to pick an austerity with confidence and create the mental fee=\r\nling that you are doing the best possible thing for your situation, it is g=\r\nood. After all, what is critical is to do *some* austerity to burn the bloc=\r\nking karma, with a positive frame of mind about what you are doing.\n&gt; \n&gt; [S=\r\nanjay Rath:] No Narasimha, very happy marriages can happen, without austeri=\r\nties as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, if endless theorization and complicated technicalit=\r\nies evolving from the thumb rule are creating doubts and confusion in the m=\r\ninds of people as they consider an austerity, that is useless and totally m=\r\nissing the point.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people tend to resort to heavy theorization bas=\r\ned on very shaky grounds. I suggest going back to the basics, thinking clea=\r\nrly and keeping things simple.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Human brains work differ=\r\nently in seeking the truth and means to remedy the errors. Life is too comp=\r\nlicated to keep everything simple. For example, a heavily cursed Venus can =\r\nblock everything and UL fast may not be able to solve the problem. Now woul=\r\nd you say that heavy thoerization and complication is happening and we shou=\r\nld ignore the other factors completely?\n&gt; \n&gt; Gem stones may harm when used =\r\nincorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahma=\r\ncharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can d=\r\no it on any weekday or tithi without too many calculations.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Ra=\r\nth:] Brahmacharya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who ca=\r\nnnot conceive and this is kept for some period before the appointed date of=\r\n nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abs=\r\ntinence from physical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
