(Stomach should not be full)\n- Mditation, Pranaayaam, Japa,=\r\n Homam or such Saadhanas\n- Shirsaasan, Sarvaangaasan\n- Prohibition of seein=\r\ng TV Channels and Movies\n- Thinking mentally that all women are Sisters/Mot=\r\nhers\n\nAbove all, Prayers to the Ishta Devata. unceasing prayer is the key. =\r\n\nwithout Grace of the Lord, it is impossible to uproot the Desire \ncomplete=\r\nly.\n\nefforts, efforts and efforts.... prayers, prayers and prayers...cry \na=\r\nnd then one will start winning over the most draded of enemies.\n\nVivekanand=\r\na said &quot;The Character is establised through thousand \nstumbles&quot; - no need t=\r\no lose heart.\n\nwarm regards,\n\nutpal\n\n\n    \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Ajit Krishnan&quot; \n&lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I apol=\r\nogize for opening my mouth. This is truly a case of the \nblind leading\n&gt; th=\r\ne blind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overco=\r\nming \nthe basic\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire com=\r\ne back later. \nBut, if one\n&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  =\r\nThis is the nature \nof desire.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One of my favourite books is the mud=\r\ngala-purana, which is a purana \nabout\n&gt; Ganesha. Here, Ganesha has 8 avatAr=\r\nas, which come to destroy 8 \ndemons: envy,\n&gt; lust, delusion, greed, anger, =\r\ndesire, &quot;my-ness&quot; and pride. In the \nchapter\n&gt; where Ganesha destroys the &quot;=\r\ndesire demon&quot;, the demon is described \nas having\n&gt; two children -- shoShaNa=\r\n and duShpUra i.e. (1) one who dries \nthings up /\n&gt; destroys and (2) one wh=\r\no can never be satisfied.\n&gt; \n&gt; Satisfying desire always results in fanning =\r\nthe fire of desire. \nAnd in the\n&gt; process, other things become neglected (d=\r\nried up). Eventually, one \nfeel&#39;s\n&gt; guilt / shame, where, again, the heart =\r\nliterally feels like it is \ndrying up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesha comes to uproot the &quot;de=\r\nsire demon&quot; as the \navatAra &quot;vikaTa&quot;, which\n&gt; means &quot;one who is horrible / =\r\nmonstrous&quot;. The purana explains that \nwe have to\n&gt; see things &quot;as they are&quot;=\r\n. To do this, we should think of desired \nobjects, as\n&gt; something horrible.=\r\n The desire falls away, and we will be able to \nsee\n&gt; Ganesha in his vikaTa=\r\n form.\n&gt; \n&gt; This technique is described in Shankaracharya&#39;s famous stotra &quot;=\r\nmoha\n&gt; mudgara&quot;, i.e. taking a hammer to &quot;delusion&quot;. This is also known \nas=\r\n &quot;bhaja\n&gt; govindam&quot;. Here, he teaches that we should repeatedly remember \nt=\r\nhat the\n&gt; female form is merely a modification (rather a horrible \ncontorti=\r\non) of flesh\n&gt; and fat.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, we pray to Ganesha, who illuminates the =\r\nworld, and shows it \nas it is,\n&gt; contorted and un-deserving of desire.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n bhavadIyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt;        ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
