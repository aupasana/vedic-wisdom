Next to the Kaali shrine, there was a Krishna shrine wit=\r\nh a beautiful Krishna idol and Ramakrishna used to meditate there sometimes=\r\n. Due to an accident when another priest was carrying the idol during a fes=\r\ntival, the idol broke oneday.\n=C2=A0\nThe priests and the highly learned sch=\r\nolars were in a quandary and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras w=\r\nere clear that a broken idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to=\r\n be immersed in flowing water. So the learned scholars recommended immersin=\r\ng the idol in Ganges.\n=C2=A0\nRamakrishna was asked by the temple administra=\r\ntion for his view. He thought for a while and said calmly, &quot;Suppose you hav=\r\ne a son and his leg is broken. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at h=\r\nome and continue to love him or will you throw your son into Ganges?&quot; His s=\r\nimple common sense view prevailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ram=\r\nakrishna himself fixed the broken idol. It was re-installed at the temple a=\r\nnd continued to be worshipped.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe idol was in=\r\n your house for 56 years. Suddenly, the new found knowledge is creating pro=\r\nblems in your mind, after all these years! What good is that knowledge whic=\r\nh spoils mental peace by creating doubts, fear=C2=A0and insecurity? One is =\r\nbetter off being ignorant than having such knowledge.\n=C2=A0\nIf you have an=\r\n idol that was worshipped to some extent by your ancestors for 56 years, it=\r\n would&#39;ve captured and stored some of the positive energy and positive thou=\r\nghts of those people. It would be a great blessing to have at your house.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIt should not be a problem if you cannot do much ritual worshp to th=\r\ne idol. Just doing simple things should suffice.\n=C2=A0\nWhenever you see th=\r\ne idol, imagine that there is Ganesha in it for real. Love the Ganesa who i=\r\ns in that idol. Bow to him now and then, when you get a chance. Show some f=\r\nruit or raisins or something to the idol now and then, when you get a chanc=\r\ne, and imagine that Ganesa tasted them. Every few months, clean the idol in=\r\n water and wipe it (to keep it clean).\n=C2=A0\nThe key is not how detailed y=\r\nour rituals are and whether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or more services in=\r\n your ritual. The key is how strongly you imagine a real deity in that idol=\r\n and how deeply you love that real deity that you visualize in the idol. Ri=\r\ntuals are only meant to facilitate such a visualization and increase such a=\r\n love. They are neither necessary nor sufficient for establishing a relatio=\r\nnship with a deity (which is, after all, the purpose of keeping an idol)!\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nHow does a metallic (or stone or whatever) o=\r\nbject become divine?\n=C2=A0\nOf course, each object and each atom of this un=\r\niverse is filled, in essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. But,=\r\n that would apply to the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol as=\r\n being more divine than the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-perva=\r\nding non-dual god here. We are talking about a deity within the field of du=\r\nality here. That deity is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. But=\r\n, how does the deity get into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in it =\r\nsimply because of its shape? Of course not!\n=C2=A0\nAll lokas and all devata=\r\ns are present within you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your though=\r\nt, you concentrate a part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or =\r\nany object). When a priest with a good level of purity and good ability to =\r\nvisualize (which comes from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana pr=\r\natishthaa in an idol, his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa =\r\nmantra as an instrument and a deity&#39;s essence enters the idol.\n=C2=A0\nEven =\r\nif you do not do a praana pratishthaa formally, deity&#39;s essence will slowly=\r\n be established in the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is =\r\nall about the power of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed=\r\n down by a dense and heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasana=\r\nas work faster, but even thoughts of an impure=C2=A0mind that is weighed do=\r\nwn by a dense and heavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will =\r\nalso work, albeit=C2=A0slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qual=\r\nities in an idol over a long time, essence=C2=A0of such a deity will invari=\r\nably be established in the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a meta=\r\nllic object.\n=C2=A0\nIf you imagine a deity who is angry with you for not ta=\r\nking good care of him, you will slowly create such a form in that idol. Ple=\r\nase stop this negativity. Imagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy=C2=A0and saa=\r\nttwika form with whom you can fall in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms=\r\n your mind when you see the idol (instead of thoughts of fear and deity&#39;s a=\r\nnger), it will indeed create such a presence in the idol and do you good.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThere are several *well-meaning* people out =\r\nthere with half-baked understanding that is not based on any direct experie=\r\nnce, who go around scaring people in several matters relating to god, relig=\r\nion and spirituality. But god is not to be feared.\n=C2=A0\nLove god. Do not =\r\nfear god. When your father or mother shout at you or punish you, it=C2=A0is=\r\n for a good reason and it will eventually be for your good. They are not re=\r\nally angry at you and they actually love you. Similarly, when god punishes =\r\nyou or gives bad results, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be=\r\n for your good. Do not fear god even when god gives you bad results. Always=\r\n *love* god and love god very deeply. More deeply than you love your parent=\r\ns, spouse, children etc. That is a simple principle for sureshot=C2=A0spiri=\r\ntual progress.\n=C2=A0\nGood luck with your Ganesha idol no matter what you d=\r\necide to do with it!\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.com=\r\ncast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=C2=A0\n----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Ram R&quot; &lt;mantra2379@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 02, 2009 1:22 PM\nSub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Right-sided Trunk Shri Ganesha Idol\n=C2=A0\n&gt; OM Namo B=\r\nhagvate Venkateshaya\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; This ia my first posting in this f=\r\norum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am writing in as am in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha i=\r\ndol which we found during puja in our home. This idol has its trunk to the =\r\nright side and has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I recen=\r\ntly came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the ri=\r\nght is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and we=\r\n have honestly not being doing this all these years. It was infact purchase=\r\nd by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it si=\r\nnce then. \n&gt; \n&gt; I feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which wou=\r\nld worship it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are f=\r\neeling hesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could ha=\r\nve\n advice as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about =\r\ndoing the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum =\r\nfor such a query.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Ramesh M\n&gt; Bangalore \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    =\r\n  Love Cricket?
