They need a lot more iterations though since I =\r\ndon&#39;t seem to grasp everything that they offer. Anyway, some of the questio=\r\nns that I have at this point are as follows.\n\n1. While the stories in these=\r\n books are quite interesting, how many of us in the group truly believe tha=\r\nt these are real incidents that have actually happened? It is easy to rejec=\r\nt them as a figment of imagination by Robert Svobodha. Or is it that these =\r\nstories are supposed have some inner/esoteric meaning and should not be tak=\r\nen literally as real incidents?\n\n2. While there is a wealth of information =\r\nin the second book, and co-incides a lot with Bhagavatham, there are quite =\r\na few places that left me quite confused too. Maybe with the help of others=\r\n from the group, I hope to get a better perspective. For instance, on the c=\r\nhapter on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vimalananda says the real Gayatri M=\r\nantra is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no one can really pr=\r\nonounce a vedic mantra perfectly in these times owing to the influence of K=\r\nali. At the same time he goes on narrating how to practise a mantra by doin=\r\ng japam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so that siddhi happens! How to reco=\r\nncile these two?  To be more specific, I have tried in the past a puraschar=\r\nana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred thousand times and was successf=\r\nul in finishing the ritual part (and I intend to do a lot more with a lot m=\r\nore discipline), but with the real Gayatri Mantra being hidden and not in o=\r\nur knowledge, is any there any use in continuing in this path?  \n\n3. Since =\r\nperfect pronounciation is impossible, he recommends that mantra sadhana sho=\r\nuld be done mentally, with not even tongue moving. I find this very difficu=\r\nlt to practise. At least for me, mind wanders in a crazy fashion if Mantra =\r\nsadhana is practised silently. In fact, it wanders so much that I start wit=\r\nh Ganapati mantra and somewhere along in the middle of japa, I realize that=\r\n my mind is elsewhere and try to come back to the japam. What is shocking t=\r\no me is that at that time my mind is constantly repeating Savitru Gayatri M=\r\nantra and not the intended Ganapati mantra. And the rosary keeps moving reg=\r\nardless, so the counts are lost.........\n\n4. He warns that without proper p=\r\nronounciation and/or disciplines, bad things will happen, like the example =\r\nof Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of breaking his celibacy! This kin=\r\nd of examples could potentially scare many people from taking to any sadhan=\r\na at all, in the lack of a proper Guru! And for a proper guru, one must kee=\r\np doing sadhana.... how?\n\nNagraj\n\n\n\n\n"}}
