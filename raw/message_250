He\nread the Bible, the Quran,=\r\n ancient Buddhist texts. Finally, he read\nthe Bhagavad Gita, a short book t=\r\nhat is one of the most revered of\nHindu scriptures.\n\n&quot;I felt I&#39;d found what=\r\n I was looking for,&quot; he said.\n\nThe Gita tells the story of Arjuna, a warrio=\r\nr in India, who is caught\nup in a battle between members of his own family.=\r\n In a crisis of\nconscience, he turns to Krishna, an incarnation of God, for=\r\n advice.\nKrishna gives Arjuna instruction and answers his questions, provid=\r\ning\na clear and logical explanation of the three paths of yoga, or union\nwi=\r\nth God.\n\nThe three paths =97 karma yoga (action), gyana-yoga (knowledge) an=\r\nd\nbhakti-yoga (devotion) =97 form the basis for the practice of Hinduism.\nA=\r\ns a young boy discovering them for the first time, Morales felt that\nthey g=\r\nave the most understandable explanation of the human situation\nand human be=\r\nings&#39; relationship with God.\n\n&quot;I was searching for a truth that was univers=\r\nal, not just sectarian,&quot;\nhe said. &quot;I wasn&#39;t looking for faith; I was lookin=\r\ng for philosophy.\nIt had to be universally applicable.&quot;\n\nHe went on to stud=\r\ny more Hindu scriptures and soon discovered that\nthere are so many Hindu te=\r\nxts that probably no one person has read\nthem all.\n\n&quot;They were written over=\r\n many hundreds of years. They&#39;re older than\nthe Bible. They&#39;re considered t=\r\nhe oldest collection of writings known\nto humanity.&quot;\n\nAt age 14, he made hi=\r\ns first visit to a Hindu temple =97 in Queens,\nN.Y. The temple was filled w=\r\nith beautiful artwork and statues\nrepresenting many Hindu deities, each of =\r\nwhom is considered a\ndifferent expression of God.\n\n&quot;It was absolutely stunn=\r\ning; I was overwhelmed,&quot; Morales said. &quot;I\nfelt I was leaving the world behi=\r\nnd, entering a spiritual world. I\nfinally sat down in front of a statue of =\r\nKrishna, and in my own mind I\nsaid, `I&#39;m home. This will be my religion for=\r\n the rest of my life.&#39;&quot;\n\nMorales went on to study philosophy and theology, =\r\neventually receiving\na doctoral degree with an emphasis on Hinduism and Asi=\r\nan culture from\nthe University of Wisconsin in Madison. He made several tri=\r\nps to\nIndia, and in 1986, after living as a celibate monk for six years, he=\r\n\nwas initiated as a Hindu priest.\n\nBack in the United States, he became an =\r\nacharya, or teacher of\nHinduism, and adopted the Sanskrit name Sri Dharma P=\r\nravartaka Acharya.\nThe word &quot;dharma&quot; means natural law; his name literally =\r\nmeans &quot;one who\nsets the dharma in motion.&quot;\n\nMorales has become a widely rec=\r\nognized Hindu teacher, especially\nthrough his Web site, www.dharmacentral.c=\r\nom. He is president of the\nInternational Sanatana Dharma Society.\n\nLast fal=\r\nl, he became the resident acharya (spiritual teacher) at the\nHindu Temple o=\r\nf Nebraska in Omaha. He teaches several different\nclasses, including introd=\r\nuction to Hinduism, a study of the Bhagavad\nGita and a youth class. He give=\r\ns a spiritual talk prior to Sunday\nworship at the temple and also leads sat=\r\nsang (meditation and religious\ndiscourse) sessions weekly in Omaha, and onc=\r\ne each month in Lincoln.\n\nMost of his students are people of Indian backgro=\r\nund who want to learn\nmore about their religion. But a growing number are p=\r\neople who come\nfrom other religious traditions who want to learn about Hind=\r\nuism. A\nfew of those have decided, like Morales did, to become Hindus thems=\r\nelves.\n\n&quot;Hinduism does not look for converts,&quot; Morales said. &quot;But we do lik=\r\ne\nto teach. Anyone is welcome to come and learn.&quot;\n\nHeather Mortensen is one=\r\n of his students who considers herself a\nconvert to Hinduism. She grew up i=\r\nn an evangelical Christian family,\nbut said she had many doubts about the G=\r\nod of the Bible, who often is\ndepicted as angry and judgmental. She went to=\r\n www.beliefnet.com to\nlearn about other religions. &quot;I was super impressed w=\r\nith the Hindu\nquotes,&quot; she said.\n\nThat led her to read the Bhagavad Gita an=\r\nd felt it answered her\nquestions about God and human destiny. &quot;I was in bli=\r\nss the entire day\nwhile I was reading it.&quot;\n\nMortensen said she found the Hi=\r\nndu concept of reincarnation most\nappealing, because it gives people a chan=\r\nce to keep striving, through\nsuccessive lives, to learn and grow closer to =\r\nGod.\n\nShe began studying with Morales in Wisconsin, and when he came to\nNeb=\r\nraska last fall, she moved to Omaha to continue taking classes from\nhim. Mo=\r\nrtensen goes to the Hindu Temple regularly to meditate and\nparticipates in =\r\nSunday services there with the Hindu community.\n\nThe temple serves about 1,=\r\n000 families =97 predominantly immigrants from\nIndia and their children =97=\r\n but there are a few converts, like\nMortensen, who regularly attend service=\r\ns.\n\n&quot;I&#39;m getting to know them (the Indians),&quot; she said. &quot;They&#39;re usually\nsu=\r\nrprised at first =97 but I remind them I&#39;m Hindu by telling them my\nHindu n=\r\name.&quot; Mortensen took the Sanskrit name Tulasi in a ritual in\nwhich she vowe=\r\nd to follow Hindu teachings and practices.\n\nOn May 29, Morales will lead a =\r\nritual in Council Bluffs for 20 or more\npeople who are becoming Hindus. He =\r\nestimates that about 1.5 million\nAmericans nationwide have converted to Hin=\r\nduism.\n\nStephanie Guilfoyle, another of Morales&#39; students who lives in Omah=\r\na,\nwas raised Lutheran and converted to Catholicism when she got married,\nb=\r\nut about 10 years ago began studying different forms of Buddhism.\nThat even=\r\ntually led her to Hinduism, since the Buddha was himself a\npracticing Hindu=\r\n.\n\n&quot;I was searching for the truth =97 I was searching for the root of all\nt=\r\nhe traditions I had studied,&quot; she said. &quot;When I read the Bhagavad\nGita, I f=\r\nelt, `This is what all the other religions are saying, but\nit&#39;s in the pure=\r\nst form, the most undiluted.&#39;&quot;\n\nIn the Gita, Krishna teaches Arjuna about t=\r\nhe nature of the soul and\nabout the difference between eternal reality and =\r\nthe changing world of\nsensory experience. The ultimate destiny of all peopl=\r\ne, Krishna says,\nis union with God.\n\nShe described Morales as a gifted teac=\r\nher who helped the meaning of\nthe text come alive.\n\nJohn Granger, who grew =\r\nup in a Catholic family and attended a Jesuit\nhigh school, became an agnost=\r\nic at age 17 and didn&#39;t become a believer\nagain until he discovered Hinduis=\r\nm at age 44.\n\n&quot;Hinduism seems to fit my spiritual path, but it was a path I=\r\n was on\nanyway,&quot; he said.\n\nGranger enjoys the richness of the Hindu traditi=\r\non, which is reflected\nin the many different deities represented in the Oma=\r\nha temple. The\ntemple has 12 separate sanctums, or altars, each with one or=\r\n more\nstatues representing different incarnations of God. People from\nvario=\r\nus parts of India have certain deities that they honor, so Hindus\nof all ba=\r\nckgrounds feel comfortable in the Omaha temple.\n\nRam Bishu, a University of=\r\n Nebraska-Lincoln engineering professor and\nchairman of the temple&#39;s religi=\r\nous committee, said the temple was\ncreated primarily as a center of worship=\r\n and teaching for people from\nIndia who live in Nebraska and Iowa. But, he =\r\nadded, &quot;We&#39;re totally\ncomfortable&quot; with people of other religious backgroun=\r\nds visiting or\nparticipating in prayers and rituals.\n\n&quot;Hinduism is not a pr=\r\noselytizing religion,&quot; he said. &quot;We have no\nformal way of converting someon=\r\ne to Hinduism. It&#39;s a very\nindividualistic religion.&quot;\n\nBishu noted that man=\r\ny Americans practice yoga as an exercise\ntechnique, or a way of calming the=\r\nir mind, but most are not aware of\nthe spiritual side of yoga as taught at =\r\nthe temple. Some people may go\nto the temple because they&#39;re studying yoga =\r\nand want to learn more\nabout its origins and deeper meaning, he said.\n\nMany=\r\n church groups visit the temple seeking to learn about Hinduism\nand promote=\r\n inter-religious understanding.\n\n&quot;Hinduism is a religion of tolerance,&quot; Mor=\r\nales said. His goal as a\nteacher, he said, is not to preach but to explain =\r\nthe religion and\noffer &quot;a supportive environment&quot; for individual spiritual =\r\ngrowth.\n\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\n\n\n\n\n"}}
