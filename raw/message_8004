Removal of outer layer. In extreme cases of old age people, it may be re=\r\nquired. This is not the main cause of blindness as depicted by statistics.=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Blindness by birth is mostly caused by damage to retina and opt=\r\nic nerve, which cannot be treated now.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; In Modern Science there is n=\r\no proof for the claim that eye donation gives Punya. But Dharmic texts are =\r\nthe deciders of Paapa & Punya. According to that Anga or Angamsha Daana is =\r\nnot at all accepted. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please remove the name donation =3D daana. It=\r\n is just a business (Kraya-Vikraya). Its a lobby is most parts of the world=\r\n. If one tries to transplant any organ to any other by surgeries, the body =\r\nof acceptor never accept that and it will be in the process of rejecting th=\r\ne same!! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Does any part of modern science has any strong explanatio=\r\nn for the cause of blindness by birth? Why a particular person &#39;X&#39; has to l=\r\noose his/her eye sight? Why only the person &#39;Y&#39; got Kidney failure? What&#39;s =\r\nthe reason behind it? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Only Karma Siddantha can answer all these qu=\r\nestions.

These are the statistics below for eye donations done successfully =\r\nyearly in India.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am quoting directly from Indian express.\n&gt; \n&gt; http:=\r\n//www.indianexpress.com/news/a-lot-needs-to-be-done-to-create-awareness-on-=\r\neye-donation/551681/0\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. 1/3rd of the world&#39;s blind population is in I=\r\nndia and most of them go blind due to preventable cataract formation and ot=\r\nher issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.Sankara Netrayala as mentioned in the article is an accl=\r\naimed organization which on a average conducts on a average 1000 eye transp=\r\nlantation surgeries.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1000!!!! lives impacted with one organization...i=\r\ns that an small number. Still millions wait for an surgery to gain eyesight=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt; By the way ..Sankara Netrayala is associated with the Kanchi peetha=\r\nm and was inspired by the clarion call of Sri Jayendra Saraswathi in the 19=\r\n70&#39;s. Also the Kanchi peetham has an annex centre associated with Sankara N=\r\netralaya. \n&gt; \n&gt; Kanchi peetham also works with the Sankara eye foundation\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankara_Nethralaya\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.sankara=\r\nnethralaya.org/patient-care-jkcn.html\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody is advocating not followi=\r\nng the samskaras after death.What is preventing the following of the samska=\r\nra for rest of the corpse.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which is an greater punya , using an part o=\r\nf the body after the soul has left to bring alive the life of another perso=\r\nn or blindly sticking to dogma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla RamKishore\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Hemanth Kumar G &lt;vijnasu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I wrote, Indradi devatas would be summoned on Brahma Hatyaif they had kill=\r\ned Dadichi and taken away the bones. Your point of discussion about Ashwini=\r\n Kumaras and Haya Shira stories is prior to this incident.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nasic rule of Medical science says that one body cannot accept the parts of =\r\nanother one. There are lot of medical practitioners who had understood & ex=\r\nperienced this fact. Even though you operate and stitch a Kidney or heart, =\r\nthe body will always be resisting to the external organ. Donated blood will=\r\n be rejected in terms of Urine, swet and other excretions within some days.=\r\n Lot of foreign civilizations knew this fact and they never take other body=\r\n remains. So you can see in http://www.noblood.org/medical-conditions-treat=\r\nments/6478-open-heart-surgery-without-blood-can-done-routinely\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Eve=\r\nry day this modern science gives new statements. First they say that extern=\r\nal blood supply is mandatory in case of blood loss. Then they only warn abo=\r\nut the un healthy, contamination, uselessness of stored blood after some ho=\r\nurs etc., Science doesn&#39;t believes in Paapa, Punya. Then why they used the =\r\nconcept of &quot;Daana&quot; in the name of blood donation and advertised it as a wor=\r\nk that gives Punya! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Only in certain processes like in reprod=\r\nuction, there will be mixture of 2 different materials, but body nourishes =\r\nit as a separate wing and reproduces offspring. Eye donation is another cor=\r\nruption. Cornea which is the outer lens of the Eye can only be made fit to =\r\na person having Cornea damage. That too the sizes should match. Its not tru=\r\ne that all the eyes which has been donated has been used and a blind got th=\r\ne sight. There are very rare cases who get blindness due to Cornea damage. =\r\nJust make a trip around Blind schools & eye banks to understand the actual =\r\nstatistics of blind getting vision!! Cornea transplantation is just like fi=\r\nxing eye lens that we use nowadays. But in the future there may be syntho-o=\r\nrganic material that replaces human donated cornea. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Remember=\r\n that any of your organ is not useful if it is given to others. Either it w=\r\nill be thrown out after some time by storing banks or its rejected by body =\r\nafter some time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Its foreign missionaries who familiarized th=\r\nis kind of transfusions.=C2=A0 Their science is just a baby stepping now. B=\r\nut our seers had much better vision behind every word & inventions.=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Animals also die, decay & perish. Its soul goes according to its ka=\r\nrma. But we are men, not pashu. My suggestion is for the people who believe=\r\n and practice Sanatana Bhatiya Dharma and its rituals. Why body is made int=\r\no ashes including a detailed proceducre of Shava Samskara with medicinal pl=\r\nants, fire and mantras? Why uttara shodasha karma is done such that the wor=\r\nldly desires of atma is seperated, soul is given a divya sharira, sent to p=\r\nitru lokha and only the daivika part of atma is kept for the welfare of the=\r\n family and worshipped every yver in terms of Shradda Prakriya? In each and=\r\n every part of these rituals there will be a separation of bodily elements =\r\nand -ve energies attached to soul such that it shouldn&#39;t contact the living=\r\n humans or other creatures. Till what level we do this? We wont leave ash a=\r\nlso. It will be made floated it some of Punya Teertas like Ganga, Yamuna, G=\r\nodavari etc., There is in depth Genetic level explanation hidden in all\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  these practices.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
