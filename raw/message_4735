This =\r\nis verily the boat which can rescue the mortals\nstruggling hard, sinking an=\r\nd rising, in the sorrowful ocean of samsara of\nendless cycles of births and=\r\n deaths and take them by the direct path to the\nshore of liberation. Let al=\r\nl earnest seekers after Truth, instead of groping\nin the dark, bewildered, =\r\nand losing their way, adopt the help of this\nstraight path and reach the su=\r\npreme state to bliss and peace.\n\nInvocation\n\nMeditate in the Heart upon Lor=\r\nd Ganesa =E2=80=94 the silent,non-dual, universal\nwitness =E2=80=94 who is =\r\nthe nectar of divine bliss and is full of grace, shining as\nthe bountiful f=\r\nlowering of aspirants following the path of spiritual wisdom\nrevealed in De=\r\nvikalottara, which was expounded by Lord Ishwara into the ears\nof Goddess I=\r\nshwari.\n\nNote: In the original Tamil verse, the word =E2=80=98kari=E2=80=99=\r\n means =E2=80=98elephant=E2=80=99, which\ndenotes Lord Ganesa as per traditi=\r\non, but the word =E2=80=98kari=E2=80=99 also means\n=E2=80=98witness=E2=80=\r\n=99, which denotes the Universal Self, which is in line with Advaitic\nexper=\r\nience.\n\nThe Text\n\nDevi :\n\n1. O Lord of all celestial beings! I yearn to kno=\r\nw that path of supreme\nwisdom and the code of conduct by adopting which one=\r\n can get liberation, so\nthat all humanity may attain salvation. I request y=\r\nou to enlighten me on\nthem, out of your grace.\n\nIshwara :\n\n2. O Queen among=\r\n women! So that everyone may attain knowledge, I shall\nclearly explain to y=\r\nou today the highest knowledge and the discipline to be\nfollowed by which\nd=\r\niscerning seekers will attain liberation, which is free from any blemish\nan=\r\nd is difficult to describe.\n\n3. O Lady with fair countenance! Understand th=\r\nat one who is not able to\nrealise the Truth in his Heart by this knowledge =\r\nof spiritual wisdom known\nas Kala Jnana, can\nnever attain it even by studyi=\r\nng countless crores of sastras (scriptures)\nspread out like the sky.\n\n4. Th=\r\nerefore cast aside all fears (on following this path) and shed all\ndoubts. =\r\nGiving up attachment or desire for anything, be ardent in seeking\nthe ultim=\r\nate knowledge with wholehearted devotion and with a clear mind\n(without any=\r\n trace of confusion).\n\n5. Claiming nothing as =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, fille=\r\nd with compassion,giving protection to\nall living beings so that no creatur=\r\ne fears you, yearning for liberation,\nabsorbed in yoga (union of jiva and P=\r\nara, fusion of individual self with the\nuniversal Self),study this work Dev=\r\nikalottara and follow wholeheartedly and\nsteadfastly the single path shown =\r\ntherein.\n\n6-7. If one is to describe the person who can bring under control=\r\n his mind,\nwhich is restless and turbulent like a whirlwind, and maintain i=\r\nt in a\ntranquil state, he is verily Brahma (the God that does the creation)=\r\n, Siva\n(the saviour who shows the path to salvation) and Vishnu (the sustai=\r\nner of\nthe world); he is Indra, King of the devas, and Lord Subrahmanya (ch=\r\nief\ncommander of all the celestial forces);he is Brihaspati, the guru of al=\r\nl\ndevas; he is a supreme yogi, and one who has achieved the result of\nperfo=\r\nrming all austerities; he is a great scholar (who has mastered all the\nVeda=\r\ns and sastras), and an outstanding man; he is one who has achieved the\ntrue=\r\n spiritual goal.\n\n8-9. The means by which this mind, which is restless and =\r\nmoves about quicker\nthan the wind, can be brought under control, is indeed =\r\nthe means to obtain\nliberation; it indeed is what is good for those who see=\r\nk the permanent\nReality; it itself is Pure Consciousness and the state of f=\r\nirmness;\nmoreover, it alone is the righteous duty to be followed by discern=\r\ning\naspirants; it alone is the pilgrimage to holy waters;\nit alone is chari=\r\nty; it alone is austerities. Know that there is no doubt\nabout this.\n\n10. W=\r\nhen the mind moves even a little, that is samsara (worldly bondage);\nwhen t=\r\nhe mind abides firmly and motionlessly (in the state of Self), that is\nmukt=\r\ni (liberation).This is certain. Therefore know that the wise man must\nhold =\r\nhis mind firm by supreme Self-awareness.\n\n11. The happiness attained in thi=\r\ns aloneness is the highest,boundless bliss.\nWhich learned persons will not =\r\nrevel in that Supreme Reality, in which there\nis absolutely no action? Tell=\r\n me.\n\n12. Being rid of the worldly knowledge, the great hero who has acquir=\r\ned pure\nwisdom, in which there are no sense objects, and which is all perva=\r\nding and\nwithout any form,\nwill attain immutable moksha without fail, even =\r\nthough he may have no desire\nto attain liberation.\n\n13. The consciousness (=\r\nchaitanya) associated with the aspect =E2=80=98am=E2=80=99 is called\nSakti.=\r\n The universe shines by its light.The entire creation is Sakti=E2=80=99s\nsa=\r\nnkalpa (thought). The state (of mind) which is completely devoid of all\natt=\r\nachment is the pure (wisdom) to be attained.\n\n14. The void which is the inf=\r\ninite and all-encompassing one whole without a\nsecond, which is just the ef=\r\nfulgence of pure wisdom, which is completely\ndevoid of visible\nphenomena an=\r\nd which consists of the aspect =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is the seed which fructi=\r\nfies\nas liberation, bestowing salvation by enabling one to unite with the\nS=\r\nupreme.\n\n15. Instead of following this direct path, do not ever contemplate=\r\n even in\nthe least upon chakras (located in six adharas, centres in the bod=\r\ny), nadis\n(subtle nerves that produce the ten divine sounds such as Pranava=\r\n), the\ndeities associated with the lotus seats (in the adhara chakras, begi=\r\nnning\nwith Vinayaka), the mantraksharas (potent sound syllables for the wor=\r\nship of\nthese deities) and the diverse mandala murtis (the\nGod-aspects, sta=\r\nrting from those controlling the sun, Surya Mandala, the\nmoon, Chandra Mand=\r\nala, and fire, Agni mandala).\n\nNote: Some aspirants indulge in severe auste=\r\nrities and arduous practices,\nmastering several techniques and incidentally=\r\n attaining extraordinary\nsupernatural powers as\nwell. All these are to be s=\r\nhunned as they do not lead to ultimate peace and\njoy. On the other hand, th=\r\ne path of Kala Jnana described here is a direct\npath to mukti.\n\n16. Those w=\r\nho seek everlasting liberation need not endeavour to practise\nrepetition an=\r\nd countless verse mantras (repeating potent scriptural words or\ntexts to ga=\r\nin various ends), and methods of yoga such as breath-control\n(pranayama), b=\r\nreath retention (kumbhaka) and concentration.\n\n17. There is no room for per=\r\nforming puja (worship of deities), namaskaram\n(paying homage like prostrati=\r\non), japa (incantation), dhyana (contemplation)\nand so on. Hear from me tha=\r\nt the highest truth acclaimed in the Vedas can be\nknown only through jnana;=\r\n hence, there is absolutely no need to know\nanything outside of oneself.\n\n1=\r\n8. For those whose minds are constantly expanding, clinging to external\nobj=\r\nects, factors will always arise causing increasing bondage. If the\noutward-=\r\nwandering mind is turned inwards to stay in its natural state, know\nthat on=\r\ne will not undergo any suffering in the world.\n\n19. Unite with that one tot=\r\nality, which is all-pervasive,which has no inside\nor outside, which is bere=\r\nft of all (concept of) directions such as above,\nbelow and in between, whic=\r\nh assumes all the forms in creation and yet is\nitself formless,which can be=\r\n known only by itself, and which is\nself-luminous.\n\n20. People perform thei=\r\nr actions having their own aims in mind, and they\naccordingly reap the cons=\r\nequences of their actions by attaining those aims.\nTherefore do not engage =\r\nin such actions which are not free from flaws\n(leading to bondage). Turn th=\r\ne attention completely away from external\nobjects and concentrate only upon=\r\n that (the Self) which cannot be seen.\n\n21. In our natural state, actions, =\r\ncause and result of such actions, and all\nthe various other theories propou=\r\nnded (in the scriptures) do not exist. In\nfact, even the diverse world does=\r\n not exist. As such even the worldly\nindividual who is attached\nto (the var=\r\nious attractions of) the world is also nonexistent.\n\n22. This entire univer=\r\nse is nothing but the niralamba (the reality which\nexists without any suppo=\r\nrt). Further, it shines being illumined by the\nniralamba. The yogi (with hi=\r\ns mind turned inward) merges with this whole one\nby making every object in =\r\nthis world one with it. Know this.\n\n23. If any person does not meditate on =\r\nthis great allpervading void, which\nis the space of consciousness (chidakas=\r\na), he will be a samsari (a worldly\nindividual) forever in bondage to world=\r\nly attachments, like the silkworm in\nits self made cocoon. Understand this.=\r\n\n\n24. All living beings, of whatever genus, undergo great misery over and o=\r\nver\nagain. Hear from me. In order to avert all this suffering and sorrow,\nm=\r\neditate on the great void constantly without any break.\n\n25. Good actions a=\r\nnd good conduct have been prescribed only to guide the\nseeker towards the p=\r\nath of acquiring knowledge. Therefore, giving up even\nsalamba yoga in which=\r\n an object (such as a mantra or a form of God) is\nmeditated upon in the min=\r\nd, stay steadfast in your real state (sahaja\nswarupa), where the outside wo=\r\nrld is not perceived.\n\nNote: Actions prescribed include worship of Siva in =\r\none=E2=80=99s mind as well as\noutside. The various ceremonies prescribed in=\r\n Agama Sastras for worshipping\nSiva in saguna form in a temple are covered =\r\nin good conduct.\n\n26. One who can destroy all the tattvas (principles) from=\r\n patalaloka (the\nnethermost world) to Sakti (one of the highest tattvas), w=\r\nhich are all\ninterdependent, by the arrow of sunyabhava is a man of great v=\r\nalour. He has\nattained supreme wisdom which is beyond matter.\n\nNote: ln sun=\r\nyabhava the individual is only aware of his conscious being\nwhile everythin=\r\ng else is like a void (sunya) =E2=80=94 without existence.\n\n27. The mind, h=\r\nankering after things of the world, is more restless than a\nmonkey. If one =\r\ncontrols it from wandering after external things and holds it\nin the void o=\r\nf non-matter one will attain liberation directly.\n\n28. The full Consciousne=\r\nss (purna chit) which is not other than the true\nimport of the word =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99, being non-different in all the principles (tattvas)\nand bein=\r\ng other than the sense =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, is the all-pervadin=\r\ng\nReality.\n\n29. This complete wholeness pervades inside and outside all cre=\r\nations like\nether, merging with them, and is itself formless. Dear, those w=\r\nho are\nsubmerged in this supreme bliss become that supreme bliss themselves=\r\n. See,\nhow wonderful!\n\n30. The expanding mind will attain peace, becoming s=\r\ntill of its own accord,\nif it is deprived of something to hold on,just as f=\r\nire gets extinguished\ngradually if not fed with fuel.\n\n31. You must realise=\r\n that the four states of infatuation,delusion, swoon\n(due to shock) and dre=\r\naming, as also sleeping and waking, are all to be\ndispelled.\n\n32. If one me=\r\nditates that the one Consciousness (chit) is different from the\nprana (life=\r\n-force), which has subtly attached itself to this gross body,\nfrom the mind=\r\n, from the intellect and from the ego, one will become\nestablished in that =\r\nConsciousness.\n\n33. Due to sleep and due to thoughts the mind always loses =\r\nits sharpness,\nits foolishness increases, and it goes to ruin. Awakening th=\r\nis mind with\neffort, and without allowing it to wander, establish it in the=\r\n state of\nSelf. Persevere in this effort by fixing the mind again and again=\r\n in its\nnatural state.\n\n34. When once the mind becomes steady, it should no=\r\nt be disturbed in any\nway. There is no need to think even in the least of a=\r\nnything else,\nentertaining any doubts. Fixing the mind firmly in that state=\r\n (of\nSelf-awareness), keep it still.\n\n35. Make the mind, which always cling=\r\ns to some support (attaching itself to\nsense-objects), devoid of all such s=\r\nupports. Making the mind, which is\nrestless in clinging to external support=\r\ns, motionless, do not disturb that\ntranquillity even a little.\n\n36. Meditat=\r\ne on the peerless Self which pervades all the various forms, yet\nremains wi=\r\nthout any blemish (being unaffected by them), just as ether,\npervading all =\r\nthe creations made up of the five elements, remains unsullied\nat the time o=\r\nf\ntheir dissolution.\n\n37. When one adopts the practice (sadhana) by means o=\r\nf which one=E2=80=99s mind,\nwhich is restless like the wind, is made still =\r\nperpetually, then the purpose\nof taking birth as a human being is fulfilled=\r\n. That is also the mark of a\ntrue scholar.\n\n38. Do not practise meditation =\r\nby fixing the mind on the six adhara chakras,\nthe ones that are up or down =\r\nor in the middle, or anywhere else. Giving up\nall such meditations, make th=\r\ne mind always devoid of any support (either\ninside or outside).\n\n39. If the=\r\n mind falls asleep, awaken it. Then if it starts wandering, make\nit quiet. =\r\nIf you reach the state where there is neither sleep nor movement\nof mind, s=\r\ntay still in that, the natural (real) state.\n\n40. The state in which the mi=\r\nnd is bereft of any support to cling to, ever\nfaultless and pure, and devoi=\r\nd of worldly attachments, is the nature of\nliberation attained through know=\r\nledge. Keep this firmly in mind.\n\n41. Dispelling all attachments completely=\r\n, and fixing that mind in the Heart\nfirmly, persist in your practice always=\r\n in order to strengthen the\nawareness, which then shines forth with great e=\r\nffulgence and clarity.\n\n42. Know that whoever meditates on that supreme voi=\r\nd,and becomes established\nin it by virtue of constant practice,will definit=\r\nely attain the great state\nwhich is beyond birth and death.\n\n43. Gods and g=\r\noddesses, merits, demerits and their fruits, which are\nlikewise anya (other=\r\n than oneself), objects of attachment and the knowledge\nof those objects =\r\n=E2=80=94 all these will lead one to bondage in mighty samsara.\n\n44. All ob=\r\njects of attachments are said to be pairs of opposites (happiness\nand miser=\r\ny, good and bad, profit and loss, victory and defeat, and so on).\nWhen one =\r\nrises above those pairs of opposites, one realises the Supreme.\nSuch a yogi=\r\n is a jivanmukta, liberated from bondage. On discarding the body,\nhe become=\r\ns a videhamukta.\n\n\n...

The means by which this mind, which is restless and moves about=\r\n quicker than the wind, can be brought under control, is indeed the means t=\r\no obtain liberation; it indeed is what is good for those who seek the perma=\r\nnent Reality; it itself is Pure Consciousness and the state of firmness; mo=\r\nreover, it alone is the righteous duty to be followed by discerning aspiran=\r\nts; it alone is the pilgrimage to holy waters;&lt;br&gt;\n\nit alone is charity; it=\r\n alone is austerities. Know that there is no doubt about this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;10. When the mind moves even a little, that is =\r\nsamsara (worldly bondage); when the mind abides firmly and motionlessly (in=\r\n the state of Self), that is mukti (liberation).&lt;/span&gt;This is certain. The=\r\nrefore know that the wise man must hold his mind firm by supreme Self-aware=\r\nness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;11. The happiness attained in this aloneness is the highest,=\r\nboundless bliss. Which learned persons will not revel in that Supreme Reali=\r\nty, in which there is absolutely no action? Tell me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12. Being rid o=\r\nf the worldly knowledge, the great hero who has acquired pure wisdom, in wh=\r\nich there are no sense objects, and which is all pervading and without any =\r\nform,&lt;br&gt;\n\nwill attain immutable moksha without fail, even though he may ha=\r\nve no desire to attain liberation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;13. The consciousness (chaitanya)=\r\n associated with the aspect =E2=80=98am=E2=80=99 is called Sakti. The unive=\r\nrse shines by its light.The entire creation is Sakti=E2=80=99s sankalpa (th=\r\nought).=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The state (of mind) which is =\r\ncompletely devoid of all attachment is the pure (wisdom) to be attained.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;14. The void which is the infinite and all-encompassing one w=\r\nhole without a second, which is just the effulgence of pure wisdom, which i=\r\ns completely devoid of visible&lt;br&gt;phenomena and which consists of the aspec=\r\nt =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is the seed which fructifies as liberation, bestowing=\r\n salvation by enabling one to unite with the Supreme.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;15. Instead =\r\nof following this direct path, do not ever contemplate even in the least up=\r\non chakras (located in six adharas, centres in the body), nadis (subtle ner=\r\nves that produce the ten divine sounds such as Pranava), the deities associ=\r\nated with the lotus seats (in the adhara chakras, beginning with Vinayaka),=\r\n the mantraksharas (potent sound syllables for the worship of these deities=\r\n) and the diverse mandala murtis (the&lt;br&gt;\n\nGod-aspects, starting from those=\r\n controlling the sun, Surya Mandala, the moon, Chandra Mandala, and fire, A=\r\ngni mandala).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Note: Some aspirants indulge in severe austerities and=\r\n arduous practices, mastering several techniques and incidentally attaining=\r\n extraordinary supernatural powers as&lt;br&gt;\n\nwell. All these are to be shunne=\r\nd as they do not lead to ultimate peace and joy. On the other hand, the pat=\r\nh of Kala Jnana described here is a direct path to mukti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;16. Those who seek everlasting liberation need not e=\r\nndeavour to practise repetition and countless verse mantras (repeating pote=\r\nnt scriptural words or texts to gain various ends), and methods of yoga suc=\r\nh as breath-control (pranayama), breath retention (kumbhaka) and concentrat=\r\nion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;17. There is no room for performing puja (worship of d=\r\neities), namaskaram (paying homage like prostration), japa (incantation), d=\r\nhyana (contemplation) and so on. Hear from me that the highest truth acclai=\r\nmed in the Vedas can be known only through jnana; hence, there is absolutel=\r\ny no need to know anything outside of oneself.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold&quot;&gt;18. For those whose minds are constantly expanding, clinging =\r\nto external objects, factors will always arise causing increasing bondage. =\r\nIf the outward-wandering mind is turned inwards to stay in its natural stat=\r\ne, know that one will not undergo any suffering in the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;19. Unite with that one totality, which is all-pervasive,which has no in=\r\nside or outside, which is bereft of all (concept of) directions such as abo=\r\nve, below and in between, which assumes all the forms in creation and yet i=\r\ns itself formless,which can be known only by itself, and which is self-lumi=\r\nnous.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;20. People perform their ac=\r\ntions having their own aims in mind, and they accordingly reap the conseque=\r\nnces of their actions by attaining those aims. Therefore do not engage in s=\r\nuch actions which are not free from flaws (leading to bondage). Turn the at=\r\ntention completely away from external objects and concentrate only upon tha=\r\nt (the Self) which cannot be seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;21. In our natural state=\r\n, actions, cause and result of such actions, and all the various other theo=\r\nries propounded (in the scriptures) do not exist. In fact, even the diverse=\r\n world does not exist. As such even the worldly individual who is attached&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\nto (the various attractions of) the world is also nonexistent.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n22. This entire universe is nothing but the niralamba (the reality which ex=\r\nists without any support). Further, it shines being illumined by the nirala=\r\nmba. The yogi (with his mind turned inward) merges with this whole one by m=\r\naking every object in this world one with it. Know this.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;23. If any person does not meditate on this great a=\r\nllpervading void, which is the space of consciousness (chidakasa), he will =\r\nbe a samsari (a worldly individual) forever in bondage to worldly attachmen=\r\nts, like the silkworm in its self made cocoon. Understand this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;24. All living beings, of whatever genus, undergo great misery over an=\r\nd over again. Hear from me. In order to avert all this suffering and sorrow=\r\n, meditate on the great void constantly without any break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;25. Good =\r\nactions and good conduct have been prescribed only to guide the seeker towa=\r\nrds the path of acquiring knowledge. Therefore, giving up even salamba yoga=\r\n in which an object (such as a mantra or a form of God) is meditated upon i=\r\nn the mind, stay steadfast in your real state (sahaja swarupa), where the o=\r\nutside world is not perceived.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Note: Actions prescribed include wo=\r\nrship of Siva in one=E2=80=99s mind as well as outside. The various ceremon=\r\nies prescribed in Agama Sastras for worshipping Siva in saguna form in a te=\r\nmple are covered in good conduct.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n26. One who can destroy all the =\r\ntattvas (principles) from patalaloka (the nethermost world) to Sakti (one o=\r\nf the highest tattvas), which are all interdependent, by the arrow of sunya=\r\nbhava is a man of great valour. He has attained supreme wisdom which is bey=\r\nond matter.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Note: ln sunyabhava the individual is only aware of hi=\r\ns conscious being while everything else is like a void (sunya) =E2=80=94 wi=\r\nthout existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;27. The mind, hank=\r\nering after things of the world, is more restless than a monkey. If one con=\r\ntrols it from wandering after external things and holds it in the void of n=\r\non-matter one will attain liberation directly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;28. The full=\r\n Consciousness (purna chit) which is not other than the true import of the =\r\nword =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, being non-different in all the principles (tattva=\r\ns) and being other than the sense =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, is the a=\r\nll-pervading Reality.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;29. This complete wholeness pervades inside =\r\nand outside all creations like ether, merging with them, and is itself form=\r\nless. Dear, those who are submerged in this supreme bliss become that supre=\r\nme bliss themselves. See, how wonderful!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;30. The expanding mind will attain peace, becoming still of its own=\r\n accord, if it is deprived of something to hold on,just as fire gets exting=\r\nuished gradually if not fed with fuel.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;31. You must realise=\r\n that the four states of infatuation,delusion, swoon (due to shock) and dre=\r\naming, as also sleeping and waking, are all to be dispelled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;32. If =\r\none meditates that the one Consciousness (chit) is different from the prana=\r\n (life-force), which has subtly attached itself to this gross body, from th=\r\ne mind, from the intellect and from the ego, one will become established in=\r\n that Consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;33. Due to s=\r\nleep and due to thoughts the mind always loses its sharpness, its foolishne=\r\nss increases, and it goes to ruin. Awakening this mind with effort, and wit=\r\nhout allowing it to wander, establish it in the state of Self. Persevere in=\r\n this effort by fixing the mind again and again in its natural state.&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;34. When once the mind becomes =\r\nsteady, it should not be disturbed in any way. There is no need to think ev=\r\nen in the least of anything else, entertaining any doubts. Fixing the mind =\r\nfirmly in that state (of Self-awareness), keep it still.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;35. Make the mind, which always clings to so=\r\nme support (attaching itself to sense-objects), devoid of all such supports=\r\n. Making the mind, which is restless in clinging to external supports, moti=\r\nonless, do not disturb that tranquillity even a little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;36.=\r\n Meditate on the peerless Self which pervades all the various forms, yet re=\r\nmains without any blemish (being unaffected by them), just as ether, pervad=\r\ning all the creations made up of the five elements, remains unsullied at th=\r\ne time of&lt;br&gt;\n\ntheir dissolution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;3=\r\n7. When one adopts the practice (sadhana) by means of which one=E2=80=99s m=\r\nind, which is restless like the wind, is made still perpetually, then the p=\r\nurpose of taking birth as a human being is fulfilled.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0That is a=\r\nlso the mark of a true scholar.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;38. Do not practise meditation by =\r\nfixing the mind on the six adhara chakras, the ones that are up or down or =\r\nin the middle, or anywhere else. Giving up all such meditations, make the m=\r\nind always devoid of any support (either inside or outside).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;39. If the mind falls asleep, awaken it. Then i=\r\nf it starts wandering, make it quiet. If you reach the state where there is=\r\n neither sleep nor movement of mind, stay still in that, the natural (real)=\r\n state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;40. The state in which the mind is bereft of any su=\r\npport to cling to, ever faultless and pure, and devoid of worldly attachmen=\r\nts, is the nature of liberation attained through knowledge. Keep this firml=\r\ny in mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n41. Dispelling all attachments completely, and fixing t=\r\nhat mind in the Heart firmly, persist in your practice always in order to s=\r\ntrengthen the awareness, which then shines forth with great effulgence and =\r\nclarity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n42. Know that whoever meditates on that supreme void,and =\r\nbecomes established in it by virtue of constant practice,will definitely at=\r\ntain the great state which is beyond birth and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;43. Gods and g=\r\noddesses, merits, demerits and their fruits, which are likewise anya (other=\r\n than oneself), objects of attachment and the knowledge of those objects =\r\n=E2=80=94 all these will lead one to bondage in mighty samsara.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;44. All objects of attachments are said to b=\r\ne pairs of opposites (happiness and misery, good and bad, profit and loss, =\r\nvictory and defeat, and so on). When one rises above those pairs of opposit=\r\nes, one realises the Supreme. Such a yogi is a jivanmukta, liberated from b=\r\nondage. On discarding the body, he becomes a videhamukta.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;...
