Its a Sangam of Many Rivers. The peop=\r\nle of the culture are so accommodative that Parasis stayed for centuries ke=\r\neping their identity and religious faith intact without facing any conversi=\r\non threats or any sort of pressure for *conversion*.\n\nHindu is the one who =\r\n*never thinks* even once to convert religious faith of the people who are b=\r\nelievers in other faiths. On the contrary, Hindu encourages the people from=\r\n other faiths to be in their own and love god rather then getting in to bus=\r\niness of conversion. Hindu does not form organised missions, use power of M=\r\noney or Sword for conversions.\nHindu does not hesitate, if asked, to go to =\r\nchurch and bow to Jesus because he believes deep within that Jesus is a Sai=\r\nnt, a true man of God. If a Muslim friend makes a request to a Hindu that T=\r\nhis is My Allah in this mosque. Would you come with me in mosque and bow do=\r\nwn to show your respect and love? Then Hindu would certainly do that becaus=\r\ne Hindu heart naturally believes in the famous message of Veda - &quot;Ekam Saty=\r\na Vipra Bahudha vadanti&quot;. Although he would not have read even one line of =\r\nVeda ever, this timeless message of Veda is ingrained in every pore of his/=\r\nher being!\n\nHindu does not need any strict Ritualistic initiation to become=\r\n Hindu. A Hindu believes in Sarve Bhavantu SukinaH. Hindu is a born Hindu! =\r\nHindu is the one who hardly feels pressure from society to go to temples or=\r\n pray God at specific schedules. Hindu has freedom to decide His/her ways t=\r\no pray God. There is no pressure from Hinduism. Hindu has true liberty and =\r\nthat is why Hindu can say that I do not believe in God and still leave happ=\r\nily and respectfully in Hindu Society.\nAbove all Hindu is symbolical of all=\r\n expansive heart!\n\nOops! I just became emotional and unburden probably a Hi=\r\nndu heart :)\n\nSorry for not able to answer your actual query and digressed =\r\nto something else.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; Glad th=\r\nat you liked this interview.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have not read any of Swamiji&#39;s work, (n=\r\not surprising given my level of \n&gt; ignorance!), but this is a gem of an int=\r\nerview.

At one end is this thought expressed=\r\n above and at the \n&gt; other end is this notion that to be a Hindu, you have =\r\nto believe in the Vedas \n&gt; (which, ironically, most people cannot read and =\r\nthose who can, cannot \n&gt; understand!)\n&gt; \n&gt; warm regards,\n&gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wed, February 23, 201=\r\n1 2:52:55 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Interview with Swami Chinmayanad=\r\na\n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; Namaste Chandra Prakash,\n&gt; Thank you!\n&gt; How true:\n&gt; [\n&gt; Yoga an=\r\nd bhog.
