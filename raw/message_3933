The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may=\r\n have all kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a =\r\nforce that can be used to change or move something karmically.\n\nSuppose you=\r\n see something or someone beautiful and the enemy of &quot;desire&quot; (one of shadr=\r\nipus - six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone =\r\nabuses you and the enemy of &quot;anger&quot; tries to attack your mind. How does you=\r\nr mind fight back?\n\nJust as you need energy to fight external enemies, your=\r\n mind needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, t=\r\nhe enemies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exer=\r\nts shakti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push =\r\non the mind is negated.\n\nWhen you eat, you get physical energy. When you ex=\r\nercise, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Sim=\r\nilarly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats =\r\nfrom the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time=\r\n in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc=\r\n), it stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.\n\nJust as physical=\r\n energy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual ene=\r\nrgy helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.\n\nIf your surrender is =\r\nperfect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas wi=\r\nthout committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless=\r\n leaf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have=\r\n a conditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulner=\r\nable to committing NEW karmas, don&#39;t you think some energy is needed?\n\nDon&#39;=\r\nt look at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to do great deeds =\r\nin the world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude=\r\n and inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as somethin=\r\ng that enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome you=\r\nr own weaknesses.\n\n* * *\n\n4. If you are living every second without any goa=\r\nls/agendas/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberate=\r\nd and then your point is meaningful.\n\nBut, if you do have some some goals, =\r\nsome wishes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize =\r\nthat those wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaa=\r\nrmically) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti)=\r\n accumulated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy=\r\n and stop you from getting bound further.\n\nSome people make the mistake of =\r\nthinking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from moksh=\r\na. That is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definite=\r\nly worth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.\n\nSuppose you hav=\r\ne a trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected tra=\r\nsh and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new tr=\r\nash that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you k=\r\neep collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can=\r\n also, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.\n\nBest=\r\n regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.=\r\norg\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 2010 11:4=\r\n2:03 +0000\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadhana\n&gt; From: M=\r\nanish Pandit &lt;mm.pandit@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. n=\r\net&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Brahmacharya and virya:\n&gt; \n&gt; In a ml of semen, there are millio=\r\nns of sperm, most living beings with\n&gt; potential to form a jiva.\n&gt; Look at =\r\nthem under a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.\n&gt; They =\r\nswim really energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try not to\n&gt; ki=\r\nll tadpoles normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be ok to take God&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n name and kill them?\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is that those poor beings are destined =\r\nfor short life and death\n&gt; normally.\n&gt; If you realised this and stopped you=\r\nrself by Brahmacharya, still you would\n&gt; have nightly emissions. Partly, ri=\r\nch food, partly lots of Kama related\n&gt; thoughts are responsible.\n&gt; Whenever=\r\n you think of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by\n&gt; consciou=\r\ns effort and look at the thought, you will clearly see the\n&gt; copulation hap=\r\npening in your thought in the head.\n&gt; That is problematic, but essentially =\r\nit means that sex starts in the mind\n&gt; only. Control the mind and things ar=\r\ne generally fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing is the prostatic fluid itself, if yo=\r\nu get a slight erection\n&gt; say after 20-30 days of strict Brahmacharya, you =\r\nwill notice that although\n&gt; there is no emission of sperm, some prostatic f=\r\nluid comes out (this is a\n&gt; form of Shukra-Acharya. ... prostatic fluid nou=\r\nrishes sperm and ....\n&gt; &quot;teaches&quot; it) This also represents a loss of shakti=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, so, how to stop it??\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and =\r\nkeep Bramhacharya for a few days,\n&gt; someday you may be destined for a fall =\r\nfrom Brahmacharya, for example, if\n&gt; some great looking heroine comes to yo=\r\nu and drops her clothes without asking,\n&gt; how many of you will be able to r=\r\nesist, keeping in mind that sexual imagery\n&gt; from films may have already sp=\r\noiled the mind. Most difficult... .\n&gt; There are only two ways, total contro=\r\nl, which very few can do or total\n&gt; gratification followed by terrific sadh=\r\nana.\n&gt; Here is where Tantra is superb, none of these so called gurus can ma=\r\ntch a\n&gt; true sadhaka of tantra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name ju=\r\nst as\n&gt; sitting in a smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are af=\r\nraid of\n&gt; Her in the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which bin=\r\nds normal\n&gt; humans.\n&gt; Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana=\r\n of a sexual nature.\n&gt; These are two separate things. Sadhana of this sort =\r\ntricks the mind in many\n&gt; ways already discussed before.\n&gt; I would suggest =\r\nthat Shiva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind\n&gt; of control whi=\r\nch most people cannot imagine.\n&gt; First, you will stick to one partner for t=\r\nhe sadhana, that is a kind of\n&gt; Brahmacharya in itself.\n&gt; Two, the sadhana =\r\nwhen it matures, will be so good that ordinary sex will be\n&gt; thrown out of =\r\nthe window.\n&gt; Three, a naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the w=\r\nay it did when\n&gt; you first started.\n&gt; Four, the play of the deity within yo=\r\nur respective bodies will give you\n&gt; knowledge which normal people do not h=\r\nave.\n&gt; Five, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and t=\r\nhe\n&gt; deities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? The Law =\r\nof\n&gt; karma applies to everybody.\n&gt; Six, The bliss of not having to think of=\r\n sex will occur for many months on\n&gt; end.\n&gt; The aashirvaad given by the spe=\r\nrm for not being killed (millions of such\n&gt; beings), is so tremendous that =\r\nthe Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies\n&gt; tremendously. Notice that i still sa=\r\ny sadhaka, not &quot;Great exhalted Guru&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or all that rubbish.\n&gt;=\r\n As far as I am concerned, very few people are qualified enough to be a Gur=\r\nu(\n&gt; I do not think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my child=\r\nren).\n&gt; True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost imp=\r\nossible\n&gt; to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do everyth=\r\ning such a\n&gt; being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?\n&gt; And the p=\r\nunishment for Guru Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.\n&gt; Unfortunate=\r\nly, sometimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/\n&gt; Guru comes to th=\r\neir door, they foolishly direct that person elsewhere, such\n&gt; is the force =\r\nof maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Love\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@yahoo. com&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne argument involving Virya is not satisfying to me:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. This explanati=\r\non is explaining predominantly from a male point of view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. According=\r\n the modern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or\n&gt; &gt; not, the Vi=\r\nrya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why so much focus or =\r\naffinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the\n&gt; &gt; common argument is that w=\r\ne need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our\n&gt; &gt; karma. But, why burn =\r\nthe karma? In several threads, the only absolute way of\n&gt; &gt; burning karma s=\r\neem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the\n&gt; &gt; mind. In o=\r\nrder to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need\n&gt; &gt; energy. =\r\nI trust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Is not=\r\n the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to\n&gt; &gt; anticipate/wish =\r\nfor an experiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do\n&gt; &gt; sadhana wit=\r\nh out any anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy\n&gt; &gt; or ev=\r\nen obtaining Moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to ke=\r\nep the mind in Brahman all the\n&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not result in =\r\nany more karma because, your mind is\n&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence you =\r\ndo not identify yourself in your actions.\n&gt; &gt; You do them because you had t=\r\no do them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoiding certai=\r\nn actions but, try\n&gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about God while =\r\ndoing any/every thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in my chi=\r\nld hood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the best devotee =\r\nas he keeps\n&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him b=\r\ny naming some\n&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters =\r\nthe name of Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada protests and t=\r\nhen Vishnu gives him a\n&gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on hi=\r\ns head and walk around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s n=\r\name while you are doing sex. If\n&gt; &gt; you can manage to decrease amount of jo=\r\ny you derise out of sex, then you are\n&gt; &gt; on the correct path. Nigraha will=\r\n come automatically if you stop enjoying\n&gt; &gt; it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-351786136-1268063644=:214\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimharao garu and others, &lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After reading these questions, I have another seri=\r\nous question.

The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have all kinds of=\r\n connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force that can be =\r\nused to change or move something karmically.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose you see somethi=\r\nng or someone beautiful and the enemy of &quot;desire&quot; (one of shadripus - six i=\r\nnternal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuses you a=\r\nnd the enemy of &quot;anger&quot; tries to attack your mind. How does your mind fight=\r\n back?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind =\r\nneeds energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the ene=\r\nmies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts sha=\r\nkti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on the=\r\n mind is negated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you eat, you get physical energy.\n When you e=\r\nxercise, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Si=\r\nmilarly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats=\r\n from the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends tim=\r\ne in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang et=\r\nc), it stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as p=\r\nhysical energy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spirit=\r\nual energy helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If your =\r\nsurrender is perfect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of y=\r\nour karmas without committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like=\r\n a weightless leaf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if y=\r\nou still have a conditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadrip=\r\nus and vulnerable to committing NEW karmas, don&#39;t you think some energy is =\r\nneeded?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don&#39;t look at spiritual shakti as\n something that enables yo=\r\nu to do great deeds in the world. Though that too is possible, that is a eg=\r\no-promiting attitude and inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritua=\r\nl shakti as something that enables you to fight back your own internal enem=\r\nies and overcome your own weaknesses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. If you are liv=\r\ning every second without any goals/agendas/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, t=\r\nhen you are all already liberated and then your point is meaningful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;But, if you do have some some goals, some wishes, some anticipations, some=\r\n agendas etc, then you should realize that those wishes and anticipations h=\r\nave a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmically) and they bind you further. =\r\nYou need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumulated through exertion of self=\r\n-control to negate that kinetic energy and stop you from getting bound furt=\r\nher.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people make the mistake of thinking that desire of moksha =\r\nis also a desire and can stop you from\n moksha. That is true. However, it i=\r\ns better than many other desires and definitely worth having. It can be jet=\r\ntisoned when the time comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose you have a trash can in which y=\r\nou collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash and hang on to the tr=\r\nash can. If you throw away the can too, then new trash that comes in will b=\r\ne all over the floor. So keep the can so that you keep collecting trash and=\r\n throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can also, when you are abso=\r\nlutely sure that no trash is being generated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Naras=\r\nimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://s=\r\naraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.=\r\norg&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 2010 11:42:03 +0000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; S=\r\nubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Manish Pa=\r\nndit &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dmm.pandi=\r\nt%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;mm.pandit@gmail. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com=\r\n/mc/compose?to=3Dpvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;pvr@char=\r\nter. net&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On Brahmacharya and virya:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; In a ml of semen, there are millions of sperm, most\n living beings with&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; potential to form a jiva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Look at them under a microscope i=\r\nn a hospital if you get a chance some day.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; They swim really energet=\r\nically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try not to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kill tadpoles n=\r\normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be ok to take God&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; name a=\r\nnd kill them?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The point is that those poor beings are dest=\r\nined for short life and death&lt;BR&gt;&gt; normally.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you realised thi=\r\ns and stopped yourself by Brahmacharya, still you would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have nightl=\r\ny emissions. Partly, rich food, partly lots of Kama related&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thought=\r\ns are responsible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever you think of a woman/man in that way, j=\r\nust stop your thought by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conscious effort and look at the thought, =\r\nyou will clearly see the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; copulation happening in your thought in th=\r\ne head.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That is problematic, but essentially it means that sex star=\r\nts in the mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only. Control the mind\n and things are generally fin=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The other thing is the prostatic fluid itself, if you g=\r\net a slight erection&lt;BR&gt;&gt; say after 20-30 days of strict Brahmacharya, y=\r\nou will notice that although&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there is no emission of sperm, some pr=\r\nostatic fluid comes out (this is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; form of Shukra-Acharya. ... pros=\r\ntatic fluid nourishes sperm and ....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;teaches&quot; it) This also repres=\r\nents a loss of shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Right, so, how to stop it??&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and keep Bramhacharya for a few da=\r\nys,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someday you may be destined for a fall from Brahmacharya, for e=\r\nxample, if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some great looking heroine comes to you and drops her cl=\r\nothes without asking,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how many of you will be able to resist, keepi=\r\nng in mind that sexual imagery&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from films may have already spoiled =\r\nthe mind. Most difficult... .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are only two ways, total contro=\r\nl, which very few can do or\n total&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gratification followed by terrif=\r\nic sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Here is where Tantra is superb, none of these so called=\r\n gurus can match a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; true sadhaka of tantra. Unfortunately, tantra ha=\r\ns got a bad name just as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sitting in a smashan and doing sadhana. In=\r\n the former people are afraid of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her in the form of Maya, in the ot=\r\nher the pasha of fear which binds normal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humans.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most norma=\r\nl people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana of a sexual nature.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The=\r\nse are two separate things. Sadhana of this sort tricks the mind in many&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; ways already discussed before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I would suggest that Shiva lat=\r\na Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of control which most =\r\npeople cannot imagine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; First, you will stick to one partner for the=\r\n sadhana, that is a kind of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahmacharya in itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Two, th=\r\ne sadhana when it matures, will be so good that ordinary sex will be&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; thrown out of the\n window.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Three, a naked woman or man can no lon=\r\nger arouse you in the way it did when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you first started.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fo=\r\nur, the play of the deity within your respective bodies will give you&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; knowledge which normal people do not have.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Five, even if you are=\r\n born again, your partner in this sadhana and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deities will both=\r\n come to you unasked, where can they escape? The Law of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; karma appli=\r\nes to everybody.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Six, The bliss of not having to think of sex will =\r\noccur for many months on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; end.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The aashirvaad given by the s=\r\nperm for not being killed (millions of such&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings), is so tremendo=\r\nus that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tremendously. Notice t=\r\nhat i still say sadhaka, not &quot;Great exhalted Guru&quot; or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or=\r\n all that rubbish.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As far as I am concerned, very few people are qu=\r\nalified enough to be a Guru(&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do not think that I am, but I guide =\r\nthose who\n come to me as my children).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; True Gurus of the sort menti=\r\noned in the AGHORA books are almost impossible&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to find, and even if=\r\n you do find such a Guru, will you do everything such a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being says?=\r\n How good a disciple can most of us be?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And the punishment for Guru=\r\n Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, sometime=\r\ns for some people, even when a real sadhaka/&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Guru comes to their do=\r\nor, they foolishly direct that person elsewhere, such&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the force =\r\nof maya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Love&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dpvklnrao%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;pvklnrao@yahoo. com=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered ques=\r\ntions in my mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The argument involvin=\r\ng Virya is not satisfying to me:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. This explanation is e=\r\nxplaining\n predominantly from a male point of view&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Acc=\r\nording the modern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; not, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; 3. Why so much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; common argument is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy t=\r\no burn our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karma. But, why burn the karma? In several threads,=\r\n the only absolute way of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; burning karma seem to be paying it u=\r\np with out attachment. It is all in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind. In order to real=\r\nise this and condition our mind, do we really need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; energy. I t=\r\nrust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n4. Is not the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; anticipate/wish for an experiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to =\r\ndo&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana with out any anticipation, why all this focus on\n a=\r\nccumulating energy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or even obtaining Moksha?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in=\r\n Brahman all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not result in any m=\r\nore karma because, your mind is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence =\r\nyou do not identify yourself in your actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You do them beca=\r\nuse you had to do them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best w=\r\nay to get this is not avoiding certain actions but, try&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; develo=\r\nping ability to keep thinking about God while doing any/every thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in my child ho=\r\nod.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he i=\r\ns the best devotee as he keeps&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the ti=\r\nme. Vishnu disappoints him by naming some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his b=\r\nest devotee. This wood cutter utters the name of Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; only =\r\nfew times during the day. Narada protests and then Vishnu gives him a&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head and walk aro=\r\nund.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant Go=\r\nd&#39;s name while you are doing sex. If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you can manage to decreas=\r\ne amount of joy you derise out of sex, then you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the cor=\r\nrect path. Nigraha will come automatically if you stop enjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-351786136-1268063644=:214--\r\n\n"}}
