It cannot be said that it exists. As\n=\r\ndarkness does not bear the light, so this ignorance does not bear [the ligh=\r\nt\nof] right awareness.\n\nBut the question arises, in what, when it appears, =\r\ndoes this ignorance\nsubsist? The answer is given next.\n\n297 This ignorance,=\r\n as the world-form, appears to ignorant ones to be real.\nIn the Supreme Bei=\r\nng [which is consciousness] the world is like unreal\njewellery that appears=\r\n in the [relatively] real gold.\n\nHere the simile of gold and jewellery is u=\r\nsed. It is usually supposed that\nboth are real, but here the jewellery is d=\r\nescribed as unreal. Why is it so\ndescribed?\n\n298 If it is asked, =E2=80=98H=\r\now is it said that gold is real, but jewellery is\nunreal?=E2=80=99 [the ans=\r\nwer is that] the words are used here by our Guru in order\nto show that the =\r\nworld, which is the subject of comparison, is unreal.\n\nCan this be done, it=\r\n may be asked? It is answered in the following way.\n\n299 Since a simile is =\r\nused to convey a clear knowledge of the subject of the\nteaching, the simile=\r\n is presented so as to convey the intended meaning.\n\nThe propriety of thus =\r\npresenting this simile is shown next.\n\n300 The jewellery was [only] gold be=\r\nfore; it is only that in the middle, and\nit is that in the end also. Compar=\r\ned to the jewellery, gold is [relatively]\nreal, and because the jewellery-f=\r\norms are transient, they are unreal.\n\nThis is in accordance with the vedant=\r\nic definition of reality, which is here\nstated once more.\n\n301 Here imperma=\r\nnence alone is the test of unreality. Permanence itself is\naffirmed as [the=\r\n quality of] reality. Hence, [it follows] that ignorance and\nthe world whic=\r\nh is born of it, are unreal, exactly like the serpent seen in\na rope.\n\nThis=\r\n has been discussed and settled in a previous context.\n\nAnother analogy is =\r\nused next to explain the teaching.\n\n302 Or, as the moving pictures pass upo=\r\nn the unmoving lighted screen [in a\ncinema show], so the series of pictures=\r\n, namely the world, comes and goes on\n[the substratum], the real [which is =\r\nunmoving].\n\nThis is the simile used in =E2=80=98Forty Verses on the Real=E2=\r\n=80=99, in the very\nbeginning, immediately after the first two benedictory =\r\nverses.\n\n303 In the analogy of the moving pictures, the seer is distinct fr=\r\nom them,\nwhereas in the world pictures the seer is included. Thus the world=\r\n differs\n[from the cinema show]. The result is that the world and its seer =\r\n[the\nindividual] are both unreal.\n\n304 Just as the light on the screen rema=\r\nins clear [of the shadow pictures]\nwhen those moving pictures have ceased, =\r\nso too when the series of\nworld-pictures cease, the consciousness, which is=\r\n the Self, will remain\nclear [as the sole reality].\n\nThe unreality of the w=\r\norld is further highlighted by the world-appearance\nbeing made up of a seri=\r\nes of momentary pictures, as is shown next.\n\n305 As at every instant of tim=\r\ne the spectator,seeing only a new picture,\nassumes that what he sees is one=\r\n, so the ignorant one, seeing an utterly new\nworld every instant, assumes t=\r\nhat what he sees is one continuous world.\n\nThis mistaken view concerns the =\r\nseer=E2=80=99s own body also. From this it follows\nthat the seer, who is on=\r\nly a reflection in the three bodies, is unreal =E2=80=93\nthat is, as unreal=\r\n as the spectacle, the world.\n\nThe world-appearance is possible only becaus=\r\ne the real Self, which is\nconsciousness, is present as the substratum.\n\n306=\r\n As the succession of moving pictures shines only on the screen and by\nits =\r\nlight, so the world shines only on the real Self and by its light of\nconsci=\r\nousness.\n\n307 Just for this reason the real Self is real in its own right. =\r\nThis world\nis not at all real in its own right. The unreality of the world =\r\nand the\nreality of the Self, which is pure consciousness, should be underst=\r\nood in\nthis way.\n\nThere is a distinction to be noted between the popular se=\r\nnse of the world\n=E2=80=98real=E2=80=99 and its use in advaitic Vedanta phi=\r\nlosophy, which has already been\nexpounded.\n\nThe next topic to be studied is=\r\n the mental impression that time and space\nare objective realities. These t=\r\nwo are inseparable from the\nworld-appearance, and hence the world would con=\r\ntinue to be taken as real if\nthese two are taken to be so.\n\n308 The mind kn=\r\nows all visible objects, the physical body and all the rest,\nequally in dre=\r\nam and in waking, as divided up in space and in time, and\nhence it is neces=\r\nsary to enquire whether these two are real [or not].\n\n309 These three, name=\r\nly space, time and causality, have been shown to be\nonly mental by an occid=\r\nental philosopher named Kant by means of good\nreasons.\n\n310 Bhagavan, our G=\r\nuru, makes it clear to the seekers of deliverance, from\nthe experience of a=\r\nll men in deep sleep, and from the experiences of sages\nin the supreme stat=\r\ne, that these three are unreal.\n\n311 Because no one knows space and time in=\r\n deep sleep, where the mind is\nlatent, and in the supreme state, where the =\r\nmind is lost, these two are only\nmental.\n\n312 In the dream state as well as=\r\n the waking state the mind creates these\ntwo along with the world. Without =\r\nthem the mind knows nothing. This is the\nenduring nature of the mind.\n\n313 =\r\nOnly because of the ignorance =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 does man have=\r\n the\nawareness =E2=80=98I am in space and time=E2=80=99. Really, we are not=\r\n in space, nor in\ntime. If we were bodies, then [and only then] would we be=\r\n in them.\n\n314 We are not bodies, nor do we own them, since we never became=\r\n souls.\nSpace and time, just like all things, are created in us by the mind=\r\n because\nof ignorance.\n\nIt may be asked when we shall be rid of this delusi=\r\non of the objective\nreality of space and time. The answer given in the next=\r\n verse is from\nBhagavan, our Guru.\n\n315 If the mind, by the quest of its so=\r\nurce, attains peace in the supreme\nstate, then these two will be swallowed =\r\nup by the real Self itself, along\nwith the ego and the world.\n\n316 The whol=\r\ne world, which is composed of causes and effects together with\nspace and ti=\r\nme, is illusory. The real Self never undergoes change, whether\nby space or =\r\nby time, or by causality.\n\n317 Since the one real Self [of all], which is e=\r\nver the same, never swerving\nfrom its true nature, transcending time and de=\r\nvoid of space, and hence\ninfinite, is experienced by the sages, it alone is=\r\n real; nothing else.\n\nThe three divisions of time, namely the past, the pre=\r\nsent and the future,\nare next dealt with and shown to be unreal.\n\n318 Also =\r\nthe divisions of time, namely, past, present and future, are not at\nall rea=\r\nl. The past and the future are dependent upon the present, and are\nthemselv=\r\nes present in their own times.\n\n319 Thus all time is only present; men make=\r\n this division only by words; the\neternal reality is indeed the real Self a=\r\nlone. Hence, it alone is present,\nnothing else.\n\n320 The aspirant must ther=\r\nefore aim at the experience of the truth of that\nSelf by attaining the supr=\r\neme state. The discussion of the past and of the\nfuture is declared to be l=\r\nike trying to count without knowledge of the\nnumber =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99.\n=\r\n\n321 Only the number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99 exists, and none else, because a=\r\nll numbers are\nmodifications of it. In the same way, the consciousness that=\r\n is the Self\nalone exists, and the whole world is only that.\n\n322 As one be=\r\ncomes able, by knowing the number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99, to know all the\nnu=\r\nmbers, so, after knowing the truth of themselves, the sages come to know\nth=\r\ne truth of the world also.\n\n323 The Guru says that having knowledge of anyt=\r\nhing other than the Self,\nwithout first knowing the Truth of oneself, is on=\r\nly ignorance. Everything\nthat one knows, without having a right awareness o=\r\nf the Self, is a knowledge\nthat is contrary to truth.\n\n324 When, by the que=\r\nst of the Self, that Self is known, there remains\nnothing else to be known.=\r\n To the sage all things shine only as the Self, and\nhence the Self is well =\r\nknown as =E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 [in the Vedantas].\n\n325 Therefore Bhagav=\r\nan Sri Ramana says that omniscience is only the state of\nbeing the real Sel=\r\nf. He also says that what is considered as omniscience by\nthe ignorant is o=\r\nnly ignorance.\n\nHow the Self is =E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 is next stated.\n\n=\r\n326 This world is not other than the body; this body is not distinct from\nt=\r\nhe mind; the mind does not exist apart from the real Self; therefore that\nS=\r\nelf is all the world.\n\n327 =E2=80=98How was I in my previous birth, and how=\r\n shall I be in the next birth?=E2=80=99\n=E2=80=93 such enquiries are only [=\r\ndue to] ignorance, because the Self was never\nborn.\n\n328 Thinking about the=\r\n totality and the distinct units [individuals] is a\npointless activity for =\r\nseekers of deliverance. Only the enquiry as to the\nsource of him [the ego] =\r\nwho is interested in the totality and the units will\nlead to deliverance.\n\n=\r\n329 =E2=80=98By whom, and how, was the world created in the beginning?=E2=\r\n=80=99 =E2=80=98What is\nmaya?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98What is ignorance?=E2=80=99=\r\n =E2=80=98How did the individual soul come into being?=E2=80=99\nSuch pointl=\r\ness questions are posed by the deluded ones because they forget\nthe main th=\r\ning that needs to be enquired into.\n\nThe secret of creation is briefly stat=\r\ned next.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=\r\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e64f45e8f9647804a038bbcc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n296 This ignorance is like darkness.

The answer is given next.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;297 This ignorance, as the world-form, appears to ignorant ones to be =\r\nreal. In the Supreme Being [which is consciousness] the world is like unrea=\r\nl jewellery that appears in the [relatively] real gold.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here the sim=\r\nile of gold and jewellery is used.

Why is it so described?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;298 If it is asked, =E2=80=98How is it said that gold is real, but =\r\njewellery is unreal?=E2=80=99 [the answer is that] the words are used here =\r\nby our Guru in order to show that the world, which is the subject of compar=\r\nison, is unreal.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Can this be done, it may be asked? It is answered=\r\n in the following way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;299 Since a simile is used to convey a clear =\r\nknowledge of the subject of the teaching, the simile is presented so as to =\r\nconvey the intended meaning.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The propriety of thus presenting this=\r\n simile is shown next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;300 The jewe=\r\nllery was [only] gold before; it is only that in the middle, and it is that=\r\n in the end also. Compared to the jewellery, gold is [relatively] real, and=\r\n because the jewellery-forms are transient, they are unreal.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;This is in accordance with the vedantic definition of reality, which is h=\r\nere stated once more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;301 Here impermanence alone is the test of unr=\r\neality.

Hence, [=\r\nit follows] that ignorance and the world which is born of it, are unreal, e=\r\nxactly like the serpent seen in a rope.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This has been discussed an=\r\nd settled in a previous context.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another analogy is used next to exp=\r\nlain the teaching.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;302 Or, as the m=\r\noving pictures pass upon the unmoving lighted screen [in a cinema show], so=\r\n the series of pictures, namely the world, comes and goes on [the substratu=\r\nm], the real [which is unmoving].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is the simile used i=\r\nn =E2=80=98Forty Verses on the Real=E2=80=99, in the very beginning, immedi=\r\nately after the first two benedictory verses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;303 In the analogy of =\r\nthe moving pictures, the seer is distinct from them, whereas in the world p=\r\nictures the seer is included.

Really=\r\n, we are not in space, nor in time. If we were bodies, then [and only then]=\r\n would we be in them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;314 We are not bodies, nor do we own them, sin=\r\nce we never became souls. Space and time, just like all things, are created=\r\n in us by the mind because of ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It may be asked when we s=\r\nhall be rid of this delusion of the objective reality of space and time. Th=\r\ne answer given in the next verse is from Bhagavan, our Guru.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;315 If =\r\nthe mind, by the quest of its source, attains peace in the supreme state, t=\r\nhen these two will be swallowed up by the real Self itself, along with the =\r\nego and the world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;316 The whole world, which is composed of cause=\r\ns and effects together with space and time, is illusory.

The past and=\r\n the future are dependent upon the present, and are themselves present in t=\r\nheir own times.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;319 Thus all time is only present; men make this d=\r\nivision only by words; the eternal reality is indeed the real Self alone.

The discussion of the past and o=\r\nf the future is declared to be like trying to count without knowledge of th=\r\ne number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;321 Only the number =E2=80=\r\n=98one=E2=80=99 exists, and none else, because all numbers are modification=\r\ns of it. In the same way, the consciousness that is the Self alone exists, =\r\nand the whole world is only that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;322 As one becomes able, by knowin=\r\ng the number =E2=80=98one=E2=80=99, to know all the numbers, so, after know=\r\ning the truth of themselves, the sages come to know the truth of the world =\r\nalso.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;323 The Guru says that havi=\r\nng knowledge of anything other than the Self, without first knowing the Tru=\r\nth of oneself, is only ignorance. Everything that one knows, without having=\r\n a right awareness of the Self, is a knowledge that is contrary to truth.&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;324 When, by the quest of the Self, that Self is known, ther=\r\ne remains nothing else to be known. To the sage all things shine only as th=\r\ne Self, and hence the Self is well known as =E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 [in t=\r\nhe Vedantas].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;325 Therefore Bhagavan Sri Ramana says that omniscienc=\r\ne is only the state of being the real Self. He also says that what is consi=\r\ndered as omniscience by the ignorant is only ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;How the Se=\r\nlf is =E2=80=98the All=E2=80=99 is next stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;326 This world is no=\r\nt other than the body; this body is not distinct from the mind; the mind do=\r\nes not exist apart from the real Self; therefore that Self is all the world=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;327 =E2=80=98How was I in my previous birth, and how shall I be =\r\nin the next birth?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 such enquiries are only [due to] igno=\r\nrance, because the Self was never born.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;328 Thinking about the totality and the distinct units [individuals] i=\r\ns a pointless activity for seekers of deliverance. Only the enquiry as to t=\r\nhe source of him [the ego] who is interested in the totality and the units =\r\nwill lead to deliverance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;329 =E2=80=98By whom, and how, wa=\r\ns the world created in the beginning?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98What is maya?=E2=80=\r\n=99 =E2=80=98What is ignorance?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=98How did the individual so=\r\nul come into being?=E2=80=99 Such pointless questions are posed by the delu=\r\nded ones because they forget the main thing that needs to be enquired into.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The secret of creation is briefly stated next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/=\r\nrteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach=\r\n/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0p=\r\nx;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:=\r\n0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016e64f45e8f9647804a038bbcc--\r\n\n"}}
