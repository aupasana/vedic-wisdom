Take bath be=\r\nfore starting Homa.\n\nI belive that you are fluent with Chandi Paath. if not=\r\n than do not worry, just do the Homam with 4th and/or 11th chapter. if that=\r\n is not possible then just do it with &#39;Durga Saptashloki&#39;.\n\nJai Mataji\n\nUtp=\r\nal\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, shreya sampathy &lt;shreyasampathy@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Guruji,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 Pranam!!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I would like to th=\r\nank you for all your kind and effective advices.
