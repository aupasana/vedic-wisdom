I have just now finished typing a long =\r\npost on another thread. However I will address both your questions in anoth=\r\ner post hopefully within a week or so at the earliest that I can. I will al=\r\nso elaborate a little more on the role of intiation in mantramarga. Except =\r\nfor mantra sadhana, initiation is not a mandatory requirement in any other =\r\nform of sadhana. It is a different matter though that the idea has been app=\r\nropriated by practitioners studying even predominantly secular disciplines =\r\nsuch as music, dance, astrology etc, causing a lot of unwanted and unhealth=\r\ny confusion. No doubt, spiritualising these secular subjects makes them mor=\r\ne wonderful and inspiring. It is the false pretense of certain unscrupulous=\r\n self-proclaimed gurus of material vidyas that I am cautioning against. It =\r\nis mantra sadhana alone as enjoined by the Tantras that requires initiation=\r\n. Nowhere else is it a requirement. I will deal with the rest in my next po=\r\nst.\n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash  \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Satya Prakash ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you f=\r\nor your beautiful=C2=A0analysis of Sri Sri Chandi. I read it and reflected =\r\n\n&gt; on it, and in my limited understand I agree to most of what you have sai=\r\nd. \n&gt; Specially your explanation pertaining to=C2=A0Chand-munda and=C2=A0Su=\r\nmbha-Nishumbh were \n&gt; awesome!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a question about your following =\r\nparagraph:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do=\r\n the sadhana as per \n&gt; the mantra marga. It is this particular approach tha=\r\nt needs initiation as per \n&gt; its own principles. Initiation is not mandator=\r\ny if one adopts the Vedantic path \n&gt; of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic pa=\r\nth of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the \n&gt; Pauranic approach of reading the=\r\n text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam \n&gt; too is not required if one=\r\n is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice \n&gt; of Ritual/Yagnya. =\r\nOne may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri \n&gt; Chandi. H=\r\nowever one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions \n&gt; =\r\nof both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various part=\r\ns of \n&gt; the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and he=\r\nnce the \n&gt; importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi o=\r\nr Sri Vidya.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to differ=\r\nent paramparas within the \n&gt; broader subset of Kalikula. They said that the=\r\n initiation in Chandi sadhana in \n&gt; required for not only the parayana but =\r\nalso (mostly?) because of the main \n&gt; mantra. Normally we are accustomed wi=\r\nth only the navarna mantra, but there are \n&gt; various other mantras of the d=\r\nifferent aspects of the Universal Chandi, of which \n&gt; the navarna we know o=\r\nf, is probably the mildest. To chant one of these mantras \n&gt; and awaken the=\r\n same needs initiation. This, they said, is a part of the entire \n&gt; Chandi =\r\nsadhana.=C2=A0What=C2=A0is your opinion on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) As a corollary to =\r\nyour above paragraph, one can therefore read the text of \n&gt; the Chandi in a=\r\n pouranik approach, as a sacred myth? There are people, specially \n&gt; in Ben=\r\ngal, who do a Chandipath on their own without having undergone any formal \n=\r\n&gt; initiation. How good or bad is this practise?\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajar=\r\nshi\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me. \n&gt; Take away the m=\r\ne, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; =\r\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: =\r\nmindcareclinic@...\n&gt; Sent: Mon, 18 October, 2010 8:54:40 PM\n&gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Fwd: Initiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner \n&gt; Meanin=\r\ng)\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; I am forwarding a reply sent by Dr Satya Prakash Choudhar=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:10:31 -0000\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Dr Satya Prakash=\r\n&quot; &lt;mindcareclinic@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom-owner@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Subje=\r\nct: Initiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Meaning)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All Glories to the Goddess!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am Satya Prak=\r\nash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the last 4-5 \n&gt; &gt;years I=\r\n have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. Howev=\r\ner after \n&gt; &gt;Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my w=\r\nrite up to my \n&gt; &gt;inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through s=\r\nome posts. I am happy \n&gt; &gt;to note that the general atmosphere here is far b=\r\netter and more sincere than a \n&gt; &gt;lot of other forums. Having quickly brows=\r\ned through this particular thread, I \n&gt; &gt;thought that I might reply to Utpa=\r\nl ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regardi=\r\nng the necessity of \n&gt; &gt;initiation. I will address it after summarizing the=\r\n big picture that needs to be \n&gt; &gt;invoked in order to understand the ONE qu=\r\nestion and the MANY answers possible. \n&gt; &gt;Firstly is the question a general=\r\n or specific one? Generally speaking if the \n&gt; &gt;question is whether initiat=\r\nion is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or \n&gt; &gt;sadhana, *my* answ=\r\ner is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of \n&gt; &gt;being init=\r\niated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is \n&gt; &gt;Y=\r\nES.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby =\r\nthe necessity for \n&gt; &gt;multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises t=\r\nhe inevitability of \n&gt; &gt;multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context th=\r\nere are many paths for \n&gt; &gt;sadhana. But in the current context of this ques=\r\ntion I will restrict myself to \n&gt; &gt;only the five that are relevant to the d=\r\niscussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (P=\r\nsycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/De=\r\nvotion)\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abst=\r\nract Truths \n&gt; &gt;of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particula=\r\nr methods and \n&gt; &gt;techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract tr=\r\nuths at an experiential \n&gt; &gt;level. Let us briefly look at the predominant m=\r\nethods/ techniques employed by \n&gt; &gt;each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who a=\r\nre predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking \n&gt; &gt;even the =\r\nexternal guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflectio=\r\nn). \n&gt; &gt;Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has=\r\n retained the \n&gt; &gt;vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of tex=\r\nts) too as an important \n&gt; &gt;practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;s=\r\nelf&#39; in a big way with a marginal \n&gt; &gt;role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga addit=\r\nionally \n&gt; &gt;emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Sup=\r\nreme Iswara) too \n&gt; &gt;while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise =\r\nonly the first two as they \n&gt; &gt;subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhakti=\r\n marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nwill through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis i=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt;Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging =\r\nin actions \n&gt; &gt;without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma m=\r\narga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantr=\r\na sadhana where alone the \n&gt; &gt;inevitable necessity of initiation and thereb=\r\ny the necessity of a Guru arises. \n&gt; &gt;Mantra sadhana involves the practical=\r\nization of certain occult truths via the \n&gt; &gt;energetics of Sabda through th=\r\ne employment of Vak. It presupposes certain \n&gt; &gt;dangers inherent to any lab=\r\n experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe \n&gt; &gt;practices. It shou=\r\nld be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke \n&gt; &gt;Fire or Agn=\r\ni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the \n&gt; &gt;refer=\r\nence here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the fi=\r\nre of \n&gt; &gt;speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physic=\r\nal fire of the \n&gt; &gt;Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking f=\r\nire deals with the fire of Vak through the \n&gt; &gt;lab-like practical mantrasas=\r\ntra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques \n&gt; &gt;that bring results=\r\n more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is \n&gt; &gt;not about=\r\n authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to \n&gt; &gt;exp=\r\neriment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need \n&gt; &gt;exp=\r\nerience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety meas=\r\nures, in \n&gt; &gt;the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own c=\r\nonsciousness \n&gt; &gt;whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the in=\r\ndividual consciousness \n&gt; &gt;(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this i=\r\ns not a topic for mere \n&gt; &gt;intellectualisation, I will refrain from further=\r\n discussion on the Kundalini. \n&gt; &gt;Without going into other needless details=\r\n here, I will just elaborate on \n&gt; &gt;initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it wit=\r\nhin \n&gt; &gt;the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river wi=\r\nthin the \n&gt; &gt;Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta =\r\nsadhanas \n&gt; &gt;comprehensively. However there are actually three major school=\r\ns that are \n&gt; &gt;full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Ka=\r\nlikula, Srikula and \n&gt; &gt;Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikul=\r\na whilst Sri Vidya sadhana \n&gt; &gt;belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture=\r\n more complete the Vajrayanas among \n&gt; &gt;the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tar=\r\nakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan \n&gt; &gt;Buddhism I will draw atte=\r\nntion to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana \n&gt; &gt;shares both the A=\r\ndvaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach \n&gt; &gt;to sadhan=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not in=\r\nvoked at all) \n&gt; &gt;while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at th=\r\ne major milestones in \n&gt; &gt;the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantr=\r\na, bija, devata, etc are all \n&gt; &gt;consistently of a particular set of synchr=\r\nonistic frequencies for each of these \n&gt; &gt;three lineages. Initiation is the=\r\n full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a \n&gt; &gt;particular spiritual lin=\r\neage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be \n&gt; &gt;compared to an INVE=\r\nRTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk \n&gt; &gt;arises. Ea=\r\nch branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward \n&gt; &gt;=\r\ntill the individual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualis=\r\ne it. \n&gt; &gt;Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. =\r\nIt is held by \n&gt; &gt;the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes t=\r\nhe circuit necessary \n&gt; &gt;for the conduit of electricity but also prevents s=\r\nhort circuit. Imagine many \n&gt; &gt;beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this=\r\n inverted tree of live wires, where \n&gt; &gt;there is a long series of sadhakas =\r\nsitting in silent practice all the way up \n&gt; &gt;till Siva himself. It is a dy=\r\nnamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). \n&gt; &gt;Now back to Sri Sri C=\r\nhandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti withi=\r\nn the individual \n&gt; &gt;consciousness through an integrated approach that comb=\r\nines the practices of \n&gt; &gt;Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalik=\r\nula and Srikula have evolved \n&gt; &gt;into highly comprehensive and integrated a=\r\npproaches that can simultaneously hold \n&gt; &gt;the many in the One. Sri Sri Cha=\r\nndi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. \n&gt; &gt;However it is also a f=\r\null-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It \n&gt; &gt;is also simu=\r\nltaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The \n&gt; &gt;question o=\r\nf initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and \n&gt; &gt;th=\r\nus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text=\r\n as \n&gt; &gt;a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have co=\r\nvered \n&gt; &gt;extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to=\r\n the Advaitic \n&gt; &gt;path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely p=\r\nowerful reflections \n&gt; &gt;through its central message of Oneness. The crest j=\r\newel, the crowning glory in \n&gt; &gt;the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi =\r\nHerself proclaims in full-fledged \n&gt; &gt;Upanishadic fashion that She is one w=\r\nithout a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in \n&gt; &gt;this universe. Who else is th=\r\nere besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other \n&gt; &gt;Mahavakyas of the Up=\r\nanishads and reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I=\r\n advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional \n&gt; &gt;lang=\r\nuage is because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are \n&gt; &gt;p=\r\nossible only when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as a=\r\nn Advaitic \n&gt; &gt;and Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred m=\r\nyth. However Sri Sri \n&gt; &gt;Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as t=\r\nhe Veda Samhita, especially \n&gt; &gt;the four hymns. In that regard all the appl=\r\nications of Veda mantras or the Veda \n&gt; &gt;Samhita are equally possible with =\r\nSri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of \n&gt; &gt;Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is =\r\nacquainted with the original Vedic method will \n&gt; &gt;straightaway identify th=\r\nat Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even \n&gt; &gt;the worship of th=\r\ne Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED \n&gt; &gt;from a one =\r\non one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just a=\r\ns some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere =\r\nto the \n&gt; &gt;Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It =\r\nis this \n&gt; &gt;particular approach that needs initiation as per its own princi=\r\nples. Initiation \n&gt; &gt;is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Vi=\r\nveka and Vichara, or the \n&gt; &gt;Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even th=\r\ne Pauranic approach of reading the \n&gt; &gt;text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewi=\r\nse Homam too is not required if one is not \n&gt; &gt;inclined to the predominantl=\r\ny Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit \n&gt; &gt;from any or all of =\r\nthese approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear \n&gt; &gt;in mind tha=\r\nt the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as \n&gt; &gt;Sriku=\r\nla as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation=\r\n for \n&gt; &gt;those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summar=\r\ny, one can make spiritual progress through any of the \n&gt; &gt;merthods/practice=\r\ns using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, \n&gt; &gt;Iswarapranidhana, A=\r\nbhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are \n&gt; &gt;all effecti=\r\nve. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., \n&gt; &gt;som=\r\ne of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. O=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt;may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spirit=\r\nual life. \n&gt; &gt;However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA in=\r\nvolves Mantra \n&gt; &gt;diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answ=\r\ner to the question has \n&gt; &gt;to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally one last =\r\nword. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and \n&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA are =\r\nthe most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular \n&gt; &gt;self-stu=\r\ndy of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;This is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya=\r\n is the \n&gt; &gt;alternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is no=\r\nt possible. It is \n&gt; &gt;Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to mak=\r\ne rapid progress in \n&gt; &gt;spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare e=\r\nxalted state by virtue of \n&gt; &gt;serving, listening to and spending time in th=\r\ne company of sadhus and sants in \n&gt; &gt;his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanad=\r\neva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in \n&gt; &gt;their spiritual lives after t=\r\nhey attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, \n&gt; &gt;Nivrittinath and Matsyendran=\r\nath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Sat=\r\nsangha nowadays, I will just \n&gt; &gt;quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There=\r\n is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no good \n&gt; &gt;Mahatma=\r\ns. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of supply \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at once. Th=\r\nis is \n&gt; &gt;the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you will=\r\n find your \n&gt; &gt;Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, yo=\r\nur mind is full of \n&gt; &gt;passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit fo=\r\nr higher divine life. You \n&gt; &gt;waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, w=\r\norldly talks. You have become a \n&gt; &gt;hopeless slave of passion, greed, and n=\r\name and fame.

However, one=\r\n without a rich father is still better off opening a bank \n&gt; &gt;account with =\r\na zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. \n&gt; &gt;Simi=\r\nlarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (=\r\nnot as a \n&gt; &gt;formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, =\r\njust go ahead and \n&gt; &gt;do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are u=\r\nsed for two purposes - (i) for getting \n&gt; &gt;specific material results and (i=\r\ni) as tools of increasing surrender and making \n&gt; &gt;spiritual progress. In t=\r\nhe case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, \n&gt; &gt;in the case of =\r\n(i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. \n&gt; &gt;One ca=\r\nn get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several time=\r\ns, there are very few people who can do (i) \n&gt; &gt;now-a-days. Nature has dest=\r\nabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali \n&gt; &gt;progressed. I suggest =\r\ndoing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, \n&gt; &gt;getting whatev=\r\ner material results god wants to give and making spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress. If=\r\n one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material \n&gt; &gt;results (=\r\nfor oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3=\r\n) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not=\r\n know \n&gt; &gt;how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any mate=\r\nrial results or \n&gt; &gt;spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires=\r\n. I will accept whatever \n&gt; &gt;god gives. I want to increase my devotion and =\r\nsurrender and make spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation i=\r\ns not required. That attitude itself \n&gt; &gt;is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n(4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave =\r\nthis \n&gt; &gt;analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruit=\r\ns from a fruit \n&gt; &gt;basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrie=\r\nve one good fruit from \n&gt; &gt;under them. If the person is gentle, one may do =\r\nit gently and the spillage of \n&gt; &gt;rotten fruits on the floor will be minima=\r\nl. If the person is aggressive, one may \n&gt; &gt;do it fast and there may be mor=\r\ne spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the \n&gt; &gt;good fruit stuck unde=\r\nr the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt;phala of your =\r\nkarmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and \n&gt; &gt;throw=\r\n them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some \n&gt; &gt;sp=\r\nillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time=\r\n to \n&gt; &gt;get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce =\r\ndeity like \n&gt; &gt;Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spilla=\r\nge, but the good \n&gt; &gt;fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, re=\r\nmember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but \n&gt; &gt;fruits of your =\r\nown actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of \n&gt; &gt;those rot=\r\nten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one=\r\n unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is \n&gt; &gt;better off avo=\r\niding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler \n&gt; &gt;deities. I=\r\nf initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before \n&gt; &gt;st=\r\narting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a=\r\n fruit of \n&gt; &gt;your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good r=\r\nesults. If you are \n&gt; &gt;weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took several hours=\r\n to read \n&gt; &gt;Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doin=\r\ng Chandi homam \n&gt; &gt;with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of the=\r\nm have transformed a lot \n&gt; &gt;and have experienced some things too. Obviousl=\r\ny, they have done sadhana with \n&gt; &gt;fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects o=\r\nf Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of igno=\r\nrance and rank materialism, if someone has even a \n&gt; &gt;faint idea that spiri=\r\ntual progress is important, is looking for god and is \n&gt; &gt;attracted to a sp=\r\necific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person \n&gt; &gt;obviously has so=\r\nme good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that \n&gt; &gt;sadhana in t=\r\nhe past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n(7) If you have a good understanding of what is what, how things work, why =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;one should do something, how to do it, what is more important and what =\r\nis less \n&gt; &gt;important, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pat=\r\nhak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal=\r\n opinion that Strong and long standing urge should be \n&gt; &gt;considered as Ini=\r\ntiation at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recit=\r\ne Chandi paatha regularly but was not \n&gt; &gt;able to almost for a year.

This is the \n&gt; best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;exposition of the esoteric=\r\n significance of Chandipath I have seen so \n&gt; &gt;far. I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pleas=\r\ned to share it with all of you.
