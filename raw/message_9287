It means=\r\n a completely divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one po=\r\nornavataras. They are not necessarily &quot;equal&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nTo give a simplisitc =\r\nanalogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount of copper. If one=\r\n jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it contains all the gold in t=\r\nhe world. It only means it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the four=\r\n poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not contain jiv=\r\namsa. It does not mean they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; in cosmos.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn fact, the very notion that any one form can be &quot;th=\r\ne most complete or perfect avatara&quot; or &quot;one that personifies entire divinit=\r\ny of Supreme Being&quot; or &quot;one equal to Supreme Being&quot; is unacceptable and inc=\r\nonsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY form of Supreme Being is l=\r\nike a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like the sky containing all =\r\npossible clouds.\n=C2=A0\nSupreme Being is endowed with infinite qualities. A=\r\nny form contains a finite number of those qualities. So no form can be &quot;equ=\r\nal to&quot; Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in that regard.\n=C2=A0\nIf one f=\r\norm is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and others are not, you can conclude that t=\r\nhat form is &quot;the best&quot;. If neither form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being, how ca=\r\nn you really compare the different qualities of two forms?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, this renders your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether =\r\nthat line refers to Krishna alone or not is irrelevant, for, in either case=\r\n, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; cannot mean &quot;a personification of the entirety of supre=\r\nme being&quot;. Before you wonder whether it refers to Krishna alone or not, fir=\r\nst figure out what &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; actually means, in a way that is not i=\r\nnconsistent with verses that follow! If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being=\r\n and every form is a &quot;subset&quot; of supreme being (like a cloud in sky), what =\r\nis the meaning of &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot;???\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegard=\r\ning (4), Parasara identified 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, an=\r\nd identified the source of divinity in each of them. He only gave objective=\r\n information and did not give any subjective judgment on who is the best, w=\r\nhich Suta apparently did.\n=C2=A0\nI have not read BV Purana. If you can quot=\r\ne some verses before and after, I can comment. Any comparison between avata=\r\nras WILL have to be under some subjective context. I don&#39;t know the context=\r\n of Suta&#39;s statement you allude to.\n=C2=A0\nThough any comparison is subject=\r\nive, I will be surprised if someone considers the other two poornavataras o=\r\nf Vishnu as the &quot;best&quot; avataras. But, I will not be surprised if different =\r\npeople consider Rama and Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon=\r\n are the luminaries and show soul and mind, which clearly have a primary si=\r\ngnificance compared to other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna =\r\nare bound to be seen as the best by different people. However, what Suta ap=\r\nparently said can only be a subjective view under some context.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding (2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16=\r\n phases (representing 16 tithis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun =\r\nhas only one phase - he is always full and bright!\n=C2=A0\nJust like Moon, m=\r\nind has many moods, even a perfected one. A perfected mind goes through tho=\r\nse moods with full awareness of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mi=\r\nnd experiences them under delusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to ha=\r\nve variations. Sun/soul OTOH has no such variations.\n=C2=A0\nKrishna may sho=\r\nw Vishwaroopa oneday, run away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandh=\r\na), do amazing miracles oneday and play clever tricks another day. There is=\r\n a lot more variety to his personality than Rama&#39;s. Now, does that make him=\r\n better or worse than Rama? Well, that is a *subjective* matter.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is pre=\r\nsent in several beings such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. =\r\nGrahas sustain the world appearance in consciousness by grasping it based o=\r\nn karmaphala. So they stand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain =\r\nthe world appearance. So Vishnu&#39;s avataras are associated with grahas. But =\r\nPararsara said that avataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in s=\r\neveral other beings (e.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunate=\r\nly, we have meagre understanding what various deities stand for, what force=\r\ns play a role in creating, sustaining and destroying the world appearance i=\r\nn consciousness. People talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there=\r\n is hardly any understanding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we =\r\nthink in terms of superficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to wh=\r\nat happens in consciousness.\n=C2=A0\nMohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Mahes=\r\nhwari. Nara & Narayana were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu =\r\n+ Shiva). I don&#39;t know about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatrey=\r\na again was an incarnation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incar=\r\nnation of great serpent Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).\n=C2=A0\nWe need to go de=\r\neper into what they all stand for esoterically and what role they play in t=\r\nhe functioning of consciousness, to understand this more. Hopefully another=\r\n day..\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAdwaitins who are skeptical about noti=\r\nons taught by Parasara (paramatmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of para=\r\nmtmamsa etc) should realize one thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not c=\r\nome from Brahman in one step. It all evolved in many steps and correspondin=\r\ngly there are some steps in the process of liberation!\n=C2=A0\nIf a characte=\r\nr in my dream tonight overcomes its conditioning in the dream, it will simp=\r\nly merge back into my mind and not into Brahman yet. Of course, it cannot d=\r\no even that until I actually will it. It is after all a character created a=\r\nnd sustained in my mind!\n=C2=A0\nSame thing applies to us!\n=C2=A0\nVedanta is=\r\n not wrong. But it is relevant and applicable at &quot;anta&quot;, i.e. the end.

All of them are men=\r\ntioned as Avataras of the Supreme Being in SB.\n&gt;\n&gt;2. What is your opinion a=\r\nbout the general stated idea that only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others =\r\nare not?\n&gt;\n&gt;3. That the SB mentions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with resp=\r\nect to the previous sloka where it says that all rishis, munis etc are also=\r\n Avataras, is one interpretation, and not too popular at that. OTOH, most o=\r\nf the great commentators, and they were no less in their spiritual merit\n o=\r\nr intellectual prowess have taken that specific verse to mean Krshna to be =\r\ngreater than ALL Avataras. The verse itself does not mention that it is wit=\r\nh respect to the previous verse, or with respect to all the 17 verses that =\r\nprecede it, which lists all Avataras. So it boils down to interpretation ba=\r\nsed on individual conditioning. It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavachary=\r\na, Nimbarka, etc all shared a similar conditioning which made them read tha=\r\nt verse to mean that only Krshna is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this=\r\n conclusion? :) \n&gt;\n&gt;4. Apparently in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells=\r\n the Rishis of Naimisharanya that Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all.

I am just doing a thinkin=\r\ng aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the co=\r\nnception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with un=\r\nlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came=\r\n into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krsh=\r\nna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=\r\n=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata relig=\r\nion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All th=\r\ne major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Val=\r\nlavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhanesh=\r\nwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - conside=\r\nred, (with differing nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, =\r\nmoksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This w=\r\nas aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, t=\r\nhat is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n=\r\n like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal v=\r\niew of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless P=\r\naramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama=\r\n was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the =\r\nearlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nWhatever the case maybe, each school had its own set of established saints =\r\nand scholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation,=\r\n which is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditio=\r\nnings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;We=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. When=\r\never an Avatar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who ap=\r\npear after the Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the l=\r\nast Avatara=C2=A0because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra o=\r\nf those times, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=\r\n=A0way beyond=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continue=\r\ns until the next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama=\r\n, and before Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world=\r\n at large remained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In this =\r\nlight Krshna is the Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he wil=\r\nl be invarible accompanied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara come=\r\ns with his coterie of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of=\r\n the Avatara to the general masses - who will then create new scriptures an=\r\nd Kalki will be looked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutionary p=\r\narable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these set of A=\r\nvatara, from the whole list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the po=\r\npular imagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spiri=\r\ntuality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the li=\r\nst of 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to con=\r\nsider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also =\r\ncame from them, which was basically exploring=C2=A0cronologically all these=\r\n nine chakras one after the other by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=C2=\r\n=A0represent the essential nature of each chakra. All these make me more sa=\r\nnguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which cas=\r\ne Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you rightly poin=\r\nted out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if logic is=\r\n the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=C2=A0his philo=\r\nsophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it cannot be denied th=\r\nat=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the sharpest and most logical=\r\n of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical mind=C2=A0is beyond=\r\n doubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed himself to be an Avatara=\r\n. Neither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and=\r\n the former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual=\r\n impact on the world is no less than that of the=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstre=\r\nam=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it not been for the inv=\r\naluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=C2=A0the awai=\r\nted=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been able to absorb=\r\n the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip on I=\r\nndia. Buddhism\n barely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;All this t=\r\naken together, make me more and more convinced that there are 9 evolutionar=\r\ny Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;A little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it=\r\n is not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find ext=\r\nremely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was=\r\n to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment h=\r\ne could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to hi=\r\ns army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean =\r\nallow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill wa=\r\ns not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=C2=\r\n=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful warr=\r\nior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, no=\r\nt letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a moment is an amaz=\r\ning phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplati=\r\non, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some f=\r\norm of power or influence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no ma=\r\nlice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was th=\r\ne very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningn=\r\ness are impossible.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he=\r\n has learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only =\r\nfollow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemen=\r\ntly. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna =\r\nof Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Gur=\r\nu who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in t=\r\nhe Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all th=\r\nrough his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under a=\r\nll circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes=\r\n me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something l=\r\nike this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from=\r\n everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He =\r\nhad not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his w=\r\nife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had zero=C2=\r\n=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents fro=\r\nm Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he=\r\n forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gr=\r\neat war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed R=\r\nama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0=\r\nBalarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshn=\r\na. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they d=\r\noing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their v=\r\nillage in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will =\r\nunderstand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, =\r\nwith perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false prais=\r\nes, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I=\r\n am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n wo=\r\nrship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single =\r\nsadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kin=\r\nd of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from =\r\nthe world or actively performing a larger dharma.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I started ap=\r\npreciating Swami Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Ava=\r\ntara. That was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middl=\r\ne of a circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admire=\r\nrs and on the other bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=\r\n=A0right upto the=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of tha=\r\nt affected him to any great degree. He faced terrific racism in the America=\r\n, yet not a single speech of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness=\r\n, anger, or negativity. That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with you, Narasimha, for most of us it is better to=C2=A0try=\r\n to=C2=A0mould ones life=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selflessness th=\r\nat Rama showed all along.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more importan=\r\ntly study=C2=A0his life and imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possible, the q=\r\nuality he represented.=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Realit=\r\ny - Shiva - will fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some futur=\r\ne life, in some later birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna show=\r\ned, unattached and unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up.

Though 9 main avataras =\r\nof Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras als=\r\no descended on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and=\r\n jivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas!

Just a speculation..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avatara=\r\ns, the theory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because\n=\r\n &quot;perfection&quot; occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from =\r\nmain scriptures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not com=\r\ne yet).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Rather than &quot;evolution&quot;, i=\r\nt is a matter of what the world needs at that time. If people at the beginn=\r\ning of Satya yuga are established in Self always and the only issue is that=\r\n a small attachment may develop now and then, disturbing that state of bein=\r\ng established in Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciou=\r\nsness that is relevant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it rem=\r\noves that attachment and takes one back to being established in Self. So an=\r\n avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective conscio=\r\nusness became denser, being established in Self became less natural and mor=\r\ne effort was needed. So the &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and\n hard-work=\r\n&quot; (Saturn) became relevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred.=\r\n And so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds woul=\r\ndn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self be=\r\ncame an unnatural, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit o=\r\nf comprehension&quot; (Mercury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mer=\r\ncury occurred and tried to explain being established in Self as a comprehen=\r\nsible notion, so that rational minds of that age would accept it to an exte=\r\nnt and attempt it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collec=\r\ntive consciousness. Of course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different sta=\r\nte from the collective consciousness of that time, the current avatara may =\r\nnot be relevant to one.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I respe=\r\nct Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I am\n awestruck by Krishna and =\r\nworship him, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneda=\r\ny. In fact, I recommend the approach to others.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Though I said =\r\nRama and Krishna are almost the same, there is a difference between soul an=\r\nd perfected mind.

It=C2=A0dea=\r\nls with the idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=\r\n=C2=A0It also=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as t=\r\nhe 10 in its list of 22.

Infact, in=\r\n the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, t=\r\nhis One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation of concept=\r\nion. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and am=\r\nong the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentione=\r\nd in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; i=\r\nn your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wron=\r\ng and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A=\r\ns I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea o=\r\nf 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link=\r\n to grahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in co=\r\nmbination, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else =\r\nin this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corres=\r\nponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is =\r\nnot a graha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that unt=\r\nil an Avatara actually descends on the earth, his energy and his force cann=\r\not be attributed to any graha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures thi=\r\nngs completely? We can only know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/j=\r\nyotish at all.

It is under THA=\r\nT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, whi=\r\nle Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alon=\r\ne* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say that a=\r\nll these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsar=\r\na explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mea=\r\nn if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says=\r\n in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and =\r\nof the\n nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the q=\r\nualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to =\r\nclouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond =\r\nthem, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what i=\r\ns the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himsel=\r\nf&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fa=\r\nncies and conditioning..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma=\r\n (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter p=\r\nortion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great =\r\navataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras d=\r\nescend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishn=\r\na are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are entirely=\r\n divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;en=\r\ntire\n divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can con=\r\ntain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the =\r\ndivine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual f=\r\norce in this world. But I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evoluti=\r\nonary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static rea=\r\nlization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in =\r\nSB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in you=\r\nr &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and=\r\n avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Se=\r\ncondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies log=\r\nical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n =\r\nand its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected s=\r\npirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality comp=\r\nletely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Inc=\r\nomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doi=\r\nng. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this K=\r\nali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this w=\r\norld in this age.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dis=\r\nmiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, ar=\r\ne you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect?=\r\n (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking some SB ver=\r\nses and ignoring some as\n I\n showed!.)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottomline as far=\r\n as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly cohere=\r\nnt esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha =\r\n- spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus=\r\n - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES hav=\r\ne a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoteri=\r\ncally is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notion=\r\ns in them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw =\r\nlopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one a=\r\nnd other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;sup=\r\nreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali=\r\n, being Aadyaa, is superior\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned =\r\nyogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures eve=\r\nn prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference betw=\r\neen them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing=\r\n some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecti=\r\nng their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=\r\n=C2=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If w=\r\ne think about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and=\r\n soul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not really that different. =\r\nSo I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different, though the specific=\r\ns of their stories may be different.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One last word though. I=\r\nf someone truly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Kris=\r\nhna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are m=\r\nore for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries o=\r\nf understanding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the s=\r\nhort run. In the end, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycl=\r\nes of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one =\r\nstarts grasping some fistfuls of Reality.

Let me write down as I see it, in point=\r\n by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a l=\r\nist of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd=\r\n Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa D=\r\neva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu menti=\r\non that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa say=\r\ns all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being=\r\n while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various po=\r\nssible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded speci=\r\nal mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, spec=\r\nially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When =\r\nKrshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed =\r\nthe full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. A=\r\nll Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali=\r\n-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed=\r\n sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashur=\r\nama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection=\r\n of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life =\r\non earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the ha=\r\nlf-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately=\r\n takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Ra=\r\njashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna=\r\n Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates th=\r\nat spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progres=\r\nsive realization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inher=\r\nent in the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. La=\r\nrger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s =\r\ngrand design for life on\n earth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc contex=\r\nt, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not =\r\nmy contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain =\r\nto a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmolo=\r\ngy in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. A=\r\nnd each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and=\r\n can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they =\r\nrepresent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which socie=\r\nty can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the sta=\r\nge of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how=\r\n to transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a c=\r\nonstructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full S=\r\nattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it i=\r\ns static in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As =\r\nper the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita i=\r\nn the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana=\r\n, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the =\r\nSun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dis=\r\npassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n was the=\r\n Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma =\r\nof that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic,=\r\n and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the thin=\r\ngs as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his =\r\nown preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama fa=\r\nced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most disp=\r\nassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passio=\r\nns can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader =\r\nmust be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I a=\r\nm not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular =\r\nand constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, fro=\r\nm circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leav=\r\ne Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,\n his village=\r\n-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for h=\r\nim to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village lif=\r\ne and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason =\r\nwith them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he wi=\r\nll return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, =\r\nmuch later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their d=\r\nance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and p=\r\nossessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that=\r\n he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. =\r\nWhen Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on th=\r\ne floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swif=\r\ntly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurish=\r\nrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist\n and charlatan, Krshn=\r\na did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another=\r\n black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in =\r\nthe assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next=\r\n moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharat=\r\na is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of dep=\r\nression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective o=\r\nf what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the grea=\r\ntest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual=\r\n philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For=\r\n a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. N=\r\neither the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When running aw=\r\nay from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema=\r\n to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n to hit Duryodhana below the=\r\n waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine I=\r\nntuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would caus=\r\ne the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by th=\r\ne rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously con=\r\nnected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situati=\r\nons in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we=\r\n take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we =\r\nget a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demo=\r\nn attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakt=\r\ni and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we tak=\r\ne only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very c=\r\nlear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the=\r\n great characteristics of satwa, chief\n of which is self-control, as well a=\r\ns the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, =\r\nat least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creat=\r\nes a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken=\r\n. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man=\r\n, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected =\r\nany trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most t=\r\nrying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I =\r\ndo not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, =\r\nthe one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is cl=\r\nearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with wh=\r\nat either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If nega=\r\ntion of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars=\r\n at crucial stages of\n evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on=\r\n masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zo=\r\nrathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in th=\r\ne scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a =\r\nmost logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of Indi=\r\na, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and=\r\n holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as insi=\r\nde of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual phil=\r\nosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence=\r\n and realization. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to ment=\r\nion 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the h=\r\numan body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. =\r\nIt is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond=\r\n to the full\n power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 g=\r\nrahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to=\r\n explore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The l=\r\nagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who =\r\nrepresent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the=\r\n sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typicall=\r\ny represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my =\r\nbelief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-ro=\r\noted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-=\r\nYuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be =\r\nKalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - th=\r\ne stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the =\r\nAtmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and comple=\r\nte\n purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint=\r\n of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this worl=\r\nd and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at vario=\r\nus points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, w=\r\non&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will =\r\nbe the only one capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruption=\r\ns that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It=\r\n is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine n=\r\now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto =\r\nmamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Prev=\r\nious Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like=\r\n going back from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avatars ma=\r\nnifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 I want to emphatically disa=\r\ngree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spiritual=\r\nity..upto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Each avatara represents an=\r\n aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. =C2=A0 Maharshi Parasara equated da=\r\nsavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, M=\r\noon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercu=\r\nry, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, min=\r\nd, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit =\r\nof enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,\n spirit of innovation/breaki=\r\nng barriers and detachment (respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, each ava=\r\ntara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each s=\r\ntory is an example of how that aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is=\r\n a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfec=\r\nted example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected exampl=\r\ne of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfec=\r\nted example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, ener=\r\ngy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/=\r\npatience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. H=\r\nowever, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different qu=\r\nalities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them. =C2=\r\n=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfect ot=\r\nher aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end=\r\n. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and =\r\nare in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=\r\n=A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story that =\r\ndemonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of m=\r\nind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is =\r\nfascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrates =\r\nhow wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and subj=\r\nective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama and K=\r\nrishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, =\r\nbecause of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has no ag=\r\nendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existence =\r\nwith some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousness =\r\nstemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and s=\r\nupport to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, ene=\r\nrgy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports t=\r\nhem fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impa=\r\nssionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that La=\r\nws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full awa=\r\nreness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As m=\r\nind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the not=\r\nion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports them=\r\n fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionately.=\r\n =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionali=\r\nty of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting=\r\n enough\n to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and ag=\r\nendas.
