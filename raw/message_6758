And f=\r\nor the creator of this world there is nothing that is \nseparate from him. e=\r\nverything in world resides in him and he is the shiva (the \nmeaning of shiv=\r\na is &quot;shubha&quot; the elders sometimes bless as &#39;shivamastu&#39; - just \nlike that =\r\nof &#39;shubhamastu&quot; and the great lord is also called in his sahasranama \nas &quot;=\r\nshivaashrayaaya&quot; he is the one in whom the shiva or shubha has ashraya or \n=\r\nresidence. ( i. e. by  going to his ashraya you get the shiva that is shubh=\r\na ). \nSo there was nothing like any amangala that would have existed by his=\r\n presence \nin that yajna, but it was just that Daksha needed to learn some =\r\nlesson hence \nsupreme lord made him go high with his ahamkara and learn som=\r\ne lesson out of it.\n\nb) the so called bhuta ganas and rakshasas and devils =\r\nalso have their own role \nto play in this universe. they are also part of t=\r\nhis and not separate from it. \nmore or less every being&#39;s lives are interwo=\r\nven with all such elements and \nenergies.

It is lethal, catastrophic mistake and will \n&gt; destroy equili=\r\nbrium\n&gt; of the cosmos.\n\nMy friend, you have some weird notions. Agni permea=\r\ntes the 14 worlds and \nis responsible for their smooth running. He can take=\r\n your offering \nanywhere and not just to &quot;heaven&quot;. In homam/yajna, we make =\r\nofferings to \nvarious beings living in various worlds. For example, in jaya=\r\ndi homam \ndone at the end of various homas, we make offerings to pitris, pa=\r\nrvatas, \nbhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.\n\nSecondly, to one who sees Shiva as=\r\n the supreme being, Shiva does not \n&quot;live in&quot; one place, but he is the unde=\r\nrlying reality of everything.\n\nThough Shiva is depicted as living in smasha=\r\nna (cemetary) with spirits, \nit has esoteric significance. I elaborated thi=\r\ns in a Sanskrit shloka I \ncomposed just a few days back and you can read it=\r\n, its meaning and \ncommentary at that: \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom/message/6719\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleas=\r\ned with homa of any kind or any type. \n&gt; Not a single\n&gt; scriptural referenc=\r\ne could be found out\n\nParasara mentioned making offerings to Shiva in fire =\r\nwith &quot;tryambakam \nyajaamahe&quot; mantra (Mrityunjaya mantra) as a remedy to sev=\r\neral horoscopic \nproblems!!\n\nVishnu Dharmottara Purana mentioned Rudra Yajn=\r\na. Agni Purana also \nmentioned Rudra homam. Mrityunjaya homam to Shiva with=\r\n Mrityunjaya \nmantra is also mentioned and popular in tradition.\n\n*        =\r\n*        *\n\n&gt; However there are many references in purans that Lord Shiva w=\r\nas not \n&gt; invited to\n&gt; fire sacrifice conducted by Duksha Prajapati.\n\nIn an=\r\ny homam, the final offerings made are those to Vishnu and Rudra, \nirrespect=\r\nive of what homam it is. What Daksha did was to break the rules \nby doing a=\r\n &quot;Nirishwara yajna&quot;. He was trying to insult Shiva and he paid \nfor it. It =\r\nis foolish to take his foolish act as an example to conclude \nthat offering=\r\ns should not be made to Shiva in fire.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Shiva homa i=\r\ns absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All those \n&gt; who perform\n&gt; =\r\nsuch irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTED BY EVERYONE.\n\nIf yo=\r\nu think it is &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;, please do not do it! Do homam to \nGanapa=\r\nthi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody \nelse. Or d=\r\non&#39;t do homam at all if you please.\n\nBTW, I personally know people doing ho=\r\nmam to Shiva and making brisk \nspiritual progress.\n\nIf you really want to &quot;=\r\ninsult and reject&quot; someone, you will be better \noff picking someone killing=\r\n and raping in the name of god or spreading \nintolerance and hatred in the =\r\nname of god and religion. Or people \nengaging in so many worse evils on ear=\r\nth today. Why target poor people \nworshipping Shiva in fire!\n\n*        *   =\r\n     *\n\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself=\r\n from \n&gt; self titled\n&gt; kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes to y=\r\nou is not a true \n&gt; guru. Don&#39;t\n&gt; fall pray to marketing.\n\nJust for the rec=\r\nord, I do not consider myself a guru. If someone \nvoluntarily (and mentally=\r\n) considers me a guru for the purpose of \nperforming homam, I do not mind i=\r\nt. However, my main role is not to be a \nguru, but to show people their gur=\r\nu. Let me elaborate.\n\nPeople who have access to a good external guru to giv=\r\ne a push to one&#39;s \nspiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Otherwise=\r\n, I am giving \nthem access to a superb external guru who will remain on ear=\r\nth in a \nphysical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), the origin=\r\nal \npreceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life=\r\n \nas your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him everyday \nwi=\r\nth reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the correct \ndir=\r\nection. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you \nfor =\r\nbetter.\n\nAnd, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don&#39;t worry about &quot;falling pr=\r\ney to \nmarketing&quot;. Try homam if you want to and continue if you like it. \nP=\r\neriod.

In \n&gt; this yuga tamo guna exists in =\r\npredominance and sattva exists in very \n&gt; marginal potency. As is it imposs=\r\nible to see anything in darkness, \n&gt; people in kali yuga engage themselves =\r\nin all kind of stupid and \n&gt; foolish things since these their intellect is =\r\nblinded by the kalyugi \n&gt; darkness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Things like erecting huge buildings=\r\n which are destined to be shattered \n&gt; and ruined by natural calamities are=\r\n being considered as object of \n&gt; pride. Even people feel proud to create w=\r\neapons which are capable of \n&gt; destroying whole humanity within fractions o=\r\nf seconds. If one wants to \n&gt; be proud of anything be proud of an achieveme=\r\nnt which is not destined \n&gt; to be devastated by eternal time.\n&gt;\n&gt; People ar=\r\ne digging deep into earth to set free all evil sprits \n&gt; sleeping in deep r=\r\nealms of hell and using it as fuel as the cost of \n&gt; bringing hell on earth=\r\n. To compensate for the loss these people have \n&gt; come up with a solution o=\r\nf wearing black, consuming alcohol, tobacco, \n&gt; tea, coffee, chocolate and =\r\nother such products.\n&gt;\n&gt; Degenerated intellect has bring us to verge in the=\r\n history that some \n&gt; people are promoting SHIVA HOMA since years and no on=\r\ne of these so \n&gt; called intellectual, scholars and people with wisdom (if a=\r\nnyone left) \n&gt; is coming forward and asking to stop this irreligious practi=\r\nce.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s very unfortunate that people with no knowledge and understandi=\r\nng \n&gt; of divinity are promoting their irreligious believes without doing an=\r\ny \n&gt; research of ancient Indian scriptures and gullible people are easily \n=\r\n&gt; falling pray, more pathetic is that no one is coming forward and say \n&gt; t=\r\nhat stop this nonsense.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of a=\r\nny kind or any type. \n&gt; Not a single scriptural reference could be found ou=\r\nt where nativity \n&gt; performs Shiva homa to please lord Shiva.

It is lethal, catastrophic mistake \n&gt; and=\r\n will destroy equilibrium of the cosmos.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva lives in Kalasha pa=\r\nrvata and the only way to reach it to \n&gt; try to offer flowers, raw milk, fr=\r\nuits and sweets to shiva lingam. \n&gt; Performing rudrabhishakam is the only c=\r\norrect way to please lord \n&gt; shiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even in Ramayana lord Rama tries to=\r\n please lord Shiva by worshiping to \n&gt; Shiva lingam. Why didn&#39;t he perform =\r\nhoma?\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All tho=\r\nse \n&gt; who perform such irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTED B=\r\nY \n&gt; EVERYONE.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is good if someone is promoting vedic tradition of ho=\r\nmam but before \n&gt; doing so one must properly read religious scripture to un=\r\nderstand that \n&gt; which deity can be pleased by performing homa. One should =\r\nalso \n&gt; understand that since pure cow ghee is not easily available and it&#39;=\r\ns \n&gt; rare to find any people with fully activated Pingala nadi; any homam \n=\r\n&gt; will not yield satisfactory results. Purity of material offered into \n&gt; h=\r\noma and purity of the person performing the homa is essential.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a per=\r\nson accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perform homa \n&gt; will only exp=\r\nerience malefic results same is true if homam is \n&gt; performed with adultera=\r\nted butter.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a person not corrupted by vice perform homam with pure c=\r\now ghee and \n&gt; tries to please deities living in heaven such as indra, varu=\r\nna, soma, \n&gt; agni, prajapati etc then such a native is equivalent(or will s=\r\noon \n&gt; become) to demigods.\n&gt;\n&gt; Same is true for a brahmachari or a yogi wh=\r\no perform internal homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spiritu=\r\nal practices should be \n&gt; followed under the guidance of a bonafide guru. A=\r\n native without a \n&gt; capable guru is like god without power.\n&gt; One should c=\r\nonsider himself as luck if he is able to save himself from \n&gt; self titled k=\r\nalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes to you is \n&gt; not a true guru=\r\n. Don&#39;t fall pray to marketing.\n&gt;  Its rare fortune, that native found a tr=\r\nue guru.

( i. e. by &nbsp;going to his as=\r\nhraya you get the shiva that is shubha ). So there was nothing like any ama=\r\nngala that would have existed by his presence in that yajna, but it was jus=\r\nt that Daksha needed to learn some lesson hence supreme lord made him go hi=\r\ngh with his ahamkara and learn some lesson out of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;b) the so called bhuta ganas and rakshasas and devils also have their o=\r\nwn role to play in this universe. they are also part of this and not separa=\r\nte from it. more or less every being&#39;s lives are&nbsp;interwoven&nbsp;with =\r\nall such elements and\n energies.

It is lethal, catastrophic=\r\n mistake and will &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; destroy equilibrium&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of the cosmos.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nMy friend, you have some weird notions. Agni permeates the 14 worlds =\r\nand &lt;br&gt;\nis responsible for their smooth running. He can take your offering=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nanywhere and not just to &quot;heaven&quot;. In homam/yajna, we make offerings =\r\nto &lt;br&gt;\nvarious beings living in various worlds. For example, in jayadi hom=\r\nam &lt;br&gt;\ndone at the end of various homas, we make offerings to pitris, parv=\r\natas, &lt;br&gt;\nbhutas, samudras, yakshas etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSecondly, to one who see=\r\ns Shiva as the supreme being, Shiva does not &lt;br&gt;\n&quot;live in&quot; one place, but =\r\nhe is the underlying reality of everything.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThough Shiva is depict=\r\ned as living in smashana (cemetary) with spirits, &lt;br&gt;\nit has esoteric sign=\r\nificance. I elaborated this in a Sanskrit shloka I &lt;br&gt;\ncomposed just a few=\r\n days back and you can read it, its meaning and &lt;br&gt;\ncommentary at that: &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom/message/6719&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/m=\r\nessage/6719&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva is ne=\r\nver ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Not a single&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; scriptural reference could be found out&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nParasara mentione=\r\nd making offerings to Shiva in fire with &quot;tryambakam &lt;br&gt;\nyajaamahe&quot; mantra=\r\n (Mrityunjaya mantra) as a remedy to several horoscopic &lt;br&gt;\nproblems!!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nVishnu Dharmottara Purana mentioned Rudra Yajna. Agni Purana also &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nmentioned Rudra homam. Mrityunjaya homam to Shiva with Mrityunjaya &lt;br&gt;\nm=\r\nantra is also mentioned and popular in tradition.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *      =\r\n  *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; However there are many references in purans that Lord Shi=\r\nva was not &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; invited to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fire sacrifice conducted by Duksha=\r\n Prajapati.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn any homam, the final offerings made are those to Vi=\r\nshnu and Rudra, &lt;br&gt;\nirrespective of what homam it is. What Daksha did was =\r\nto break the rules &lt;br&gt;\nby doing a &quot;Nirishwara yajna&quot;. He was trying to ins=\r\nult Shiva and he paid &lt;br&gt;\nfor it. It is foolish to take his foolish act as=\r\n an example to conclude &lt;br&gt;\nthat offerings should not be made to Shiva in =\r\nfire.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute non=\r\nsense. I condemned it completely. All those &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who perform&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nsuch irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTED BY EVERYONE.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nIf you think it is &quot;absolute nonsense&quot;, please do not do it! Do homam to=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nGanapathi, Lakshmi, Vishnu, Shiva, Krishna, Chandi etc. Pick somebody=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\nelse. Or don&#39;t do homam at all if you please.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBTW, I persona=\r\nlly know people doing homam to Shiva and making brisk &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progre=\r\nss.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf you really want to &quot;insult and reject&quot; someone, you will be=\r\n better &lt;br&gt;\noff picking someone killing and raping in the name of god or s=\r\npreading &lt;br&gt;\nintolerance and hatred in the name of god and religion. Or pe=\r\nople &lt;br&gt;\nengaging in so many worse evils on earth today. Why target poor p=\r\neople &lt;br&gt;\nworshipping Shiva in fire!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself fro=\r\nm &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; self titled&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who =\r\ncomes to you is not a true &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guru. Don&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fall pray to mark=\r\neting.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nJust for the record, I do not consider myself a guru. If so=\r\nmeone &lt;br&gt;\nvoluntarily (and mentally) considers me a guru for the purpose o=\r\nf &lt;br&gt;\nperforming homam, I do not mind it. However, my main role is not to =\r\nbe a &lt;br&gt;\nguru, but to show people their guru. Let me elaborate.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nP=\r\neople who have access to a good external guru to give a push to one&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nspiritual progress, they may follow that guru. Otherwise, I am giving &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nthem access to a superb external guru who will remain on earth in a &lt;br&gt;\nph=\r\nysical form even after you and I leave - Agni (Fire), the original &lt;br&gt;\npre=\r\nceptor, guru, priest and purohit of Veda! Invite Agni into your life &lt;br&gt;\na=\r\ns your guru and purohit and spend some sacred time with him everyday &lt;br&gt;\nw=\r\nith reverence. He will transform you from the core and show the correct &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\ndirection. I am not a guru, but I can show you a guru who can change you =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nfor better.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd, BTW, I do not sell ANYTHING. So don&#39;t worry =\r\nabout &quot;falling prey to &lt;br&gt;\nmarketing&quot;. Try homam if you want to and contin=\r\nue if you like it. &lt;br&gt;\nPeriod. No strings attached.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n  =\r\n                 &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that=\r\n make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a =\r\nrel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish w=\r\nritings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;A=\r\nrun Yadav&quot; &lt;aruninthecity@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jai Shre=\r\ne Rama,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear List,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I usually talk about=\r\n the degeneration of intellect in kali yuga. In &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; this yuga tamo gu=\r\nna exists in predominance and sattva exists in very &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; marginal pote=\r\nncy. As is it impossible to see anything in darkness, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people in k=\r\nali yuga engage themselves in all kind of stupid and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; foolish thin=\r\ngs since these their intellect is blinded by the kalyugi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; darkness=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Things like erecting huge buildings which are destined =\r\nto be shattered &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and ruined by natural calamities are being consid=\r\nered as object of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; pride. Even people feel proud to create weapons=\r\n which are capable of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; destroying whole humanity within fractions =\r\nof seconds. If one wants to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; be proud of anything be proud of an a=\r\nchievement which is not destined &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to be devastated by eternal time=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; People are digging deep into earth to set free all evil=\r\n sprits &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sleeping in deep realms of hell and using it as fuel as t=\r\nhe cost of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bringing hell on earth. To compensate for the loss the=\r\nse people have &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; come up with a solution of wearing black, consumin=\r\ng alcohol, tobacco, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tea, coffee, chocolate and other such product=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Degenerated intellect has bring us to verge in the his=\r\ntory that some &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people are promoting SHIVA HOMA since years and no=\r\n one of these so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; called intellectual, scholars and people with wi=\r\nsdom (if anyone left) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is coming forward and asking to stop this i=\r\nrreligious practice.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s very unfortunate that people wi=\r\nth no knowledge and understanding &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of divinity are promoting their=\r\n irreligious believes without doing any &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; research of ancient India=\r\nn scriptures and gullible people are easily &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; falling pray, more pa=\r\nthetic is that no one is coming forward and say &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that stop this no=\r\nnsense.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of any=\r\n kind or any type. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Not a single scriptural reference could be fou=\r\nnd out where nativity &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; performs Shiva homa to please lord Shiva. H=\r\nowever there are many &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; references in purans that Lord Shiva was no=\r\nt invited to fire sacrifice &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; conducted by Duksha Prajapati.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; Why is it so?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is so because lord Shiva will be accompanied b=\r\ny his ganas who are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nothing but demons and evil sprits and presen=\r\nce of anything impure &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will destroy the fire sacrifice. Things whi=\r\nch are pure and sacred in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nature are to be offered into homam pit=\r\n since it is believed that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; these things will ultimately reach dev=\r\ntas in heaven and nothing impure &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is ever offered to homam pit.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva didn&#39;t live in heaven; by performing fire sacrif=\r\nice one in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; try to send lord shiva to heaven. It is lethal, catast=\r\nrophic mistake &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and will destroy equilibrium of the cosmos.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lord Shiva lives in Kalasha parvata and the only way to reach i=\r\nt to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; try to offer flowers, raw milk, fruits and sweets to shiva l=\r\ningam. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Performing rudrabhishakam is the only correct way to pleas=\r\ne lord &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; shiva.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Even in Ramayana lord Rama tries =\r\nto please lord Shiva by worshiping to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shiva lingam. Why didn&#39;t he=\r\n perform homa?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it com=\r\npletely. All those &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who perform such irreligious practice will be =\r\nINSULTED AND REJECTED BY &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; EVERYONE.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is good i=\r\nf someone is promoting vedic tradition of homam but before &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doing =\r\nso one must properly read religious scripture to understand that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nwhich deity can be pleased by performing homa. One should also &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; un=\r\nderstand that since pure cow ghee is not easily available and it&#39;s &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; rare to find any people with fully activated Pingala nadi; any homam &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; will not yield satisfactory results. Purity of material offered into =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; homa and purity of the person performing the homa is essential.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If a person accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perf=\r\norm homa &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will only experience malefic results same is true if hom=\r\nam is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; performed with adulterated butter.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If a p=\r\nerson not corrupted by vice perform homam with pure cow ghee and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\ntries to please deities living in heaven such as indra, varuna, soma, &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; agni, prajapati etc then such a native is equivalent(or will soon &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; become) to demigods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Same is true for a brahmachari=\r\n or a yogi who perform internal homam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is said in all =\r\nscriptures that all spiritual practices should be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; followed under =\r\nthe guidance of a bonafide guru. A native without a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; capable guru =\r\nis like god without power.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One should consider himself as luck if =\r\nhe is able to save himself from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; self titled kalyugi gurus. Just r=\r\nemember that one who comes to you is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not a true guru. Don&#39;t fall =\r\npray to marketing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Its rare fortune, that native found a true gur=\r\nu. Before that one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should build a fort strong enough so that one =\r\nnot fall prey to kalyugi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gurus.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Arun&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: black; font-size=\r\n: 10pt; font-family: tahoma, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; position: fixed; &quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-117951088-1309859882=:90069--\r\n\n"}}
