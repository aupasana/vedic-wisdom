The modified version\n&gt; applies a lot to us, fools=\r\n lost in oblivion trying to learn more and\n&gt; more and more theories instead=\r\n of doing sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Quoted with modifications pertaining to Mr God.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;There was a young man, you know, who wanted to reach god/be super\n&gt; si=\r\nddha or something and so he went to this guru. The guru was very very\n&gt; adv=\r\nanced, a legend in his own right. And he told the guru you know I\n&gt; wanna b=\r\ne on the same level you are and the guru said if you wanna be on\n&gt; the same=\r\n level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met you tomorrow at the beach.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the young man go=\r\nt there 4 A.M. he was  all ready to rock n&#39; roll.\n&gt; He was dressed properly=\r\n, but he should have worn shorts. The old man\n&gt; grabs his hand and said: Ho=\r\nw bad do you wanna be successful (basically\n&gt; achieve god, have siddhi and =\r\nthe like, all references to success from\n&gt; hereon now mean uniting with god=\r\n) ? He said: &quot;Real bad&quot;. He\n&gt; said: Walk on out in the water. So he walks o=\r\nut into the water. When he\n&gt; walks out to the water he goes waist deep and =\r\ngoes like this old man is\n&gt; crazy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The young man was thinking , &quot;Hey I=\r\n wanna meet god, achieve siddhi in my\n&gt; sadhana, get out of this birth deat=\r\nh cycle etc. etc. and this foolish\n&gt; old man got me out here swimming. I di=\r\ndn&#39;t ask to be a lifeguard. I\n&gt; wanna meet god he got me in water =96 so th=\r\ne old man said go on a\n&gt; little further =96 the young man walked out a litt=\r\nle further =96\n&gt; then the young man was neck deep in water - the young man =\r\nwas thinking \n&gt; this old man is crazy =96 everybody calls him a paramhansa,=\r\n a\n&gt; mahapurusha, god incarnate but he is definitely crazy. So the old man\n=\r\n&gt; again said go on out a little further =96 the young man went out a\n&gt; litt=\r\nle further, the water was now right at his mouth =96the young man\n&gt; was now=\r\n thinking of going back, this old hack is out of his fucking\n&gt; mind. And th=\r\nen the old man said: &quot;I thought you said you wanted to\n&gt; be successful?&quot; He=\r\n said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &quot;Then walk a\n&gt; little further.&quot; Then the old man fo=\r\nllowed this guy into the water,\n&gt; he grabbed the young man&#39;s head, and held=\r\n him down underwater. The old\n&gt; guy held the young man, till  the young man=\r\n was about to pass out, the\n&gt; young guys arms were now splashing the water =\r\nin desperation, then\n&gt; suddenly the guru raised him up. He said: &quot;I got a q=\r\nuestion for\n&gt; you.&quot; He told the young guy, he said: &quot;When you want to succe=\r\ned\n&gt; as bad as you wanna breathe than you will be successful.&quot;\n&gt; (Succeed =\r\n=3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or achieving supernatural\n&gt; powers, or=\r\n siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto you.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t know how ma=\r\nny of you all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If\n&gt; you ever had a asthma a=\r\nttack before, you are short of breath S.O.B,due\n&gt; to shortness of breath, y=\r\nou start wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like you\n&gt; have run 10,000kms in one go,=\r\n the only thing you are trying to do at\n&gt; that moment during the attack, is=\r\n get some air. You don&#39;t care about\n&gt; no basketball game, you don&#39;t care ab=\r\nout what&#39;s on T.V., you\n&gt; don&#39;t care about nobody calling you, you don&#39;t ca=\r\nre about a\n&gt; party. The only thing you care about when you trying to breath=\r\ne is to\n&gt; get some fresh air. That&#39;s it! And when you get to the point wher=\r\ne\n&gt; all you wanna do is be is successful as bad as you wanna breathe then\n&gt;=\r\n you will be successful. And I&#39;m here to tell you that number one,\n&gt; most o=\r\nf you say you wanna be successful but you don&#39;t want it bad,\n&gt; you just kin=\r\nd of want it. You don&#39;t want it bad than you wanna\n&gt; party. You don&#39;t want =\r\nit as much as you want to be cool. Most of you\n&gt; don&#39;t want success as much=\r\n as you want sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n&gt; (Again Success =3D uniting with god, or seeing=\r\n god, or achieving\n&gt; supernatural powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats sub=\r\njective, upto\n&gt; you.)\n&gt; End Quote\n&gt; \n&gt; Ignore the following video , focus o=\r\nn the audio in it. with the above\n&gt; modifications.\n&gt; http://www.youtube.com=\r\n/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU_J0A\n&gt; \n&gt; Do all of you remember that Visa call from your=\r\n perspective\n&gt; embassies????\n&gt; Remember those???\n&gt; The interviews???\n&gt; Even=\r\n if you had slept at 4 in the morning, the night before, you would\n&gt; still =\r\nwake up and be at the embassy office at 7, or whenever your\n&gt; appointment w=\r\nas.\n&gt; Hell even if you had high fever 102 or something, you would still rea=\r\nch.\n&gt; Do you remember that flight to the states???\n&gt; Ohhhh Ammmerrriiiiicaa=\r\naaaaa!!!!

Mmmmmmmmm,\n&gt; tandoori chicken=85.. mmmmmm.\n&gt; \n&gt; When was the la=\r\nst time you did this for god????\n&gt; I see homams that last for 15 minutes.

Wah, wah!!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Surely sir=\r\ne/ madame, god will be yours, yes, yes surely.

But =\r\nerrrrrr=85=85=85=85\n&gt; what did you do post that???\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t see people =\r\nshortening their mall trips, their shopping sprees,\n&gt; their time on the int=\r\nernet but when it comes to a homam, first question\n&gt; or thought is &quot;oh my g=\r\nawd, it will take that long, let me ask Mr Rao of\n&gt; making it shorter.&quot; And=\r\n god is so magnanimous, he allows you to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hell you spend more ti=\r\nme on buying your kacche, panty, banyan and bras\n&gt; rather than on god!!!!!!=\r\n Wah, wah, surely god will be yours.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then you pick up books, all sort =\r\nof books read all about other guys\n&gt; reaching god, start reading into their=\r\n experiences, start discussing\n&gt; about their high spiritual states and ever=\r\nything, and get lost  in\n&gt; arguing over those discussions. Then post apolog=\r\nies, my goodness, the\n&gt; noise. Waste of a human birth, if you were to see t=\r\nhe line waiting for a\n&gt; human womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; have to stand at t=\r\nhe end of this line,\n&gt; you would piss yourself. Some girl after seeing it d=\r\nid, and has always\n&gt; been a little urgent with her sadhana ever since then.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I see this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do you find a\n&gt; gu=\r\nru????&quot;\n&gt; And you know everyone, wants a high powered one, not any other wi=\r\nll do.\n&gt; See a high powered guru, also requires a good disciple.\n&gt; Are you =\r\ngood enough, honestly answer this??? Many will say no, many will\n&gt; say good=\r\n or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it etc etc, but are you\n&gt; willing =\r\nto work on yourself to spare the guru some work???? Why would a\n&gt; high powe=\r\nred one come and teach you??? only after your penance is good\n&gt; enough na? =\r\notherwise, he/she will be busy in his/her union with god.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now how b=\r\nad do you want god?\n&gt; How bad do you want a guru?\n&gt;   How bad do you want t=\r\nhose spiritual states?\n&gt; How bad do you want the darsahn for your beloved?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time is running out, and very soon=\r\n,\n&gt; another rebirth, again the young age, again the teenage, again the\n&gt; af=\r\nfairs, again the hormone spikes, again the degrees, again the sucky\n&gt; jobs,=\r\n again confused with life, again the financial nightmares, again\n&gt; the hear=\r\nt attacks , again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll end th=\r\nis post with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the\n&gt; 1940&#39;s, had done a=\r\n bit of penance and you know was highly interested in\n&gt; god , shod and all =\r\nthis stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and\n&gt; met a guy who was pro=\r\nclaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord\n&gt; voldmeort or something bu=\r\nt on the god side.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the guy went to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t be=\r\n taken and asked him\n&gt; , i am looking for a guru, the old fella said , for =\r\nwhat exactly are you\n&gt; looking for a guru??? The business man said, , you k=\r\nnow to learn stuff.\n&gt; The old fellow said what are you willing to do for yo=\r\nur guru??? The\n&gt; businessman said anything. The old fella said, okay take a=\r\nll your\n&gt; clothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy took them =\r\noff\n&gt; reluctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a patta around your\n=\r\n&gt; neck and roam around the town naked. The businessman was aghast, but the\n=\r\n&gt; old fella, told him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the businessman very BADLY\n&gt; wan=\r\nted a guru, so he went and got shoes thrown at him, came back after\n&gt; half =\r\nan hour to find the old fella gone and his clothes gone too. He sat\n&gt; there=\r\n sobbing, and sobbing and cursing god, that i was the biggest fool\n&gt; to com=\r\ne here and trust this man. But then as he haid read somewhere, why\n&gt; waste =\r\ntime, he started meditating and chanted. 3 hours went by no sign\n&gt; of the o=\r\nld man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, the old fella reappeared, and\n&gt; said &quot; her=\r\ne are your clothes, go back to your town.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The businessman just didn&#39;t=\r\n want to say anything tried to get up, but\n&gt; couldn&#39;t move. The old fella w=\r\nas weeping with joy, stating that finally\n&gt; he has found someone worthy eno=\r\nugh to teach. Somebody who actually wants\n&gt; it &quot;bad&quot;.Old fella took the hot=\r\nshot as his disciple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Punjabi fans -----&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; Makkah gayan=E2=80=A8\n&gt; =\r\nGal mukdi nahin\n&gt; =E2=80=A8Paven sau sau jummen padhaiye\n&gt; Ganga gayan\n&gt; =\r\n=E2=80=A8Gal mukdi nahin=E2=80=A8\n&gt; Paven sau sau gothey khaiye\n&gt; Gaya gaya=\r\nn\n&gt; =E2=80=A8Gal mukdi nahin=E2=80=A8\n&gt; Paven sau sau panD padhaiye\n&gt; Bulle=\r\nh Shah!=E2=80=A8\n&gt; Gal taiyon mukdi=E2=80=A8\n&gt; Jadon menu dilon gavaiye.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Parh parh ilm hazaar kitaabaN\n&gt; kadi apne aap nu parhya nahin\n&gt; Jaa jaa =\r\nwardey mandar maseetan\n&gt; kadi mann apne wich wareya nahin\n&gt; Anven larda sha=\r\nitaan de naal bandeya\n&gt; kadi nafs apne naal larya nahin\n&gt; Aakhe peer Bulleh=\r\n Shah aasmani pharna aeN\n&gt; jehra man wich wasda unhoN pharya nahin\n&gt; \n&gt; (ji=\r\nsko samajh mien aye who baakiyon ke liye transalte kare )\n&gt; \n&gt; Satya Shri A=\r\nkaal\n&gt; Jai mere kaal\n&gt; Nobody\n&gt; P.S.
