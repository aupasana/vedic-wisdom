I am not confident of being able to stay completely detach=\r\ned during the homam. I think what I am trying to say is that I do not know =\r\nto what extent my underlying motives can remain pure (unselfish) enough. At=\r\n some point or another won&#39;t one end up automatically asking for one&#39;s pers=\r\nonal gains? After all, isn&#39;t it human nature to confide everything/ask the =\r\nMother for everything.. Maa mujhe new car chaahiye, please give my kids goo=\r\nd health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting th=\r\ne Paath with these motives in mind? In that case, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimo=\r\nchan mantra enough to &#39;white-wash&#39; one&#39;s selfish motives?\n\nSecondly, I have=\r\n to admit that after listening to some tales about regular recitation of th=\r\ne Chandi Paath being associated with &#39;Kundalini jagran&#39;, I am a bit worried=\r\n. Can sadhana and &#39;kundalini jagran&#39; ever be mutually exclusive? What if on=\r\ne wants to pray for the sake of praying only?
