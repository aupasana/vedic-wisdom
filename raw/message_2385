Atman appears to be diverse or plural on account of its association with various types of equipment known as Upadhis in Vedanta. But it becomes one on destruction of these equipment just as  space is one only although it appears different . Let me put it this way. In a house we denominate some space as drawing room, some as dining room, some as bed room, bath room etc. etc.  All these spaces appear different and separate because of the wall separating one room from the other. Once the walls are knocked down, there is only one space. The walls of the room can be said to be the equipment which seem to limit the limitless space. When the  walls are pulled down, the different room spaces which had erstwhile individual existence merge into the one infinite or limitless space. \n \nLikewise, the equipment of body, mind and intelect which are Upadhis are responsible for the manifested world of perceptions, emotions and thoughts projected upon the Atman.  The pluralistic phenomenon is nothing but the one Atman appearing manifold because of its association with these three equipment mentioned above.  When these equipment are transcended, the plurality merges into the Atman which is the Supreme Reality.   In either case, the manifold conditionings are only illusory in as much as the gross can not condition the subtle.   Both Atman and space are subtle in relation to the equipment of body mind and intellect  and walls respectively which are gross.\n(to be continued)\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1551127983-1251625056=:86547\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: garamond,new york,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: garamond,new york,times,serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: bookman old style,new york,times,serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: bookman old style,new york,times,serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: bookman old style,new york,times,serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The all-pervasiveness of Atman was&nbsp; touched upon in the previous posting.&nbsp; Atman appears to be diverse or plural on account of its association with various types of equipment known as &lt;i&gt;Upadhis &lt;/i&gt;in &lt;i&gt;\nVedanta.&lt;/i&gt; But it becomes one on destruction of these equipment just as&nbsp; space is one only although it appears different .
