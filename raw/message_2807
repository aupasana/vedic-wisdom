However, eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disa=\r\nppear depends on how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n \nSimil=\r\narly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be filled=\r\n with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that place=\r\n or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becom=\r\nes weak and disappears.\n \nIn many famous temples these days, priests have b=\r\necome commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed=\r\n every few years to re-energize the idols \n \n*        *        *\n \nIt is my=\r\n humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine presence t=\r\noday, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so=\r\n-well-known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n \nI was very i=\r\nmpressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), =\r\nGirnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Mah=\r\narshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those p=\r\nlaces. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For e=\r\nxample, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol a=\r\nt Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous=\r\n Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n \nThere was one small temple in=\r\n Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 t=\r\nemples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai =\r\nin 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small tem=\r\nple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there was a Tamil la=\r\nnguage name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name no=\r\nw. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in fron=\r\nt of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose fac=\r\ne was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence ther=\r\ne. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, b=\r\nut it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof o=\r\nver the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each=\r\n time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof.=\r\n Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with th=\r\nat temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple an=\r\nd goddess.\n \nLike this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful di=\r\nvine presence across India.\n \nApart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar,=\r\n one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temp=\r\nle at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditat=\r\ning in the underground chamber there.\n \n*        *        *\n \nEven the midd=\r\nle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. T=\r\nhese western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas i=\r\nn India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple i=\r\nn India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not =\r\nmuch left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n \nIf one has=\r\n a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I su=\r\nggest the following:\n \nMayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east In=\r\ndia, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near=\r\n Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (J=\r\nunagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India a=\r\nnd Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n \nThere are many =\r\nother good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is=\r\n one thing and staying there for several months while maintaining a simple =\r\nlifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quit=\r\ne another.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Astro Seeker \n  To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n=\r\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n\n        Respected Narsimhaji,\n\n\n    =\r\n    I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) i=\r\nn today&#39;s time.

These western countries are so fi=\r\nlled with \nrajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a goo=\r\nd amount of \nsattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place t=\r\no meditate, but my \nview is that there is not much left at *some* temples. =\r\nBut some temples are \nreally good.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;If one has a cha=\r\nnce to spend a few months doing \nspiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest=\r\n the following:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Ka=\r\nmakhya in east \nIndia, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)&nbsp;a=\r\nnd \nNarayana&nbsp;vanam (near Tirupati)&nbsp;in south India, Shirdi, Aaland=\r\ni, \nDwaraka&nbsp;and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, V=\r\nrindavan \nand Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam&nbsp;=\r\nand Ujjain in \ncentral India.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;There are many other =\r\ngood places, but the above \ncome to my mind.
