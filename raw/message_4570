It is the opposite of attachment( bandhana)- it does not mean dislik=\r\ne or aversion. \n\nThe Goddess Mahalakshmi- from the Sri Suktam and the Devi =\r\nMahatmyam is not money- She is creation itself. She is consciousness.. The =\r\neffect that you see may be due to wrong linkage of Her in your mind. She is=\r\n Sri- prosperity and abundance- even renunciates do not say that they do no=\r\nt want money or food( they may be indifferent to them- which is different f=\r\nrom aversion). The thing is to be indifferent\nto it. Using bhakti, we do no=\r\nt withdraw our consciousness forcefully as in some other forms of yoga. We =\r\nform an attachment to Her and that does all this and more.A person who does=\r\n true upasana will get detachment naturally. Use the attitude of &#39;do as you=\r\n will&#39; and surrender as your tools.\n\nSo coming to the point- say &#39;I want YO=\r\nU mother-whatever you give me is your prasada.I will accept it. But YOU are=\r\n most important.&#39; She who is Tarini will help you cross the ocean of diffic=\r\nulties.\n\nOn the spiritual path, remember the 6 enemies( shad ripu) and 9 bo=\r\nndages( nava pasham), which hold back a sadhaka. Both attachment and hatred=\r\n( among others) are enemies.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nS\n\n\n  \n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prm7782&quot; &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram Narsimha g=\r\naru,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you please explain to me about the nature of Goddess Mahalaks=\r\nhmi? I am practising detachment from money. During this process I have freq=\r\nuently observed anything I speak about money she gets hurt as I immediately=\r\n see some financial loss. If one says I don&#39;t want money it is like offendi=\r\nng the Goddess and when one says I want money it becomes desire. So how to =\r\ndetach mind from money the right way? I am spiritually connected to that Go=\r\nddess and have seen her visions almost all my life and don&#39;t wish to hurt h=\r\ner in anyway. I am also sorry if my question sounds silly but whatever I am=\r\n today is only because of your teachings. I don&#39;t have much spiritual knowl=\r\nedge and neither do I get time to read books. I rely completely on your tea=\r\nchings and any words of wisdom coming from you would be of great help. Kind=\r\nly guide,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and Best regards,\n&gt; Priya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
