But the=\r\n space that matters to the goat is small and the goat&#39;s maneuvres within th=\r\nat small space are quite important - they decide how much the goat is able =\r\nto accomplish and how happy it is. See the example below of river and bucke=\r\nt of water. In that example, goat&#39;s choice decides whether its thirst is qu=\r\nenched or not.\n \nSimilarly, an ordinary person&#39;s free will works within a l=\r\nimited space. There may be millions of things that are out of reach for an =\r\nordinary person. But, the maneuvres made within the limited space of possib=\r\nilities can have a considerable impact on that person&#39;s life.\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nAssuming that life and one&#39;s actions are predetermined based on =\r\nhoroscope, we are effectively saying that actions in one of the previous li=\r\nves (which determined the current horoscope) are determining all actions in=\r\n this life, hence the next life&#39;s horoscope, hence all actions in next life=\r\n, hence the horoscope in the life after that one, and so on. This line of t=\r\nhinking implies that choices made in one particular life predetermine a seq=\r\nuence of lives. What a proposition!\n \n*        *        *\n \nBTW, Prasad, th=\r\nanks for an awesome link. Seekers of knowledge who are genuinely interested=\r\n in this topic (the play of destiny and free will) should find this article=\r\n quite insightful.

When you witness incredible chart analysis by a gifted astrolo=\r\nger there is little choice but to have this view.  Though a person may thin=\r\nk, feel, and act as if they are making choices in their life, this view may=\r\n be completely compromised by an astrologer describing exactly where they a=\r\nre, what they have been doing, and how they got there.  If someone can do t=\r\nhis with a few symbols nicely arranged on a piece of paper then it really q=\r\nuestions the idea of &#39;free will&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The analogy of the goat having &#39;free=\r\n will&#39; within the range of its tether is really saying that given the huge =\r\nsize of the world the goat is extremely restricted.  And so are we.  If you=\r\n compare &#39;free will&#39; to this short rope that goats are usually tied by, and=\r\n the vastness of the world, then we can only conclude that life is largely =\r\npredetermined.  This being so, we cannot use &#39;free will&#39; as an excuse for o=\r\nur inability to make accurate predictions consistently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Michal\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

Free \n&gt; will is restricted to the\n&gt; &gt; amount of freedom the rope allows =\r\n\n&gt; one.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna is a master of explaining the toughest \n&gt; of phil=\r\nosophical points using the simplest of analogies. His analogies are \n&gt; usua=\r\nlly quite apt and brilliant.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result o=\r\nf past \n&gt; actions) is like a rope tied to the neck of a goat. The rope rest=\r\nricts the movement of the goat, but does not determine where the goat \n&gt; go=\r\nes and what it does! That is upto the goat&#39;s free will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A thirsty goa=\r\nt may look at a river nearby and \n&gt; despair as it cannot reach the river du=\r\ne to the rope. It may try and struggle \n&gt; continually, without reaching the=\r\n river. Another thirsty goat may realize that \n&gt; it cannot reach the river,=\r\n accept that, look around, find a small bucket of \n&gt; water behind it within=\r\n reach if it negotiates with the rope and the obstacles. \n&gt; It may turn bac=\r\nk, go, drink that water in the bucket and be happy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; While the destiny=\r\n as frozen at the time of birth \n&gt; (and as reflected in the horoscope) is l=\r\nike the rope tying the goat and the \n&gt; surroundings of the goat, the action=\r\ns of free will after birth are like the \n&gt; actions of the goat - how it acc=\r\nepts and negotiates the rope and its \n&gt; surroundings to get what it wants.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Today&#39;s actions (karma) are tomorrow&#39;s d=\r\nestiny (karma). Some of today&#39;s \n&gt; actions may impact destiny in a future l=\r\nife. Some of today&#39;s actions may modify \n&gt; destiny for tomorrow (in this li=\r\nfe itself!). Let me \n&gt; extend Ramakrishna&#39; s analogy to explain it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A=\r\n goat tied to a tree with a rope may go around the tree a few times in one =\r\n\n&gt; direction and the rope may get shorter. It may now be unable to reach pl=\r\naces it \n&gt; was able to reach earlier. Similarly, some bad acts of free will=\r\n in this life \n&gt; may tighten the destiny, make things worse and reduce one&#39;=\r\ns options.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It may go around the tree a few times in another direction=\r\n and the rope may \n&gt; get longer. It may now be able to reach places it was =\r\nunable to reach earlier. \n&gt; Similarly, some good acts of free will in this =\r\nlife may improve the destiny and \n&gt; make more things possible.\n&gt;  *        =\r\n\n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One&#39;s mind is conditioned based on one&#39;s destiny. \n&gt; On=\r\ne&#39;s surroundings and life situations faced by one are influenced by one&#39;s \n=\r\n&gt; destinty. One will be pulled in certain directions. One may feel attracti=\r\non \n&gt; for another person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and thr=\r\now \n&gt; obstacles. One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be =\r\nadored by \n&gt; millions of people. And so on. One faces different life situat=\r\nions at different \n&gt; times and in different matters.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, destiny=\r\n only shows how one (and one&#39;s \n&gt; mind) is pulled in various directions and=\r\n what life situations one finds oneself \n&gt; in. Irrespective of the mental c=\r\nonditioning and one&#39;s circumstances, one can \n&gt; still choose between differ=\r\nent actions. The actions taken by one are not fixed \n&gt; based on the horosco=\r\npe. For example, one person may abuse one badly and one may \n&gt; feel great a=\r\nnger towards that person, all on account of a previous karmik debt. \n&gt; But,=\r\n when badly provoked, one can either succumb to the temptation and fight \n&gt;=\r\n back or just ignore and move on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Destiny places you in different sit=\r\nuations. What \n&gt; you do in those situations is based on how you use your fr=\r\nee will. In some \n&gt; cases, free will has a lot of wiggle room and many opti=\r\nons and, in some cases, \n&gt; it has fewer options. But, usually, you do have =\r\nseveral options that may or may \n&gt; not be obvious and the action you finall=\r\ny choose shapes your \n&gt; destiny in a future birth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma and the =\r\nSanskrit \n&gt; word for action is also karma. Basically, actions of today beco=\r\nme destiny of \n&gt; tomorrow. You will get reaction in future to your current =\r\nactions and destiny is \n&gt; the sum total of those actions that will come bac=\r\nk to you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Each action of yours that impacts other beings and \n&gt; objec=\r\nts of this universe will go towards forming your destiny for future. (Here =\r\n\n&gt; please note that both physical and mental actions count. Any emotions yo=\r\nu feel \n&gt; towards someone else and do not necessary express outwardly will =\r\nalso \n&gt; impact that person in a subtle manner and hence counts as an \n&gt; act=\r\nion.)\n&gt;  \n&gt; Horoscope captures the good and bad actions, \n&gt; committed physi=\r\ncally or mentally to other beings, until the current birth, which \n&gt; are to=\r\n give their reactions in this life. This is also known as \n&gt; destiny.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n It does not fix what you do in various situations \n&gt; in your current life.=\r\n You have the ability to make different choices at \n&gt; important crossroads.=\r\n The choices you make are your karma (actions) and they \n&gt; shape your desti=\r\nny for future. They may either impact your current life itself, \n&gt; or becom=\r\ne part of the destiny (as reflected in the horoscope) in the next \n&gt; life.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Anybody who tells you that so and so hou=\r\nses show \n&gt; acts of free will does not understand what free will is. Horosc=\r\nope is the \n&gt; frozen list of past karmas that form one&#39;s destiny for this l=\r\nife. It is like the \n&gt; rope tying the goat. Acts of free will are like how =\r\nthe goat negotiates the rope \n&gt; and moves around within the possible area t=\r\no do its stuff. That is in the \n&gt; hands of the goat.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The scope and op=\r\ntions available to free will can be \n&gt; estimated from the horoscope, but th=\r\ne exact acts of free will are unpredictable \n&gt; based on horoscope. To compl=\r\nicate things further, how exactly free will has been \n&gt; used until now in t=\r\nhis life (which cannot be seen from the horoscope) has \n&gt; an impact on the =\r\nscope and options available to free will at this time. \n&gt; The exertion of f=\r\nree will until now may have modified the destiny.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *      =\r\n  *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am not downplaying astrology. Going back to the \n&gt; original Chi=\r\nranjeevi prediction, the prediction that he would come into politics \n&gt; in =\r\n2007-2009 and enjoy some kind of power was made using astrology. When someo=\r\nne \n&gt; is already a candidate, even a random prediction of success or failur=\r\ne has \n&gt; a 1/2 or 1/3 probability. But, when there are no signs on the grou=\r\nnd, a \n&gt; prediction on one&#39;s political entry in a specific timeframe has a =\r\nvery low \n&gt; probability. Such a low probability prediction made 7 years ahe=\r\nad using \n&gt; astrology came true. Moreover, we have all seen many cases wher=\r\ne astrology \n&gt; worked spectacularly. I am not saying astrology is nonsense.=\r\n But I am saying \n&gt; that we do not attempt to understand its shortcomings.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; When someone&#39;s free will works in a predictable \n&gt; way, i.e. when one=\r\n&#39;s free will has very few options and/or one reacts to life \n&gt; situations t=\r\nhrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, job of an astrologer is \n&gt; eas=\r\nier. But, when free will has a wide range of options and/or one used the fr=\r\nee \n&gt; will powerfully, the gap between the destiny as reflected by horoscop=\r\ne and the \n&gt; actual destiny as a result of those actions may make an astrol=\r\noger \n&gt; fail.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do \n&gt; a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do \n&gt; Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free \n&gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedi=\r\ncastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free \n&gt; Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri \n&gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sr=\r\niJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 5/27/09, Shyam V.

At the time of that pr=\r\nediction, there were no such \n&gt; indications on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ground. But he=\r\n did come into politics \n&gt; in the same timeframe. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial tal=\r\nk was in 2007, he \n&gt; finally formed a party in 2008 and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elections=\r\n were in \n&gt; 2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; legislator (MLA) in May 2009.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, the orig=\r\ninal prediction was quite successful. However, I \n&gt; upped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ant=\r\ne last year by suggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39; \n&gt; s party would do well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though I was not \n&gt; specific regarding his level of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success and did not \n&gt; predict that he would become the Chief Min=\r\nister, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was \n&gt; honestly expecting his party to do better than th=\r\ney managed. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the followup of my original prediction is a =\r\nfailure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is =\r\nmy personal observation that the success rate in high \n&gt; profile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npolitical predictions is less than in regular \n&gt; predictions like marriage,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in \n&gt; &quot;regular&quot; charts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In \n&gt; some cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurate and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we make \n&gt;=\r\n bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it can be \n&gt; a hu=\r\nman error in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging various factors. However, that \n&gt; human erro=\r\nr seems to be a little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common in high \n&gt; profile political p=\r\nredictions than in regular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; predictions. What could be the reas=\r\non?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor of free will that is =\r\nleft out of \n&gt; astrology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a bigger role in political charts.=\r\n I will \n&gt; try to think loud and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate what I mean.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth chart contai=\r\nns the list of actions \n&gt; committed in previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives using one&#39;s=\r\n free will that \n&gt; are to give their reactions in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life. Howe=\r\nver, as \n&gt; life goes on, one accumulates newer actions committed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nin \n&gt; THIS life using one&#39;s free will. What happens at any point of time in=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function of ALL actions committed by one unti=\r\nl \n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in \n&gt; TH=\r\nIS life until now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using \n&gt; one&#39;s free=\r\n will in THIS life,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at important \n&gt; crossroads in life=\r\n, should impact the life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events from \n&gt; then onwards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many \n&gt; people are weighed down by too many karmas and always =\r\nplaying a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; catchup. In other words, destiny (sum of the actions=\r\n of previous \n&gt; lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to give a reaction now) is too we=\r\nighty \n&gt; and free will in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has little scope. When the \n&gt;=\r\n options available for the free will in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are \n&gt; limited,=\r\n there may not be significant actions using free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; will and henc=\r\ne the modifications to destiny based on actions of this\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life m=\r\nay not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient to \n&gt; predict\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly popular, successful=\r\n and high profile \n&gt; public\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities may have less restricti=\r\nons and more \n&gt; options available for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free will. With their=\r\n free \n&gt; will being more free and powerful, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions committed=\r\n \n&gt; by their free will may have a higher weightage. As we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are \n&gt; =\r\nable to see only their destiny in the horoscope (free will exercise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable to factor in how free will was exercised in \n&gt;=\r\n this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life until now, we are perhaps handicapped in our \n&gt; predic=\r\ntions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a \n&gt; political leader is in limeligh=\r\nt and becomes MP or the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; leader of opposition in parliament or =\r\nthe Prime Minister, he is enjoying\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some political power. Previ=\r\nous karmas placed him in a position to \n&gt; enjoy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that power. To pr=\r\nedict the specific degree of power \n&gt; and make an accurate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predic=\r\ntion, is the horoscope \n&gt; sufficient always? Could the exercise of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; free will in \n&gt; this life until now make a difference in some high profil=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; charts?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * \n&gt; *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I am just thinking \n&gt; loud here.

His analogies are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; usually quite apt and \nbrilliant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of past \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions=\r\n) is like a rope tied to the neck of a goat. The rope restricts \nthe moveme=\r\nnt of the goat, but does not determine where the goat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; goes \nand wh=\r\nat it does! That is upto the goat&#39;s free will.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A \nth=\r\nirsty goat may look at a river nearby and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; despair as it cannot rea=\r\nch \nthe river due to the rope. It may try and struggle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; continually=\r\n, without \nreaching the river.

Some o=\r\nf today&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions \nmay impact destiny in a future life. Some of to=\r\nday&#39;s actions may modify &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \ndestiny for tomorrow (in this life itsel=\r\nf!). Let me &lt;BR&gt;&gt; extend Ramakrishna&#39; \ns analogy to explain it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A goat tied to a tree with a \nrope may go around the tree a =\r\nfew times in one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; direction and the rope \nmay get shorter. It may n=\r\now be unable to reach places it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was able to \nreach earlier. Simila=\r\nrly, some bad acts of free will in this life &lt;BR&gt;&gt; may \ntighten the dest=\r\niny, make things worse and reduce one&#39;s options.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It=\r\n may go around the tree a few times in another direction and the rope \nmay =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get longer. It may now be able to reach places it was unable to \nr=\r\neach earlier. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, some good acts of free will in this life =\r\nmay \nimprove the destiny and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; make more things possible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One&#39;s mind \nis conditi=\r\noned based on one&#39;s destiny. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One&#39;s surroundings and life \nsituatio=\r\nns faced by one are influenced by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; destinty. One will be \npul=\r\nled in certain directions. One may feel attraction &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for another \npe=\r\nrson. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and throw &lt;BR&gt;&gt; obstacle=\r\ns. \nOne may not have enough money to live happily. One may be adored by &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \nmillions of people. And so on. One faces different life situations a=\r\nt different \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; times and in different matters.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; However, destiny \nonly shows how one (and one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind) is pulled =\r\nin various directions and \nwhat life situations one finds oneself &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nin. Irrespective of the mental \nconditioning and one&#39;s circumstances, one c=\r\nan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; still choose between \ndifferent actions. The actions taken by o=\r\nne are not fixed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; based on the \nhoroscope. For example, one person =\r\nmay abuse one badly and one may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feel \ngreat anger towards that per=\r\nson, all on account of a previous karmik debt. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, when badly pr=\r\novoked, one can either succumb to the temptation and \nfight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; back o=\r\nr just ignore and move on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Destiny \nplaces you in di=\r\nfferent situations. What &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you do in those situations is \nbased on h=\r\now you use your free will. In some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cases, free will has a lot \nof =\r\nwiggle room and many options and, in some cases, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it has fewer \nopt=\r\nions. But, usually, you do have several options that may or may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; no=\r\nt \nbe obvious and the action you finally choose shapes your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; destin=\r\ny in a \nfuture birth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nPlease note that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma =\r\nand the Sanskrit \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; word for action is also karma. Basically, action=\r\ns of today become \ndestiny of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tomorrow. You will get reaction in f=\r\nuture to your current \nactions and destiny is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the sum total of tho=\r\nse actions that will come \nback to you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Each action =\r\nof yours that impacts other \nbeings and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; objects of this universe w=\r\nill go towards forming your \ndestiny for future. (Here &lt;BR&gt;&gt; please note=\r\n that both physical and mental \nactions count. Any emotions you feel &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; towards someone else and do not \nnecessary express outwardly will also &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; impact that person in a subtle \nmanner and hence counts as an &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; action.)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Horoscope \ncaptures the good and bad ac=\r\ntions, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; committed physically or mentally to \nother beings, until th=\r\ne current birth, which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are to give their \nreactions in this life. =\r\nThis is also known as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; destiny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It does not=\r\n fix what you do in various situations &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in your \ncurrent life. You =\r\nhave the ability to make different choices at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nimportant crossroad=\r\ns. The choices you make are your karma (actions) and they \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; shape y=\r\nour destiny for future. They may either impact your current life \nitself, &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; or become part of the destiny (as reflected in the horoscope) \nin t=\r\nhe next &lt;BR&gt;&gt; life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Anybody who \ntells you that so and so houses show &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; acts of free will does not \nunderstand what free will is. Horoscope is =\r\nthe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; frozen list of past \nkarmas that form one&#39;s destiny for this l=\r\nife. It is like the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rope tying \nthe goat. Acts of free will are li=\r\nke how the goat negotiates the rope &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nand moves around within the p=\r\nossible area to do its stuff. That is in the \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hands of the goat.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The scope and options \navailable to free will can be =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; estimated from the horoscope, but the \nexact acts of free will are=\r\n unpredictable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; based on horoscope. To \ncomplicate things further, =\r\nhow exactly free will has been &lt;BR&gt;&gt; used until \nnow in this life (which=\r\n cannot be seen from the horoscope) has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an \nimpact on the scope an=\r\nd options available to free will at this time. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nThe exertion of fr=\r\nee will until now may have modified the destiny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not \ndownplaying astrolo=\r\ngy. Going back to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; original Chiranjeevi \nprediction, the predic=\r\ntion that he would come into politics &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in \n2007-2009 and enjoy some=\r\n kind of power was made using astrology. When someone \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is already =\r\na candidate, even a random prediction of success or failure \nhas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a=\r\n 1/2 or 1/3 probability. But, when there are no signs on the \nground, a &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; prediction on one&#39;s political entry in a specific timeframe \nhas a ve=\r\nry low &lt;BR&gt;&gt; probability. Such a low probability prediction made 7 \nyear=\r\ns ahead using &lt;BR&gt;&gt; astrology came true. Moreover, we have all seen many=\r\n \ncases where astrology &lt;BR&gt;&gt; worked spectacularly. I am not saying astr=\r\nology \nis nonsense. But I am saying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that we do not attempt to unde=\r\nrstand its \nshortcomings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When someone&#39;s free will w=\r\norks in a \npredictable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; way, i.e. when one&#39;s free will has very few=\r\n options and/or \none reacts to life &lt;BR&gt;&gt; situations thrown up by the de=\r\nstiny in predictable \nways, job of an astrologer is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; easier. But, w=\r\nhen free will has a wide \nrange of options and/or one used the free &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; will powerfully, the gap \nbetween the destiny as reflected by horoscope a=\r\nnd the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actual destiny as \na result of those actions may make an as=\r\ntrologer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- \n--------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a Short \nHomam Yourself: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; \nrologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSpirituality: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups&quot;&gt;http://groups&lt;/A&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \nwisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nFree &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro&quot;&gt;http://=\r\nvedicastro&lt;/A&gt;. home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.=\r\norg&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.SriJagan&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ \n----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 5/27/09, Shyam V.

At the time of that prediction, t=\r\nhere were no such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; indications \non&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nground. But he did come into politics \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in the same timeframe. The&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initial talk was \nin 2007, he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; finally =\r\nformed a party in 2008 and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; elections were in &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; 2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected \nas a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; legislator (MLA) in May 2009.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, the \noriginal=\r\n prediction was quite successful. However, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; upped&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; the ante last year by suggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\n \nparty would do well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though=\r\n I was \nnot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; specific regarding his level of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; success \nand did not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; predict that he would become the Chief =\r\nMinister, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; honestly expecting hi=\r\ns party to do better than \nthey managed. Thus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; the followup of my \noriginal prediction is a failure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It i=\r\ns my personal observation \nthat the success rate in high &lt;BR&gt;&gt; profile&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \npolitical predictions is less than in regular &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; predictions like \nmarriage,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; job, childb=\r\nirth etc in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;regular&quot; \ncharts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some cases, the reason is that =\r\nthe birthdata is not accurate \nand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; yet=\r\n we are eager to make predictions. \nBut sometimes we make &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bad&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with \ngood data too. Of course, it can =\r\nbe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a human error in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; judging various f=\r\nactors. However, that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; human error seems to \nbe a little&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common in high &lt;BR&gt;&gt; profile \npolitical predictio=\r\nns than in regular&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \npredictions. What =\r\ncould be the reason?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor of free will that is \nleft out=\r\n of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; astrology&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a bigger role \nin =\r\npolitical charts. I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; try to think loud and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; elaborate what I mean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth chart contains the lis=\r\nt of \nactions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; committed in previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; li=\r\nves using \none&#39;s free will that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are to give their reactions in thi=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; life. However, as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; life goes on, one=\r\n accumulates newer \nactions committed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; THIS life using one&#39;s \nfree will. What happens at any point of time in&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; one&#39;s life is a function of ALL action=\r\ns committed by one until &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nthat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point o=\r\nf time, INCLUDING the actions committed \nin &lt;BR&gt;&gt; THIS life until now.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions \ncommitted using &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s=\r\n free will in THIS life,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; especially at importa=\r\nnt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; crossroads in life, should impact the \nlife&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; events from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then onwards.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; people are \nweighed down =\r\nby too many karmas and always playing a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &g=\r\nt; catchup. In other words, destiny (sum of the actions of previous \n&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; lives&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which are to give a reaction now) is \n=\r\ntoo weighty &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and free will in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life=\r\n has \nlittle scope. When the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; options available for the free will i=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; limited, there may no=\r\nt be significant \nactions using free&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; w=\r\nill and hence the \nmodifications to destiny based on actions of this&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; life may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope=\r\n may be sufficient to \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; predict&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; However, highly popular, \nsuccessful and high profile &lt;BR&gt;&gt; public&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \npersonalities may have less restrictions and more=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; options available \nfor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their free wil=\r\nl. With their free &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will \nbeing more free and powerful, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions committed \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; by their free will may hav=\r\ne a higher weightage. As we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; able =\r\nto see only their destiny in the horoscope (free \nwill exercise&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable to \nfactor in how free wil=\r\nl was exercised in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; life until no=\r\nw, we are perhaps handicapped in our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \npredictions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \nWhether a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; poli=\r\ntical leader is in limelight and becomes MP or \nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; leader of opposition in parliament or \nthe Prime Minister, he=\r\n is enjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some \npolitical power. Pr=\r\nevious karmas placed him in a position to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nenjoy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; that power. To predict the specific degree of \npower &lt;BR&gt;&gt; an=\r\nd make an accurate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prediction, is \nthe horoscop=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sufficient always?
