For exampl=\r\ne, in this thread,\nbetween the words &quot;God-realized&quot; and &quot;self-realized&quot;, Sh=\r\nankaracharya was\nlabelled as &quot;self-realized&quot;. We often have such theoretica=\r\nl discussions without\nunderstanding the terms involved (I am more guilty of=\r\n this than most). For me,\nthis book helped clarify some of these terms and =\r\nconcepts, from a learned\njagadguru who had directly experienced.\n\nBased on =\r\nmy reading, the path to spirituality requires destroying the\nego. I don&#39;t\nt=\r\nhink that it is possible for me to reduce my ego without both bhakti\nto Ish=\r\nwara\nand vicAra as part of the picture.\n\nI have to surrender to a higher po=\r\nwer in order to reduce my ego. But then my ego\nshows up elsewhere and becom=\r\nes happy that I am a good bhakta that is pleasing\nIshwara. Then I have to r=\r\nealize that Ishwara isn&#39;t pleased by my\naction or inaction.\nAnd then, witho=\r\nut a higher power in the picture, the original ego\nresurfaces. Hence,\nas fa=\r\nr as the process is concerned, I believe that bhakti and vicAra\ngo hand in =\r\nhand.\nUsing an illustration from the Yoga-Vasishtha, it is like the two\nwin=\r\ngs of a bird that\nwants to fly.\n\nI understood the question as asking about =\r\nself-realization (through vicAra) and\nGod-realization (through bhakti). Fro=\r\nm my perspective, the path and desired\nresult are really the same, regardle=\r\nss of how they are labelled. Looking back,\nreading this book helped form my=\r\n opinion, and I thought that others might find\nthe book to be equally revea=\r\nling.\n\nbhavadiiyaH,\n\n      ajit\n\nOn Fri, Aug 7, 2009 at 5:48 AM, Jyotisa Sh=\r\nisya&lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Ajit,\n&gt;\n&gt; Always refreshing to re=\r\nad your post...this one I could not resist replying\n&gt; to!
