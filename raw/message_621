The first was on 5th April 74 whereas this was in the mid of\nMay=\r\n 1974, the date I do not remember.\n\nAs I have written in my previous mail m=\r\ny duty was as a Telegraphist at\nOkha Post Office and my duty hours were fro=\r\nm 7 am to 12 pm and from 4 pm\nto 7 pm. I was coming to my home at 12 pm and=\r\n cooking my food daily as\nmy wife was at her parent&#39;s home at Ahmedabad the=\r\nn. I was alone\nthere. I was eating my food at 1 pm around and taking rest f=\r\nor 2 hours.\nI was awaking between 3 to 3.30 pm and preparing my tea before =\r\ngoing to\noffice. This was a daily routine.\n\nI was receiving 30 to 40 telegr=\r\nams daily before 12 pm and was giving\nthem to Mr. Babaubhai Pandya, a deliv=\r\nery postman of 50 years age to\ndeliver these telegrams to Banks, Navy, Fish=\r\neries and Shipping agents,\nas Okha is a big port. Babubhai was delivering t=\r\nelegrams and coming back\nto Post office at 4 pm daily.\n\nI was then reciting=\r\n Shri Ramkrishnadev Mantra given by Mr. Patel to me\nwhole day and reading S=\r\nhri Ramkrishna Kathamritam daily after taking my\nfood at noon before rest. =\r\nOne day I was reading Kathamritam after my\nfood, I slept while reading the =\r\nbook. It was a long sleep but I heard \nsomebody is knocking my door and I w=\r\nas awake. I opened the door and he\nwas Babubhai, my deliveryman.\n\n&quot;Are you =\r\nstill sleeping Rawalbhai? See your watch, it is already\n3.45&quot;\n\n&quot;Oh, thanks =\r\nBabubhai, today I am really late. Let us drink tea\ntogether today as you ar=\r\ne never coming to my home&quot;\n\nAnd I immediately prepared the tea. We both too=\r\nk the tea and talked some\ngeneral talk then.\n\n&quot; Ok, now I am going to deliv=\r\ner these 2 telegrams to Banks and\ncoming to office within 10 to 15 minutes.=\r\n&quot;\n\n&quot; Ok,&quot; I said and Babubhai went to office.\n\nAfter 5 minutes time I also =\r\nwent to office and reached my office at 4.10\nhours. I saw Babubhai there, w=\r\naiting for me.\n\n&quot;Why late Rawalbhai?&quot; he said.\n\n&quot; You know Babubhai, you ha=\r\nve awakened me today otherwise I might be\nstill sleeping. Today how you cam=\r\ne to my house?  You are never coming to\nthat area generally.&quot;\n\n&quot;But I have =\r\nnot come to your house Rawalbhai, why should I come at\nthis time? My route =\r\nis different, as you know. I have just come from\nmarket. I don&#39;t understand=\r\n what you are telling.&quot; He exclaimed.\n\nI was thrilled again with excitement=\r\n. Who was He who came to my house?\nIt was not a dream. We had taken tea tog=\r\nether and 2 cups of tea I had\nwashed.\n\nI did not reply to Babubhai but I st=\r\nill search the Answer as to Who was\nHe to my home on that day?
