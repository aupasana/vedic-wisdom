Apologies if it has\nalready been answered and I have missed it in the archives.\n\nThe question is, during the ritual, where should the water being placed into the palm be allowed to\nfall?  Is it okay for it to simply fall on the floor (I am thinking in particular of the case where\none is doing it on a balcony or terrace) or should it be collected and then disposed of into the\nearth later?\n\nKindest regards,\n\nSamir\n\n"}}
