He did=\r\n not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw=\r\n and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he sa=\r\nw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road=\r\n. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, wh=\r\nen I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This=\r\n was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future tha=\r\nt is to come has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, =\r\nbut it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I gues=\r\nsed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do=\r\n you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am th=\r\ninking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His =\r\nmain characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, c=\r\nontented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he could no=\r\nt express himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that =\r\nfuture has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people=\r\n later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready i=\r\nn a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on t=\r\nhe screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying=\r\n something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is wha=\r\nt I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will happen wh=\r\nen future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, be=\r\ncause it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention =\r\nit, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man r=\r\niding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to com=\r\ne, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and underst=\r\nand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see s=\r\nomebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible=\r\n and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However=\r\n, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It=\r\n even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahm=\r\nan or Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same boy once perfo=\r\nrmed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali w=\r\nith beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahu=\r\nti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from =\r\nthe energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied=\r\n and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am=\r\n done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire=\r\n consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense =\r\nenergy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was med=\r\nitating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in Indi=\r\na. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside =\r\nthe garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Ka=\r\nali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the=\r\n past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no oth=\r\ner time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, aft=\r\ner we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all t=\r\nhe different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him wh=\r\ny. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and diffe=\r\nrent.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a really =\r\nsimple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it see=\r\nmed like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The =\r\nbottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and g=\r\net more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doi=\r\nng it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Keep performing your chose=\r\nn spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engag=\r\ne in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress =\r\nand purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can=\r\n resist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal en=\r\nemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. =\r\nEgo - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of a=\r\nll problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using j=\r\nnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that=\r\n all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, childr=\r\nen and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caret=\r\naker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but withou=\r\nt entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very goo=\r\nd care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things=\r\n as his or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things=\r\n as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who lov=\r\nes one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thin=\r\ng is taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A serva=\r\nnt will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. Thi=\r\ns enables one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry abou=\r\nt what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properti=\r\nes will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without getting caught and =\r\novercome ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ICC World =\r\nTwenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!
