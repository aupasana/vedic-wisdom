Sastri, I must say that Rajarshi&#39;s view\n&gt; is far more accurate and truthful to the scripture. In fact, Swami\n&gt; Vivekananda also shared exactly the same view (i.e. Rajarshi&#39;s view) when\n&gt; commenting on this story from Chhaandogypanishad!\n\n\nI mentioned Sri S.N.Sastri&#39;s name, because he has a long 2-page\nfootnote discussion on the subject, and not to bolster my argument by\nassociation. If I had wished to do the latter, I would have invoked\nAdishankarachArya -- &quot;paricAriNii paricaranti iti paracaraNa-shiiilA\neva aham paricaraNa-chittatayA gotrAdi-smaraNe mama manaH na abhUt&quot;\nand Anandagiri -- &quot;punaH tasya uparatatvAt&quot;. According the S.N.Sastri,\nShri Ramanuja and Shri Madhva also subscribed to the same view.\n\n\n&gt; Now, I cannot reconcile Sri S.N. Sastri&#39;s interpretation with the above at\n&gt; all. Even today, in this deep Kali yuga, Brahmins do find out the gotra\n&gt; before marriage and avoid marrying people from the same gotra at any cost. I\n&gt; find it strange that one would get married without finding gotra in old\n&gt; days.\n\n\nNeedless criticism. I obviously conveyed the wrong message -- the\nargument is that she does not remember her new gotra, and not that she\nwas never exposed to it. Some things require repeated repetition\nbefore they register. It is quite normal, even today, for brides and\nin-laws to be very forgetful (or, more accurately &quot;un-remember-ful&quot;)\nof their new gotra.\n\n\n&gt; If the true reason is that her husband died young, what is\n&gt; the relevance of her being a servant maid and her moving a lot? Why would\n&gt; she mention those irrelevant points and not her husband dying young?\n\n\nThe points mentioned are not at all irrelevant. It is a partial excuse\n/ apology. Her mind was totally occupied in these activities. In her\nyouth, it did not occur to her to pay attention and remember her\ngotra. Narasimha, this is a conversation between mother and son. If\nthe father died young, it would be well-known, and there would be no\nreason for the mother to &quot;disclose&quot; it to her son at this time. When\nanswering the question, there is simply no need to start reciting the\nlitany of known facts. On the other hand, the points mentioned are\nrelevant, since they show her state of mind. It is a natural lament.\n\n\n&gt; Thus, I cannot support Sri S.N. Sastri&#39;s view at all. It seems quite\n&gt; far-fetched and motivated to me.\n\n\nThe first sentence is quite reasonable. To say that it seems\nfar-fetched to you, is also very reasonable. However, the last\ncriticism is unfair, and cannot be substantiated. Though I did not\nwish to say it, I have the same criticism -- I see an attempt to\nretrofit a story to result in a desirable conclusion, which would make\nfor an excellent example.\n\n\n&gt; If one&#39;s conditioned mind cannot accept the fact that a maharshi accepted\n&gt; the son of a woman who would be considered &quot;fallen&quot; by the moral standards\n&lt;snipped&gt;\n\n\nThis diatribe is interesting, but irrelevant to this dicussion. I am\nhappy to accept that this is how maharshis worked. But, this incident\nis not a good example. The traditional understanding adds facts which\nare not found in the upanishad. However, in my opinion, in this\ninstance, it fits in quite well.\n\nsavinayam praNato.asmi,\n\n         ajit\n\n"}}
