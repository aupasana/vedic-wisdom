NO...is it both?YES...is it neither?YES.....DO I MAKE SENSE?....I,m =\r\nas lost as the other guy.....\n\nif karma makes sense to you....use it!!....i=\r\nf rebirth and an endless process of evolution of consciousness makes sense =\r\nto you!...use it..or if heaven and hell ,and fallen angels makes u happy!..=\r\n.use it...or if it is all a cosmic dream,and u r just a momentary character=\r\n,or prolection...use it..\n\nbecause at the end of the day...there is no way =\r\nwe can truly understand this issue....and the funny thing is most of the so=\r\n called great rishis or mystics don&#39;t seem to concur....\n\nvasistha called i=\r\nt a great dream of one being...so if at the end of the day there is only on=\r\ne guy...so where is injustice?...easy to say but hard to swallow when shit =\r\nhappens to you.....\n\nso here is the bottom line....there can never be a sat=\r\nisfactory answer to the problem of suffering!!ever since man could think he=\r\n has been trying but failing pathetically....\n\nall we can do is accept it o=\r\nr commit suicide....what else is there to do????\n\nmany times I have wanted =\r\nto end it myself....what can I say...still human..right??\n\n\n"}}
