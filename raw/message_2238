Performing a Homa at home is unavoidabel during Sraddha ceremo=\r\nny in which coconut is not offered for Poornahuti. In respect of other homa=\r\nms which are optional  a person is going to spend quite a good amount on th=\r\ne homam and I do not think he will grudge the cost of half a coconut.

No food on earth is left untainted.\n&gt; \n&gt; So should such food =\r\nbe offered to god.Should we altogether give up offering food &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.The w=\r\nater that comes from the tap in the US is heavily contaminated with heavy m=\r\netals, lead , chlorine and what not....filtered water is striped of its nat=\r\nural healing properties.. .\n&gt; \n&gt; So should we use such a water in Pitri Tar=\r\napana..Kalasha etc etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Fire should not be lit with Matches accor=\r\nding to Vedic homa rules , it must only be lit with Samidhas and that too w=\r\nith a elaborate procedure... .\n&gt; \n&gt; So should we stop using matches untill =\r\nwe attain perfection with the procedure...\n&gt; \n&gt; When the whole world is und=\r\ner the effect of Kali yuga it is but a part of nature that impurities will =\r\ncreep into all the materials that are offered to god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same goes for th=\r\ne search for the perfect ingredients. .\n&gt; Same goes for the search for the =\r\nperfect guru who can be followed..\n&gt; Same goes for the search for the perfe=\r\nct muhurta....\n&gt; Same goes for the search for the perfect astrological reme=\r\ndy.....\n&gt; \n&gt; What is visible to the naked eye is 10% whereas the invisible =\r\nis 90% ...so what is to guarantee that any of those calculations will work.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Does not Krishna say in the 9th chapter Verse 26 of the gita...he is =\r\neasily pleased with a offering of a flower , leaf ,fruit done with the pure=\r\nst of intentions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I strongly beleive it is much better to do homa with=\r\n complete surrender to the divine and he/she will absolve us of the lapses =\r\ncommitted conscious or unconscious.\n&gt; \n&gt; RamKishore \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com, G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  Dear Frien=\r\nds,\n&gt; &gt; At the time of Poorna Ahuti,  a  full coconut(poorna phalam)  is re=\r\nquired to be offered by chanting  the  Vedic Mantra&quot; Poornamadah  Poornamid=\r\nam  Poornaat  Poornamudatchyate   Poornasya   Poornamaadaaya  Poornamevaasi=\r\nshyate &quot;.
