I \n&gt; want to make some more comments on recent posts in th=\r\nis series. Some of \n&gt; the strong points made in this series have a potentia=\r\nl to mislead and \n&gt; instill wrong notions.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe arguments of the karma-kandins are not sound. For there cannot be \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nany motive\n&gt; &gt; or desire to act when there is the knowledge of the highest =\r\ntruth. He \n&gt; &gt; does not find\n&gt; &gt; any use in the performance of karma. When =\r\none gets a desire to know \n&gt; &gt; the atman which\n&gt; \n&gt; This notion that the pa=\r\nths of karma (action) and gyaana/jnaana \n&gt; (knowledge) oppose each other is=\r\n one of the major misconceptions of \n&gt; contemporary Vedic knowledge. I foun=\r\nd the same thinking at WAVES (World \n&gt; Association of Vedic Studies) confer=\r\nence in Aug 2010. Some Vedic \n&gt; scholars talk about vedanta and knowledge. =\r\nSome talk about karma and \n&gt; actions/rituals. They think that those are two=\r\n opposing paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vasishtha very clearly said at the beginning of &quot;Yoga=\r\n Vaasishtham&quot; that \n&gt; the bird of individual self flies into the sky of und=\r\nivided and infinite \n&gt; consciousness, by flapping the two wings of karma an=\r\nd gyaana. A bird \n&gt; cannot fly with just one wing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowledge without a=\r\nction to rid oneself of the blocking conditioning \n&gt; cannot free one. Witho=\r\nut actions, knowledge remains merely intellectual. \n&gt; Only with repeated ac=\r\ntions does knowledge get ingrained in one&#39;s \n&gt; consciousness so deeply that=\r\n all of one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and deeds \n&gt; are shaped by that correct k=\r\nnowledge (instead of underlying \n&gt; conditioning). Just &quot;knowing&quot; intellectu=\r\nally that a movie is not real \n&gt; and there is no need to take what happens =\r\non the screen seriously is not \n&gt; enough to stop you from getting startled =\r\nwhen a really scary scene comes \n&gt; in the movie! You need to practice a lot=\r\n before that knowledge becomes \n&gt; natural and permanent and you stop gettin=\r\ng startled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, actionss without knowledge are useless too. One=\r\n keeps \n&gt; performing actions forever then. One watching a movie 1000 times =\r\nwithout \n&gt; the knowledge that it is unreal and should not be taken seriousl=\r\ny will \n&gt; get startled each time and enjoy the experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; In http://t=\r\ninyurl.com/homamwhy document (from WAVES 2010 conference), I \n&gt; gave an ana=\r\nlogy. Suppose one needs to walk to the top of a mountain. One \n&gt; with gyaan=\r\na but no karma is like a person standing at the base and \n&gt; staring at the =\r\npinnacle. He knows where to go, but he will remain at the \n&gt; base forever. =\r\nOne with karma but no gyaana is like a person going around \n&gt; the mountain =\r\nforever. One balancing karma and gyana, i.e. engaging in \n&gt; actions cocuple=\r\nd with the correct understanding that all is Brahman, is \n&gt; like a person c=\r\nlimbing the mountain and watching the top from time to \n&gt; time to correct o=\r\nne&#39;s course. He will eventually reach the pinnacle. \n&gt; Karma and gyaana nee=\r\nd to go hand in hand and are definitely not \n&gt; opposites or alternatives.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; is free from all the faults of samsaraf samsara, one does not find an=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; benefit out\n&gt; &gt; of actions which he has done or which he has to do.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Actions with attachment (i.e. actions with agyaana) can be criticized =\r\n\n&gt; and dismissed. But detached actions (i.e. actions with gyaana) should be=\r\n \n&gt; encouraged.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; This equating of liberation a=\r\nnd spiritual progress with akarma \n&gt; (inaction), instead of detached action=\r\n (nishkaama karma), is what led to \n&gt; the temporary downfall of Sanatana Dh=\r\narma in the world. This is \n&gt; pseudo-Vedanta and not the real deal.\n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n long as you self-identify with a body, desires arise from time to \n&gt; time.=\r\n The purer your conditioning is, the more dharmik those desires \n&gt; will be.=\r\n Perform the best action within your capability to fulfil those \n&gt; desires.=\r\n Once action is done, surrender it to the Lord and do not think \n&gt; about it=\r\n anymore. Whatever result comes, take it as God&#39;s will and do \n&gt; not regret=\r\n or rejoice. No pride and no shame. As you do this more and \n&gt; more, your c=\r\nonditioning will drop more and more and your consciousness \n&gt; will become p=\r\nurer and purer. Your conscience will speak louder and \n&gt; louder and your se=\r\nnse of dharma will be refined. Your desires will \n&gt; become more and more dh=\r\narmik. You will transition from fulfilling dharma \n&gt; towards individual sel=\r\nf to fulfilling dharma towards universal self. \n&gt; Eventually, you will reac=\r\nh a stage where you perform actions with no \n&gt; identification. Then action =\r\nbecome non-action.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, rishis etc also do not engage in ina=\r\nction. Instead, they \n&gt; engage in detached action for maintaining and suppo=\r\nrting the Cosmic \n&gt; Order, as determined by the Supreme Cosmic Being and Hi=\r\ns Shakti (his \n&gt; Kinetic aspect).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; One acts =\r\nonly when there is desire. A desireless man, whose desires \n&gt; &gt; have been\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; fulfilled, who has risen above desires, whose desire is the atman, has \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; no\n&gt; &gt; necessity to act.\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, everybody whose self-identi=\r\nfication with a body remains \n&gt; atleast to a small extent IS performing act=\r\nions continually. At the bare \n&gt; minimum, one performs actions like breathi=\r\nng, eating, drinking water, \n&gt; urinating and defecating, which affect the l=\r\nives of millions of \n&gt; micro-organisms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, one &quot;whose desire is t=\r\nhe atman&quot; still needs to perform actions \n&gt; to fulfil that desire and be es=\r\ntablished in atman always. Running away \n&gt; from actions and samsara will no=\r\nt free one from samsara.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sannyasa is absolu=\r\ntely necessary whether it be vividisha-sannyasa or \n&gt; &gt; vidvat-sannyasa.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Without perfect renunciation it is impossible to pursue the path of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBrahmavidya. ...\n&gt; &gt; it is foolish to cite instances of Janaka and others w=\r\nho did not take \n&gt; &gt; sannyasa but\n&gt; &gt; possessed Brahmajnana. Such instances=\r\n are quoted by householders who \n&gt; &gt; are unwilling\n&gt; &gt; to leave their attac=\r\nhments, for there is no reason why they should \n&gt; &gt; stick to\n&gt; &gt; household =\r\nlife after attaining knowledge. For knowledge by its very \n&gt; &gt; nature is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; against all senses of worldly duty and activity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, many people wh=\r\no quote such examples may indeed be unwilling to \n&gt; leave their attachments=\r\n and take sannyasa. However, it is not correct to \n&gt; think that external sa=\r\nnnyasa is a must for Self-knowledge. In fact, \n&gt; Vasishtha gave so many cri=\r\nteria and paths towards Self-knowledge in \n&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, but did no=\r\nt say that you have take sannyasa.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, there is an interesting st=\r\nory given by Vasishtha in that \n&gt; Vedanta epic. See the story of Chudala an=\r\nd Sikhidhwaja. King Sikhidhwaja \n&gt; leaves his wife and kingdom, becomes an =\r\nascetic, lives in a small hut in \n&gt; a forest for a few decades and spends a=\r\nll his time in meditation. Wife \n&gt; Chudala rules kingdom on behalf of her h=\r\nusband and becomes \n&gt; Self-realized. She later helps her husband in realiza=\r\ntion! So much for \n&gt; sannyasa being &quot;absolutely necessary&quot; for Brahmavidya!=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The sannyasin can find adequate leisure an=\r\nd freedom from the \n&gt; &gt; distractions of life.\n&gt; &gt; Renunciation is desirable=\r\n even to those who have not attained jnana. \n&gt; &gt; Only the\n&gt; &gt; sannyasin can=\r\n devote the whole time for meditation. Householders \n&gt; &gt; cannot give\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nemselves up completely for meditation.\n&gt; \n&gt; :-) If one can find some focus =\r\ndespire the distractions, one progresses \n&gt; faster. If one has no jnana and=\r\n mind tends to get distracted, then \n&gt; sannyasa may not help that much. Mer=\r\nely having more free time will not \n&gt; allow one to focus on god. One will g=\r\net all kinds of thoughts when \n&gt; meditating.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, we see sanny=\r\nasins getting caught engaging in sexual \n&gt; scandals and political scandals =\r\nnow-a-days. We see sannyasins fighting \n&gt; among themselves cheaply, to beco=\r\nme the heads of their mathas \n&gt; (monasteries). We see sannyasins trying to =\r\nraise their profile among \n&gt; devotees and politicians or to get better TRPs=\r\n on TV. We see sannyasins \n&gt; running after siddhis and talking about siddhi=\r\ns like a child may talk \n&gt; about chocolates. We see sannyasins trying to ra=\r\nise a lot of money for \n&gt; their mathas and resorting to cheap gimmicks for =\r\nit. When people not \n&gt; ready for sannyasa and having dense conditioning tak=\r\ne up sannyasa to \n&gt; have more &quot;leisure&quot; or escape from &quot;the distractions of=\r\n life&quot;, this is \n&gt; what happens!\n&gt; \n&gt; Remain in the material world and do s=\r\nadhana. Develop detachment from \n&gt; body and individual needs, compassion to=\r\n others, dispassion and \n&gt; detachment in actions, surrender to the Lord and=\r\n the ability to engage \n&gt; in powerful actions while being absolutely prepar=\r\ned for any end result. \n&gt; As you make progress, perhaps oneday you will be =\r\nready for sannyasa and \n&gt; it will just happen. Or perhaps you will become r=\r\nealized even without \n&gt; sannyasa. In either case, the end goal is internal =\r\ndetachment and \n&gt; self-realization and not external renunciation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyb=\r\nody who tells you that a *specific* external action or object is a \n&gt; *must=\r\n* for internal purification and liberation is over-selling it.\n&gt; \n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without abandonment of the concerns of worldly life, kn=\r\nowledge cannot \n&gt; &gt; be pursued\n&gt; &gt; with unabated vigor and devotion. It doe=\r\ns not mean that the sannyasin \n&gt; &gt; undervalues\n&gt; &gt; human society and discar=\r\nds all men without helping them at all. As the \n&gt; &gt; life of a\n&gt; &gt; sannyasin=\r\n is meant only to reach the highest Reality, and as he has \n&gt; &gt; already pas=\r\nsed\n&gt; &gt; through the lower stages of spiritual evolution, he may appear to b=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; not working\n&gt; &gt; for the rest of humanity at large; but it is to be b=\r\norne in mind that \n&gt; &gt; he exercises\n&gt; &gt; a silent and unnoticed but powerful=\r\n influence for the good of the \n&gt; &gt; public. That\n&gt; &gt; itself is the service =\r\nhe is rendering to the society and that is the \n&gt; &gt; highest and\n&gt; &gt; the mos=\r\nt beneficent service that one could ever do to man. One who is \n&gt; &gt; intent =\r\nupon\n&gt; &gt; realizing the peace, the bliss, the One Without a Second=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC&quot;Shantam, \n&gt; &gt; Shivam,\n&gt; &gt; Advaitam=C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot;is the most powerf=\r\nul and the useful friend of the world!\n&gt; \n&gt; Correct. But, not every sannyas=\r\nin may have enough &quot;spiritual evolution&quot; \n&gt; to exert such &quot;powerful influen=\r\nce for the good of the public&quot;. The \n&gt; question here is not whether one has=\r\n renounced X, Y, Z external things \n&gt; or not. The question is whether one h=\r\nas renounced ego, doership of one&#39;s \n&gt; actions and surrendered to the Supre=\r\nme Cosmic Being completely or not. \n&gt; One who has, whoever he is and wherev=\r\ner he is, has a highly purified \n&gt; consciousness and exerts a powerful subt=\r\nle influence on the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   =\r\n Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;         =\r\n              Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Na=\r\nrasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have great=\r\n respect for Swami Sivananda and commentary on &quot;Yoga \n&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham&quot; by h=\r\nis disciple Swami Venkatesananda is one of my \n&gt; &gt; favorite books.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHowever, I want to put my foot down and record my exception to some \n&gt; &gt; id=\r\neas expressed in this series. Swamiji may have been trying to \n&gt; &gt; inspire =\r\nsome sadhakas into the sannyasa order when he wrote this \n&gt; &gt; series and he=\r\n goes a bit overboard.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all members of =\r\nyour family will cling to you like leeches\n&gt; &gt;&gt; till the end of your life\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do not appreciate this tone at all. One can renounce if one wants.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; But, why belittle family members and call them leeches?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If on=\r\ne&#39;s wife wants to cling to one, because of her conditioning and \n&gt; &gt; spirit=\r\nual evolution, it is fine. She is not necessarily a bad person \n&gt; &gt; or a &quot;l=\r\neech&quot;. If one engages in dharmik and unselfish actions to make \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s w=\r\nife happy in various ways, as far as possible, it is not bad \n&gt; &gt; and does =\r\nnot imply an undesirable attachment. If one *expects* \n&gt; &gt; something from w=\r\nife in return, THAT expectation is bad. THAT \n&gt; &gt; expectation of something =\r\nback from wife is a leech that sucks blood \n&gt; &gt; from one&#39;s soul.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Se=\r\neing the world, people and objects as obstructions or temptations or \n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nleeches&quot; is silly. Being disgusted with the world is as much an \n&gt; &gt; attach=\r\nment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated with it! \n&gt; &gt; World and=\r\n people can exist and act in ways that may be natural to \n&gt; &gt; them. Whateve=\r\nr they do, they are never the problem or blockage for \n&gt; &gt; your own spiritu=\r\nal evolution. You may do various actions and give \n&gt; &gt; various things to va=\r\nrious people, based on kaarmik debts, and nothing \n&gt; &gt; you do is necessaril=\r\ny a bondage. Actions never bind you, it is \n&gt; &gt; expectation of specific res=\r\nults from those actions that binds you. \n&gt; &gt; Give freely and magnanimously;=\r\n and take whatever comes back naturally, \n&gt; &gt; with no excitement and no reg=\r\nret. Remove ANY expectation that may \n&gt; &gt; exist in your mind, from ANYONE, =\r\nand become completely free. THAT is \n&gt; &gt; true sannyasa or renunciation, not=\r\n seeing people as leeches that cling \n&gt; &gt; on to you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one becomes=\r\n a sannyasin because one is fed up with the world, it is \n&gt; &gt; probably a ba=\r\nd idea. When one discharges most of one&#39;s duties and \n&gt; &gt; responsibilities =\r\nto others, a sense of genuine renunciation will \n&gt; &gt; naturally develop. If =\r\none runs away from the world prematurely, Nature \n&gt; &gt; will drag one back la=\r\nter.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When Adi Shankara renounced, his m=\r\nother was very sad. But Adi Shankara \n&gt; &gt; did not see her as a leech. In fa=\r\nct, when she was on deathbed, he came \n&gt; &gt; all the way back and did her fin=\r\nal rites himself, though that was \n&gt; &gt; completely against the traditional n=\r\notions of sannyasa dharma. There \n&gt; &gt; is a big lesson in this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Acti=\r\nons and paying off your debts do not bind you. In fact, inaction \n&gt; &gt; and p=\r\nushing off a debt to future MAY bind you! It is expectation in \n&gt; &gt; what yo=\r\nu do and egoistic attachment to what you do (feeling proud or \n&gt; &gt; ashamed)=\r\n is what binds you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is only when yo=\r\nu take sannyasa that they will leave\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you free.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even to a sanny=\r\nasin, many people may cling. They may come for \n&gt; &gt; knowledge or wisdom or =\r\nto fulfil their pride related to doing good \n&gt; &gt; religious work. So many pe=\r\nople clung to Vivekananda and other monastic \n&gt; &gt; disciples of Ramakrishna.=\r\n If one expects something back from such \n&gt; &gt; followers, well-wishers and d=\r\nisciples (e.g. admiration, learning well, \n&gt; &gt; spreading knowledge or messa=\r\nge in the world, giving money for the \n&gt; &gt; religious order, etc), there is =\r\nno difference really between wife and \n&gt; &gt; children and them. In other word=\r\ns, attachment can form and bind you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What binds you is your attitud=\r\ne towards people and your expectations \n&gt; &gt; from people and NOT how much pe=\r\nople like you and how attached THEY are \n&gt; &gt; to you. To be free, you do not=\r\n need people to &quot;leave you free&quot;. You \n&gt; &gt; can be surrounded by thousands o=\r\nf people who are attached to you \n&gt; &gt; heavily and yet you can be free. Thei=\r\nr attachment binds *them*. To be \n&gt; &gt; free, have no attachment and no expec=\r\ntations. Give other whatever your \n&gt; &gt; body, mind and soul allow you to giv=\r\ne. Have no expctations of getting \n&gt; &gt; anythying back. Take whatever comes =\r\nback by itself. Simple!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you fall =\r\nsick You will be tempted to go in for their help and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; vice versa.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Vice versa&quot; is not a problem. Taking care of a sick person if one is \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; able to, whether it is wife or parents or children or someone else, is =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; not binding. If there is an expectation of a return favor, THEN it is =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; binding.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding taking help: Expecting anything from anyone=\r\n causes bondage, \n&gt; &gt; but taking what comes by itself, with neither excitem=\r\nent nor regret, \n&gt; &gt; does not cause bondage. Ma Sarada nicely demonstrated =\r\nthis once.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When Swami Yogananda was badly sick, Ma Sarada asked his=\r\n erstwhile \n&gt; &gt; wife (before sannyasa!) to come and serve him. That is so \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; unconventional! Swami Yogananda protested saying it will set a bad \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n example. But Swami Yogananda did not have any expectations and this \n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nas done voluntarily by his wife (or under the instruction of Ma \n&gt; &gt; sarada=\r\n, but not due to any expectations or pressure from Yogananda). \n&gt; &gt; After Y=\r\nogananda overcame his reservations, he was neither excited nor \n&gt; &gt; regretf=\r\nul. He accepted the service equanomously and not worrying about \n&gt; &gt; what o=\r\nthers will think or say.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, if one puts pressure on oneself a=\r\nnd wants to prove to the \n&gt; &gt; world how good one&#39;s renunciation us, THAT ma=\r\ny be an attachment. \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Expecting&quot; the world to see one&#39;s renunciation an=\r\nd appreciate one (or \n&gt; &gt; not criticize one) is a very subtle attachment. M=\r\na Sarada may have \n&gt; &gt; detected a subtle attachment and put Swami Yogananda=\r\n in a spot \n&gt; &gt; intentionally and made him overcome the attachment. Great t=\r\neachers \n&gt; &gt; like Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada teach subtle and valuable lesso=\r\nns in a \n&gt; &gt; practical way. It may not even be obvious to onlookers that th=\r\nere was \n&gt; &gt; a lesson there! This is how sadgurus operate..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Being able to renounce wife, children, parents, siblin=\r\ngs, house, car \n&gt; &gt; etc is a great thing. But, if one thinks that those are=\r\n &quot;all \n&gt; &gt; connections and ties&quot; that bind one, one is badly mistaken. Thos=\r\ne are \n&gt; &gt; the gross ones - the external ones. The biggest bondage is inter=\r\nnal. \n&gt; &gt; The identification with a body and identification with a subtle \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; individual identity (e.g. the notion that one is Narasimha, an \n&gt; &gt; eng=\r\nineer, a scholar, an astrologer etc) are much stronger bondages \n&gt; &gt; than a=\r\nny others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one&#39;s hands or legs are cut off or if a tiger is eati=\r\nng one alive \n&gt; &gt; or if one is suffering from a terrible disease, can one f=\r\nocus the mind \n&gt; &gt; on god and not think of the body and its suffering? If o=\r\nne thinks &quot;*I* \n&gt; &gt; am suffering&quot; and starts weeping, is one really free?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If someone praises a sannyasin for his renunciation, devotion to god=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; wisdom or spiritual attainment, will no sannyasin feel even a little=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; pride? If so, is one really free?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a sannayasin does sadhan=\r\na and experiences some special things or \n&gt; &gt; gets some siddhis, will it no=\r\nt give a little bit of pride or \n&gt; &gt; satisfaction? If so, is one really fre=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Focusing so heavily on external renunciation and making external=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; objects of attachment seem like a major thing, while ignoring the rea=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; attachment inside one (the sense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;these are mine&quot;=\r\n), \n&gt; &gt; is like beating up a tiger cub and feeling proud of the achievement=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; while ignoring the big tiget just lurking behind one and waiting to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; pounce on one!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me say one thin=\r\ng clearly. Sannyasa or external renunciation is an \n&gt; &gt; *attempt* to cut on=\r\neself off from a few external objects that cause \n&gt; &gt; temptation (and bonda=\r\nge!) internally. It is not a guarantee that \n&gt; &gt; internal temptations and b=\r\nondages are completely destroyed. The real \n&gt; &gt; bondage comes from the inte=\r\nrnal attachment and not from the external \n&gt; &gt; objects. Work hard on removi=\r\nng it. Do not despise the external objects \n&gt; &gt; or see them as &quot;leeches&quot; or=\r\n become fed up with them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                    ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;       Films that make a difference: http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 3,=\r\n 2011 at 2:00 PM, chaudhuri.krishnendu wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Sannyasa has got =\r\nits own glory and advantages!
