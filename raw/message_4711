I have also read that and certainly it=\r\n adds to the confusion.\n\nYou have mentioned and Rajarshi has seconded the l=\r\nogic that none of the claimants of recent times have those close associates=\r\n of the caliber which can match those inner circle disciples of Ramakrishna=\r\n. My doubt is that how do we know caliber of close associates of any saints=\r\n, Sadhus, Babas etc?...\n\nThis is a very tricky field which has almost no sa=\r\ntisfying answer. The Only answer can be found by realising by one self and =\r\neven then one will not be sure if one is being deluded or not.\n\nyours,\n\nUtp=\r\nal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; After you die, what would be your name and r=\r\neligion and nationality\n&gt;  \n&gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though religion u=\r\nsually stays the same, it CAN change. Nationality can of course change too.=\r\n Job, skills, external nature, looks, gender, even yoni (human, cow, goat, =\r\nchicken, tiger etc) can all change from birth to birth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Basically, th=\r\ne seed of one&#39;s new birth is formed at the time of one&#39;s death. As one&#39;s co=\r\nnnection is severed with the body, the last desires/thoughts/ponderings of =\r\nthe mind become the seed for the next life. Nature chooses for one a future=\r\n course that allows one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by one&#39;=\r\ns previous karmas and debts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is able to not entertain ANY desi=\r\nre as one element after another evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one becomes =\r\nliberated. All the spiritual sadhana we do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; when we see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; sh=\r\nall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt;  \n&gt; If I and you like each other =\r\nand your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they will start off taking=\r\n a liking to each other. If I and you dislike each other and your rebirth a=\r\nnd my rebirth meet each other, they will start off disliking each other. Th=\r\nis will happen without either being consciously aware of who one was and wh=\r\no the other person was, in the last life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead, if your question i=\r\ns how we can recognize that so and so person is a rebirth of Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda, so and so person is a rebirth of Paramahamsa Yogananda etc, the answer=\r\n is complex.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The reborn person may not look like the old person or do=\r\n similar work or have much *external* similarity. So it is difficult to &quot;re=\r\ncognize&quot; one. After all, Rama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle=\r\n), while Krishna had thousands of wives. Rama was a great warrior and kille=\r\nd Ravana in the biggest war of his times. Krishna was a key player in the b=\r\niggest war of his time, but did not take a weapon at all. The game can be d=\r\niffent in each coming..\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When it comes to re=\r\ncognizing the rebirth of a great soul, it can become a trap.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakris=\r\nhna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back after 100 years and t=\r\nhat everybody else who came with him would have to come back with him. When=\r\n Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did not have a choice=\r\n! Even Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once more. =\r\nThe Master said I am to come back once more with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you=\r\n have to come back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied, &quot;souls li=\r\nke that have great power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ramakrishna said tha=\r\nt people would get liberated en masse during his next coming and that would=\r\n be the last opportunity for a long time to come.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Interestingly, two =\r\ngood saints claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna since then. One of=\r\n them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good saint suggested that she is=\r\n the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said that he identified =\r\na particular young man as the reincarnation of Swami Vivekananda. Ramakrish=\r\nna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty disciples of a very h=\r\nigh caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they nearly moulded the dire=\r\nction of spiritual India for the next century. None of the claimants of reb=\r\nirthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the bill.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Th=\r\nus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It is =\r\nnot that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themselves and of cour=\r\nse ego is the root of delusion!\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, is it necessary to recognize=\r\n whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X and Y are different and play a d=\r\nifferent game? A small discussion on this point vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom/message/807\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though external factors=\r\n like nationality, religion, name, job, looks, gender etc can change, some =\r\ninternal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who one likes, who one disl=\r\nikes, what values one is attracted to internally, etc, may remain essential=\r\nly the same.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn a=\r\ns Muslim emperor Akbar (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and the ot=\r\nher was a Muslim. However, both were very brave, unafraid of death, inheren=\r\ntly spiritual, had a refined taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. Th=\r\ne previous connections with rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised=\r\n when his mother was hiding at a rajput household, before moving to Delhi. =\r\nDespite being a Muslim, he actually helped the Hindu causes (to the extent =\r\npossible at that time) by putting an end to barbaric practices like killing=\r\n defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in conquered places. He promote=\r\nd acceptance of other faiths, canceled pilgrimage taxes on Hindus and even =\r\ncame up with his own religion of humanity towards the end of his life by in=\r\ntegrating various religions. In one life, he tried to save India from invad=\r\ning barbarians. In another, he was born as a cultured man amid barbarians a=\r\nnd tried to save India by changing the ways of his own people. There is a s=\r\nubtle continuity in the agenda at a deeper level!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;           =\r\n        http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotish=\r\nWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;jyotish_van=\r\ni@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Lokesh_ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As nearly ALL of do except this=\r\n &quot;BABAJI&quot; Character described in Lahiri Mahashay (no connection with the ay=\r\nanamshaa that is causing lot of problems for many!), Yukteshwar and Yognand=\r\na and Kriya Yoga -- shall probably die and hopefully be born again -- here =\r\nis a simple question from a simpleton:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After you die, what would b=\r\ne your name and religion and nationality, when we see you again and do you =\r\nknow how we shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not bei=\r\nng FLIPPANT at all but just reminding you and myself how evanescent each of=\r\n us truly ARE!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rohiniranjan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
