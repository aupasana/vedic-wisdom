A yogi who considers each sensory experience as an \n&gt; &gt; aahuti (oblation)=\r\n to the agni (fire) of indwelling Self, does not get \n&gt; &gt; attached to senso=\r\nry experiences and remains free from attraction and \n&gt; &gt; aversion for them.=\r\n Whatever one sees (physically or within the mind!), \n&gt; &gt; whatever one hear=\r\ns (physically or within the mind), whatever touch one \n&gt; &gt; feels etc, one c=\r\nonsiders it a sacred offering to the fire of indwelling \n&gt; &gt; Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Similarly, whatever action one performs, one considers it as an offering \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; to the fire of all-pervading Self and remains free from the sense of \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; doership.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is the real internal homam performed by a libera=\r\nted yogi. This is \n&gt; &gt; the goal of sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, most of us ar=\r\ne not able to avoid attraction/aversion for \n&gt; &gt; various sensory experience=\r\ns and the sense of doership over actions. One \n&gt; &gt; needs to purify one&#39;s co=\r\nnsciousness to free oneself and prepare for this \n&gt; &gt; internal homam. One c=\r\nan perform an external homam to purify and prepare \n&gt; &gt; oneself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When one feels attraction or aversion for somet=\r\nhing one perceives \n&gt; &gt; physically or mentally, one can try to take a steo =\r\nback and consider the \n&gt; &gt; perception itself to be an offering to the fire =\r\nof Self or Brahman \n&gt; &gt; burning brightly inside one (and outside too). When=\r\n feels pride or shame \n&gt; &gt; for an action one performed, one can try to take=\r\n a step back and \n&gt; &gt; consider the action to be an offering to the fire of =\r\nSelf or Brahman \n&gt; &gt; burning brightly everywhere. Even a non-liberated pers=\r\non can try to \n&gt; &gt; alter one&#39;s thinking slowly, with practice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n  Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twi=\r\ntter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
