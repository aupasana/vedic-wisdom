W=\r\nhile different places and times have some difference in the nature and degr=\r\nee of spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywhere anytime, if th=\r\ne internal factors are conducive.\n \n(2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs =\r\nKalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind that any observation=\r\n is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual =\r\nenergy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What w=\r\ne are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental conditio=\r\nning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n=\r\n \n&gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/creative/\n&gt; =\r\ndestruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is\n&gt; re=\r\naching God, is it not enough?\n \nThe purpose of an idol is to evoke certain =\r\nimagery or thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular ener=\r\ngy or form of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that=\r\n form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be foc=\r\nused on that specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol.=\r\n Though we think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connect=\r\ned feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other peopl=\r\ne&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is work=\r\ning as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to foc=\r\nus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in an=\r\nother person too.\n \nHowever, there is some translation involved when though=\r\nts of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This =\r\ntranslation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we percei=\r\nve at the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!\n \nSuppose a foo=\r\nlish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess w=\r\nho kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control and makes =\r\none successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to=\r\n that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you ov=\r\nercome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to ha=\r\nppen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of ne=\r\ngative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.\n \nHowever, please note that th=\r\nis principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particula=\r\nr place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thought=\r\ns everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying the=\r\nre later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of=\r\n thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a repository as opp=\r\nosed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n \nHowever, please note that most people have =\r\nsome devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when =\r\nthey are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and =\r\nselfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus,=\r\n the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes consider=\r\nable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible p=\r\nractices without understanding what they are doing.\n \n&gt; is Idol worship ris=\r\nky?\n \nBottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.\n \n*        =\r\n*        *\n \n&gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?\n \nGod created man a=\r\ns his replica. But the replica got corrupted with time. Now, man needs to r=\r\necreate god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that he can go back =\r\nto the source and become free from this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/=\r\nconditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god correctly. He ends u=\r\np creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! The goal is to ke=\r\nep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep refining onese=\r\nlf and eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates god as a replic=\r\na of oneself, that god will match the god that created man in the first pla=\r\nce. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free from the cycle.\n \n*        =\r\n*        *\n \nI saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about resp=\r\nected spiritual leaders of other religions.\n \nIn general, please remember t=\r\nhat saying negative things about people that one may not have understood fu=\r\nlly or correctly is unwise.\n \nFrom time to time, the Lord may send someone =\r\nto a part of the world to maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhram=\r\na that is required in that part of the world at that time. One cannot judge=\r\n a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people=\r\n claiming to follow that person. Worse things may have happened if god did =\r\nnot send that person! If some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher =\r\nattained some level of realization, it means something. Let us not be harsh=\r\n in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise.\n \nIf one is unh=\r\nappy because of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a follow a yogi or=\r\n spiritual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will correct things =\r\nand change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to Nature and d=\r\no your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the=\r\n cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.\n \nBest regards,\nNa=\r\nrasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriti=\r\nngs\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Origi=\r\nnal Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom \n  Sent: Thursday, October 08, 2009 2:38 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Holy Places\n\n\n        Namaste,\n\n        To add to my query, a good nu=\r\nmber of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth=\r\n is one, how can it be so contradictory? \n\n        I can understand that a =\r\nIdol may contain a presence created by human imagination which maynot have =\r\na divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakal=\r\ni into an Idol.\n\n        But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/=\r\nnegative/creative/destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assumi=\r\nng that it is reaching God, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax =\r\ncollecter of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective o=\r\nf whether a divine presence is there or not there infront?\n\n        I would=\r\n like to mention a small incident here about someone I know well. There was=\r\n a certain individual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take =\r\ntime out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaaligha=\r\nt temple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to me=\r\ndiate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought=\r\n* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there =\r\nwas a distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thought=\r\ns as if there was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.  Als=\r\no a strong, sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Go=\r\nddess. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked mo=\r\nre than a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but a=\r\nll he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind tha=\r\nt night, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bottomline: a=\r\n nice spiritual experience.\n\n        Some months later he ended up meeting =\r\na very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.  =\r\nHe strongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting with the pers=\r\non was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that the=\r\nre is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.\n\n   =\r\n     Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not have a=\r\n divine presence why did this person suddenly have such a nice meditation t=\r\nhere?  Does it mean that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee whi=\r\nch counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether the=\r\n idol has any energy at all?\n\n        -Regards\n         Rajarshi\n\n        -=\r\n-- On Thu, 8/10/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n        =\r\n  From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n          Subject: Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n          To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n     =\r\n     Date: Thursday, 8 October, 2009, 8:24 PM\n\n           \n                =\r\nNamaste,\n\n                In this context of divine pressence, is Idol wors=\r\nhip risky?

However,=\r\n eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends =\r\non how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n\n                  Si=\r\nmilarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be fil=\r\nled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that pl=\r\nace or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it be=\r\ncomes weak and disappears.\n\n                  In many famous temples these =\r\ndays, priests have become commercial and do not have the devotion needed. T=\r\nhe rituals performed every few years to re-energize the idols \n\n           =\r\n       *        *        *\n\n                  It is my humble opinion that =\r\nsome famous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not=\r\n want to name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples =\r\nseem to have a powerful divine presence.\n\n                  I was very impr=\r\nessed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Gir=\r\nnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Mahars=\r\nhi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those plac=\r\nes. There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For exam=\r\nple, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at D=\r\nakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Ka=\r\nlighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n\n                  There was one s=\r\nmall temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to vi=\r\nsit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi hom=\r\nam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed li=\r\nke a small temple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there =\r\nwas a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even rememb=\r\ner the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my =\r\nmantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce god=\r\ndess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful=\r\n presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or =\r\nthe goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried t=\r\no put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire=\r\n accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open ai=\r\nr and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very p=\r\nleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of=\r\n the temple and goddess.\n\n                  Like this, I am sure there are =\r\nmany temples with a powerful divine presence across India.\n\n               =\r\n   Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences=\r\n when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I =\r\nam sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground cham=\r\nber there.\n\n                  *        *        *\n\n                  Even t=\r\nhe middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in=\r\n USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is =\r\nrajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any t=\r\nemple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there =\r\nis not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n\n    =\r\n              If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sad=\r\nhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n\n                  Mayapur, Da=\r\nkshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Ar=\r\nunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi,=\r\n Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, =\r\nVrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and U=\r\njjain in central India.\n\n                  There are many other good places=\r\n, but the above come to my mind.

If a spirit=\r\nual person imagines a particular energy or \nform of god in a particular obj=\r\nect on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets \n&quot;established&quot; in that ido=\r\nl. As time goes on, his mind&nbsp;can be focused on \nthat specific form fas=\r\nter and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we \nthink that our min=\r\nds are separate entities, they are all connected feebly and \nall of us are =\r\nable to perceive in some vague form other people&#39;s strong thoughts \nthat ar=\r\ne present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of \nsev=\r\neral spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seein=\r\ng \nthat idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, there is some translation involved when \nthought=\r\ns of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This \n=\r\ntranslation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we percei=\r\nve at \nthe end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;Suppose a foolish person thought while praying to \nan idol everyd=\r\nay of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings \npeople under=\r\n one&#39;s control&nbsp;and makes one successful. Suppose you focus on \nthat id=\r\nol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you \nsee=\r\n her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become \ndispassi=\r\nonate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that someone \nus=\r\ned that idol as a repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor \nobstruct=\r\nion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, please note that this principle works=\r\n \nwithout an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a c=\r\nhurch \nbench) and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Thos=\r\ne thoughts \nare present in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be=\r\n a little \nsusceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may =\r\nbe a&nbsp;little \nhigher when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to =\r\njust air.

Thus, =\r\nany negative and selfish \nthoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirab=\r\nle thoughts. Thus, the downside \nI mentioned is not a big deal.

There is a \n                  tremendous amount of spiritual energy i=\r\nn those places. There \n                  are several temples where the idol=\r\n is practically alive.

I never heard of that \n                  temple before and it seemed lik=\r\ne a small temple. The name of \n                  the&nbsp;form of the divin=\r\ne Mother&nbsp;present there was a \n                  Tamil language name an=\r\nd I did not understand it. I do not even \n                  remember the na=\r\nme now. But, when I closed my eyes and started \n                  meditatin=\r\ng with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled \n                  by =\r\na vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting \n                 =\r\n rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence \n                =\r\n  there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place \n          =\r\n        or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the \n         =\r\n         goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few \n        =\r\n          times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and \n =\r\n                 they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and n=\r\no \n                  roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, =\r\nI was \n                  very pleased with that temple.
