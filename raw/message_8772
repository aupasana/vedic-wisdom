I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi wen=\r\nt down the drain.&quot;\n\nTechnically what Aurobindo said was right. It is in fac=\r\nt mentioned in Mahabharata. When Pandavas did the Ashvamedha after the Maha=\r\nbarata war, Arjuna asks Krishna to tell him the Gita again as the earlier s=\r\nituation when he heard Gita was full of tension and he needs to reinforce i=\r\nt in his mind. It was then that Krishna reprimands Arjuna for having forgot=\r\nten and then says that he (Krishna) had forgotten the Gita and cannot tell =\r\nthat again. \n\nBut one needs to remember that its all God&#39;s play to convey t=\r\nhat  upadesha cannot be given so easily everytime it is asked. But the same=\r\n Krishna bestows Anu-Gita on Arjuna right after he said he had forgotten. A=\r\nnugeeta is pretty much a good summary of the same Bhagavad-Gita. How did th=\r\nat happen? :-)\n\nAnd the same Krishna much later during leaving his apparent=\r\n mortal body behind tells Uddhava-Gita to Uddhava. Uddhava Gita is much mor=\r\ne detailed and also more deep than the Bhagavad Gita that we all have come =\r\nto appreciate. How could the Lord that has forgotten tell more of it to Udd=\r\nhava later? \n\nThus it becomes pretty obvious how this drama has to be inter=\r\npreted when we see this incident not as stand alone but in the larger conte=\r\nxt of related events, Mahabharata and Bhagavat.\n\nRegards,\nAshutosh\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai,\n&gt; How are you doing? About 200 hundred ye=\r\nars ago, a man made a theory of creation in France. When Napolean asked whe=\r\nre is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. It makes things compl=\r\nicated.\n&gt; So is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or Grace or Pr=\r\notection in your theory.

Does the deities have even less =A0a=\r\nbility on earth plane.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I am sure this is not your theory. You have =\r\ntaken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain person reach a stage =\r\nin their spiritual path, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=A0co=\r\nmplete truth, when in fact it is=A0far from truth. Once=A0I saw in a articl=\r\ne that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it =\r\nafter few minutes or so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my re=\r\nspect for this yogi went down the drain.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Divine Mother, Her Love, H=\r\ner Grace Her Protection and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of our =\r\nhuman perception.

For me there is a=A0difference between a yogi and devotee.=A0 A devot=\r\nee rises due to Grace of Divine Mother or their Ishtdav. where as a yogi ri=\r\nses after a lot of huff and fuff, and they get stuck everywhere. I am sure =\r\nthere are only=A0devotee in this group. They may be doing haven or japa or =\r\nother devotional work.\n&gt; So nobody should=A0feel any sort of fear or pressu=\r\nre even for one second because there is no such hocus pocus zone to cross a=\r\nnd there is Grace of Divine Mother on all Her children.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; La=\r\nxmiNarayan\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is very different=\r\n due to Darshan and=A0Grace of Divine Mother & Divine Lord.

And the only parameters of judgement is to obj=\r\nectively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day consciou=\r\nsness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The field o=\r\nf experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it can b=\r\ne genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spi=\r\nritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand the=\r\nse things properly, but some pattern is observable.=A0 Not all experiences =\r\nare what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of=\r\n experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genuine and w=\r\nhich is non-genuine. This is the world of astral plane, driven by the overl=\r\napping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human bei=\r\nng. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (o=\r\nverlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=A0 is p=\r\nossible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation i=\r\nn this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of=\r\n varies character and hue who can very easily create an\n&gt;  expereince for a=\r\n sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/a=\r\nura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use =\r\nhim/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower extreme =\r\nof which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driv=\r\nen by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealo=\r\nusy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the =\r\nother extreme this layer can, if properly channalized as is done in genuine=\r\n Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manifest the=\r\n &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell, a genu=\r\nine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only to the extent that it helps to =\r\nmodify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the only true=\r\n test. Rest all the range of experiences that come from this realm, and 95 =\r\npercent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and f=\r\nury without substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it =\r\nthe intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got s=\r\nwept away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross =\r\nthis realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang o=\r\nn tightly to the fundamentals.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam=\r\n wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayama=\r\nnuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: vedic_pa=\r\nthak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday=\r\n, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

So always concentrate on your direction, not on speed=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For any genuine spiritual seeker, this is one of the sanest adv=\r\nices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, too many people get caught up in=\r\n the less important - aka, visions, &#39;experiences&#39;, tough-penances, complex =\r\nrituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetting the goal of real spirit=\r\nuality, that is transformation of mind/emotions/body resulting in greater s=\r\nurrender to the Divine, greater equanimity to life situations, an abiding c=\r\nalm and peace, genuine humility, lessening of lower emotions like lust, ang=\r\ner, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious attachments, such that eventually =\r\nevery action of the individual is like a consecration (sacrifice, yagjya) t=\r\no the Divine. A life so transformed and so away from our average superficia=\r\nl existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own. God is not the finis=\r\nh line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive unfolding of a transformati=\r\non process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complex rituals and speedy sadhanas and experiences et=\r\n al are ok, provided one does not lose sight of the fundamentals. THEN thes=\r\ne can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in circles and going nowhere=\r\n. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritual entity.
