I=\r\n wonder at how sure I was about things earlier,and how I cannot get into ar=\r\nguments anymore because my thought is &quot;what exactly is the whole truth?&#39;.St=\r\nrangely, I have become more vocal and firm when I feel something is wrong.I=\r\n lacked this confidence earlier.\nBecause of my husbands profession,I am req=\r\nuired to socialize a lot and often feel as if I am disconnected and watchin=\r\ng a film.Every second person sings songs about his achievements and greatne=\r\nss-all I can do is nod and smile (which incidently is enough encouragement =\r\nfor them to go on!). I feel like an outsider (though that doesn&#39;t upset me =\r\nin any way). I do worry about how we will continue for several years more w=\r\nithout paying a price professionally.But I am grateful for &quot;Their&quot; grace an=\r\nd am confident that &quot;They&quot; will give us the wisdom to deal with it.\n\nRegard=\r\ns,\nTilottama\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Can you pls share ur experiences like wha=\r\nt changes have come in you and \n&gt; all others who r doing chandi homam, pls =\r\nalso share ur experinces.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; First let me take it internally. I was =\r\nproud of my achievements, scholarship and clarity of thinking, several year=\r\ns back. I still am. But, when someone bluntly tells me that (very few dare/=\r\ncare to!), it does not upset me but makes me think now.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I used to e=\r\nxperience attacks of anger, jealosy, greed, delusion and lust quite\n&gt; often=\r\n. I still do. But I am able to resist better now and can \n&gt; recover and mov=\r\ne on quickly instead of suffering for a long time.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I used to readil=\r\ny write about some mystical experiences (sometimes in third person, i.e. wi=\r\nthout specifically mentioning that it was *my* experience), but the motivat=\r\nion was not only to inspire others to do sadhana but partly to &quot;impress&quot; ot=\r\nhers about my &quot;achievements&quot;. Now, I share something only if I genuinely fe=\r\nel that the experience or the disclaimer I mention at the end may inspire o=\r\nr caution or otherwise benefit someone. Now I hardly do it on public forums=\r\n anyway and do it with only a handful of people when an occasion comes.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Now, let me take it externally. When my company closed a business uni=\r\nt many months back, I had to move from a group where I had some clout to a =\r\ngroup where I was new. Though things are the same financially, there is a b=\r\nig change in the influence. But I am more relaxed than before.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I wa=\r\ns known as a good scholar and teacher of Jyotish and &quot;chairman&quot; of a Jyotis=\r\nh organization based on a parampara. I am alone now, and not even sure of b=\r\nasic calculations (e.g. ayanamsa, computation of certain divisional charts =\r\netc) even after experimenting with more possibilities than ever. Though I h=\r\nave not fully convinced myself what is correct, I have convinced myself tha=\r\nt whatever is out there is incorrect/incomplete (however, I keep teaching a=\r\nnd giving readings to some people who trust me, based on &quot;my best current u=\r\nnderstanding&quot;). I am more focused than ever in my Jyotish research, but do =\r\nnot feel any undue pressure to solve the puzzles like before.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Proba=\r\nbly this is=A0not=A0what you wanted to hear.. ;-) In any case, different pe=\r\nople may get different results based on their karmas, dasas, gochara etc.\n&gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; Now, on a serious note, those who are frustrated that their sadhana =\r\nis not producing results may do well to realize that Rome is not built in a=\r\n day. Vasanas that have been reinforced in our consciousness for many lives=\r\n cannot be overcome in a few years. Just keep doing sadhana..\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Aslo,=\r\n\n&gt;  what seems like a loss from one angle may seem from another angle like =\r\nliberation from some unneeded baggage. What seems like a gain from \n&gt; one a=\r\nngle may seem from another angle like an unneeded baggage that bogs one dow=\r\nn.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; As I keep insisting, please don&#39;t idolize me or anyone associate=\r\nd with homam movement. The whole idea behind homam is that Agni is the orig=\r\ninal preceptor of rishis and can ably guide anyone who surrenders to Him. I=\r\ngnore personalities, surrender to Agni and walk your walk.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;__________________________=\r\n______\n&gt; &gt;From: rakesh.behal &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, March 17, 2013 9:34 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] experiences of Chandi homam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Dear Narsimha ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nNavratris are about to come next month.About 6 years have passed since u st=\r\narted doing Chandi homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can you pls share ur experiences like what=\r\n changes have come in you and all others who r doing chandi homam, pls also=\r\n share ur experinces.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This will be great guidence for others also.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;regards\n&gt; &gt;Rakesh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
