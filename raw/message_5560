It will be available in JHora soon. I am using standard Jyotish techniques that I found to work well with the SSS calculations.]\n \nThis gentleman has the evil sign Scorpio rising with Mandi very close to lagna. This shows affliction of body by poisons. He was born in the last moments of Kartika Krishna Ashtami in Scorpio lagna and that can show some blessings of Kaala Bhairava. Though Scorpio has 4 planets, only Mars and Ketu are in first house (lagna is the beginning of first house and longitudes in the sign before lagna are in the visible half of the zodiac and hence in the 12th house). Mandi, Mars and Ketu in first house (Mandi is the closest to lagna) show a bold, heretic, hasty, unconventional and revolutionary person, who is afflicted by poisons. Sun and Jupiter are joined in the 12th house by 8th lord Mercury and 12th lord Venus. This can actually show powerful liberating experiences, which should be confirmed from D-20.\n \nIn D-20, lagna contains 12th lord Saturn, while 12th contains its other lord Rahu and Ketu. Lagna lord Jupiter joins 8th lord Venus. This too can show a man who experienced some things, i.e. a genuine mystic. But 9th lord Mars from Pi lagna is in Vi in badhaka sthana. This shows somebody who does not like dharma and organized religion. In D-9 (dharma), GK Mercury is afflicted by Rahu within a few arc-min in the 12th house and it shows one who is uncomfortable with and inimical (GK) to dharma.\n \nIn D-10, 10th lord Venus is in 9th (Ar) with Jupiter and it shows a teacher. Ar dasa as per Chara dasa of D-10 ran from 1984 to 1991. That is a time of some prominence as a teacher. Ta dasa (1991-2002) is also good as it is the 10th house.\n \nIf you look at D-30, Mars is the 8th lord in 7th and is maraka. He joins 6th lord Saturn and they both aspect lagna. They suggest dying from a serious disease. As per Chara dasa of D-30, Ar dasa (8th house) was running when he died from a brain tumor. At the time, Mars and Saturn (6th and 8th lords in natal D-30), along with Jupiter (7th lord of natal D-30), were transiting in Ar (dasa sign as per Chara dasa of D-30!) to trigger the event.\n \nParasara&#39;s teaching does suggest that D-30 may be an important chart for suffering and death. As a matter of fact, if you make varshaphal chart for 1999-2000, you will see that Moon and Saturn are the lords of 8th and 2nd/3rd from Sg lagna and they are together in Sg and Moon-Saturn antardasa as per Mudda dasa ran during 2000 April 2-7. He died on April 3!\n \nIf you see D-24, 5th lord Jupiter is in Sc lagna in a friendly sign, showing an intelligent person. Lagna lord Mars is in 8th showing an intellectual explorer. Venus and Moon afflicted by nodes were in the 2nd house of resources and forbidden substances and pleasures are a resource in his pursuit of knowledge.\n \nMandi being close to lagna in D-1 and Saturn (6th lord) aspecting lagna in D-30 do show addiction. So, I am afraid he was addicted to an extent to the psychodelic substances he was using.\n \nOverall, my impression is that he is an intelligent and inquisitive man who experienced some higher truths by design or by grace or by accident. But the chart does not show a liberated person or a great gyaani and shows someone with an addiction. Drugs cannot make one realize god, but they helped the exploration of his consciousness into the hidden truths. He was lucky as his method was fraught with risk. He was a man who achieved some clarity on what is what (though most drug addicts do not get ANY clarity), but not a full realization. Without mandi being too close to lagna in D-1 and 6th lord Saturn aspecting lagna in D-30, he could&#39;ve achieved more, perhaps using better means.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; observations about Soma drink\n \nThe views held by some on Soma plant referred in Veda are questionable. Veda is about Self-realization. Those who think Self-realization requires specific material substances are knowingly or unknowingly motivated by Aasuri (demonic) thinking that puts too much emphasis on the material plane. A lot of things mentioned in Veda are metaphors for internal things. Even yajnas (sacrificail rituals) mentioned in Veda are metaphors for internal activities. Sacrificing the I-ness, I-am-ness, I-do-ness and the overall individualized consciousness in the fire of fine discrimination is the true internal yajna that is the focus of Veda and not external rituals where ghee, grains etc are offered in an external fire, though we use the external fire to increase internal fire through resonance. Self-knowledge and the true bliss (sat-chid-aananda) comes only when the internal yajna is performed successfully and Veda focuses on various aspects of this yajna.\n \n*        *        *\n \nConsciousness is a strange thing. The whole universe exists in a microcosmic form within us and we have access to the entire universe, but we identify with a specific physical body and perceptions of its senses. Thus, we fail to perceive everything else that is out there and is accessible. Detaching the consciousness from body and senses is necessary to experience more. But consciousness is deeply attached to body and refuses to rise above it. It takes a lot of sadhana.\n \nIf a person stays home all the time, he cannot go out and see the town. If he wants to see the town, he should work on attitude, reduce the attachment to the house and leave the house calmly. If a person is so attached to a house that he cannot step out of the house and hires goons to beat him up and force him out of the house, that may force him to see a bit of the town, but one is not in the right mood or see the town in the correct light. One wanders around the house till goons leave and comes back into the house without seeing much of the town. One&#39;s attachment to the house is not overcome.\n \nSimilarly, taking psychodelic substances to have an out of body experience is like hiring goons to force one out of the house that one is very attached to and has problem leaving. One will not overcome attachment to the body in this manner and one&#39;s self-identification hangs aroung the body and returns to body as soon as the substances allow it.\n \nA better approach is to work on one&#39;s attitude and shed the attachment to the house (body). If the attachment is dropped, one will oneday voluntarily leave the house (body) to explore the town (universe). This is a more natural and less damaging approach.\n \nIn any case, a genuine sadhaka does not give a damn about out of body experiences and does not pursue any experiences or siddhis. One works on one&#39;s attitude, increases surrender to divine Will and removes weaknesses and likes/dislikes. Any experiences that come by themselves on the way are accepted, but they are neither sought after nor avoided. People like McKenna pursue these mystical experiences actively.\n \nImagine a hill that has dull scenery at the base and some beautiful scenery at higher altitudes and a pinnacle from which everything is visible. Materialistic people are like people living happily at the base. Sadhakas who do sadhana, get some experiences and get attached to them are like people driving a car on the mountain road, seeing nice mountain scenery on the way and camping there forever. Sadhakas like McKenna who use psychodelics are like people who get them thrown in the air from a hammock (to fall back) to see some high altitude scenery. Genuine sadhakas are like people who keep driving the car without being distracted by the beautiful scenery and reach the pinnacle finally.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;J.&quot; &lt;jkoperumcholan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; This chart is of Terence McKenna (www.deoxy.org.mekenna.htm).

He experimented with psychedelic drugs,and his observations about Soma drink, and his knowledge of various gods and goddesses are breathtaking and profound. Many are slaves to his Videos in You Tube, because he has such a musical voice, which many consider just listening him itself is a drug-trip. Some see him as a mystic and some see him as a wastrel.
