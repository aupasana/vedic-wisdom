If you look at the nights before Vijaya Dasami, then there are ten nigh=\r\nts instead of nine this year. This happens sometimes.\n=C2=A0\nIf you live on=\r\n US east coast, then Chaturthi comes twices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 &=\r\n 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and extended into Friday. Panchami was o=\r\nn Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (=\r\nOct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIf one&#39;s parents did not do a proper &quot;anna praasana&quot; ritual (the ritual=\r\n of first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, should one consider ones=\r\nelf not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a mantra because of no in=\r\nitiation is basically like that.\n=C2=A0\nGetting initiation is good, especia=\r\nlly if the one initiating has some level of sadhana in that mantra. But it =\r\nis neither necessary nor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nIf you see my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A millio=\r\nnaire may open a bank account in his son&#39;s name with a starting balance of =\r\na million dollars. This is akin to a good guru initiating a sishya in a man=\r\ntra. Sishya starts off by getting some of guru&#39;s attainment. But the son ma=\r\ny waste those million dollars and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya=\r\n may fall and not achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to g=\r\nive money and may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate million=\r\ns of dollars with own effort. This is akin to=C2=A0a person doing sadhana w=\r\nith a mantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.\n=C2=A0\nSo=\r\nme people hold the view that mantras cannot be chanted without a proper &quot;in=\r\nitiation&quot; . This view is especially prevalent in some sections of society w=\r\n.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with that view.\n=C2=A0\nIf you kno=\r\nw the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an initiating guru have done fo=\r\nr you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given some of his attainment in the mantra to yo=\r\nu. Well, you can do it yourself if you work hard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taught=\r\n you the right nyasas to be done before the mantra. Well, you can get the n=\r\nyasas from books too. Moreover, what most people do today for nyasas is any=\r\nway just a ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means placement. You pla=\r\nce various sounds in various body parts (like the tips of various fingers, =\r\nheart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some signals while say=\r\ning the sounds. This &quot;placement&quot; is actually supposed to be an internal act=\r\n and it creates an ideal environment for the repetition of mantra. Due to t=\r\nhe external actions, what is supposed to occur internally does not occur in=\r\n most. So the sounds end up not getting properly placed in the body. In oth=\r\ner words, what I am trying to say is that most people do\n not know how to &quot;=\r\nplace&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in various body parts. They merely perform meaningl=\r\ness ritualistic actions. So, if you do not know nyasas, you are not really =\r\nmissing much compared to others who were initiated.\n=C2=A0\nIn my humble opi=\r\nnion, the most important qualification is to have devotion and sense of sur=\r\nrender to Her. If you have them, you can consider yourself &quot;highly initiate=\r\nd&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisd=\r\nom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \nFrom: Chandra Prakash \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nSent: Sunday=\r\n, October 05, 2008 11:16 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Navaratri...\n\n\n\n\nDear N=\r\narasimha,\n\nWhen does Navratri end?
