O=\r\nf course if there were no snakes ever the\n&gt; mind would have never seen it w=\r\nould have never thought the rope as a snake.\n&gt; Snake and rope are real. Its=\r\n as simple as that.\n&gt;\n&gt; When watching a movie I know that actors are mouthi=\r\nng dialogues written by\n&gt; somebody else. I don&#39;t become the movie or become=\r\n a character in the movie\n&gt; before, during or after the movie.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence wh=\r\ny I said it was an imperfect analogy.\n\n&gt;  If doing is a figment of our mind=\r\ns , who is doing what ? Is a real mind\n&gt; doing real things ? Is an unreal m=\r\nind doing real things ?Is an unreal mind\n&gt; doing unreal things ? Oh wait, i=\r\ns mind real or unreal ?Take your pick.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s not that simple. It is real=\r\n to us, because we are a part of it, within\nit. But the &quot;fabric&quot; itself, as=\r\n it were, is just quantum foam soup,\ncompletely chaotic (well, technically =\r\nstochastic) in apparent patterns,\nfractals are an excellent way to understa=\r\nnd what I&#39;m getting at. They are\ndrawn from specific calculations in which =\r\npure randomness is introduced. And\nyet each one &quot;fits itself&quot; into a patter=\r\nn and repeats that pattern again and\nagain.\n\nWhen Lord Krishna gave Arjuna =\r\ndivya Drishti ,Arjuna never saw an unreal\n&gt; world.He continued to do his Ka=\r\nrma without having doubts of real vs unreal.I\n&gt; don&#39;t see anywhere in BG wh=\r\nere Krishna says universe is a creation of mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you keep denouncing=\r\n the world as unreal I&#39;m afraid it may lead to a\n&gt; state of Tamas.If you sa=\r\ny everything you see is Maya then is Maya real or\n&gt; unreal ?\n&gt;\n&gt; lol. I&#39;m n=\r\not denouncing anything. Science has proven it&#39;s unreal. Yes, it\n*may* lead =\r\nto Tamas. However, to me it has lead to to Sattva (not that I&#39;m\nSattvic, bu=\r\nt I&#39;m magnetically geared in that direction). To say &quot;it is god&#39;s\nwill&quot; mak=\r\nes no sense to me, but that is the makeup of the karmas I am\nworking with. =\r\nBut to just adopt the scientific viewpoint &quot;it&#39;s just quantum\nsoup, nothing=\r\n is real&quot; and that&#39;s it, leads to Tamas and nihilism, IMO. It&#39;s\nwhy I becam=\r\ne drawn to Vedic thought, from atheism and before that a\nconservative Catho=\r\nlic upbringing. Long way to go, no?\n\n&gt; To me putting the teachings of Bhaga=\r\nvad Geeta into practice itself is a\n&gt; long journey and may take many life t=\r\nimes. If you guys already realized that\n&gt; world is unreal by Advaita logic =\r\nor otherwise tand you are indeed Brahman,\n&gt; more power to you.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I sta=\r\nted, I got the idea from Science. My arrival to the feet of the\nRishis came=\r\n because they already knew it, even without the electron\nmicroscope and oth=\r\ner advanced technology.\n\n&gt; Anyways I would like to close my posts on this t=\r\nopic. I have no vendetta\n&gt; against Advaita or Advaitins. Advaita just does =\r\nnot make sense to me and no\n&gt; where in Geeta I find Advaita.\n&gt;\n&gt; You do not=\r\n have to have a vendetta to disagree, I find that to be an\nillogical extrap=\r\nolation. Do I agree with everyone? No. Does that\nautomatically mean I have =\r\na vendetta against them?\n\nAnyway, if Gita is where you find your Heart, the=\r\nn there it belongs. You\nseemed to me to be genuine, so I offered my opinion=\r\n.\n\n&gt;  Vedic wisdom is not just Advaita. There are many schools of thought t=\r\nhat\n&gt; have challenged and continue to challenge Advaita.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is true, =\r\nof course.\n\n&gt;  I hope my posts help people who are beginning their spiritua=\r\nl journey use\n&gt; their rationale to conclude as to what is real and what is =\r\nnot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Jai\n&gt;\n&gt; PS: My wife&#39;s lagna is Mithuna as well. She rarely has any=\r\n interest in\n&gt; intellectual discussions. Dividing the population in to 12 k=\r\ninds of people\n&gt; is a bit too simplistic.There are various factors to look =\r\nin a Kundali while\n&gt; trying to find out one&#39;s spiritual inclination.\n&gt;\n&gt; lo=\r\nl. I was trying to be funny, actually. My sense of humor is a bit too\ndry, =\r\nI have learned. Of course you are correct.\n\nAnyway, this list is absolutely=\r\n wonderful. Many people of varying\nbackgrounds come together in mutual resp=\r\nect and I have been very impressed\nand comfortable here.\n\nkrisnath\n\n&gt;\n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; Krisna=\r\nth &lt;krisnath5@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Adesh!

Is Karma even unreal ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One =\r\ndoes not &quot;do Karma&quot;. If anything, Karma does one. It is merely an\n&gt; &gt; extra=\r\npolation of the law of cause and effect which operates on everything\n&gt; &gt; wi=\r\nthin the material plane, but reflects the Ego&#39;s tendency to grasp, own,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n and separate in order to label it as something other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yoga Vas=\r\nhista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere are experienced\n&gt; &gt; by us;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; there is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Okay. How does this statement prove world is unreal ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus sci=\r\nentists are veering round to the conclusion that since every\n&gt; &gt; object is =\r\na sum of its qualities and these\n&gt; &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the who=\r\nle objective universe of matter\n&gt; &gt; and energy, atoms and stars does not ex=\r\nist except as a construction of\n&gt; &gt; consciousness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which scientist =\r\nsays universe is a construction of consciousness ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Why does conscio=\r\nusness construct anything ? Why can&#39;t it just be as it\n&gt; &gt; is ? What is the=\r\n need for an unreal world ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I understand your point about consc=\r\niousness. I agree that it just &quot;Is&quot;,\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; that the extrapolation of &quot;d=\r\noing&quot; is only a figment of our minds and egos\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; order to try and und=\r\nerstand it. The funny thing is, though, that only\n&gt; &gt; consciousness can und=\r\nerstand consciousness. All we can do is invent\n&gt; &gt; languages and stumble ar=\r\nound trying to square &quot;it&quot; in our organic brains.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, the univ=\r\nerse really is, on a level of actuality, unreal. It\n&gt; seems\n&gt; &gt; real to us =\r\nbecause we are also characters in the same movie. A quick\n&gt; study\n&gt; &gt; of qu=\r\nantum psychics will swiftly show you that. There is no such thing as\n&gt; &gt; &quot;s=\r\nolid&quot; material, the closest this universe gets to solidity (and hence\n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nrealness&quot;) is a black hole, which is so out of place that it rips apart\n&gt; t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; fabric of space and time, so that not even light, a massless particl=\r\ne (a\n&gt; &gt; paradox if there ever was one) can escape its grasp. Similarly, th=\r\nough on\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; different level of course, the Ego tries to find and create=\r\n solidity on\n&gt; &gt; earth which draws Chaos to it, which requires further cons=\r\ntructions of\n&gt; &gt; solidity (&quot;beliefs&quot;) to bolster it. The only thing that al=\r\nlows the\n&gt; &gt; appearance of &quot;things&quot; as &quot;separate&quot; from other &quot;things&quot;, is\n&gt;=\r\n electromagnetic\n&gt; &gt; energy, or shakti, in her symbolic form as Maya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; India (Bharat) has come up with many scientific ideas that form the basi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; (foundation) of Western science. *And they did it through meditation =\r\non\n&gt; &gt; Consciousness*.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93We owe a lot to the Ind=\r\nians, who taught us how to count, without which\n&gt; no\n&gt; &gt; worthwhile scienti=\r\nfic discovery could have been made.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC - Albert Einstein\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Carl Sagan:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;The tenth episode of COSMOS is largely about cosmology=\r\n - the study of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; universe in a perspective in which the Earth is l=\r\nike a grain to stand in\n&gt; &gt; vast beach or desert - and the way we approach =\r\nthe subject is through\n&gt; Hindu\n&gt; &gt; cosmology. ... But the main reason that =\r\nwe oriented this episode of\n&gt; COSMOS\n&gt; &gt; towards India is because of that w=\r\nonderful aspect of Hindu cosmology\n&gt; which\n&gt; &gt; first of all gives a time-sc=\r\nale for the Earth and the universe -- a\n&gt; &gt; time-scale which is consonant w=\r\nith that of modern scientific cosmology.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; As far as I know. It is =\r\nthe only ancient religious tradition on the Earth\n&gt; &gt; which talks about the=\r\n right time-scale.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Few are the scientists that are brave enough to=\r\n stand up and grant Bharat\n&gt; &gt; her rightful inheritance, because they suffe=\r\nr from their own cultural\n&gt; &gt; xenophobia and religious bigotry, but that is=\r\n a whole different\n&gt; subject....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is possibly only an assumption =\r\nthat the universe is a construction of\n&gt; &gt; Consciousness, however, Consciou=\r\nsness is one of the only &quot;things&quot;, if not\n&gt; &gt; the *only* thing, that can ne=\r\nver be &quot;this&quot;. Take away everything that is\n&gt; &gt; &quot;This&quot;, and the only thing =\r\nleft is &quot;That&quot;. It&#39;s sort of how 2 hydrogen\n&gt; &gt; molecules electromagnetical=\r\nly bond with one oxygen molecule, and &quot;Live&quot;\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; what we humans have l=\r\nabeled &quot;Water&quot;. There is no such thing as &quot;water&quot;,\n&gt; per\n&gt; &gt; se, there are =\r\nonly electrons, protons, and neutrons -etc.- bumping around\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; a vast=\r\n sea of Chaos, the substratum, what we call Brahma.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; By the way, I a=\r\nm a Caucasian, American by birth, who considered himself\n&gt; an\n&gt; &gt; atheist f=\r\nor many years (I presently live in India and am Hindu). When I\n&gt; &gt; discover=\r\ned the greatness of the Rishis, the Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I\n&gt; &gt; realized=\r\n how much *more* splendid this planet could be with the Sanatana\n&gt; &gt; Dharma=\r\n respected for the greatness, beauty, and Truth it holds and\n&gt; bestows\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nupon us, who are also That (Consciousness is not divided as the Upanishad\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; states &#39;take the full from the full, and the full remains.&#39; I don&#39;t\n&gt; of=\r\nfhand\n&gt; &gt; recall the attribution.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just questioning certain=\r\n basic assumptions of Advaita\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; They are also &quot;assumptions&quot; that =\r\nhave been laboratory tested in the halls\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; science and proven sound.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; which seem to be totally opposite of what Bhagavad Gita is say=\r\ning. In\n&gt; &gt; fact what you are saying leads to nihilism which is what Buddhi=\r\nsts say.\n&gt; If\n&gt; &gt; you agree that you believe in Buddhism we can move on. Bu=\r\nt if you say all\n&gt; &gt; what you are saying is in Vedas , then I will question=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nihilism is an attitude of defeatism. It is not an attitude o=\r\nf respectful\n&gt; &gt; worship towards this great mystery that we call the univer=\r\nse, the cosmos,\n&gt; &gt; which we are a part of; and Life itself, which animates=\r\n us and all other\n&gt; &gt; living things.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I consider every &quot;thing&quot; as &quot;a=\r\nlive&quot;. The main difference in us is that we\n&gt; &gt; have a brain which allows u=\r\ns access to levels of Understanding not\n&gt; possible\n&gt; &gt; without a complex sy=\r\nmbolic language. There is no difference between me,\n&gt; you,\n&gt; &gt; a drop of wa=\r\nter, a worm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance due to Maya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hav=\r\ne a Mithuna Lagna (which should be obvious!) so I tend to think of\n&gt; &gt; thin=\r\ngs on an intellectual level. However, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati\n&gt; (different\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; facets of shakti) makes it easy for my human mind to grasp the Dance of\n&gt;=\r\n Life\n&gt; &gt; and Existence, and I stand in awe before this great tapestry of B=\r\nrahman&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; dream.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one =\r\naspect of the universe\n&gt; (the\n&gt; &gt; Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) an=\r\nd grants it an all-encompassing\n&gt; &gt; power over all that is. A Shivaite woul=\r\nd say that the Destructive aspect\n&gt; &gt; (entropy) is actually the engine of l=\r\nife, and hence Shiva is the God of\n&gt; &gt; Gods. A Shakta would say that since =\r\nShakti is responsible for the\n&gt; appearance\n&gt; &gt; of apparent reality, then Sh=\r\ne is the God of Gods.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I say only that Thou Art That, there is no Ot=\r\nher. And this draw towards\n&gt; one\n&gt; &gt; Form of Divinity or another, or the Ad=\r\nvaitin draw towards the Formless\n&gt; &gt; Divine, is based on, i.e. has its foun=\r\ndation in, one&#39;s Karma. And hence\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s Karma *does* drive one on, like=\r\n a chariot driver. The BG contains\n&gt; &gt; many, many wonderful Truths.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; PS : I&#39;m not a Dvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I do not want to start\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; another Dvaita v/s Advaita thread on this forum.There have been many such=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; threads going on on the internet without any value.

Matter and energy\n&gt; &gt; became\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interchangeable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Max Plan=\r\nck, famous for his quantum theory, added a further dimension\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhis, stating that it is consciousness that is fundamental and that\n&gt; &gt; matt=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a derivative of consciousness. As a corollary even space and ti=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are =\r\nveering\n&gt; &gt; round to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the conclusion that since every object is a sum =\r\nof its qualities and\n&gt; &gt; these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the who=\r\nle objective universe of matter\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; energy, atoms and stars does =\r\nnot exist except as a construction of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga=\r\n Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere are experienced\n&gt; &gt; by us=\r\n;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienced by us=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real. It =\r\nis real as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahman or Consciousness. The world we see and experience =\r\nwith our\n&gt; &gt; senses is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a product of the mind; the mind is a part of t=\r\nhe ego, which rises from\n&gt; &gt; Pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Consciousness, which is the same as=\r\n Reality. One has to realize That\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just Be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot; Ramana Smrti\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Source: http://=\r\nwww.arunachala.org/newsletters/2009/?pg=3Dsep-oct\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83 =C3=82=C2=B0&quot;=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=\r\n=B0=C3=82=C2=A8=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=AE=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C2=B9 =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=AD=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC&quot;=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B5=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=A4=C3=83 =\r\n=C3=82=C2=B1=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C2=A1\n&gt; =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B6=C3=83 =\r\n=C3=82=C2=B1 =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B0=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1=C3=A2=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=AC =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B0=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=AE=C3=\r\n=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=A3=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=BE=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=\r\n=B0=C3=82=C2=AF\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=AA=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1 =\r\n=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B0=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B6=C3=83 =C3=82=\r\n=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=BE=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=\r\n=B0=C3=82=C2=A4=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1\n&gt; =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=85&quot;=C3=83 =C3=\r\n=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B2=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B8=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=A4=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1 =C3=83=\r\n =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B0=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=AA=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1 =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=B0=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C2=A1=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=AE=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C2=A1 =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B6=\r\n=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=BE=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B6=C3=83 =C3=82=\r\n=C2=B1\n&gt; =C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=B5=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=A4=C3=\r\n=83 =C3=82=C2=B0=C3=82=C2=AE=C3=83 =C3=82=C2=B1\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd1a0f87e3870048567005e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nHi!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Fri, Apr 30, 2010 at 2:38 AM, jaid=\r\nixit74 &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:jaidixit74@...&quot;&gt;jaidix=\r\nit74@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204=\r\n); padding-left: 1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color: rgb(=\r\n255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n  =\r\n    \n      &lt;p&gt;Hello Kris,&lt;br&gt;\nYou are an American in India and I&#39;m an I=\r\nndian in America :)&lt;br&gt;\nIts definitely your Purva Punya that brought you to=\r\n India and let you study Sanatan Dharma philosophy. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe rope-snak=\r\ne , movie characters speaking to each other, dream-wake examples don&#39;t =\r\nmake sense to me.

It is the only ancient religious traditi=\r\non on the Earth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; which talks about the right time-scale.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Few are the scientists that are brave enough to stand up and=\r\n grant Bharat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; her rightful inheritance, because they suffer from t=\r\nheir own cultural&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; xenophobia and religious bigotry, but that is a =\r\nwhole different subject....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is possibly only an assum=\r\nption that the universe is a construction of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Consciousness, howeve=\r\nr, Consciousness is one of the only &quot;things&quot;, if not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the=\r\n *only* thing, that can never be &quot;this&quot;. Take away everything tha=\r\nt is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This&quot;, and the only thing left is &quot;That&quot;=\r\n. It&#39;s sort of how 2 hydrogen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; molecules electromagnetically bo=\r\nnd with one oxygen molecule, and &quot;Live&quot; as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what we human=\r\ns have labeled &quot;Water&quot;.

When I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; discovered the greatness of th=\r\ne Rishis, the Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; realized how much *more* =\r\nsplendid this planet could be with the Sanatana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dharma respected f=\r\nor the greatness, beauty, and Truth it holds and bestows&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; upon us, =\r\nwho are also That (Consciousness is not divided as the Upanishad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; s=\r\ntates &#39;take the full from the full, and the full remains.&#39; I don&#3=\r\n9;t offhand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; recall the attribution.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n     I&#39;m just questioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; They are also &quot;assumptions&quot; that have been l=\r\naboratory tested in the halls of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; science and proven sound.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     which seem to be totally opposite of what  Bhagav=\r\nad Gita is saying. In&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fact what you are saying leads to nihilism w=\r\nhich is what Buddhists say. If&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you agree that you believe in Buddh=\r\nism we can move on. But if you say all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what you are saying is in V=\r\nedas , then I will question.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nihilism is an at=\r\ntitude of defeatism. It is not an attitude of respectful&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worship t=\r\nowards this great mystery that we call the universe, the cosmos,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; w=\r\nhich we are a part of; and Life itself, which animates us and all other&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; living things.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I consider every &quot;thing&quot; =\r\nas &quot;alive&quot;. The main difference in us is that we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have a =\r\nbrain which allows us access to levels of Understanding not possible&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; without a complex symbolic language. There is no difference between me, =\r\nyou,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a drop of water, a worm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance =\r\ndue to Maya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have a Mithuna Lagna (which should be obv=\r\nious!) so I tend to think of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; things on an intellectual level. Howe=\r\nver, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati (different&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; facets of shakti) makes it e=\r\nasy for my human mind to grasp the Dance of Life&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and Existence, an=\r\nd I stand in awe before this great tapestry of Brahman&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; dream=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspect =\r\nof the universe (the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and gr=\r\nants it an all-encompassing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; power over all that is. A Shivaite wou=\r\nld say that the Destructive aspect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (entropy) is actually the engin=\r\ne of life, and hence Shiva is the God of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Gods. A Shakta would say =\r\nthat since Shakti is responsible for the appearance&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of apparent re=\r\nality, then She is the God of Gods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I say only that Thou=\r\n Art That, there is no Other. And this draw towards one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Form of Di=\r\nvinity or another, or the Advaitin draw towards the Formless&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Divin=\r\ne, is based on, i.e. has its foundation in, one&#39;s Karma. And hence&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; one&#39;s Karma *does* drive one on, like a chariot driver. The BG con=\r\ntains&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; many, many wonderful Truths.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   =\r\n  PS : I&#39;m not a Dvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I do not want to start&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; another Dvaita v/s Advaita thread on this forum.There have been man=\r\ny such&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; threads going on on the internet without any value.

Physicists chased them further and b=\r\nroke them&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; down to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; nucleus, electrons, quanta, wa=\r\nves, particles, and fields. Einstein&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; said that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; t=\r\nhe universe of our experience consists of matter and energy in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n   &gt; space-time-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D mc2,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; where C is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; a constant representing the velocity=\r\n of light. Matter and energy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; became&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; interchangea=\r\nble.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; Max Planck, famous for his quantum theory, added a f=\r\nurther dimension&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; this, stating that it is con=\r\nsciousness that is fundamental and that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; matter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; i=\r\ns a derivative of consciousness. As a corollary even space and time&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; only concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientis=\r\nts are veering&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; round to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; the conclusion that sinc=\r\ne every object is a sum of its qualities and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &g=\r\nt; qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of matter&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; energy, atoms and stars does not exist except =\r\nas a construction of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;     &gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere a=\r\nre experienced&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; by us;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; there is nothing here anyw=\r\nhere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n     &gt; Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real.
