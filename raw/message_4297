As their thinking evolves, they think of the world instead of their own problems.\n \nJust a word on &quot;peace around the world&quot;..\n \nPeace is a great ideal, but sometimes long-lasting peace requires chaos and destruction in the short-term. Rama did not make peace with Ravana, but killed him in a war and that brought peace in the world.\n \nWe should pray for &quot;dharma&quot; in the world instead of &quot;peace&quot;. If dharma is not there, peace will be short-lived.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; You are very right!! There is so much chaos around the world especially India that we all need to focus on peace. I started homam for a better life for myself but soon realised that the problems going on around the world is nothing in front of mine. I started dedicating all my homams/prayers for peace around the world and request others who aren&#39;t doing so to do the same. The world needs us and the least we can do is pray. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Priya\n\n\n"}}
