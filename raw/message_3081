I am going to follow the advice. Anyway=\r\n, I have some other questions now. I have learnt how to perform Ganapathi H=\r\nomam and Gayatri Homam from our local priest (we used to call him Sharmaji.=\r\n He is no longer here and moved to Texas) here in Michigan. He taught me a =\r\nprocedure called &quot;Chatushpatra Prayogam&quot; that I use for these Homams. I hav=\r\ne also reviewed your pdf files, the audio mp3s and videos for many homams t=\r\nhat have been described in your site and noticed that your documents do inc=\r\nlude what Our priest taught and more. So, I am thinking of following your p=\r\nrocedure. Also, Our Sharmaji used to perform the homam in our Wood Burning =\r\nFire Place. From your video, I understand that you are doing it in open, in=\r\n a room. How do you control Smoke so that it won&#39;t darken the ceiling and t=\r\nhe walls? Is it ok to do it in Wood Burning fire place? The only problem I =\r\nsee in doing it in fireplace is that I cannot do pradakshinam to the fire (=\r\nin case that is needed), and it is not convenient to reach back of the homa=\r\n kundam to put the darbhas and other puja materials. Also more than one Rit=\r\nvik cannot do the homam in case I am involving other people. How much do th=\r\nese matter? One other procedure our Sharmaji instructed is that it is prefe=\r\nrable that Ganapathi homam be performed on Shukla Chaturthi and before the =\r\nsunrise and he said that we should put modakas in the fire. What do you say=\r\n about those aspects. I know purity of mind and sincerety in performing thi=\r\ns ritual is of paramount importance than the ritualistic details, but I wan=\r\nt to follow the prescribed procedures to the extent possible. \n\n\n"}}
