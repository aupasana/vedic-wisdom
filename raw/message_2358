Let me tell you as one\nwho=\r\n has been working =97 at least trying to work =97 all his life, that there =\r\nis\nno regeneration for India until you be spiritual. Not only so, but upon =\r\nit\ndepends the welfare of the whole world. For I must tell you frankly that=\r\n the\nvery foundations of Western civilisation have been shaken to their bas=\r\ne.\n\nThe mightiest buildings, if built upon the loose sand foundations of\nma=\r\nterialism, must come to grief one day, must totter to their destruction\nsom=\r\ne day. The history of the world is our witness. Nation after nation has\nari=\r\nsen and based its greatness upon materialism, declaring man was all\nmatter.=\r\n Ay, in Western language, a man gives up the ghost, but in our\nlanguage a m=\r\nan gives up his body. The Western man is a body first, and then\nhe has a so=\r\nul; with us a man is a soul and spirit, and he has a body.\nTherein lies a w=\r\norld of difference.\n\nDo not be in a hurry, do not go out to imitate anybody=\r\n else. This is another\ngreat lesson we have to remember; imitation is not c=\r\nivilisation. I may deck\nmyself out in a Raja&#39;s dress, but will that make me=\r\n a Raja? An ass in a\nlion&#39;s skin never makes a lion. Imitation, cowardly im=\r\nitation, never makes\nfor progress. It is verily the sign of awful degradati=\r\non in a man. Ay, when\na man has begun to hate himself, then the last blow h=\r\nas come.\n\nWhen a man has begun to be ashamed of his ancestors, the end has =\r\ncome. Here\nam I, one of the least of the Hindu race, yet proud of my race, =\r\nproud of my\nancestors. I am proud to call myself a Hindu, I am proud that I=\r\n am one of\nyour unworthy servants. I am proud that I am a countryman of you=\r\nrs, you the\ndescendants of the sages, you the descendants of the most glori=\r\nous Rishis\nthe world ever saw.Therefore have faith in yourselves, be proud =\r\nof your\nancestors, instead of being ashamed of them. And do not imitate, do=\r\n not\nimitate! Whenever you are under the thumb of others, you lose your own=\r\n\nindependence. If you are working, even in spiritual things, at the dictati=\r\non\nof others, slowly you lose all faculty, even of thought. Bring out throu=\r\ngh\nyour own exertions what you have, but do not imitate, yet take what is g=\r\nood\nfrom others.\n\nWe have to learn from others. You put the seed in the gro=\r\nund, and give it\nplenty of earth, and air, and water to feed upon; when the=\r\n seed grows into\nthe plant and into a gigantic tree, does it become the ear=\r\nth, does it become\nthe air, or does it become the water? It becomes the mig=\r\nhty plant, the\nmighty tree, after its own nature, having absorbed everythin=\r\ng that was given\nto it. Let that be your position. We have indeed many thin=\r\ngs to learn from\nothers, yea, that man who refuses to learn is already dead=\r\n.\n\nDeclares our Manu: -\n&quot;Take the jewel of a woman for your wife, though sh=\r\ne be of inferior descent.\nLearn supreme knowledge with service even from th=\r\ne man of low birth; and\neven from the Chand=E2la, learn by serving him the =\r\nway to salvation.&quot; Learn\neverything that is good from others, but bring it =\r\nin, and in your own way\nabsorb it; do not become others. Do not be dragged =\r\naway out of this Indian\nlife; do not for a moment think that it would be be=\r\ntter for India if all the\nIndians dressed, ate, and behaved like another ra=\r\nce.\n\nReligion in India must be made as free and as easy of access as is God=\r\n&#39;s\nair.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_=\r\nVivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_from_Colombo_to_Almora/The_Common_Bases_of_Hi=\r\nnduism\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Lov=\r\ne Alone\n\r\n--0015175cda200c39df04722e88a3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75e=\r\nm;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE C=\r\nOMMON BASES OF HINDUISM=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Vol=\r\nume 3, Lectures from Colombo to Almora=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let them talk of In=\r\ndia&#39;s regeneration as they like.
