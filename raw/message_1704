Mr. X didn&#39;t do any wrong. now in this case, what should X=\r\n be doing. should he take the Slap and go away from there thinking that it =\r\nwas a result of his past Karma or he should give back the same medicine to =\r\nthe abuser.\n\nIn either of the above options, how Mr. X can remain (act) wit=\r\nhout  detachment.how such state can be achieved. however we say that we sho=\r\nuld do detached karma, it does not seem possible. how to achieve that?\n\nit =\r\nlooks very difficult to understand.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste=\r\n,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fantastic question! Before I answer it, I want to say that I am imp=\r\nressed with the decription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live=\r\n in the greater Boston area too?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Karma and =\r\nkarmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and being pushi=\r\nng back as a reaction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you karmically push an object with some f=\r\norce and that object pushes you back karmically with the same force at a la=\r\nter point of time, it is not necessary that you resist it and apply some mo=\r\nre force to push again. You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are bein=\r\ng pushed now. That is reaction. How you take this push and whether you resi=\r\nst or not has nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF yo=\r\nu resist and apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get i=\r\nts reaction later.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even a person of a high =\r\nlevel of mental equanimity and stability does have an ego. Each living pers=\r\non has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.=\r\ng. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like this, who knows so and so things, who =\r\ndoes so and so things, who wants so and so things, who is the husband of Pa=\r\ndmaja, who is the father of Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of M=\r\nanish Pandit etc etc). If the binding is completely removed and one becomes=\r\n completely unbound from that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer r=\r\nemain in the body. So any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). =\r\nAs one dies and gets reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one=\r\n body and environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Natu=\r\nre tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to y=\r\nour old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature del=\r\nivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of I-ness in =\r\nthis life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Natu=\r\nre will continue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions from =\r\nthat being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an=\r\n election, being criticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being ab=\r\nused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend etc e=\r\ntc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s sense of=\r\n I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver reactions to pr=\r\nevious actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result of previous good kar=\r\nma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or excited or elated. Do n=\r\not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good karma is meaningful only=\r\n if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one =\r\nis cheated, it is not necessary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not t=\r\nhink that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s bad karma is meaningful only if t=\r\nhat reaction disappoints him. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such=\r\n that that person cheats you now. How you feel about it now is not relevant=\r\n as far as the old action-reaction equation is concerned. Thus, being equan=\r\nimous, equal-minded and calm does not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, =\r\none is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous li=\r\nfe. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His cheating =\r\nyou is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it with self-id=\r\nentification with the action, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, =\r\nthat is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and without doing an=\r\nything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try=\r\n to stop the person from cheating you. Then your current actions would beco=\r\nme a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction later. If you want to=\r\n pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you have to behave like the =\r\nperson you described below. Accept whatever comes your way with neither hap=\r\npiness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep do=\r\ning what seems like the right thing to do at the moment, with as little sel=\r\nf-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) as possible. As you become be=\r\ntter at this, your instincts and judgment will guide you better and show yo=\r\nu the right action.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; ----- Origin=\r\nal Message ----- \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; Subject: Karma=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they ar=\r\ne able to be in a neutral frame \n&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what is=\r\n percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wi=\r\nfe in a road accident a few years \n&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pul=\r\np right before his eyes. He very \n&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the=\r\n hospital and took care of all of his \n&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the famil=\r\ny. His wife was a very spiritual person \n&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the=\r\n accident, his wife told him of her recent \n&gt; &gt; meditation experience and t=\r\nhat she would probably be leaving her body \n&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never she=\r\nd a tear and was in the utmost calm and \n&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even du=\r\nring the funeral process. Some folks felt it \n&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a =\r\nhighly educated professor with a stable mind. His \n&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a=\r\n very high spiritual and mental bond and they have two \n&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I=\r\n have the utmost reverance towards him and also in awe of \n&gt; &gt; his spiritua=\r\nl level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if he \n&gt; &gt; never feel=\r\ns the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted =\r\nfor privacy&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
