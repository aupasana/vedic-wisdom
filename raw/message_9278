SB list gives the avataras of =\r\nSupreme Being (&quot;Purusha&quot; as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of=\r\n Vishnu, who is the &quot;sustaining principle&quot; of Purusha. Dattatreya is an ava=\r\ntara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and de=\r\nstructive principles of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not am=\r\nong Dasavataras. That does not make him any less or more. His purpose/funct=\r\nionality is simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venk=\r\nateswara.

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Fee=\r\nl free to disagree :)\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquia=\r\nlly used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials wa=\r\ny beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence from =\r\nthe Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate Go=\r\nd=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity betwe=\r\nen terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the G=\r\nita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Va=\r\nishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, =\r\nSri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest =\r\nknown non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing n=\r\nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krsh=\r\nna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a =\r\nmeasure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana a=\r\nnd the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya Vais=\r\nhnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and decl=\r\nared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as N=\r\narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately =\r\nlinked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshn=\r\na, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Whatever the case maybe, e=\r\nach school had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch for =\r\ntheir views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, as you ri=\r\nghtly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;We=C2=A0hu=\r\nman beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avatar appears on the =\r\nearth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after the Avatara, remain=\r\n=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0because invar=\r\niable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the life of the=\r\n Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0imagination=\r\n for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avatara comes=\r\n on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of which =\r\nwe have very little written record, the world at large remained entirely ov=\r\nerawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatara=\r\n. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a se=\r\nt of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who e=\r\nxplain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the general masses=\r\n - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as the c=\r\nrest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\nI believe in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no =\r\nother reason why these set of Avatara, from the whole list of possible=C2=\r\n=A0Avataras, have captured the popular imagination. I mean Dattatreya is an=\r\n Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no less than that of any other =\r\nAvatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The=C2=A0or=\r\niginal Nath Yogis used to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body. The=\r\n idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which was basically exploring=\r\n=C2=A0cronologically all these nine chakras one after the other by flooding=\r\n them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each =\r\ngraha could very well=C2=A0represent the essential nature of each chakra. A=\r\nll these make me more sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avatara=\r\ns, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Buddha,=\r\n as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Y=\r\nuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agr=\r\nee to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it=\r\n cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the sharp=\r\nest and most logical of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical=\r\n mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed hims=\r\nelf to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later came=\r\n 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0=\r\nShankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is no less than that of the=C2=A0B=\r\nuddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it =\r\nnot been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was=\r\n truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have=\r\n been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make i=\r\nt lose its grip on India. Buddhism\n barely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;All this taken together, make me more and more convinced that there=\r\n are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;A little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire =\r\nRama, it is not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I =\r\nfind extremely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where =\r\nRama was to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one =\r\nmoment he could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield w=\r\nay to his army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that th=\r\ne ocean allow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goo=\r\ndwill was not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the oc=\r\nean,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerf=\r\nul warrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself=\r\n is, not letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a moment is =\r\nan amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comt=\r\nemplation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has=\r\n some form of power or influence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama ha=\r\nd no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He=\r\n was the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and c=\r\nunningness are impossible.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that=\r\n he has learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but on=\r\nly follow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehe=\r\nmently. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krsh=\r\nna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat =\r\nGuru who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced i=\r\nn the Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all=\r\n through his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment unde=\r\nr all circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that ma=\r\nkes me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do somethin=\r\ng like this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate f=\r\nrom everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. =\r\nHe had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had hi=\r\ns wife abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had zero=\r\n=C2=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents =\r\nfrom Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere=\r\n he forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a=\r\n great war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followe=\r\nd Rama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=\r\n=A0Balarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Kr=\r\nshna. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are the=\r\ny doing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to thei=\r\nr village in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone wi=\r\nll understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharm=\r\na, with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false pr=\r\naises, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. An=\r\nd I am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n=\r\n worship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a sing=\r\nle sadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this =\r\nkind of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing fr=\r\nom the world or actively performing a larger dharma.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I started app=\r\nreciating Swami Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avat=\r\nara. That was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle=\r\n of a circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirer=\r\ns and on the other bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=\r\n=A0right upto the=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of tha=\r\nt affected him to any great degree.

If people at the beginning of =\r\nSatya yuga are established in Self always and the only issue is that a smal=\r\nl attachment may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being estab=\r\nlished in Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness t=\r\nhat is relevant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes th=\r\nat attachment and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatar=\r\na corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;As collective consciousness beca=\r\nme denser, being established in Self became less natural and more effort wa=\r\ns needed. So the &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and\n hard-work&quot; (Saturn) =\r\nbecame relevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept any=\r\nthing that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatur=\r\nal, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension=\r\n&quot; (Mercury) became relevant.

It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatar=\r\ns, and the term becomes popular. \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;And ONLY when we take these 9/=\r\n10 Avataras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we get the popula=\r\nr concept of Dasavatara.

If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Av=\r\natars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;e=\r\nvolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Ava=\r\ntaras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If=\r\n you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any use. For th=\r\nese nine grahas, individually or in combination, will represent all Avatara=\r\ns, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Secondly=\r\n, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what must K=\r\nalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Or, just surmisin=\r\ng, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the earth,=\r\n his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he do=\r\nes appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the la=\r\nst Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars =\r\nfrom the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some traditions c=\r\nonsider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;T=\r\nhe concept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita.

In fact, Parasara, father of Vy=\r\nasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poo=\r\nrnavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amo=\r\nunt of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact =\r\ninnumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are av=\r\nataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds =\r\nto say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I quest=\r\nion if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not i=\r\ns accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc=\r\n are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and=\r\n Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental=\r\n question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himse=\r\nlf&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in re=\r\nality formless (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman)=\r\n, are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further=\r\n compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *cont=\r\nains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is bey=\r\nond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended =\r\non earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting th=\r\nis notion based on their fancies and conditioning..\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;All beings a=\r\nre made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relati=\r\nve being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desi=\r\nres and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma.=\r\n Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma p=\r\nortion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity=\r\n!!!! After all, &quot;entire\n divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just =\r\nas no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying=\r\n and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna=\r\n as well as Rama.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great =\r\nspiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme o=\r\nf evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a sta=\r\ntic realization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in=\r\n SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in yo=\r\nur &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong an=\r\nd avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Secon=\r\ndly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logica=\r\nl mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n and=\r\n its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spir=\r\nit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality complet=\r\nely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomp=\r\nrehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing.=\r\n However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali=\r\n yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this worl=\r\nd in this age.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;If you dismiss Parasar=\r\na&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolu=\r\ntely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect?

After all, esoterically is how you=\r\n really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusions=\r\n, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are=\r\n &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other =\r\ndeities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;On=\r\n a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior\n =\r\nto Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to b=\r\ne essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating =\r\nbetween them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for ev=\r\nen rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant difference =\r\nbetween them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Sa=\r\nme in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and =\r\nfully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (=\r\nparamatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represente=\r\nd by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama ar=\r\ne not that different, though the specifics of their stories may be differen=\r\nt.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna =\r\nis superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy =\r\nfor such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/k=\r\nnowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than =\r\nchanging the minds of anyone in the short run.

Let me write down as I see it, in point by poi=\r\nnt manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Ava=\r\ntaras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and=\r\n Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself a=\r\nre in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the A=\r\nvatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these A=\r\nvatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna=\r\n is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10=\r\n, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and sign=\r\nificance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which w=\r\nere composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, i=\r\nt was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of =\r\nKali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were com=\r\nposed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantr=\r\nas]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. =\r\nMatysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddh=\r\na) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence=\r\n of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquati=\r\nc, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to th=\r\ne dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this=\r\n earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashu=\r\nrama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the =\r\nNirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to=\r\n be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the v=\r\narious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness =\r\nand its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of eart=\r\nh and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on =\r\nearth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the par=\r\nable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worshi=\r\nps say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the =\r\nsoul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can l=\r\nead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vi=\r\nshnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive s=\r\npiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krs=\r\nhna are most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both insid=\r\ne as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age.=\r\n Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is i=\r\nn control of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within=\r\n and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. H=\r\nowever, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even t=\r\nhough few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only wh=\r\nen circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel de=\r\njected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear b=\r\nefore the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the =\r\nlater revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battl=\r\ne, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana n=\r\not to rescue her, but it\n was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family=\r\n honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. T=\r\nhe way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis =\r\nValmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as=\r\n an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 =\r\nyears of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Rava=\r\nna, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal co=\r\nnsideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life i=\r\ns a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate=\r\n detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats =\r\ninto account. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, f=\r\nrom people, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the=\r\n age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends,=\r\n his foster parents,\n his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him =\r\nthat it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort =\r\nof his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and des=\r\ntination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they wo=\r\nn&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is=\r\n over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him ask=\r\ning him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of t=\r\nhem started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself qu=\r\nietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one=\r\n has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later m=\r\nerely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment =\r\nthe 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back=\r\n into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a re=\r\nvolutionist\n and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who u=\r\nsed to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krs=\r\nhna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not fini=\r\nsh the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised se=\r\nlf. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overb=\r\noard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confiden=\r\nce in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And the=\r\nn right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to d=\r\neliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains =\r\nthe best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never=\r\n be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong t=\r\no the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliy=\r\na Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bh=\r\neema\n to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhism=\r\na, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations =\r\nmust be lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This ki=\r\nnd of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one =\r\nis constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not f=\r\nind these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the V=\r\nalmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other au=\r\nxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ra=\r\nmayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, an=\r\nd then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and=\r\n Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, t=\r\nhe picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mi=\r\nnd. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief\n of=\r\n which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to sep=\r\naration from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he lo=\r\nved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some g=\r\nrief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachmen=\r\nt to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and=\r\n therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda =\r\nnever left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spir=\r\nitual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolut=\r\nionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realizat=\r\nion, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth=\r\n. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of=\r\n them negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final a=\r\nim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of\n evolutionary develo=\r\npment? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an =\r\nAvatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in =\r\nthat sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Av=\r\nataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vais=\r\nhnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara=\r\n. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic=\r\n, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed=\r\n their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and=\r\n therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literatu=\r\nre of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psycho=\r\nlogical functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-develop=\r\ned in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avatara=\r\ns - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full\n power and force of one of th=\r\nese 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousn=\r\ness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various pos=\r\nsiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha.=\r\n Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nin=\r\ne in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comm=\r\nent on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what =\r\nthe BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)=\r\n[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textua=\r\nl misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras =\r\nhas not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in t=\r\nhe Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing w=\r\nhich is perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha co=\r\nmes living in the full and complete\n purity and might and force and strengt=\r\nh of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn =\r\naway opposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Ev=\r\nen Krshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his=\r\n ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and t=\r\nhat sword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify =\r\nthe various errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I =\r\nlook at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my view=\r\ns, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -=\r\nRegards =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddh=\r\nayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Na=\r\nrasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;,=\r\n &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna i=\r\ns like going back from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avat=\r\nars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 I want to emphaticall=\r\ny disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spi=\r\nrituality..upto Krshna&quot;. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Each avatara represen=\r\nts an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. =C2=A0 Maharshi Parasara equat=\r\ned dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are S=\r\nun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, =\r\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul=\r\n, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, sp=\r\nirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,\n spirit of innovation/b=\r\nreaking barriers and detachment (respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, eac=\r\nh avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. E=\r\nach story is an example of how that aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s sto=\r\nry is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a p=\r\nerfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected e=\r\nxample of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a p=\r\nerfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, =\r\nenergy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipl=\r\nine/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Sel=\r\nf. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has differen=\r\nt qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.=\r\n =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfec=\r\nt other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the=\r\n end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable =\r\nand are in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story =\r\nthat demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities=\r\n of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one wh=\r\no is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstr=\r\nates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and=\r\n subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama a=\r\nnd Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in =\r\nus, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has n=\r\no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=\r\nnce with some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=\r\ness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=\r\nnd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=\r\n energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=\r\nts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =\r\nimpassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so tha=\r\nt Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=\r\n awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =\r\nAs mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=\r\n notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =\r\nthem fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=\r\nely. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functio=\r\nnality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interes=\r\nting enough\n to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes an=\r\nd agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achi=\r\neving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!!=\r\n Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consc=\r\niousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind tha=\r\nt keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and e=\r\nven decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;bo=\r\nss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one =\r\nwho may be excited by this description! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Lord K=\r\nrishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspectiv=\r\ne. =C2=A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he re=\r\nceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whateve=\r\nr was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was give=\r\nn\n kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the be=\r\nhest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had n=\r\no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty t=\r\no various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed=\r\n his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with =\r\nLakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it i=\r\nmpassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he sear=\r\nched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him t=\r\no leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every l=\r\nife situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Eve=\r\nn as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impass=\r\nionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully le=\r\narned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama\n =\r\nis a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impa=\r\nssionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=\r\nre liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=\r\n=A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect=\r\n demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =C2=A0 He was born as=\r\n a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable =\r\ndemon king with many great qualities. =C2=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes on=\r\ne humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demon=\r\nic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not please=\r\nd until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousn=\r\ness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understo=\r\nod as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of\n our consciousness o=\r\nperate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =C2=A0 Let us not compare Da=\r\nsavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are mor=\r\ne attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develo=\r\np devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate =\r\nit today (there are different schools of thought). =C2=A0 Best regards, Nar=\r\nasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org -------- \n&gt;\n \r\n---1293697098-502574705-1367936170=:40547\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;Dear Nara=\r\nsimha,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jai Ma!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;If capturing the popular imagination i=\r\ns the criterion,&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You misunderstood what I was saying.

In contrast, the 5th and 6th\n avataras di=\r\nd have some jeevatmamsa in them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nlt;&lt;I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is n=\r\no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 A=\r\nvataras.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First of all, dasavataras are not a &quot;top 10&quot; =\r\nshort-list of SB&#39;s list. SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Being (&quot;Puru=\r\nsha&quot; as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who is the =\r\n&quot;sustaining principle&quot; of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma, Vish=\r\nnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive principles=\r\n of Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavataras. Tha=\r\nt does not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is simply d=\r\nifferent from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara. Just in te=\r\nrms of &quot;popularity&quot;, he is actually more popular than\n some of the dasavata=\r\nras.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, rather than *comparing* avataras in terms like =\r\n&quot;less&quot; or more in &quot;spirituality&quot;, try to *understand* avataras from the poi=\r\nnt of view of what functionality and role they play in the functioning of c=\r\nollective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the key to understanding them and t=\r\nheir place in cosmos. And also to internalizing them eventually..&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Whether you call the Supreme Being as Purus=\r\nha or Krishna or Shiva or Surya or Narayana does not really matter, for Scr=\r\niptures are clear that He is beyond names or descriptions.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If =\r\nyour devotion to Him is steadfast, if your notion of Him expands with time =\r\nbeyond the initial notions you start off with, and if the paramatmamsa in y=\r\nou is able to resonate to Him and the conditioning of your jeevatmamsa is b=\r\neing overcome, that is all that\n matters!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Nar=\r\nasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2=\r\n_32_1367853193997_63&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote id=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193=\r\n997_66&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;y=\r\niv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_70&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helve=\r\ntica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1=\r\n367853193997_71&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, ser=\r\nif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n Mo=\r\nnday, May 6, 2013 8:07 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div=\r\n&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv307238759&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv307238759ygrp-t=\r\next&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193=\r\n997_80&quot; style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:Courier New, =\r\ncourier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Nar=\r\nasimha,&lt;var id=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui-ie-cursor&quot;&gt;&lt;/var&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_81&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:tr=\r\nansparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monos=\r\npace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_82&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGRO=\r\nUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, m=\r\nonaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jai Ma=\r\n!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_83&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier Ne=\r\nw, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_136785319=\r\n3997_84&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMIL=\r\nY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT=\r\n-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some freeflowing thoughts that struck me while thinking =\r\nabout some of points you have raised.

It is difficult to miss the phonetic&nbsp;sim=\r\nilarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion start=\r\ned from the Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major p=\r\nurely&nbsp;Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavachary=\r\na, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya&nbsp;as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was =\r\nthe earliest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (wit=\r\nh differing nuances on the&nbsp;relation between\n jiva,\n paramatma, moksha&=\r\nnbsp;etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aide=\r\nd in no less a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is =\r\nVishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some, like th=\r\ne Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of i=\r\nt all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma=\r\n, as well as Narayana,&nbsp;as merely&nbsp;the aura of Krshna. Rama was als=\r\no intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier =\r\nbrith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_87&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:=\r\ntransparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, mon=\r\nospace, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv307238759yui_3_7_2_32_1367853193997_88&quot; style=3D&quot;BACKG=\r\nROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier,=\r\n monaco, monospace\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
