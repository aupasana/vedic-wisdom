BUT please explain to me about the supreme cosmic being who is =\r\na sole link between Dual and Non-dual self. now as you have mentioned (pl. =\r\nrefer to no.1 above) he is all knower so every possibility is known to him =\r\nand not only every possibility but even every action going to be taken in a=\r\n perticular Space-time zone and what the eventual result. we call him by Na=\r\nraayana/Shiva/ Bhagavati/ GOD/Allah/ Ganapati (As per Atharvashirsh) and ma=\r\nny such names depending on our faiths. \n&gt; \n&gt; The point no.1 indicates that =\r\nHE is all knower and point no.2 indicates that Free will is certainly there=\r\n at our Spac-time level.

It is ei=\r\nther this or that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Both are correct, but at different levels. I wi=\r\nll elaborate. However, this is philosophically complex and those who do not=\r\n follow what I say should not worry at all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Non-dua=\r\nl self has no division of self into various objects or space or time. There=\r\n is no concept of time or space or space-time continuum within non-dual sel=\r\nf. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of space or time or object=\r\nification.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality and no=\r\nn-duality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the =\r\nentire field of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-=\r\ntime continua within the field of duality exist within Him. From the perspe=\r\nctive of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are His parts a=\r\nnd all their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will. As all space-ti=\r\nme continua are within Him, there is nothing that is unknown to Him. Past, =\r\npresent and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you and others, this pos=\r\nsibility, that possibility and yet another possibility - all are accessible=\r\n and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, let us come lower a=\r\nnd into the field of duality. The field of duality consists of infinite div=\r\nisions of space, time and space-time continua. There are infinite possibili=\r\nties within this field.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within duali=\r\nty have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-time c=\r\nontinuum. However, field of duality also contains planes of consciousness w=\r\nhere different senses of time and different space-time continua (that may i=\r\nntersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time=\r\n continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience a point of time =\r\nthat maps to a future time in a regular space-time continuum being experien=\r\nced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 yea=\r\nr in another space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entit=\r\ny as one may think. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space=\r\n-time continua and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciousne=\r\nss that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience =\r\npart of a specific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the on=\r\nly reality. But relaity\n&gt;  consists of infinite space-time continua that in=\r\ntersect each other. These are all different possibilities and you chart out=\r\n your course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is in a differen=\r\nt space-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;futur=\r\ne&quot; as per the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspe=\r\nctive of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that futur=\r\ne time is not yet known and depends on your current action.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a y=\r\nogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state in future, his =\r\nobservation is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It has n=\r\no causal relationship to your current action or your future state. He is me=\r\nrely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen. His observation =\r\nis specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-time =\r\npairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair whe=\r\nre he observed you (if at all you do!).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let us go f=\r\nurther. Is there only one future possible for you? Or, does the path traver=\r\nsed by you in space-time continuum not fixed but variable based on your act=\r\nions? Can your actions at important cross-roads alter the course you traver=\r\nse?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If so, what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-=\r\ntime pair? Is his observation only a possibility or a certainty? One may sa=\r\ny &quot;how can one observe a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certain=\r\nty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite spac=\r\ne-time continua contained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Some great rishis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-=\r\ntime continua at the same time, i.e. they can see various possibilities bas=\r\ned on various possible actions. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;=\r\nfuture&quot; are just one possibility.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: At th=\r\ne level at which we exist, there is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. =\r\nWithin the limits imposed by the reactions given by nature to your own prev=\r\nious actions, you do have a scope for engaging in different actions at this=\r\n time. Depending on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly =\r\ndifferent. Some actions can even make the future significantly different. A=\r\n rishi may be able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possi=\r\nbilities for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most p=\r\nossibilities upto 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a=\r\n few possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a=\r\n few moves or guessing a future position). But the supreme cosmic being kno=\r\nws the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist within Him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; However, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference fr=\r\name of your consciousness! ) some of those possibilities. One may know all =\r\nthe possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will com=\r\ne to fruition, but it is your actions that actually make some of those poss=\r\nibilities a reality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sr=\r\niJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5=\r\n:22 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha=\r\nji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however,=\r\n I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. One =\r\nof the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If events have already=\r\n been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen in our=\r\n plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug?

He did not know mu=\r\nch about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told =\r\nhim who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radi=\r\nant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him=\r\n he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This boy is u=\r\nsually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one mornin=\r\ng, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the e=\r\npisode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. =\r\nHe said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already happene=\r\nd. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later when the ti=\r\nme comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pret=\r\nended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don=\r\n&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly =\r\nintelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is usually ch=\r\neerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto s=\r\nomething today. But he could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;d=\r\no you mean to say that future has already happened at some level, but will =\r\nreveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been =\r\nshot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. Bu=\r\nt people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front =\r\nof them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exact=\r\nly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it=\r\n will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before f=\r\nuture comes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though he did not m=\r\nention it, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him th=\r\ne man riding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet=\r\n to come, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and =\r\nunderstand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he shoul=\r\nd see somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was p=\r\nossible and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However,=\r\n in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It =\r\neven loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahma=\r\nn or Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short=\r\n Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara =\r\nadded before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very=\r\n intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel=\r\n normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and=\r\n a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I hav=\r\ne nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that.=\r\n Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to m=\r\ny guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I=\r\n had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famo=\r\nus temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was=\r\n sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt =\r\nwas the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that i=\r\nntense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and ope=\r\nned eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, =\r\nthis is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to =\r\nsay it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nis boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what I g=\r\nive in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerful e=\r\nnergy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most im=\r\nportant thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a r=\r\nitual better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and o=\r\nne has to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Keep performing =\r\nyour chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as=\r\n you engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual=\r\n progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smalle=\r\nr, you can resist attraction to external things better and you can resist i=\r\nnternal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharm=\r\na better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root =\r\ncause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana =\r\nyoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all t=\r\nhat is around you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and=\r\n your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker o=\r\nf all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without ente=\r\nrtaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care=\r\n of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as hi=\r\ns or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is =\r\nnot necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s maste=\r\nr takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken awa=\r\ny, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept=\r\n that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one =\r\nto do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one doe=\r\ns not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Developing the atti=\r\ntude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade =\r\nthe ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri=\r\n Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Yahoo! recommends that you upgr=\r\nade to the new and safer Internet Explorer 8. http://downloads.yahoo.com/in=\r\n/internetexplorer/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
