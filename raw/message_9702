Lord=\r\n Hanuman is not a godly person but pure devotion. When Lord Rama asked Lord=\r\n Hanuman to stay on the earth, he meant that &#39;bhakti&#39; will stay on earth ti=\r\nll the very end.

Where in our scr=\r\niptures does it say that every thing has 3 (adhi bhautic, adhidevik and aad=\r\nhyatmic) interpretations? Mahabharat is &quot;history&quot;. How can we say that ever=\r\ny thing mentioned therein can be, or must be, interpreted 3 ways. The notio=\r\nn that our scriptures have a hidden agenda which only pundits understand an=\r\nd can interpret seems stretching the truth. A simple Krishn- Sandeepan stor=\r\ny gets a new twist! \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Shrimad Bhagvat is a detailed and voluminous bo=\r\nok dealing with Shri Krishna&#39;s life. It gives the names of the entire clan =\r\nof Gopis and yet does not mention Radha Rani even once! \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Durga Sapts=\r\nhati is included in Markandeya Puran. Where does it say that Mahishasur als=\r\no represents our tamsic tendencies and Raktbeej represents our multitude of=\r\n desires. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So, the simple question: where is the authority for 3 way=\r\n translations?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Sent from my iPad\n&gt; &gt;Ramesh Sharma\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
