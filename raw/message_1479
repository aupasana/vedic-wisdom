Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whatever is one&#39;s =\r\npath, Kundalini is not only awakened but goes to Sahasrara \n&gt; &gt; when one is=\r\n established in undifferentiated Self. Even if one does not think \n&gt; &gt; in t=\r\nhose terms, it still happens. It is incorrect to say that one can \n&gt; &gt; real=\r\nize the highest truths without Kundalini awakened. A more accurate \n&gt; &gt; sta=\r\ntement would be that one can realize the highest truths without engaging \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; in any specific practices geared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Some people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hat=\r\nha \n&gt; &gt; yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. However, such prac=\r\ntices are \n&gt; &gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini. People belonging =\r\nto various \n&gt; &gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can exp=\r\nerience Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; awakening, without knowing anything about the name o=\r\nr the symbolism. There \n&gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini is essentially the force of o=\r\nne&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and \n&gt; &gt; raised kundalini implies a more refi=\r\nned and higher self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the lowest level, we bind our se=\r\nlves to specific bodies and our \n&gt; &gt; self-awareness is limited to a body, a=\r\n name and other things associated with \n&gt; &gt; the body and name. This experie=\r\nnce of self as a body corresponds to \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini sleeping at Mooladhara.=\r\n At the highest level, we are the \n&gt; &gt; undifferentiated Self, known as Brah=\r\nman, that is all-pervading. This \n&gt; &gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to K=\r\nundalini at Sahasrara. As \n&gt; &gt; self-awareness goes from the former to the l=\r\natter, it may traverse through \n&gt; &gt; many stages in between. Correspondingly=\r\n, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kund=\r\nalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first time, like a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes down again and the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; process of rise from then onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work =\r\nits \n&gt; &gt; way up while the nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is cleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the tim=\r\ne of \n&gt; &gt; awakening, it may encounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high=\r\n through \n&gt; &gt; the impurities. This may manifest physically as a powerful ex=\r\nperience \n&gt; &gt; similar to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere are thousands of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path taken \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; by Kundalini as it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may change =\r\nfrom \n&gt; &gt; person to person, based on the impurities in various nadis. The e=\r\nxact \n&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed and the fi=\r\nnal point \n&gt; &gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, rise to Saha=\r\nsrara \n&gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. His nadi=\r\ns had \n&gt; &gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went=\r\n into \n&gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully realiz=\r\ned person. \n&gt; &gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Saying &quot;=\r\nthis is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The \n&gt; &gt; exact=\r\n experience changes from person to person, depending on the path \n&gt; &gt; trave=\r\nrsed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one thing \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one will not have an=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; confusion about what happened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs=\r\n, one \n&gt; &gt; may confuse various other experiences (such as some movement of =\r\nvayu in \n&gt; &gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wrongly think that k=\r\nundalini is \n&gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sensation =\r\nlike ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the head are NOT \n&gt; &gt; due=\r\n to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be due to a little vaayu \n&gt; &gt; flo=\r\nwing in various nadis. This can be a premonitory sign (but not a \n&gt; &gt; guara=\r\nntee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing can be said about the \n&gt; &gt; sensati=\r\non of tilting  to one side (back or left or right) or the sensation \n&gt; &gt; of=\r\n having completely fallen back (even though one is sitting normally in \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n reality). There are several such premonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a reference, I can narrate the experience of ONE person.=\r\n He was \n&gt; &gt; meditating with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him =\r\na few months \n&gt; &gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. H=\r\nowever, he had \n&gt; &gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally u=\r\nninformed about \n&gt; &gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any=\r\n specific raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; yoga practices. All he did was to sit with his ba=\r\nck erect and eyes closed \n&gt; &gt; and meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks=\r\n before kundalini awakening, he \n&gt; &gt; started experiencing various premonito=\r\nry signs. He guru told him not to be \n&gt; &gt; distracted by them and to keep th=\r\ne focus on the mantra and try to forget \n&gt; &gt; everything else. When mind sta=\r\nrts dwelling on an experience, it gets stuck \n&gt; &gt; there and cannot go highe=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and inten=\r\nsely focused \n&gt; &gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Sudd=\r\nenly he became \n&gt; &gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was a really trem=\r\nendous explosion at \n&gt; &gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge am=\r\nount of electric current \n&gt; &gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it=\r\n felt like he was not a body \n&gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he w=\r\nas going up like a rocket at a \n&gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like the=\r\nre was a tremendously bright white \n&gt; &gt; light and there was nothing else. I=\r\nt felt like he was not a small point in \n&gt; &gt; that light, but he was the lig=\r\nht itself. There was an undescribable sense of \n&gt; &gt; peace and happiness. Su=\r\nddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this? \n&gt; &gt; What happened to m=\r\ny body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became \n&gt; &gt; aware of himsel=\r\nf as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room \n&gt; &gt; and went ou=\r\nt, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For example, a \n&gt; &gt; seria=\r\nl was coming on TV and characters in the serial that he normally \n&gt; &gt; disli=\r\nked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt like real people and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n he had great love and compassion for those TV serial characters (and other=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; real people too). That state of love and compassion lasted a while an=\r\nd then \n&gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This short experience was only the begi=\r\nnning of a journey. He experienced \n&gt; &gt; many things later on. These experie=\r\nnces were different from each other. As I \n&gt; &gt; said earlier, the experience=\r\n varies based on the path traversed and the \n&gt; &gt; point reached by the self-=\r\nawareness (kundalini). On various occasions, \n&gt; &gt; kundalini rose and he saw=\r\n several sights and several beings within and heard \n&gt; &gt; several sounds, in=\r\ncluding veda mantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He realized =\r\nthe transientness of a lot that we cling on to and the existence \n&gt; &gt; of so=\r\nmething far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All this slowly started to =\r\nchange his attitude. His senses turned inwards \n&gt; &gt; and he critically start=\r\ned to analyze his own thoughts and motives and worked \n&gt; &gt; on correcting hi=\r\ns attitude. The impact of what was happening around him, \n&gt; &gt; what others d=\r\nid and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him. \n&gt; &gt; Luckily, =\r\nhe had a guru who put things in perspective and said that kundalini \n&gt; &gt; aw=\r\nakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahead. Depending on \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many years or even lives.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginning=\r\n. It is not an end. Even the rise of \n&gt; &gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an e=\r\nnd. In fact, a big percentage of people \n&gt; &gt; with awakened kundalini end up=\r\n getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Very few \n&gt; &gt; make it to the next chak=\r\nra or the one after, but end up getting stuck there. \n&gt; &gt; Very very few mak=\r\ne it to higher chakras. And a very small minority actually \n&gt; &gt; realise sel=\r\nf.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sr=\r\ni Krishna in \n&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whethe=\r\nr you are into raja \n&gt; &gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. =\r\nThinking of a mystical \n&gt; &gt; experience can only distract one from this goal=\r\n. I urge sadhakas, especially \n&gt; &gt; those who respect my advice, to forget a=\r\nbout kundalini and chakras and just \n&gt; &gt; keep doing homam and japam (or wha=\r\ntever path they have chosen), keep \n&gt; &gt; purifying themselves with sadhana, =\r\nkeep working on their attitude and \n&gt; &gt; thought process and keep improving =\r\nself-control. When (or as) mind becomes \n&gt; &gt; purified and one overcomes ego=\r\n, whatever needs to happen with kundalini WILL \n&gt; &gt; happen automatically. T=\r\nhinking of things in terms of kundalini and mystical \n&gt; &gt; experiences is a =\r\nbig deterrent rather than a boost, in one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; sadhana. Instead=\r\n of trying to manipulate kundalini, try to manipulate the \n&gt; &gt; way your min=\r\nd works and perfect your self-control. Kundalini will \n&gt; &gt; automatically fo=\r\nllow. One will do well to remember these words.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ur=\r\ndhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Relevant to this on going subjec=\r\nt, i remember reading autobiography of Shri \n&gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Pan=\r\nthe) in which he had mentioned that Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; Awakening is not mandato=\r\nry for realization.

When one attains a per=\r\nfect focus on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra and distracting thoughts cease, praana move=\r\ns downward from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lungs/stomach and apaana moves upward. After praan=\r\na and apaana combine, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first time, it may fe=\r\nel like an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will feel =\r\nlike one is freed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exist. This is si=\r\nmilar to death, except \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusion at death a=\r\nnd one may feel a kind of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditatio=\r\nn. However, if one&#39;s focus on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware=\r\n of&quot; the experience and starts \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mind=\r\n, there is a chance of one becoming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused. So one s=\r\nhould sustain the state where there is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full focus on mantra and no=\r\n other distractions, for as long as possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These thi=\r\nngs happen automatically without thinking about them and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging =\r\nin any specific practicies. In fact, thinking about them, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desiring=\r\n them and doing specific practices may become an obstacle and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dela=\r\ny things.

How can i \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pers=\r\nonality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dei=\r\nty(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the d=\r\neity commanding a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to b=\r\ne good or be it that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s person=\r\nality is crucial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for not=\r\nhing himself, so self \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s=\r\n spiritual evolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very=\r\n little=C2 according to me which is black magic. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use o=\r\nf Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prac=\r\nhand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will b=\r\ne that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for thes=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing =\r\nof karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may reali=\r\nse this to their detriment( \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath buryin=\r\ng the city of Patan with his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some p=\r\neople may even equate this with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only ac=\r\ntion and reaction.(Bit like you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you wi=\r\nll get a result of this from that same Atma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe =\r\n5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identif=\r\nying with the universe and has very few karmas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Univ=\r\nerse itself attacks you, because your attack is not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka=\r\n, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people per=\r\nsist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then =\r\nthere is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then =\r\ntheir minds and intellects will not be free of identification with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed as \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they hav=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sad=\r\nhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his p=\r\nrevious \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this man=\r\ntra only in this lifetime may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind e=\r\nvery mantra are crucial and may not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then startin=\r\ng on some good day, do 1000 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call=\r\n this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, m=\r\nain constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sa=\r\nme materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Compl=\r\nete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body=\r\n), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you st=\r\nart, make sure your bowels are empty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Con=\r\ntinue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See th=\r\ne difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short ,=\r\n what is important is that life may be short, so do some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, =\r\nand persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possibl=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being disc=\r\nussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You=\r\n may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthat this is suitable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
