Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and =\r\ndevotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and their re=\r\nlationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty notions o=\r\nf superiority and dependence.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions an=\r\nd the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to to=\r\nlerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one=\r\n is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One =\r\nclimbing a mountain has to choose one of the available paths. Whether one a=\r\ncknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mountain top or whether=\r\n one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the top, is not th=\r\nat important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path,=\r\n one is doing alright!\n&gt; \n&gt; After all, there may be many paths around the h=\r\nill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of the mountain or ev=\r\nen distant paths on the same side. If one does not think much of those path=\r\ns and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that does no harm.\n&gt; \n&gt; As one=\r\n reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the other paths that see=\r\nmed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one is very close to t=\r\nhe top, one will see that all paths are leading there. When one is on the t=\r\nop, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-realization, one sees v=\r\narious paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, different paths come with=\r\n different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One path may be too stee=\r\np. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling rocks. One path may =\r\nhave fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that pe=\r\nople can reach there using several paths, if they are committed to overcomi=\r\nng the obstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let people follow the paths cho=\r\nsen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top in their own paths. Le=\r\nt them say whatever they want to say about your path. It does not matter. I=\r\nf YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path and reach the top!=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is that some people are doing no sadhana reall=\r\ny, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on other paths and g=\r\netting into fights. They are like people at the base of the mountain, tryin=\r\ng to block people from some paths and trying to enroll them in their path. =\r\nThey may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the base forever=\r\n and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, people with narrow =\r\nviews who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They are on some path a=\r\nnd will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna bhaktas who look=\r\n down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their mantra several malas=\r\n a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventually make progress=\r\n. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even worship Ganesha as =\r\nhe is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the start of their p=\r\noojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try to see all hu=\r\nman beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep their austerities. =\r\nBottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will eventually make pro=\r\ngress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us not worry about people who are doing some sadhana and pr=\r\nogressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be addressed in due=\r\n course.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the cond=\r\nitioning and keep making progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Film=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your views but for Iskcon I hav=\r\ne my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission to spread Shr=\r\ni Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Prabhupada)on numer=\r\nous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri Shivji and for t=\r\nhat reason I have my reservations and those views of mine are not my own vi=\r\news as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like me.If I am allow=\r\ned to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard stuff like them for=\r\n opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that well known astrolo=\r\nger Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vaishnavas to do Maha=\r\nmrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of Shri Vasishtha ma=\r\nntra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

They nee=\r\nd to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and=\r\n subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity.

But I keep trying to read as I love that poetry by the great poet Pota=\r\nna. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 11/10/10, Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On Astrologers and Priests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, JyotishGroup=\r\n@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Wednesday, November 10, 2010, 6:05 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two mails below on priests doing r=\r\nemedies and astrologers have a common thread. I will reply to them together=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and =\r\ndoing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty p=\r\nlace that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone =\r\nelse&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste t=\r\nhere and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I k=\r\neep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a bas=\r\nket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty=\r\n and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritua=\r\nl sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make=\r\n one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage=\r\n as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he =\r\nmay be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests =\r\ndid intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many=\r\n priests of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as th=\r\ney start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, man=\r\ny priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born =\r\nto a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become =\r\na brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahman=\r\na-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of=\r\n money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberati=\r\non. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahman=\r\nas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for=\r\n others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, inf=\r\nluence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing =\r\nrituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing=\r\n rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described=\r\n in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana b=\r\ny overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologe=\r\nrs:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an elemen=\r\nt of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produce=\r\ns an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone =\r\nresulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and expe=\r\nriencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. I=\r\nf the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to =\r\nexperience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings ca=\r\nn come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a=\r\n risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Well, become a true=\r\n brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bh=\r\nagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming =\r\ntendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of w=\r\nhere one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follows=\r\n this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by gi=\r\nving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I a=\r\nm not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid=\r\n about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual =\r\nmanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotis=\r\nh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are=\r\n present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am as=\r\nking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas specially =\r\nthose who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And i=\r\nf this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the =\r\nonly place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query =\r\nhere.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have j=\r\nust started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am =\r\nvery eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerou=\r\ns instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that a=\r\nstrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou=\r\n family.

Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each othe=\r\nr. They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, such as l=\r\nove and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority and depe=\r\nndence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the bias=\r\nes of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate bia=\r\nses and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making=\r\n some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available paths.=\r\n Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to\n the mountain=\r\n top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the=\r\n top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in one=\r\n&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; After all, there may=\r\n be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other=\r\n side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does n=\r\not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, tha=\r\nt does no harm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower a=\r\nnd one may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quit=\r\ne nearby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths =\r\nare leading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge t=\r\nhere. After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to go=\r\nd. Of course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may h=\r\nave some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may\n be slippery. One pa=\r\nth may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And =\r\nso on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several =\r\npaths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the t=\r\nop.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let people follow the paths chosen by them and wish th=\r\nem good luck to reach the top in their own paths. Let them say whatever the=\r\ny want to say about your path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction a=\r\nnd faith, you just walk your path and reach the top!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The problem is that some people are doing no sadhana real=\r\nly, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on other paths and =\r\ngetting into fights. They are like people at the base of the mountain, tryi=\r\nng to block people from some paths and trying to enroll them in their path.=\r\n They may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the base foreve=\r\nr and never reach the top. They are a\n problem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, peopl=\r\ne with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They are =\r\non some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna bh=\r\naktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their mantra=\r\n several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventually=\r\n make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even worsh=\r\nip Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the st=\r\nart of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try=\r\n to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep their=\r\n austerities.

If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may be able t=\r\no capture all of its details well. If you read thousands of books on an ele=\r\nphant without having ever seen one,\n you may still not be able imagine an e=\r\nlephant. Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory.

If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then=\r\n that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after=\r\n all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great s=\r\naint. To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to =\r\nspread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clo=\r\nthing in winter, requires tremendous surrender.

They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief=\r\n systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. =\r\nSo Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable t=\r\no them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly diffe=\r\nrently, because there are different groups of people with different samkara=\r\ns waiting to be guided by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My philosophy is=\r\n simple.

I will reply to them together.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1=\r\n below on priests:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing rit=\r\nuals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for others is anoth=\r\ner. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to l=\r\nive in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and clean=\r\ning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not protecte=\r\nd, one may be affected.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I=\r\n keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a b=\r\nasket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tas=\r\nty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spirit=\r\nual sadhana, the deities\n throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and m=\r\nake one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spill=\r\nage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, =\r\nhe may be affected by the spillage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough p=\r\nurity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance=\r\n. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karma=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of=\r\n today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahman=\r\na father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana o=\r\nneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many=\r\n brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of=\r\n comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are=\r\n not really\n brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth=\r\n right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others onl=\r\ny by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, mon=\r\ney and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or,=\r\n do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Mo=\r\nreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam c=\r\nhapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tenden=\r\ncies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an element of tru=\r\nth in\n it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I =\r\nam doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of gi=\r\nving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaar=\r\nmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is cl=\r\nearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;=\r\n, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come=\r\n and some sufferings can come too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Well, becom=\r\ne a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in S=\r\nrimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by ove=\r\nrcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n Irrespec=\r\ntive of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if on=\r\ne follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of oth=\r\ners by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be c=\r\nlear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by con=\r\nduct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become =\r\nclear, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc=\r\n on who can be taught Jyotish!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast=\r\nrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam=\r\n)?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall an=\r\nd general condition of Brahmanas specially\n those who do pujas for Yajmanas=\r\n and involved in Karmakanda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is tru=\r\ne is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is=\r\n the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this q=\r\nuery here.Thanks a lot in advance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Mail 2:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;=\r\nrl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasi=\r\nmhaji and other educated Scholars,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 =\r\ntraining sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in=\r\n the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and\n close uncles that astrology can =\r\nhave a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family.
