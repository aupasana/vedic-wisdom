I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  c=\r\nreaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different =\r\nenergies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rat=\r\nher evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make up =\r\nbecause of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once =\r\nI started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a t=\r\nerrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some step=\r\ns near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fu=\r\nlly aware and I can move my body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in=\r\n that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying at th=\r\nat place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before goi=\r\nng to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at home, fe=\r\neling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in heig=\r\nht, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the stra=\r\nnge feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Is there any =\r\nmantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Somet=\r\nhing that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering me for=\r\n some time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thank you in adva=\r\nnce!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
