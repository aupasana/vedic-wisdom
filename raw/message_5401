Well-educated and honest, he is\n&gt; not only courageous, but extrem=\r\nely blunt and forthright in his views.\n&gt; \n&gt; Widely known for\n&gt; publicly cha=\r\nllenging and fighting against prime ministers and chief ministers,\n&gt; it wou=\r\nld do well for his political opponents to remain on the right side of\n&gt; Swa=\r\nmy. For, his wrath can undo governments, leave alone individuals!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Though his\n&gt; histrionics have earned him the reputation of being a rabbl=\r\ne-rouser, no one can\n&gt; claim to find anything incriminating against him to =\r\ncharge or drag him to\n&gt; court.\n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking to Gulf\n&gt; News in an exclusive=\r\n interview, Swamy has openly spelt out names on\n&gt; the telecom spectrum scam=\r\n accusing both political and media persons for being\n&gt; corrupt.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n GULF NEWS: You\n&gt; seem to be treading into familiar territory with 2G spect=\r\nrum scam what with\n&gt; earlier taking the cudgels with Janata Dal leader Rama=\r\nkrishna Hegde and All\n&gt; India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader Jayalal=\r\nitha and several others? \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY: This\n&gt; is a very s=\r\nerious matter. The others were for a very different reason. Hegde\n&gt; was a m=\r\nember of my party and crafted the impression that he was a very honest\n&gt; an=\r\nd upright man. But he was most crooked and did all kinds of rackets. And, o=\r\nf\n&gt; course, he was tapping telephones of his own people, including his girl=\r\nfriends!\n&gt; A man who pretends morality had to be exposed. Strangely, in 198=\r\n8, our own\n&gt; party decided to investigate the incident of telephone tapping=\r\n and he supported\n&gt; it thinking I wouldn&#39;t get to the bottom of it. When tr=\r\napped, he filed a\n&gt; defamation case against me and later withdrew, which en=\r\nded his career.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of\n&gt; Jayalalitha, I helped her win =\r\nthe elections and become the Chief Minister. I\n&gt; was also instrumental in p=\r\nroviding her adequate security after the DMK (Dravida\n&gt; Munnetra Kazhagam) =\r\ngovernment, which was close to the LTTE (Liberation Tigers\n&gt; of Tamil Eelam=\r\n) was dismissed. But after winning, she began doing all the\n&gt; rotten things=\r\n that the DMK was doing. Whether she or her associates did, I\n&gt; can&#39;t say. =\r\nI questioned her and she got angry with me. In the process she started\n&gt; le=\r\ntting loose violence against me. That&#39;s when I said to her, `I&#39;ll teach you=\r\n a\n&gt; lesson&#39;. I dropped everything, sat in Tamil Nadu, and brought her down=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Is it because of\n&gt; bringing down governments that you are kno=\r\nwn as a troublemaker? \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s not true.\n&gt; There are also govern=\r\nments where I&#39;ve helped. Like, the Narasimha Rao\n&gt; government couldn&#39;t have=\r\n survived but for me. I created the Chandra Shekhar\n&gt; government, which act=\r\nually initiated the reforms even though it didn&#39;t get the\n&gt; credit because =\r\nit did not last very long. I helped Rajiv Gandhi survive in his\n&gt; worst day=\r\ns when everybody abandoned him.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Just because they\n&gt; [the politi=\r\ncians] can&#39;t say I&#39;m corrupt or illiterate, they spread this usual\n&gt; propag=\r\nanda that I&#39;m a troublemaker. The public doesn&#39;t think so. Else I\n&gt; wouldn&#39;=\r\nt have been elected to Parliament five times.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; But haven&#39;t you\n&gt;=\r\n kind of dragged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to court =97 something that =\r\nwas\n&gt; till now unheard of?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, but I also\n&gt; saved him because =\r\nI thought the press was getting out of control and\n&gt; over-drawing the pictu=\r\nre. I said that he sat on my petition to permit me to\n&gt; prosecute telecommu=\r\nnications minister Andimuthu Raja. Now, for the first time\n&gt; in the history=\r\n of India the Supreme Court has directed the PM to file an\n&gt; affidavit. Thi=\r\ns affidavit shows that every letter of mine was marked by him for\n&gt; action,=\r\n but his officials told him he didn&#39;t have to. He didn&#39;t know the law\n&gt; and=\r\n I don&#39;t expect him to. But since Raja was forced to resign by him, I didn&#39;=\r\nt\n&gt; want any more sanctions and said the PM didn&#39;t need to resign. Now they=\r\n\n&gt; [Congress persons] were wild, because they wanted to shoot him with thei=\r\nr guns\n&gt; on my shoulder.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Who do you mean by\n&gt; `they&#39;?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Congress President\n&gt; Sonia Gandhi. She wants someone more pliable than S=\r\ningh. He&#39;s pliable enough,\n&gt; but obviously, she is not satisfied.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; And who do you\n&gt; think could be considered more pliable?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Def=\r\nence Minister\n&gt; A.K. Antony, if she can&#39;t bring in her son Rahul Gandhi.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Are you getting to\n&gt; all this because your party is nowhere in th=\r\ne picture and you wish to remain in\n&gt; limelight?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; First of all,\n=\r\n&gt; whether I&#39;m doing it for this or that reason, the question is am I speaki=\r\nng the\n&gt; truth. Is there corruption or not? It doesn&#39;t matter what my motiv=\r\nation is.\n&gt; These are cheap diversionary tactics, which I don&#39;t take seriou=\r\nsly.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Why has it taken\n&gt; two years for the 2G spectrum scam to c=\r\nome to light?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s because it\n&gt; took me more than one-and-a-h=\r\nalf years to get hold of the documents, which was\n&gt; not easy. I had written=\r\n to the PM in 2008 and he took two years.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; On what basis do\n&gt; yo=\r\nu say that it could possibly\n&gt; be the case of the most monumental corruptio=\r\nn in world history?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Look at the sheer\n&gt; size of the amount of R=\r\ns1.76 trillion (Dh142 billion) the nation has lost. And\n&gt; I&#39;m not talking a=\r\nbout the bribe, which itself is pretty big. The total loss,\n&gt; had there bee=\r\nn an auction, and what actually it was sold for (Rs100 billion),\n&gt; is huge.=\r\n The bribe is a thing that out of the gain these people have\n&gt; potentially =\r\nmade and will make over the years. My estimate is Rs600 billion of\n&gt; bribe =\r\ninvolved.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you suspect the\n&gt; roles of some journalists and ed=\r\nitors including Hindustan Times columnist Vir\n&gt; Sanghvi and NDTV&#39;s Barkha D=\r\nutt in this scam?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Most people are\n&gt; relying on corporate lobbyi=\r\nst Nira Radia tapes. But I know from personal\n&gt; experience that journalists=\r\n do a lot of hack jobs. If wanted, they character\n&gt; assassinate you at the =\r\nbehest of the ruling party. In my case, the media\n&gt; cannot say anything exc=\r\nept that I&#39;m a troublemaker, which doesn&#39;t sell very\n&gt; well. They don&#39;t pub=\r\nlish anything I say unless it becomes impossible like now,\n&gt; because the te=\r\nlecom scam has become a big issue. They&#39;ve been doing it\n&gt; systematically. =\r\nWhen elections take place, many journalists come and ask\n&gt; for money, sayin=\r\ng they&#39;ll give favourable coverage in return.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of Vi=\r\nr\n&gt; Sanghvi, I know he used to visit Phuket [in Thailand] almost every week=\r\nend and\n&gt; the Tamil Tigers used to finance his trips. Because of his lifest=\r\nyle, I knew he\n&gt; was amenable and a real fixer. He&#39;s been writing articles =\r\ndepending on who&#39;s in\n&gt; power. As for Barkha Dutt, she&#39;s been indiscreet an=\r\nd doing foolish things.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;re quoted as\n&gt; saying that though t=\r\nhe PM is honest, others are not. Who are these persons?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, he=\r\n is honest,\n&gt; but officials around him like his Principal Secretary T.K.A. =\r\nNair and Cabinet\n&gt; Secretary Pulok Chatterjee are not with him. They are al=\r\nl Sonia&#39;s appointees.\n&gt; Even if you ask for the PM&#39;s appointment, her peopl=\r\ne decide who can and cannot\n&gt; see him.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; You&#39;ve also said\n&gt; that =\r\nif the PM resigns, it will strengthen those who made money. Could you name\n=\r\n&gt; them?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Sonia and DMK party\n&gt; chief M Karunanidhi.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYou mean Raja is\n&gt; just a face and the real culprits are the biggies of the=\r\n DMK?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Raja got 10 per\n&gt; cent, Karunanidhi 30 per cent and Sonia=\r\n&#39;s two sisters have got 60 per cent of\n&gt; the loot.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Have you don=\r\ne\n&gt; in-depth research and investigation to make such claims?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Ye=\r\ns, I&#39;ve enormous\n&gt; access because whatever my enemies may say, one thing is=\r\n there that I&#39;ve never\n&gt; betrayed anybody. Today, people in the government =\r\nare so fed up seeing\n&gt; everything happening in close range and all this mat=\r\nerial is available\n&gt; with the PM.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Why is the UPA - 2\n&gt; seeing s=\r\no many scams?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier, the scams\n&gt; were related to the defence =\r\ndeals, where things were difficult. Now, they have\n&gt; got into things within=\r\n the country. And since there are lots of players, some\n&gt; of them spill the=\r\n beans.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; You think the\n&gt; recent Mumbai&#39;s Adarsh housing and 2 G =\r\nspectrum scams could be inter-related?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, looks like it.\n&gt; Lo=\r\nts of loans have been given, which obviously have been used\n&gt; \n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; How=\r\n soon do you\n&gt; think all this will come out?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Raja getting an\n&gt; =\r\narrest warrant will happen soon and cancellation of the licences given so f=\r\nar\n&gt; could happen within the next 2-3 months. As far as the recovery of the=\r\n money is\n&gt; concerned, of which there is a big demand in the country, that =\r\nwill take time.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, if the\n&gt; Americans, who know it all, c=\r\no-operate, we can get it because there is the UN\n&gt; agreement on money laund=\r\nering.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Do you think the\n&gt; Congress will ask the Americans?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; No, they won&#39;t. But\n&gt; I can force them to. It&#39;s only a matter of ti=\r\nme. They know what I can do\n&gt; in court. They can&#39;t buy my lawyers, because =\r\nI don&#39;t keep any! I\n&gt; argue cases myself.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Why is the Congress\n&gt;=\r\n so adamant about not having a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe in=\r\nto\n&gt; the 2 G scam?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s because the\n&gt; JPC will be free for al=\r\nl. And they know that I will start advising the MPs\n&gt; what questions to ask=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; One of the\n&gt; questions is about her [Sonia&#39;s] sisters having =\r\ngot the money. And if the JPC\n&gt; calls for the intelligence people, they wil=\r\nl have to question her because the\n&gt; data is now with them.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Fac=\r\ntfile\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  Dr Subramanian Swamy was born in Mylapore,\n&gt;      Chennai on=\r\n September 15, 1939.\n&gt;  He holds a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard\n&gt;      U=\r\nniversity.\n&gt;  He taught at Harvard for 10 years and still\n&gt;      holds summ=\r\ner sessions.\n&gt;  Entered politics in 1970 and came into\n&gt;      limelight for=\r\n protesting against the emergency imposed in the country in\n&gt;      1975.\n&gt; =\r\n One of the founder members of the Janata Party,\n&gt;      he has been its pre=\r\nsident since 1990.\n&gt;  Elected five times to Parliament (thrice to the\n&gt;    =\r\n  Lok Sabha and twice to the Rajya Sabha), representing Mumbai, Uttar\n&gt;    =\r\n  Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.\n&gt;  Has been Cabinet Minister of Commerce and Law\n=\r\n&gt;      & Justice.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://gulfnews.com/news/world/india/i-saved-prim=\r\ne-minister-in-telecom-scandal-says-swamy-1.722635\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
