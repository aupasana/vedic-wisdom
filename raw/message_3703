Is this=\r\n really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Maagha Pournima as people think?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; My personal view is that it is Pushya Pournima right now and Feb 11 is=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi and not MahaaShivaraatri.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When a new month as per Chaandramaana starts on February 1=\r\n3, people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; consider it as Phalguna maasa because Moon and Sun a=\r\nre in Kumbha. But the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; next Pournima on February 28 coincides w=\r\nith Magha nakshatra. I suggest that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; THAT is the real Maagha Po=\r\nurnima. So March 13 is the Maagha Krishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Chaturdasi, i.e. Mah=\r\naaShivaraatri.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bo=\r\nttomline: I agree with the conclusion of souramaana proponents this&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; particular time, but for a different reason compared to theirs. I&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; respectfully suggest that we are all lacking in our understanding=\r\n of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; correct calendar used with tithi based festivals. We c=\r\nelebrate festivals on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the correct days most of the times, but =\r\nmake mistakes now and then. Some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; misunderstandings still need =\r\nto be corrected.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Good thing is that the knowledge=\r\n of rishis is self-revealing and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; self-correcting. If one is si=\r\nncere and applies oneself, one can find the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; answers.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nDo It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n\r\n--5-0678323311-1710830327=:4--\r\n\n"}}
