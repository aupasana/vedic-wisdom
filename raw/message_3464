I want to make a clarification=\r\n on this from the Upanishadic perspective.\n\nIn Vedic paradigm, senses do no=\r\nt mean physical senses. Sensory organs (jnaanedriyas) are not part of the p=\r\nhysical body (annamaya kosha), but part of the mental body (manomaya kosha)=\r\n.\n\nI may &quot;see&quot; a picture of Sri MahaLakshmi in front of me now. When I clos=\r\ne my eyes and meditate, I may &quot;see&quot; something else. When I sleep and get a =\r\ndream, I may &quot;see&quot; something else. The jnaanendriya of vision is a part of =\r\nthe mind and not body. It may connect to the physical eye and &quot;see&quot; some ob=\r\njects or connect to something else and &quot;see&quot; some other objects. In Upanish=\r\nadic paradigm, we do not consider one of them to be superior to the other.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nInstead of using the terms matter and proto-matter=\r\n, let us use the word &quot;dual consciousness&quot; to describe all objects in the f=\r\nield of duality. This includes objects that can be perceived by the physica=\r\nl senses (&quot;matter&quot; in your terminology) and objects that cannot be perceive=\r\nd by the physical senses (&quot;proto-matter&quot; in your terminology).\n\nThe abstrac=\r\ntion in Upanishadic paradigm is this:\n\nThere exists &quot;non-dual consciousness=\r\n&quot;, which is sat-chid-aananda (pure truth, pure awareness, pure bliss) as yo=\r\nu say. This is represented by Shiva. Then there exists &quot;dual consciousness&quot;=\r\n, which is represented by Shakti. Dual consciousness has boundaries and inf=\r\ninite objects in it, while non-dual consciousness is undivided.\n=C2=A0\nHowe=\r\nver, if one takes the dual consciousness in its entirety, it is non-differe=\r\nnt from non-dual consciousness. This fact is also represented by saying tha=\r\nt Shiva and Shakti are in reality one and not two. If one self-identifies w=\r\nith the ENTIRE &quot;dual consciousness&quot;, then one is absorbed in the dual-consc=\r\niousness in its entirety, which is non-different from non-dual consciousnes=\r\ns. In other words, one is absorbed in non-dual consciousness. That is Nirvi=\r\nkalpa Samadhi.\n\nThe problem is not dual consciousness. Dual consciousness i=\r\ns identical to non-dual consciousness in the absence of self-identification=\r\n with any limited objects of dual consciousness. Hence the problem is not d=\r\nual consciousness, but the self-identification or I-ness or egosense or aha=\r\nmkaara or asmitaa, to a limited aspect of dual consciousness.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n\nA normal person&#39;s self-identification is symbolized by one&#39;s Kundali=\r\nni shakti. When Kundalini is asleep, one is instinctively identifying with =\r\na body-name-entity and stuck in the delusion of duality. As Kundalini wakes=\r\n up and starts rising, one&#39;s self-identification is refined further and fur=\r\nther. Some also say that one&#39;s shakti is getting purified further and furth=\r\ner. Even when Kundalini is at Ajna or one of the chakras between Ajna and S=\r\nahasrara, one&#39;s self-identification is with a subset of dual consciousness =\r\nand nor with the entirety of dual consciousness. There are still notions of=\r\n I and others, current time, past, future etc. When Kundalini is at Sahasra=\r\nara, we say that Kundalini shakti is perfectly purified. In other words, on=\r\ne&#39;s self-identification is with the entire dual consciousness and there is =\r\nno I and others, current time, past and future etc. One identifies with the=\r\n entire field of duality. Such a perfectly purified Shakti is non-different=\r\n\n from Shiva. This is depicted as a union between Shiva and Shakti.\n\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nI see no logical quandary. If you show the logical quandary in=\r\n the abstraction I presented, I can try to analyze and help.\n=C2=A0\nThe pro=\r\nblem is that nirvikalpa samadhi and Brahman were portrayed by some yogis (e=\r\n.g. Buddha) in the past as a great void. Though that is true in a way, it c=\r\nan also be described as &quot;encompassing all&quot; instead of &quot;void&quot;.\n\nBest regards=\r\n,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=\r\n=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- On Wed, 1=\r\n/13/10, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: vedica=\r\nstrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Nirvikalp=\r\na Samadhi (Re: Samadhi) - to Narasimhaji\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nD=\r\nate: Wednesday, January 13, 2010, 6:13 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      =\r\n\n      \n      Dear Narasimhaji,\n\n Thank you for your reply. I already know =\r\nall this that you say - I am simply trying to draw you into explaining the =\r\nlogical quandary that is in there, but you are avoiding it (possibly becaus=\r\ne of my poor presentation) . Let me try once more to communicate more effec=\r\ntively, this time I&#39;ll start from the basics as I understand them (please f=\r\neel free to negate/correct them).\n\n\n\nTo me, as I have understood whatever t=\r\nexts I have read, that the ONLY source of consciousness, is Brahman. This h=\r\nas exactly 3 attributes - it is pure truth (i.e. it is unconditional) , it =\r\nis pure awareness and it is pure bliss. There is absolutely nothing else. T=\r\nhere is no sense of time, no sense of space, no sense of any boundary of an=\r\ny kind (spatial, temporal etc). Because boundaries would mean duality (at t=\r\nhe very least). Consequently, there is no thought either - because thought =\r\nhas objects, and objects are objects because they are a boundary between so=\r\nmething that is the object and something that is not the object.\n\n\n\nSo how =\r\ndo boundaries (e.g. thought) come about in the first place? See, Western th=\r\ninking believes (and we unknowingly mix concepts) in matter and consciousne=\r\nss, where matter is all that can be sensed (by the 5 senses), and conscious=\r\nness is all that cant (by the 5 senses). Vedic thinking goes deeper, and ef=\r\nfectively divides consciousness into proto-matter (non-(5)-sensory matter -=\r\n everything from the gunas upto the mahabhutas) and pure/essential consciou=\r\nsness (brahman). \n\n\n\nSo, if you want to use Western thinking, you can say -=\r\n my sense of I and all my thoughts are in my consciousness. And you can get=\r\n away with this statement, no one in the Western style of thinking will eve=\r\nr contradict you. But if you are to think the Vedic way, you cant say my se=\r\nnse of I and my thoughts are in Brahman. Due to the above definition of Bra=\r\nhman, every single thought or every single boundary you perceive or identif=\r\ny, has to have a corresponding unique signature in proto-matter. Do you see=\r\n where I&#39;m going with this? There is no thought or feeling or identity or u=\r\nniqueness that&#39;s &quot;just in the mind&quot;. Every single one must have a signature=\r\n i.e be a particular &quot;configuration&quot; of proto-matter. Consequently, at the =\r\nimmediate moment before you enter NVKS, when you say &quot;I&quot; went into NVKS, th=\r\ne statement is a contradiction in itself. Because that &quot;I thinking of enter=\r\ning NVKS&quot; is nothing but a configuration of proto-matter - it is simply a p=\r\narticular\n state of the sookshma sarira. When NVKS is achieved, all you can=\r\n say is - &quot;I&quot; disappeared - you cant say &quot;I got a feeling of enlightenment&quot;=\r\n . You will now say - that is exactly what I am saying with salt water doll=\r\n analogy. But I say to that - then how can you say &quot;I&quot; reappeared. If pure =\r\nconsciousness is just as I said above, when the &quot;I&quot; disappears, the entire =\r\nsookshma sarira - essentially nothing but a configuration of proto-matter d=\r\nisappears. Who can bring that back? Pure consciousness has no memory, no mo=\r\ntive, no increase, no decrease, no identity, nothing - it is INVARIANT. The=\r\nn, if that configuration of proto-matter (sookshma sarira) is to reappear (=\r\neven if in a changed form &quot;I got enlightened&quot; ), it means there must be a m=\r\nemory of it somewhere, which acted as the agent for &quot;reincarnating&quot; it. The=\r\n only logical place for that memory (according to the argument presented ab=\r\nove) is proto-matter itself. So unless there is some kind of new construct\n=\r\n that I dont know about, it isnt possible for that very sookshma sarira to =\r\nreappear. Consequently, if the physical body were to remain, it must mean a=\r\n brand new sookshma sarira got instantly attached to it. \n\n\n\nSo I hope you =\r\nget the point I&#39;m trying to make - it is easy to sweep things under the rug=\r\n by doing a &quot;deux ex machina&quot; (http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Deux_ex_machi=\r\nna), but this going in and out of NVKS isnt logically consistent with what =\r\nNVKS is portrayed to be.\n\n\n\nPlease tell me how I am wrong\n\n\n\nRegards\n\n\n\nSun=\r\ndeep\n\n \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I want to make a clarification on this from the Upanishadi=\r\nc perspective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Vedic paradigm, senses do not mean physical senses=\r\n. Sensory organs (jnaanedriyas) are not part of the physical body (annamaya=\r\n kosha), but part of the mental body (manomaya kosha).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I may &quot;see&quot; a=\r\n picture of Sri MahaLakshmi in front of me now. When I close my eyes and me=\r\nditate, I may &quot;see&quot; something else. When I sleep and get a dream, I may &quot;se=\r\ne&quot; something else. The jnaanendriya of vision is a part of the mind and not=\r\n body. It may connect to the physical eye and &quot;see&quot; some objects or connect=\r\n to\n something else and &quot;see&quot; some other objects. In Upanishadic paradigm, =\r\nwe do not consider one of them to be superior to the other.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Instead of using the terms matter and proto-matter, let=\r\n us use the word &quot;dual consciousness&quot; to describe all objects in the field =\r\nof duality. This includes objects that can be perceived by the physical sen=\r\nses (&quot;matter&quot; in your terminology) and objects that cannot be perceived by =\r\nthe physical senses (&quot;proto-matter&quot; in your terminology).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The abstra=\r\nction in Upanishadic paradigm is this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There exists &quot;non-dual consci=\r\nousness&quot;, which is sat-chid-aananda (pure truth, pure awareness, pure bliss=\r\n) as you say. This is represented by Shiva. Then there exists &quot;dual conscio=\r\nusness&quot;, which is represented by Shakti. Dual consciousness has boundaries =\r\nand infinite objects in it, while non-dual consciousness is\n undivided.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;However, if one takes the dual consciousness in its entirety, it =\r\nis non-different from non-dual consciousness. This fact is also represented=\r\n by saying that Shiva and Shakti are in reality one and not two. If one sel=\r\nf-identifies with the ENTIRE &quot;dual consciousness&quot;, then one is absorbed in =\r\nthe dual-consciousness in its entirety, which is non-different from non-dua=\r\nl consciousness. In other words, one is absorbed in non-dual consciousness.=\r\n That is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem is not dual consciousness. =\r\nDual consciousness is identical to non-dual consciousness in the absence of=\r\n self-identification with any limited objects of dual consciousness. Hence =\r\nthe problem is not dual consciousness, but the self-identification or I-nes=\r\ns or egosense or ahamkaara or asmitaa, to a limited aspect of dual consciou=\r\nsness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A normal person&#39;s\n self-identification =\r\nis symbolized by one&#39;s Kundalini shakti. When Kundalini is asleep, one is i=\r\nnstinctively identifying with a body-name-entity and stuck in the delusion =\r\nof duality. As Kundalini wakes up and starts rising, one&#39;s self-identificat=\r\nion is refined further and further. Some also say that one&#39;s shakti is gett=\r\ning purified further and further. Even when Kundalini is at Ajna or one of =\r\nthe chakras between Ajna and Sahasrara, one&#39;s self-identification is with a=\r\n subset of dual consciousness and nor with the entirety of dual consciousne=\r\nss. There are still notions of I and others, current time, past, future etc=\r\n. When Kundalini is at Sahasraara, we say that Kundalini shakti is perfectl=\r\ny purified. In other words, one&#39;s self-identification is with the entire du=\r\nal consciousness and there is no I and others, current time, past and futur=\r\ne etc. One identifies with the entire field of duality. Such a perfectly pu=\r\nrified Shakti is non-different from Shiva. This\n is depicted as a union bet=\r\nween Shiva and Shakti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see no logical quanda=\r\nry. If you show the logical quandary in the abstraction I presented, I can =\r\ntry to analyze and help.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The problem is that nirvikalpa samadh=\r\ni and Brahman were portrayed by some yogis (e.g. Buddha) in the past as a g=\r\nreat void. Though that is true in a way, it can also be described as &quot;encom=\r\npassing all&quot; instead of &quot;void&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films=\r\n that make a difference:\n http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jy=\r\notish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;----------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;=\r\nWed, 1/13/10, vedicastrostudent &lt;i&gt;&lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;=\r\n/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);=\r\n margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicast=\r\nrostudent@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Nirvikalpa Samadhi (Re: =\r\nSamadhi) - to Narasimhaji&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wedn=\r\nesday, January 13, 2010, 6:13 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv783094562&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n    =\r\n  \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Dear Narasimhaji,&lt;br&gt;\n Thank you for your reply. I alrea=\r\ndy know all this that you say - I am simply trying to draw you into explain=\r\ning the logical quandary that is in there, but you are avoiding it (possibl=\r\ny because of my poor presentation) . Let me try once more to communicate mo=\r\nre effectively, this time I&#39;ll start from the basics as I understand them (=\r\nplease feel free to negate/correct them).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTo me, as I have underst=\r\nood whatever texts I have read, that the ONLY source of consciousness, is B=\r\nrahman. This has exactly 3 attributes - it is pure truth (i.e. it is uncond=\r\nitional) , it is pure awareness and it is pure bliss. There is absolutely n=\r\nothing else. There is no sense of time, no sense of space, no sense of any =\r\nboundary of any kind (spatial, temporal etc). Because boundaries would mean=\r\n duality (at the very least). Consequently, there is no thought either - be=\r\ncause thought has objects, and objects are objects because they are a bound=\r\nary between something that is the object and something that is not the obje=\r\nct.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo how do boundaries (e.g. thought) come about in the first pl=\r\nace? See, Western thinking believes (and we unknowingly mix concepts) in ma=\r\ntter and consciousness, where matter is all that can be sensed (by the 5 se=\r\nnses), and consciousness is all that cant (by the 5 senses). Vedic thinking=\r\n goes deeper, and effectively divides consciousness into proto-matter (non-=\r\n(5)-sensory matter - everything from the gunas upto the mahabhutas) and pur=\r\ne/essential consciousness (brahman). &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo, if you want to use Weste=\r\nrn thinking, you can say - my sense of I and all my thoughts are in my cons=\r\nciousness. And you can get away with this statement, no one in the Western =\r\nstyle of thinking will ever contradict you. But if you are to think the Ved=\r\nic way, you cant say my sense of I and my thoughts are in Brahman. Due to t=\r\nhe above definition of Brahman, every single thought or every single bounda=\r\nry you perceive or identify, has to have a corresponding unique signature i=\r\nn proto-matter. Do you see where I&#39;m going with this? There is no thought o=\r\nr feeling or identity or uniqueness that&#39;s &quot;just in the mind&quot;. Every single=\r\n one must have a signature i.e be a particular &quot;configuration&quot; of proto-mat=\r\nter. Consequently, at the immediate moment before you enter NVKS, when you =\r\nsay &quot;I&quot; went into NVKS, the statement is a contradiction in itself. Because=\r\n that &quot;I thinking of entering NVKS&quot; is nothing but a configuration of proto=\r\n-matter - it is simply a particular\n state of the sookshma sarira. When NVK=\r\nS is achieved, all you can say is - &quot;I&quot; disappeared - you cant say &quot;I got a=\r\n feeling of enlightenment&quot; . You will now say - that is exactly what I am s=\r\naying with salt water doll analogy. But I say to that - then how can you sa=\r\ny &quot;I&quot; reappeared. If pure consciousness is just as I said above, when the &quot;=\r\nI&quot; disappears, the entire sookshma sarira - essentially nothing but a confi=\r\nguration of proto-matter disappears. Who can bring that back? Pure consciou=\r\nsness has no memory, no motive, no increase, no decrease, no identity, noth=\r\ning - it is INVARIANT. Then, if that configuration of proto-matter (sookshm=\r\na sarira) is to reappear (even if in a changed form &quot;I got enlightened&quot; ), =\r\nit means there must be a memory of it somewhere, which acted as the agent f=\r\nor &quot;reincarnating&quot; it. The only logical place for that memory (according to=\r\n the argument presented above) is proto-matter itself. So unless there is s=\r\nome kind of new construct\n that I dont know about, it isnt possible for tha=\r\nt very sookshma sarira to reappear. Consequently, if the physical body were=\r\n to remain, it must mean a brand new sookshma sarira got instantly attached=\r\n to it. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo I hope you get the point I&#39;m trying to make - it is ea=\r\nsy to sweep things under the rug by doing a &quot;deux ex machina&quot; (&lt;a rel=3D&quot;no=\r\nfollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_ex_mach=\r\nina&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia .org/wiki/ Deux_ex_machina&lt;/a&gt;), but this going in=\r\n and out of NVKS isnt logically consistent with what NVKS is portrayed to b=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlease tell me how I am wrong&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegards&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSundeep=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

For example, =\r\nTotapuri was familiar only with non-dual Nirvikalpa samadhi, but Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa used to go to non-dual Nirvikalpa samadhi as well as other du=\r\nalistic samadhis frequently.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp=\r\n;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n =\r\n    \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-1667829468-1263700537=:82794--\r\n\n"}}
