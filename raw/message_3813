After all, th=\r\ne main thing is to reach god. As I keep saying again and again, specific ad=\r\nvice given by saints may be adopted to their desa-kaala-paatra.\n \nThings ch=\r\nange from time to time and from place to place. For example, the pervasiven=\r\ness of sexualized imagery in mainstream media that is encountered by people=\r\n in their daily lives today from a very young age, were not there 120 years=\r\n back. There are so many changes like that in our environment. What impact =\r\ndo they have on the minds of people and the challenges faced by them in spi=\r\nritual progress? Will the relevance and usefulness of different methods und=\r\nergo change with time?\n  \nPeople like to stereotype and restrict ideas and =\r\nconcepts to stereotypes. But one need not call oneself an aghori or engage =\r\nin all aghora practices to benefit from some ideas associated with aghora.\n=\r\n \nBTW, whether one uses the front door or backdoor, the main thing is to re=\r\nach god inside. If someone has aversion for  backdoor, that&#39;s fine and he c=\r\nan use the front door.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBTW, Ramakrishna did engage =\r\nin all the 64 practices of tantra, under the guidance of Bhairavi Braahmani=\r\n who was sent by Trilinga Swami.\n \nAlso, Ramakrishna did meet Trilinga Swam=\r\ni in person and fed him rice pudding with his own hands. Aghori Vimalananda=\r\n also met Trilinga Swami before his life transformed with the darshan of Sm=\r\nashana Tara and said Trilinga Swami was his guru-bhai (i.e. same lineage). =\r\nIt is a small world with many interesting connections.\n \n*        *        =\r\n*\n \nNow on to the thread quoted below..\n \nComment on Rajarshi&#39;s original po=\r\nint:\n \nRina is something you &quot;owe&quot; and hence &quot;give back&quot;. Rina is all about=\r\n giving and not taking. Most sense gratification people engage in involves =\r\nmore taking than giving. When you &quot;give&quot; something (to others or to univers=\r\ne), you are paying back your debt. When you &quot;take&quot; something (from others o=\r\nr from universe), you are creating a new debt that will need to be paid bac=\r\nk later. A simple formula is &quot;give all you can and do not get worked up if =\r\nyou are not receiving enough in return&quot;. Of course, when you have an opport=\r\nunity to give different things to different people and have to pick some, y=\r\nou have to use your judgment to pick the right ones, to pay off a more impo=\r\nrtant rina with the little you have!!\n \nThe problem is that it is so diffic=\r\nult to give without getting something back (i.e. pay back old debt and crea=\r\nte a new debt)! This is true with anything and not just the example of sex =\r\nyou mentioned. Of course, when it comes to sex, it may be even more difficu=\r\nlt. One may tend to think more about one&#39;s own pleasure than partner&#39;s. Eve=\r\nn when one thinks about partner&#39;s pleasure, it may be with an egoistic focu=\r\ns (&quot;am *I* able to give pleasure&quot;). Who forgets own pleasure and thinks &quot;I =\r\nwill submit to the god in my partner and give as much pleasure as I can to =\r\ngod in this form. My own pleasure does not matter at all and I will not thi=\r\nnk about it&quot;? If one indeed does that successfully, then hardly new rina is=\r\n created and old rina is paid back.\n \nNow, forget sex. Even in other things=\r\n, giving goes hand-in-hand with taking and we often create new rinas. As lo=\r\nng as our ego remains, we are always pursuing self-gratification in many wa=\r\nys.\n \nSuppose I made a promise to my guru in last life to spread homam and =\r\nastrology and created a rina. Or suppose I undermined them in my last life =\r\nand ended up creating a rina. Or suppose I benefited from those subjects an=\r\nd created a rina.\n \nSomehow or the other, suppose I created a rina that set=\r\n the stage for the work of this life. Suppose the rina requires me to do so=\r\nmething for those subjects, e.g. teach homam, teach astrology, give a free =\r\nastrology software etc. All this is what I am &quot;giving&quot;, i.e. I am paying ba=\r\nck a rina I created before somehow or the other.\n \nNow, suppose people star=\r\nt praising me for what I am doing and I feel proud and gratified. This grat=\r\nification I derive is something I am &quot;taking&quot; from others and the universe.=\r\n So this is a rina.\n \nOf course, I cannot control what others do. When I gi=\r\nve something to them - knowledge or manuals or software etc - they may prai=\r\nse me to ANY level. That I cannot control. But I CAN control how proud and =\r\ngratified I feel. By conscious effort, constant contemplation, surrender to=\r\n the Mother and viewing it as a lila in which I a small instrument, I can t=\r\nry to not focus my mind on what universe is giving me and focus it instead =\r\non what more I can give to the universe.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If b=\r\ny exercising ones will power, an individual is able to avoid paying a rna, =\r\nwhat happens then? &lt; &lt; &lt;\n \nEverything you took does need to be paid back. A=\r\nctually, paying back is never a problem. If you can pay back a rina without=\r\n incurring a new rina in the process, it is safe anytime to give back and t=\r\nhere is no need to delay or avoid.\n \nBut, if that is not the case, you can =\r\ntry to use your will power to delay payback to a time later when you are ho=\r\npefully able to give without taking something back.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nUtpal, in your example, &quot;Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain=\r\n under stress&quot; under (1) are useless activities. They involve no giving and=\r\n no productive action.\n \nI said earlier: &quot;Of course, when you have an oppor=\r\ntunity to give different things to different people and have to pick some, =\r\nyou have to use your judgment to pick the right ones, to pay off a more imp=\r\nortant rina with the little you have!!&quot;\n \nSo part of option (1) is valid. I=\r\nf one believes there is a chance to retrieve the money and put it to a good=\r\n use to fulfil some other important rina, one can try. But, if one determin=\r\nes that there is no chance, one should be able to put it to rest (i.e. (2))=\r\n. Similarly, one should put in one&#39;s effort prepared for any outcome and no=\r\nt thinking about the money always.\n \nWhat action you engage in decides the =\r\noutcome and not whether you think about this action and its object all the =\r\ntime. By thinking about it all the time and becoming anxious, you achieve n=\r\nothing. In fact, such anxiety may sometimes cloud your judment, stop you fr=\r\nom doing the right thing and reduce your efficiency. Attachment limits effi=\r\nciency. It is action that gets result and not attachment. Detached action i=\r\ns the best formula for efficient action. Both inaction and attached action =\r\nare formulas for disaster.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n \n---- dinesh_nambisan &lt;dinesh@nambisan.n=\r\net&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Utpal-bhai:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your thoughts.

He follows up=\r\n for the money but with the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to hi=\r\ns family and friends that he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act =\r\netc...

If they needed to come back, she will do it or if they were to be p=\r\naid to nullify some past rinas then they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With =\r\nthe Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be =\r\nable to break free from this particular chain. He may have successfully PAI=\r\nD BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified hi=\r\nmself very strongly with Money and its ownership and hence all the actions =\r\ndone due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to =\r\nsettled on a later date.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However I am not sure for what I have wri=\r\ntten.

The mind perceives a woman or man of the opposite sex in a different way.=\r\n This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My spiri=\r\ntual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used to say  in a slightly different context that=\r\n he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I applied it to this as w=\r\nell and it works quite well.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Two things  are going to be  useful, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Continue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuat=\r\nion of your sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata an=\r\nd do not be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the  thing =\r\nin your mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a =\r\nnaked female(or male as  may be the case)  body is like a landscape picture=\r\n just like any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or A=\r\nngkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly  feel that th=\r\ne picture  is very beautiful  but you need not be aroused by it). In fact S=\r\ntriya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once this stage is rea=\r\nched then the mind ceases to think of sex all the while.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes you may =\r\nstill encounter it, but that is another story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

But, it is possible that he also likes the book and starts enj=\r\noying the book along with you and stops distracting you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If =\r\nmeditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is like the friend and =\r\nsexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like the distractions caused by =\r\nthe friend, then aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting the friend to=\r\n read the book along with you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said, there are=\r\n no guarantees. This friend may get interested in the book and stop distrac=\r\nting you, or he may continue to distract you and make it worse by being rig=\r\nht next to you through the reading. It is tricky to know how long one shoul=\r\nd try before deciding that it is not working. That is why we say that aghor=\r\na is not for everyone.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                                    http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;          Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: swamisathasivom@=\r\n rocketmail. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wed=\r\nnesday, February 24, 2010 11:48 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Aghora=\r\n books by Svoboda (Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskarams=\r\n   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reply is amazing and true \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bow down to yr knowl=\r\nedge given by ma durga Mahalakshmi .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was stunned by this answers ,i=\r\nts answers to many questions in our inner mind .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I stopped all and re=\r\nad this reply almost 5 th time .each time some new points I am catching fro=\r\nm in it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nandhi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent from my BlackBerry =C2=AE smartphone\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

The idea is that=\r\n one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates it=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the d=\r\nivine Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and overcome various w=\r\neaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a re=\r\ngular basis will promote the fighting spirit within one that fights these w=\r\neaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa an=\r\nd trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother cr=\r\neates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in=\r\n that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overc=\r\nome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one =\r\nrealizes Self at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally sees =\r\nthat all these are aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially true =\r\nSelf.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *               *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Als=\r\no, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Svo=\r\nbodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I=\r\n need to read more! \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good=\r\n, but Aghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feeli=\r\nngs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One =\r\nof the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true  Aghora (aghori) does not see =\r\nanything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifesta=\r\ntions of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permane=\r\nnt (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carr=\r\nying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is =\r\ntrue and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself tha=\r\nt life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. B=\r\nut the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth o=\r\nnly when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing=\r\n we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourse=\r\nlves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary=\r\n illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illu=\r\nsions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, c=\r\nan&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautif=\r\nul and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. Onl=\r\ny the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\nWhen someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, c=\r\nan&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary il=\r\nlusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusio=\r\nns&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; alw=\r\nays. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of =\r\n*dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc=\r\n and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and f=\r\nocus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *   =\r\n            *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The=\r\n variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If =\r\nfeces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reali=\r\nty within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces=\r\n. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.  But, please remember that e=\r\nating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consum=\r\ned and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit et=\r\nc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no pur=\r\npose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation=\r\n of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces=\r\n, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; w=\r\nith certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be th=\r\ninking that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, a v=\r\nedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eatin=\r\ng food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Neverth=\r\neless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in on=\r\ne&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestati=\r\nons of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly sal=\r\nty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth=\r\n and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora=\r\n is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very=\r\n bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one =\r\nto transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that=\r\n says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely =\r\nmade food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating=\r\n is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste=\r\n of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the =\r\nmind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be s=\r\no disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experi=\r\nence may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However,=\r\n difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely beca=\r\nuse of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *               *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take another=\r\n simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and =\r\nhomam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on=\r\n sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is causin=\r\ng guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A regular person will tr=\r\ny to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that=\r\n is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts ma=\r\ny still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, the=\r\nre is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite=\r\n one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have f=\r\nor sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to=\r\n fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keepin=\r\ng sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impur=\r\ne), he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impur=\r\ne. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap a=\r\nnd then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in =\r\nsex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he pe=\r\nrsists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may=\r\n be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. =\r\nHe may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between nake=\r\ndness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or menta=\r\nlly may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. =\r\nAny small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not le=\r\nad to denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in =\r\nsadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending =\r\nso much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction a=\r\nnd thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overa=\r\nll, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and th=\r\ne thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of =\r\nthese structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those stru=\r\nctures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It=\r\n is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely =\r\nfor sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thin=\r\nking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious=\r\n/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *               *     =\r\n          *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknes=\r\nses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal per=\r\nson may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low st=\r\nakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n *               *               *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Like Manish said in a mail earli=\r\ner, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way =\r\nto understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a =\r\nhigh stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and man=\r\ny may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for =\r\nit based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brin=\r\ngs.  Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attr=\r\nact some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Agh=\r\nora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates ho=\r\nw one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasa=\r\nnt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various=\r\n spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

But what I am trying to understand  is that=\r\n how to worship both forms simultaneously. For  instance, Sri Muththuswamy =\r\nDiskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Mus=\r\nic along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vi=\r\ndyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis  mention  great details about al=\r\nl the  nine avaranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes t=\r\nhrough each avarana.  In the Dhyana Krithi  of those, in the very  first li=\r\nne he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.  That line tells me=\r\n that  even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was=\r\n a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of=\r\n duality! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have started re=\r\nading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before=\r\n I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I=\r\n really cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see =\r\nhow mother will help me achieve my target. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have sta=\r\nrted to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha.

THAT is awe-inspiring.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that needs=\r\n a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadh=\r\nanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the time bet=\r\nween ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 me=\r\ntres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to =\r\nfind water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One possibility is to do a homam and then meditate=\r\n at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from the lit=\r\ntle I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of the =\r\nlayers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the lay=\r\ner of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lalita means gentle one and Ch=\r\nandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you=\r\n will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you will =\r\nlearn fast (provided you can face the strictness).
