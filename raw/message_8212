Most common of the meaning/=\r\ninterpretations being the charaadi interpretation/meaning, uparicharaadi in=\r\nterpretation/meaning and manvaadi interpretation/meaning. In the same way, =\r\nthey have three general effects on the kartru - manvaadi, charaadi and upar=\r\nicharaadi. What you are saying, that is, there is nothing wrong for kids in=\r\n reciting it. You are right in the broader sense of the sentence, in that, =\r\nthe effects would be &#39;manvaadi&#39;. That is psychological. I mean to say, the =\r\nmind gets cleansed. If the charaadi (that is body.ly effects - such as impr=\r\novement in health, kaanti etc.,) and uparicharaadi (that is beyond that com=\r\nposed of the common, - the interpretation/meaning as seen with the help of =\r\ninner eye) effects is to take place, one has to either have &#39;aparOkshajnaan=\r\na&#39; or a deep understanding of what is being recited, which can be obtained =\r\nthrough a guru (again, please note that\n guru means a &#39;teacher&#39; in the broa=\r\nd sense of the word, but a deeper meaning exists. guru - ---- giratEti gruH=\r\n. One who eats/destroys/removes the ego in the student).\n\nSimilar to the ab=\r\nove interpretations, homa, yoga, tapas all have multiple meanings. Tapas do=\r\nes not mean holding one&#39;s breadth for so long and all.. Tapas means &quot;deep t=\r\nhought&quot;. It might be anything. If you are trying to understand the meaning =\r\nof AUM (not &#39;OM&#39;) through meditation, then that is tapas (it does not requi=\r\nre us to be seated in front of idols and etc.. the important thing is we sh=\r\nould be seated infront of &#39;what we are thinking so deep about&#39;). Again ther=\r\ne are various stages to it, which is another story. Please note that one ca=\r\nnnot comment about these &quot;heavy&quot; words in such a general way.\n\n\nFirst, let =\r\nthe kid develop a sense of spirituality inside her (again, spirituality is =\r\nnot to be confused with doing routine namaskaaras, poojas and so on...., th=\r\ney only aid the manvaadi saadhane in spirituality). First teach the kid, sa=\r\nmskrita. A desire to learn the scriptures should be developed, from within =\r\nthe kid. Teach her Indian Classical music (you can start from bhajans and g=\r\nradually make it to pure classical) and she might discover her own way to p=\r\nerform aahata and anahata naadayoga. Once, a person steps into practicing n=\r\naada yoga, the rest of the exterior world becomes very simple and transpare=\r\nnt and the hidden meanings of texts in our scriptures open up all by themse=\r\nlves with very little of our focused efforts. As Thyagaraaja rightfully sai=\r\nd, sangeetamaarga is the easiest maarga to moksha (again there are multiple=\r\n levels of meaning to moksha here....). \n\nI agree, we are all kids in the f=\r\nield of spirituality. Infact, when godess Lakshmi herself tells in all humi=\r\nlity that &quot;mama yoniH apsu antaH samudre&quot; (there is one above me who sits i=\r\nn the ocean.....---referring to Lord VishNu), we are all but toddlers in th=\r\ne part of spirituality. But, we have to make our efforts in an efficient ma=\r\nnner, because, the todays, 60 or 80 years of lifetime is too short on the g=\r\nrand scale of time. Directly starting of with hOmas and etc,, is a bit too =\r\nmuch for the kids and its imprtactical also. If the basement is not built p=\r\nroperly, it is not possible to build a building properly.. It might collaps=\r\ne anytime.\n\nI highly appreciate the parents for having this thought, but my=\r\n comments should be taken as a word of advice. In our present state of bhar=\r\natadesha; amongst the people who have abandoned their vedic roots by taking=\r\n the wrong interpretation of the words &quot;modernization&quot; and &quot;professionalism=\r\n&quot;, it is really positive and it gives me immense joy, that parents like the=\r\n questioner are still there who want to inculcate the vast, deep vedic trad=\r\nition in their kids. But this does not mean, we can take these &quot;heavy&quot; thin=\r\ngs liberally and do things as we wish.\n- With warm regards\n\nSunil Anandathe=\r\nertha\n\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krish=\r\nnan@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Thursday, 3 May 20=\r\n12 8:55 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Teaching homam to kids....\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Dear Sunil,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Homa is not like reciting another mantra, it h=\r\nas to be according to the rules.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Everything in our tradition has=\r\n rules and mantras.

There are many contradicting sets of rules.=\r\n So, doing anything according to &quot;the&quot; rules is simply not possible. The re=\r\nality is that there are a set of timeless principles, which have been laid =\r\ndown as many sets of rules.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Many of the people in this list are doing =\r\nhoma according to rules. They may not be the same rules that you are follow=\r\ning, but that most certainly does not mean that they are rule-less :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; wrong pronunciation is very dangerous.=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; In the airforce, yo=\r\nu need to have great experience flying a sports/small aircraft,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Ou=\r\nr rishis are geniuses. They put in a few safeguards. The intent of the rule=\r\ns, and basic things like pronunciation is akin to putting the key in the pl=\r\nane. Without it, nothing happens, and we can all pretend to fly the plane. =\r\nAs long as we are pretending, it doesn&#39;t matter if it is a small plane, or =\r\na military jet. It is all totally harmless.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Frankly, &quot;correct pronunci=\r\nation&quot; is hard. I know basic sanskrit. I have worked on my pronunciation, a=\r\nnd it is decent. I have even studied a little bit of the shAstra that under=\r\nlies pronunciation. And I know that I am nowhere close to &quot;correct pronunci=\r\nation&quot;. Honestly, I have yet to meet a single person with perfect pronuncia=\r\ntion. But, I have met some people who are great sAdhakas, who are much furt=\r\nhur along the spiritual path that me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Here&#39;s another way of thinking a=\r\nbout it. Riding a bike incorrectly is very dangerous. If you go too fast, y=\r\nou will fall and get hurt. If you go too slow, you will fall and get hurt. =\r\nIf you don&#39;t look ahead, you will hit something and get hurt. And yet, we a=\r\nll teach our children how to ride bikes. Every one of them makes every one =\r\nof these mistakes. But, that is how they learn.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Fundamentally, things =\r\nlike homa, japa, tarpana, dhyana etc are mandated in the shastras from a yo=\r\nung age. Our munis would not have prescribed these for young children if th=\r\ney were dangerous. We all know -- children do everything wrong before they =\r\ndo it right. The rishis have taken this into account.

They may not be the sa=\r\nme rules that you are following, but that most certainly does not mean that=\r\n they are rule-less :-)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n\n&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&gt; wrong p=\r\nronunciation is very dangerous.&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&gt=\r\n; In the airforce, you need to have great experience flying a sports/small =\r\naircraft,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Our rishis are geniuses. The=\r\ny put in a few safeguards. The intent of the rules, and basic things like p=\r\nronunciation is akin to putting the key in the plane. Without it, nothing h=\r\nappens, and we can all pretend to fly the plane. As long as we are pretendi=\r\nng, it doesn&#39;t matter if it is a small plane, or a military jet. It is all =\r\ntotally harmless.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Frankly, &quot;correct pronunciation&quot; is hard. I know basic sa=\r\nnskrit. I have worked on my pronunciation, and it is decent. I have even st=\r\nudied a little bit of the shAstra that underlies pronunciation. And I know =\r\nthat I am nowhere close to &quot;correct pronunciation&quot;. Honestly, I have yet to=\r\n meet a single person with perfect pronunciation. But, I have met some peop=\r\nle who are great sAdhakas, who are much furthur along the spiritual path th=\r\nat me.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s another way of thinking about it. Riding a bike incorrectly i=\r\ns very dangerous. If you go too fast, you will fall and get hurt. If you go=\r\n too slow, you will fall and get hurt. If you don&#39;t look ahead, you will hi=\r\nt something and get hurt. And yet, we all teach our children how to ride bi=\r\nkes. Every one of them makes every one of these mistakes. But, that is how =\r\nthey learn.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font=\r\n size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Fundamentally, things like homa, japa, tarpana, dhyana etc are =\r\nmandated in the shastras from a young age. Our munis would not have prescri=\r\nbed these for young children if they were dangerous. We all know -- childre=\r\nn do everything wrong before they do it right. The rishis have taken this i=\r\nnto account. In the spiritual path, we are all children.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;sasneham,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &=\r\nnbsp;ajit&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control=\r\n&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquot=\r\ne&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1938982125-311671805-1336071623=:94181--\r\n\n"}}
