I was careful not to eat when somebody would give sweets saying=\r\n it is prasad. I was also very alert that I should not hurt their feelings.=\r\n=C2=A0I was living among them and=C2=A0it is normal thing that people share=\r\n their offerings in a temple=C2=A0with others standing nearby.\nOne day when=\r\n I went to a Temple very first time Pujari gave me sugar candy and other th=\r\ning from the plate he was giving to others. I took it and kept it in my han=\r\nd and and when I came out carfully sliped it in to my pocket thinking that =\r\nwhen I would reach my ashram I will feed it to a cow. Afterall it was templ=\r\ne prasad and I was not going to throw it away.\nBut it disappeared from my t=\r\nrouser pocket. There was no hole in it and I had put it there and I kept lo=\r\noking and looking. I suddenly realized I had to take=C2=A0prasad from that =\r\ntemple. So when ever I went there I ate the prasad without hesitation.\nSeve=\r\nral months later I had Darshan of Divine Lord there.\nThanks\nLaxmiNarayan\n\n\n=\r\n________________________________\nFrom: Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Wednesday,=\r\n 22 February 2012, 18:01\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Jeevanmukti and=\r\n White Sugar\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste,\n=C2=A0\nI completely agree=C2=A0with your views a=\r\nnd thanks so much for sharing your experience.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\nDuring my coll=\r\nege days I got to tour a sugar factory in Maharashtra, where I saw molasses=\r\n was passed through a hot cylinder with bones of animals inside the walls a=\r\nfter which sugar gets its white color.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \nI think in India =\r\npeople are unaware of this fact hence give offerings to god.

One&#39;s experiences=\r\n and actions are due to \n&gt; the momentum set in motion by previously present=\r\n conditioning. One \n&gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and=\r\n attachments. Thus, \n&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till th=\r\ne momentum comes to \n&gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory=\r\n mind, buddhi etc \n&gt; are returned to the original sources from which they w=\r\nere borrowed and \n&gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound ev=\r\nen while \n&gt; operating with an identity, for binding comes from the conditio=\r\nning and \n&gt; not from identification or actions. When the identity dissolves=\r\n, it is \n&gt; not any better or any extra freedom.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most likely, a jeevanm=\r\nukta ceases to operate an identity after some \n&gt; time, that time depending =\r\non the strength of prior momentum! It can be \n&gt; days or months or years or =\r\ncenturies or millennia.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place fo=\r\nr some beings (e.g. \n&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate=\r\n an identity for a \n&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off completel=\r\ny. It may even be \n&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the =\r\nmomentum set in \n&gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of one&#39;s a=\r\nhamkara to \n&gt; identify with a newly created identity (e.g. a new incarnatio=\r\nn). But \n&gt; this is different from a normal reincarnation that happens after=\r\n death. \n&gt; Vishnu&#39;s incarnations are an example.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such a thing happens =\r\nonly with beings that have a special role to play \n&gt; in the Play of Shakti.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy MahaShivaRatri!\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 3:0=\r\n7 PM, krishna Kanth wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Pranamam,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Narasimha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;v=\r\ne even got the similar question as Utpal.\n&gt; \n&gt; So is the state &#39;Mukta&#39; will=\r\n mean that the person is no longer alive? \n&gt; Also, is the Jeevan Mukta&#39;s wi=\r\nll attain :Mukti&#39;?\n&gt; \n&gt; I would assume the answer for Utpal&#39;s 2nd question =\r\nwould be that Jeevan \n&gt; Mukta&#39;s will continue to guide people in this world=\r\n (carrying the will \n&gt; of god) to attain the appropriate states or atleast =\r\nembark on the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; Subhamasthu\n&gt; KK\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 2/19/12, vedic_p=\r\nathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Jeevanmukti (liberation while living)\n&gt; To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, February 19, 2012, 11:22 PM\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone through both of your postings t=\r\nhoroughly.

The problem is *conditioning* \n&gt; &gt; (likes, dis=\r\nlikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification \n&gt; &gt; and use of w=\r\nhat one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; (identification) evapo=\r\nrates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, \n&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If=\r\n ahamkara (identification) remains while chitta \n&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is clea=\r\nned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as \n&gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0=\r\n =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; If one engages in an acti=\r\non with zero conditioning, then there is no \n&gt; &gt; karma and there are no rin=\r\nas created.

But, because there is no condi=\r\ntioning and hence no agendas, no \n&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one n=\r\neither rejoices nor protests nor \n&gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to wha=\r\nt one is identifying with.\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. =\r\nIt is the \n&gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is mor=\r\ne pain in \n&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning in chitta \n&gt; &gt; (ab=\r\nsent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a bod=\r\ny, one does not view it \n&gt; &gt; as something his own and something that must b=\r\ne kept in a particular \n&gt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but has no agenda=\r\ns for it. All that \n&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chitta, which is absent =\r\nnow!\n&gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what one \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various \n&gt; &gt; de=\r\nities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time \n&gt; &gt; e=\r\ntc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. One does not view \n&gt; &gt; it=\r\n from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y \n&gt; &gt; agen=\r\nda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me.

The question =\r\nwas as I asked it. Why did \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my question=\r\n presumes, that he got it \n&gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If his mind did =\r\nnot identify with his \n&gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma, then the karma=\r\n would not have \n&gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no identification, so no k=\r\narma (like \n&gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body, then it is obvious th=\r\nat there \n&gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind with body, that he cou=\r\nld not \n&gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not that he was ob=\r\nlivious \n&gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta. So ho=\r\nw can \n&gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the mind must be \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt; &gt; The an=\r\nswer is straight forward.

Some portions=\r\n of the Twitter exchange are quoted at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological orde=\r\nr, in case someone is interested in the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the=\r\n following question posed by Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The=\r\n question to my mind is this: was \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, W=\r\nhy did he suffer with throat \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with hi=\r\ns actions? (according to your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition=\r\n??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanm=\r\nukti. Manish \n&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas ar=\r\ne of body and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body=\r\n is an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the b=\r\nody, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas =\r\nof \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that a=\r\nre \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifi=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/co=\r\nnditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped \n&gt; &gt;&gt; out and=\r\n ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning =\r\nin chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist=\r\n with no limiting notions (it is basically the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta=\r\n that is limiting), then one becomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while liv=\r\ning). Unlike in the case of one who \n&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jee=\r\nvanmukta continues to have an I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not limited by any=\r\n notions or conditioning). This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-ness does project int=\r\no a body. But it does not say &quot;I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body sho=\r\nuld be kept healthy or strong&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta,=\r\n which is wiped out now!). On \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say =\r\n&quot;this body should be ignored \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is a=\r\nbsent now, body keeps \n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *mom=\r\nentum* set in motion \n&gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in con=\r\nditioned experiences \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a wh=\r\nile after the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriya=\r\ns keep working \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas=\r\n may sense \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input an=\r\nd register \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw var=\r\nious \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts =\r\neven \n&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; et=\r\nc). A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should ov=\r\nercome \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cons=\r\niderations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other \n&gt; &gt;&gt; object=\r\nive experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is=\r\n a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at making \n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observati=\r\nons and rational deductions, but, by themselves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY=\r\n agenda. They neither like something nor dislike \n&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT come=\r\ns from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is t=\r\nhat THAT is absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jee=\r\nvanmukta is a moot question. A better \n&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is=\r\n: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possib=\r\nle if there are no karmas or rinas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. =\r\nBut, let me sum it up briefly \n&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanen=\r\ndriyas, karmendiyas, manas and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to op=\r\nerate as before. One&#39;s I-ness \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto =\r\nthose. But neither I-ness nor \n&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas.=\r\n Chitta - the repository of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. There =\r\nare no limiting notions. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi keep ex=\r\nperiencing and doing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous mome=\r\nntum set by the play \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was l=\r\neft in chitta. Body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma =\r\nand manas are all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I=\r\n-ness) infuses \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness into them.=\r\n The \n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cond=\r\nitioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that =\r\nconditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still \n&gt; &gt;&gt; project awa=\r\nreness into those objects, but it sees them for what they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It doe=\r\ns not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and M=\r\nUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C2=A0 =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * Most people who =\r\nmay claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeeva=\r\nnmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jee=\r\nvanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best \n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by =\r\nMaharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definitio=\r\nn and characterization of a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books tha=\r\nt explain better how to do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually a=\r\nnd get closer to being \n&gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborati=\r\nng what liberation \n&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better tha=\r\nn Yoga Vaasishtham. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an int=\r\nellectual exercise \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as no=\r\nne of may ever \n&gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write wi=\r\nth a very \n&gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I writ=\r\ne. That is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel fr=\r\nee to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

Nothing really=\r\n, fulfilling all rnas, wait for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jee=\r\nvanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If n=\r\no, y r they called rnas? If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas w=\r\nill work out themselves, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas =\r\nare of the body he or she \n&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experience=\r\ns, actually sees the rnas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the bo=\r\ndy, not to you. You are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what=\r\n you want, Atma, etc. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light =\r\nwas never bound. So, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have=\r\n rnas? If these &quot;rnas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcom=\r\nes jeevanmukta, what \n&gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The m=\r\nind thought, that, it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is th=\r\ne original problem. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise from t=\r\nhis identification \n&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not boun=\r\nd, when the mind \n&gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true=\r\n, since u r that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas =\r\nof the &quot;body&quot; as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies with li=\r\nght & bcomes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projecte=\r\nd into mind, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is =\r\na jeevanmukta \n&gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? because, that person although aware of=\r\n the light at \n&gt; &gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not y=\r\net directed d \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word b=\r\neing &quot;all&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id wit=\r\nh light \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining i=\r\ns not a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liber=\r\nated) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from some=\r\nbody, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, mos=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nobjects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n&gt; &gt;&gt; concep=\r\nts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that =\r\nmeans u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. Words \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like fre=\r\ne, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will \n&gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit=\r\n in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; i=\r\ns concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly & \n&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any huma=\r\nn being can ever hope 2. Manish: The question \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was=\r\n Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he \n&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat canc=\r\ner if he was not identifying with his actions? \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your int=\r\nerpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt gi=\r\nve a single definition. His entire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition o=\r\nf jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn \n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=C2=A0 &lt;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/te=\r\nrms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n|| Om Shaantih Shaantih S=\r\nhaantih ||\nYahoo!

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe momentum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nengages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum comes=\r\n to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, bud=\r\ndhi etc &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are returned to the original sources from which they were =\r\nborrowed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound =\r\neven while &lt;BR&gt;&gt; operating with an identity, for binding comes from the\n=\r\n conditioning and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not from identification or actions. When the ide=\r\nntity dissolves, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not any better or any extra freedom.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate an identity after s=\r\nome &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of prior momentum! I=\r\nt can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings (e.g=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an identity=\r\n for a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off completely. It =\r\nmay even be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the =\r\nmomentum set in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of o=\r\nne&#39;s ahamkara to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; identify with a newly created identity (e.g. a ne=\r\nw incarnation).

I was=\r\nn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; these are not easy ideas=\r\n to communicate in vaikhari (external &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; communication). I pray =\r\nto Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; than vaikhari =\r\nin the following words so that people can understand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; better (=\r\nnot you Manish, the goal of answering your questions is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; obvio=\r\nusly not to impart any knowledge to\n YOU, but to perhaps benefit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; some others who may be ready - now or in future).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; =\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The proble=\r\nm is not identification. The problem is *conditioning* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (likes=\r\n, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n (identification) evaporates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (identification) remains while ch=\r\nitta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is a=\r\ns simple as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *=\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one engages in an action with=\r\n zero conditioning, then there is no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karma and there are no r=\r\ninas created. Actions (physical or mental) by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves do n=\r\not bind one - it is the&nbsp;\n *conditioned* actions that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bin=\r\nd one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nconditioning in chitta) behind an action that bind one!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp=\r\n; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If someb=\r\nody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), the=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction whic=\r\nh will in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one ide=\r\nntified with when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; engaging in that action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; By th=\r\ne time the reaction is experienced, all the conditioning may be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will continue to affect the bo=\r\ndy, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is=\r\n identifying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with. But, because there is no conditioning and =\r\nhence no agendas, no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neit=\r\nher rejoices nor protests nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings =\r\nto what one is identifying with.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain re=\r\nquires no conditioning. It is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Cha=\r\nndra. Observing that there is more pain in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the evening than m=\r\norning (or when swallowing) requires no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning. It is t=\r\nhe function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of praying to=\r\n god to reduce pain requires conditioning in chitta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (absent i=\r\nn a jeevanmukta!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a =\r\nbody, one does not view it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; as something his own and something=\r\n that must\n be kept in a particular &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; state. He identifies with=\r\n it, but has no agendas for it. All that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; comes from condition=\r\ning in chitta, which is absent now!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifi=\r\ner (liberated I-ness) views what one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; identifies with as an *a=\r\nmalgam* of portions borrowed from various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deities (pancha mah=\r\nabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; etc) and =\r\nhence as a manifestation of Light itself. One does not view &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; i=\r\nt from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of portions borrowed =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestations of Light. I=\r\n observe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda =\r\npursue using &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; them.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is the essence of Upani=\r\nshads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we=\r\n\n were discussing a while back.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is no=\r\nt the problem. It is the conditioning &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that drives how one use=\r\ns what one identifies with, that is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; problem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I=\r\n now feel like I have expressed myself better, though, given how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; subtle and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may still get &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; confused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thing!). I am gratefu=\r\nl to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Manish and Maharshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportu=\r\nnity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakrishna really got throat cancer becaus=\r\ne of his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the ka=\r\narmik power of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer=\r\n at the time) can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; debated. Strictly speaking,\n whether Ram=\r\nakrishna really became a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta in that lifetime or not =\r\ncan also be debated.

Why did &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my questi=\r\non presumes, that he got it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If hi=\r\ns mind did not identify with his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with =\r\nAtma, then the karma would not have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there w=\r\nas no identification, so no karma (like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did af=\r\nflict that body, then it is obvious that there &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was good enoug=\r\nh identification of mind with body, that he could not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; escape =\r\nthe karmic result. That is the point. Not that he was oblivious &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta. So how can &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the mind must be &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward.

If so, W=\r\nhy did he suffer with throat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identif=\r\nying with his actions?

Manish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is =\r\nan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not =\r\nof the body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It =\r\nis the antahkaranas of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitt=\r\na (memory/conditioning) - that are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various =\r\nrinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a bod=\r\ny, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;=\r\nexperience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rin=\r\nas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in\n chitta is completely wiped out and yet aha=\r\nmkara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no limiting notions (it is =\r\nbasically the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), t=\r\nhen one becomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unl=\r\nike in the case of one who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a =\r\njeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not=\r\n limited by any notions or conditioning). This &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; unconditio=\r\nned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!=\r\n). On &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body s=\r\nhould be ignored &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is a=\r\nbsent now, body keeps &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based=\r\n on the *momentum* set in\n motion &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeeva=\r\nnmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and actions=\r\n. This is like a fan turning for a while after the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; electr=\r\nicity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and =\r\nregister &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations an=\r\nd draw various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to s=\r\nwallow food, it hurts even &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so =\r\nherbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; normal person who=\r\nse conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and =\r\nnot have this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; considerations.\n Though one may feel and express the pain and other &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n * =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&=\r\nnbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * This is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at m=\r\naking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rational deductions, but=\r\n, by themselves, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neithe=\r\nr like something nor dislike &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from t=\r\nhe conditioning in chitta! The hallmark &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta =\r\nis that THAT is absent! * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&=\r\nnbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A&nbsp; =C3=83=E2=80=9A * &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ram=\r\nakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; w=\r\nay to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rina=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n left? I have already answered it. But, let me sum it u=\r\np briefly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, =\r\nkarmendiyas, manas and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue t=\r\no operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does proj=\r\nect itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those thing=\r\ns carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; c=\r\nonditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas &amp; buddhi keep experiencing and doin=\r\ng &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous momentum se=\r\nt by the play &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning =\r\nwas left in chitta. Body, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of=\r\n jnana and karma and manas are all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from=\r\n various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience int=\r\no them by\n projecting awareness into them. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioni=\r\nng in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nused. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. W=\r\nhen &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
