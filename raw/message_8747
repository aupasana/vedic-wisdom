I hope your health is fine too.\n=\r\n\nI will answer the points you have raised in your mail below, to the best o=\r\nf my ability. \n\n\n&lt;&lt;\n\nSo is there a place for Divine Mother and Her Love or =\r\nGrace or Protection in your theory. Is=C2=A0this intermediate zone as you s=\r\nay is created by Her \nand part of Her creation=C2=A0or by=C2=A0somebody els=\r\ne. &gt;&gt;\n\nThere is no other somebody else in the Universe apart from Her. Even=\r\n the worst Asura is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons on=\r\nly She knows, because Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpes=\r\nt human mind. Nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She =\r\nis truly the One whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She li=\r\nes hidden inside it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discover=\r\ned, extending Her love, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who cal=\r\nls Her sincerely and unconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liber=\r\nty to act as per its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the a=\r\npparently bad. \n\n&lt;&lt;Does=C2=A0She needs some visa \nto go there if she is=C2=\r\n=A0not the Creater.=C2=A0As you say all higher deity are \nthere but less in=\r\n ability. Does the deities have even less =C2=A0ability on \nearth plane.&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n\nShe needs no visa, but neither does She interfere without a genuine cause =\r\nor a genuine call. Everything is Her world, then why is there ugliness, cri=\r\nme, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if not She? And it is She herself =\r\nwho gave them the liberty to act as per their freewill. This world is a pla=\r\ny of forces and a democracy of opportunities. Every impulse, however Divine=\r\n or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to run its course and actualize i=\r\ntself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Compassion! That is why She is TH=\r\nE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Great Gods as much to the Danavas a=\r\nnd Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pretas and other corrupt human bei=\r\nng and what not. \n\nNow coming to your question on the phrase &quot;higher deitie=\r\ns having less ability&quot;. I think I have not been able to explain clearly, si=\r\nnce in the last mail I was merely writing in the context of that discussion=\r\n. Let me try here.\n\nThere are three basic layer of this Universe. The physi=\r\ncal, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In th=\r\nis subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own physical plane, there i=\r\ns a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like in our own world. It=\r\n is a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti. This force of pra=\r\nnashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive movements on the consc=\r\niousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgus=\r\nt, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of influencing the thi=\r\nnking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik =\r\nsadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti =\r\nthrough the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you =\r\nthink carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a p=\r\nranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka used the force of his=\r\n/her own\n pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle formation of the deity. =\r\nOnce this process is successfully done, this sublte formation of the deity =\r\nwhich exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its own. It can then guide =\r\nthe sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day lead him/her to the re=\r\nal abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond this astral plane).=\r\n If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and make it identi=\r\nfy/create such an astral formation of the deity, it becomes an even more po=\r\nwerful force. It is, from our limited human perspective, as much a powerful=\r\n entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the actual Deity yet. Exactl=\r\ny the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda in the Aghora books,=\r\n if you read carefully.=C2=A0 \n\nWhen a sadhaka has been able to associate w=\r\nith such an astral formation of the deity, it can guide the sadhaka along t=\r\nhe path provided the sadhaka also is trying to work hard and sincerely to r=\r\neach the causal planes (the real spiritual planes of existence where the re=\r\nal force of the Deity originates). The difference, if you ask, between this=\r\n astral formation of the deity and the real deity is that, the former is ne=\r\nither bound nor capable by itself of causing a complete and total transform=\r\nation of the average human nature without a proactive help of the sadhaka. =\r\nWhereas, if one reaches the plane of the Great Gods, which is where the rea=\r\nl deity exists, one cannot avoid being transformed in mind, emotions, body =\r\netc. And what kind of a transformation will it be? One that will reflect to=\r\n the world as a greater and genuine humility, sense of deep surrender to th=\r\ne Divine at ALL time and unfailingly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature=\r\n of man - lust, anger,\n jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, c=\r\nalm, detachment, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the=\r\n consciousness. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to a=\r\nnother person, will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which wi=\r\nll automatically calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ET=\r\nC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the=\r\n great deities. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the ca=\r\nusal planes of existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which=\r\n is created by the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case ma=\r\nybe, is often not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformation =\r\nin a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can&#39;t=\r\n=C2=A0 get me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or brin=\r\ng me fame or any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral forma=\r\ntions of the deities\n can very easily do all these things in the physical w=\r\norld - but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the must auth=\r\nentic and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one aim and des=\r\ntination of all genuine sadhana.\n\nSince this astral plane is the way it is,=\r\n therefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep actively working on ourselves t=\r\no increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surrender (when that h=\r\nappens one accepts all life-situations without the slightest grudge), humil=\r\nity, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is universally accepte=\r\nd as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are affected at least t=\r\no some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, one is simply not re=\r\nady to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from them spiritually. Mo=\r\nreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a gap between experi=\r\nence and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lead to realization. =\r\nOne off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it fritters away, =\r\nor worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioning of the sadhaka.=\r\n\n\n&lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your \ntheory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobin=\r\ndo. Many times when certain \nperson reach a stage in their spiritual path, =\r\nothers think whatever this guy is uttering is=C2=A0complete truth, when in =\r\nfact it is=C2=A0far from truth. \nOnce=C2=A0I saw in a article that Aurobind=\r\no said that Divine Lord who spoke \nGita completely forgot it after few minu=\r\ntes or so. I could not believe \nwhat I was reading. Then my respect for thi=\r\ns yogi went down the drain.&gt;&gt;\n\nYou surety is incorrect. There were certain =\r\nevents which happened in the last one and half years which made me sit down=\r\n and rethink my own understanding of spirituality. At about the same time I=\r\n started worshiping a specific personality of the Divine Mother, and the mo=\r\nre I meditated on Her, the more would thoughts pour into my mind that my un=\r\nderstanding of spirituality is imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, us=\r\ning my own meditations to find out what was wrong or rather imperfectly und=\r\nerstood, what needed rethinking. First question I asked myself was, what is=\r\n the aim of spirituality? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answ=\r\ners and processes and truths. But it was still not exceptionally clear.\n\nI =\r\nhad first read Sri Aurobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyond t=\r\nhe first two pages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three y=\r\nears ago someone gave me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10=\r\n percent, and rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to eg=\r\noistic arrogance. Never opened any of his writing since then. This year, as=\r\n my sadhana was going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct the f=\r\nlaws in my understanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thought i=\r\nn the form of an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurob=\r\nindo but in a very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-ey=\r\ne, and thoroughly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book again, an=\r\nd read it in the prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to =\r\nme. What I was struggling to understand all this year, whose outline I coul=\r\nd grasp yet not get a proper hang of, I was able to understand\n from his wr=\r\nitings with much deeper clarity.=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more=\r\n sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new =\r\nlight. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to st=\r\nop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I=\r\n will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational mi=\r\nnd will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firml=\r\ny 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun.=\r\n \n\nThe line that you mention, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Au=\r\nrobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, th=\r\nere is an incident which comes later on, after the great war and when Yudhi=\r\nsthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repe=\r\nat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more=\r\n since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed awa=\r\ny (it was a special time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the &quot;e=\r\nxact words&quot; once again. \n\nSri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even =\r\nSwami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobi=\r\nndo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appear before him dail=\r\ny and instruct him on the various layers of the mind, which he was not awar=\r\ne of till then. Swami Vivekananda had already left his physical body by the=\r\nn. It was in the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left=\r\n and right hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, a=\r\nnd their connection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science =\r\nconfirmed the same. \n\nRight from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondic=\r\nherry, to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Saha=\r\nja (which he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided co=\r\nntinuously by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice =\r\nof Krishna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna =\r\nwas his Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destinati=\r\non. Anyway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of =\r\nspirituality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone els=\r\ne will also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, eac=\r\nh with their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must indi=\r\nvidually try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotiona=\r\nl makeup, and help us to progress on the path. \n\nThough I now have a very d=\r\neep respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his cri=\r\ntics and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstoo=\r\nd the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a functio=\r\nn of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any gen=\r\nuine understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be unde=\r\nrstood accurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana.\n\n\n&lt;&lt;\nDisclaimer=\r\n---- My thinking is \nvery different due to Darshan and=C2=A0Grace of Divine=\r\n Mother & Divine \nLord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or fol=\r\nlow the \nleader.Thanks.&gt;&gt;\n\nI at-least will never feel unhappy if you disagr=\r\nee. There are \nmany saints, many philosophies, many paths, not everyone is =\r\nbound to \nlike every path.=C2=A0 Disagreement is perfectly ok. Because some=\r\none \ndisagrees with me or those whom I agree with, does not mean I like him=\r\n \nany less. I try to keep my=C2=A0 emotional side (where respect, love, \ndi=\r\nslike, hatred, anger, passions exist) separate from my thinking mind. \nIt i=\r\ns very much possible, through practice, for a man to disassociate \nhis rati=\r\nonal-mind from the emotional-mind. So have no fears that your \ndisagreement=\r\n is going to make me like you any less or any more.\n\nThe problem with the e=\r\nmotional part of our being is that it jumps up at appearances, running ahea=\r\nd to grasp the truth rather than waiting patiently for the truth to arrive =\r\nin all its aspects and dimensions, and in the process it distorts the truth=\r\n and then reacts to that distorted image. For example, recently in some soc=\r\nial forums I posted a comment that I found the Tantrik Adwaitha far more ap=\r\npealing than Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shanka=\r\nra has many hard-selling supporters. Immediately some friends of mine on Tw=\r\nitter and otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion that I have disrespecte=\r\nd Adi Shankara, and tried best to make me &quot;see the truth&quot; by such grandiose=\r\n statements that=C2=A0 Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39; on Adwaitha and everyth=\r\ning else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denou=\r\nncement. Both of which are million light-years away from the truth. That Sr=\r\ni Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti\n (manifestation) of God, that much I a=\r\nm certain. His compositions are so brilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficiently =\r\nappreciated in words. Yet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philos=\r\nophy. And because I am not bound to accept his philosophy, does not mean I =\r\nrespect or love him any less than any other great saint.=C2=A0\n\nIf you disr=\r\nespect a man, and specially a saint, and then start disliking him too with =\r\na passion, you are creating strong negative karmas. But if you can disagree=\r\n with someone without losing respect or love for the person, in an objectiv=\r\ne manner, you reap very little karmic effects. That is why Lord Krishna too=\r\n advices us to become more detached in life.\n\nIn conclusion, Narasimha is t=\r\notally correct. Many things cannot be sufficiently expressed in words witho=\r\nut causing some distortion.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n\nawaktam wyakt=\r\nimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam=\r\n ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijish=\r\nrihari@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt; \nSent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: A thought\n \n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Rajarshi Bhai,\nHow are you do=\r\ning?

Many yogis have lost themselves in this j=\r\nungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which is genui=\r\nne and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral\n plane, driven by =\r\nthe overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a =\r\nhuman being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping inf=\r\nluence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everythin=\r\ng=C2=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser man=\r\nifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endle=\r\nss beings of varies character and hue who can very easily create an experei=\r\nnce for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an exp=\r\nerience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker=\r\n and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower=\r\n extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface=\r\n ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitio=\r\nns, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc an=\r\nd at the other extreme this layer can, if properly\n channalized as is done =\r\nin genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and ma=\r\nnifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path.\n\nIn a nutshell, =\r\na genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only to the extent that it hel=\r\nps to modify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the onl=\r\ny true test.

Is&nbsp;this intermediate zone as you say is created by Her \nan=\r\nd part of Her creation&nbsp;or by&nbsp;somebody else. &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There=\r\n is no other somebody else in the Universe apart from Her. Even the worst A=\r\nsura is also Her creation to sustain this world, for reasons only She knows=\r\n, because Her perspective/vision is way beyond even the sharpest human mind=\r\n. Nobody, can understand mentally, all of Her actions, for She is truly the=\r\n One whose energy has created the Universe of diversity, She lies hidden in=\r\nside it as well as beyond it, awaiting patiently to be discovered, extendin=\r\ng Her love, truth, force and power to the aid of anyone who calls Her since=\r\nrely and unconditionally, yet allowing every creature the liberty to act as=\r\n per its own understanding, for causes apparently good or the apparently ba=\r\nd. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;&lt;Does&nbsp;She needs some visa \nto go there if she is&nb=\r\nsp;not the Creater.&nbsp;As you say all higher deity are \nthere but less in=\r\n ability. Does the deities have even less &nbsp;ability on \nearth plane.&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She needs no visa, but neither does She interfere without a ge=\r\nnuine cause or a genuine call. Everything is Her world, then why is there u=\r\ngliness, crime, evil things? Who creates the Asuras, if not She? And it is =\r\nShe herself who gave them the liberty to act as per their freewill. This wo=\r\nrld is a play of forces and a democracy of opportunities. Every impulse, ho=\r\nwever Divine or anti-Divine in aim, is given a chance to run its course and=\r\n actualize itself in the Universe. THAT is Her Divine Compassion! That is w=\r\nhy She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mother to the Great Gods as much to t=\r\nhe Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas and Bhutas and Pretas and other corru=\r\npt human being and what not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now coming to your question on the phr=\r\nase &quot;higher deities having less ability&quot;. I think I have not been able to e=\r\nxplain clearly, since in the last mail I was merely writing in the context =\r\nof that discussion. Let me try here. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There\n are three basic layer o=\r\nf this Universe. The physical, the astral or subtle layer, and the causal (=\r\nkarana jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our o=\r\nwn physical plane, there is a whole wide world of all possible forces, just=\r\n like in our own world. It is a layer which is created out of force of pran=\r\nashakti. This force of pranashakti in humans beings is what causes all emot=\r\nive movements on the consciousness - joy, happiness, love, passion, rage, f=\r\near, anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capa=\r\nble of influencing the thinking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadh=\r\nana and specially Tantrik sadhana, is to create a formation of the deity us=\r\ning ones own prana-shakti through the aid of repeated rituals and procedure=\r\ns and mantras etc. If you think carefully, you will realize that every idol=\r\n, ever homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sad=\r\nhaka used the force of his/her own\n pranashakti to infuse life into a subtl=\r\ne formation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this subl=\r\nte formation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of i=\r\nts own. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one =\r\nday lead him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (=\r\nbeyond this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini =\r\nshakti, and make it identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, =\r\nit becomes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human persp=\r\nective, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not th=\r\ne actual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimala=\r\nnanda in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a sadh=\r\naka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the deity, =\r\nit can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also is trying=\r\n to work hard and sincerely\n to reach the causal planes (the real spiritual=\r\n planes of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). The dif=\r\nference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and the rea=\r\nl deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself of causi=\r\nng a complete and total transformation of the average human nature without =\r\na proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane of the G=\r\nreat Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid being tra=\r\nnsformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transformation wil=\r\nl it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuine humili=\r\nty, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailingly, a co=\r\nmplete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust, anger, jealousy, greed, co=\r\nvetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachment, mental-illumination, genui=\r\nne compassion, a widening of the consciousness. Such an individual, even if=\r\n he/she just sits\n down next to another person, will exude a silent strong =\r\npeace and unselfish love which will automatically calm the minds and distur=\r\nbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow =\r\nof the Divine Power of any of the great deities. This comes even if one dei=\r\nty is properly realized in the causal planes of existence. But the astral f=\r\normation of the same deity, which is created by the force of our own pranas=\r\nhakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often not capable of affecting thi=\r\ns kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. I=\r\nt is not limited because it can&#39;t&nbsp; get me a better job or a nice pay h=\r\nike or cure some diseases or bring me fame or any such material benefit if =\r\nI so ask of it - the astral formations of the deities can very easily do al=\r\nl these things in the physical world - but it is limited because it cannot =\r\nby itself give you the must authentic and persistent spirituality of the hi=\r\ngher\n planes, the one aim and destination of all genuine sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Si=\r\nnce this astral plane is the way it is, therefore it&#39;s extremely important =\r\nto keep actively working on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, =\r\ngenuine internal surrender (when that happens one accepts all life-situatio=\r\nns without the slightest grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealous=\r\ny etc. (all that is universally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unles=\r\ns these changes are affected at least to some degree in the mind and emotio=\r\nns of the sadhaka, one is simply not ready to reach the higher planes of Go=\r\nd and benefit from them spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual =\r\nevolution there is a gap between experience and realization. Only repeated =\r\nexperiences *may* lead to realization. One off experiences create a force n=\r\no doubt, but in time it fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impu=\r\nrities and conditioning of the sadhaka.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;span&gt;I am sure\n thi=\r\ns is not your \ntheory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times wh=\r\nen certain \nperson reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think what=\r\never this\n guy is uttering is&nbsp;complete truth, when in fact it is&nbsp;=\r\nfar from truth. \nOnce&nbsp;I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that Divi=\r\nne Lord who spoke \nGita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I cou=\r\nld not believe \nwhat I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went down=\r\n the drain.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You surety is incorrect. There were certain even=\r\nts which happened in the last one and half years which made me sit down and=\r\n rethink my own understanding of spirituality. At about the same time I sta=\r\nrted worshiping a specific personality of the Divine Mother, and the more I=\r\n meditated on Her, the more would thoughts pour into my mind that my unders=\r\ntanding of spirituality is imperfect and has serious flaws. I tried, using =\r\nmy own meditations to find out what was wrong or rather imperfectly underst=\r\nood, what needed rethinking. First question I asked myself was, what is the=\r\n aim of spirituality? My mind could grasp some outlines of certain answers =\r\nand processes and truths. But it was still not exceptionally clear. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;I had first read Sri Aurobindo when I was in college. I could not go beyon=\r\nd the first two pages. They were bouncers going one mile over my head. Thre=\r\ne years\n ago someone gave me a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand sa=\r\ny 10 percent, and rest I rejected, partly due to ignorance and partly due t=\r\no egoistic arrogance. Never opened any of his writing since then. This year=\r\n, as my sadhana was going on and as I was instinctively trying to correct t=\r\nhe flaws in my understanding, one day while meditating I had an inner thoug=\r\nht in the form of an image, which told me that I should start reading Sri A=\r\nurobindo but in a very specific manner. The image was very clear in my inne=\r\nr-eye, and thoroughly pressing on my consciousness. I opened his book again=\r\n, and read it in the prescribed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense=\r\n to me. What I was struggling to understand all this year, whose outline I =\r\ncould grasp yet not get a proper hang of, I was able to understand from his=\r\n writings with much deeper clarity.&nbsp; Many of my own experiences made m=\r\nore sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a\n =\r\nnew light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me t=\r\no stop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60=\r\n % I will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rationa=\r\nl mind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected f=\r\nirmly 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing =\r\nsun. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The line that you mention, is from one of the earlier writings=\r\n of Sri Aurobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahab=\r\nharata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the great war and =\r\nwhen Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krish=\r\nna to repeat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war (The Gita)=\r\n once more since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the time has =\r\npassed away (it was a special time when the Gita was spoken), he cannot rep=\r\neat the &quot;exact words&quot; once again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Krishna was the main\n Guru of=\r\n Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, for during the tim=\r\ne when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Vivekananda would appea=\r\nr before him daily and instruct him on the various layers of the mind, whic=\r\nh he was not aware of till then. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda had already left his physical body by then.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It =\r\nwas in the writings of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and r=\r\night hemisphere of the brain and their difference in functionality, and the=\r\nir connection to spirituality, about 30 years before medical science confir=\r\nmed the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondi=\r\ncherry, to pushing his own spiritual experiences further into states of Sah=\r\naja (which he describes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided c=\r\nontinuously by the Adesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice=\r\n of Krishna speaking to him, instructing him to do this or\n do that. Krishn=\r\na was his Guru, the Divine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destina=\r\ntion. Anyway, my point is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective o=\r\nf spirituality. I have benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone e=\r\nlse will also benefit. There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, e=\r\nach with their unique perspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must in=\r\ndividually try and find whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotio=\r\nnal makeup, and help us to progress on the path. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though I now have =\r\na very deep respect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both=\r\n his critics and his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misu=\r\nnderstood the depth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a=\r\n function of their own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on=\r\n any genuine understanding or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can=\r\n be understood accurately or even slightly without\n sincere sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 1=\r\n6px; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;&lt;\nDis=\r\nclaimer---- My thinking is \nvery different due to Darshan and&nbsp;Grace of=\r\n Divine Mother &amp; Divine \nLord.

Because someone \ndisagrees with me or those whom I agree with, d=\r\noes not mean I like him \nany less. I try to keep my&nbsp; emotional side (w=\r\nhere respect, love, \ndislike, hatred, anger, passions exist) separate from =\r\nmy thinking mind. \nIt is very much possible, through practice, for a man to=\r\n disassociate \nhis rational-mind from the emotional-mind.

For example, recently in some social forums I posted a =\r\ncomment that I found the Tantrik Adwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi S=\r\nhankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Adwaitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-selli=\r\nng supporters. Immediately some friends of mine on Twitter and otherwise, j=\r\numped to\n the false conclusion that I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and t=\r\nried best to make me &quot;see the truth&quot; by such grandiose statements that&nbsp=\r\n; Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39; on Adwaitha and everything else must be nece=\r\nssarily lesser. Or that I was making an egoistic denouncement. Both of whic=\r\nh are million light-years away from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a =\r\nspecial Vibhuti (manifestation) of God, that much I am certain. His composi=\r\ntions are so brilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficiently appreciated in words. =\r\nYet, I have equally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy. And because I am=\r\n not bound to accept his philosophy, does not mean I respect or love him an=\r\ny less than any other great saint.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: r=\r\ngb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; background-color: transparent; font-style: no=\r\nrmal; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; background-color: transpare=\r\nnt;\n font-style: normal; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;If=\r\n you disrespect a man, and specially a saint, and then start disliking him =\r\ntoo with a passion, you are creating strong negative karmas.

Otherwise it does=\r\n not help. And the only parameters of judgement is to objectively see what =\r\nchanges are happening in our surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are =\r\nwe less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The field of experiences - =\r\nvisions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it can be genuine and pl=\r\nenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spiritual people ha=\r\nve never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand these things proper=\r\nly, but some pattern is observable.&nbsp; Not all experiences are what they=\r\n seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of experiences,=\r\n not being able to adequately determine which is genuine and which is non-g=\r\nenuine. This is the world of astral\n plane, driven by the overlapping sheal=\r\nths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantr=\r\nik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlapping a=\r\nnd not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything&nbsp; is possible h=\r\nere. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation in this re=\r\nalm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of varies c=\r\nharacter and hue who can very easily create an expereince for a sadhaka to =\r\ndelude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/aura of a hig=\r\nher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him/her for =\r\nits own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower extreme of which cau=\r\nses, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driven by attrac=\r\ntions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, a=\r\nnger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the other extrem=\r\ne this layer can, if properly\n channalized as is done in genuine Vaishava B=\r\nhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratma=\r\nh&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;expe=\r\nrience&quot; is good and authentic only to the extent that it helps to modify an=\r\nd transform your waking surface personality. That is the only true test. Re=\r\nst all the range of experiences that come from this realm, and 95 percent o=\r\nf Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sound and fury witho=\r\nut substance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the int=\r\nermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept aw=\r\nay by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross this re=\r\nalm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is to hang on tight=\r\nly to the fundamentals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv345956802MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT=\r\n-SIZE:16px;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv345956802Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR=\r\n:rgb(153,153,153);&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv345956802Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot; =\r\nclass=3D&quot;yiv345956802yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam ma=\r\nnyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;COLO=\r\nR:navy;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv345956802yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yi=\r\nv345956802yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv345956802yui_3_2_0_37_134976159846=\r\n786&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;param bhA=\r\nwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, =\r\nnew york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times ne=\r\nw roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-=\r\nLEFT:#ccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORD=\r\nER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv345956802hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tue=\r\nsday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subjec=\r\nt:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv345956802&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv345956802ygrp-text&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

So always concentrate on your di=\r\nrection, not on speed.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; For any genuine spiritual seeker,\n=\r\n this\n is one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, t=\r\noo many people get caught up in the less important - aka, visions, &#39;experie=\r\nnces&#39;, tough-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while for=\r\ngetting the goal of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/emoti=\r\nons/body resulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity t=\r\no life situations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening o=\r\nf lower emotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious att=\r\nachments, such that eventually every action of the individual is like a con=\r\nsecration (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so a=\r\nway from our average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment o=\r\nn its own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progress=\r\nive unfolding of a transformation process.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Complex rituals=\r\n and speedy sadhanas and experiences et al are ok, provided one does not\n l=\r\nose sight of the fundamentals.
