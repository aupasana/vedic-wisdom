Sometimes I feel I m=\r\nissed the \ngolden era(1800- early 1900). It was the time many saints were b=\r\norn. \nSri Shirdi Saibaba, Sri Swami Samarth(Akkalkot maharaj), Sri Ramana \n=\r\nMaharshi, Sri Tajuddin baba, Sri Bhagavan Nityananda, Nisargadatta \nMaharaj=\r\n, Ramakrishna parmahansa, Trilinga swami, Lahiri baba, \nYukteswara Maharaj,=\r\n Pakalapati guruji and many other saints were \nborn in that golden era. I t=\r\noo accept that the presence of the \nsaints just near to us is highly benifi=\r\ncial than anything. However \nstill many people near to those saints didn&#39;t =\r\nuse those great saints \nhelp. Sri Shirdi Saibaba himself told that everybod=\r\ny was coming to \nhim for material wealth and nobody was asking spiritual we=\r\nalth. In \nmy opinion, if we pray sincerely, even now also those saints will=\r\n \nrespond to us. In my observation, devotion with other kinds of \nmeditatio=\r\nn gives excellent results. Combination of strong conviction \non guru or god=\r\n, meditation on beingness(I like pranayama, vipasana, \nand zen too), chanti=\r\nng of the powerful Gayatri Mantra or any other \nmantras we are connected gi=\r\nves highly benificial results. Finally it \nleads us to sarwasya saranagati =\r\nand complete detachment. As human \nmind needs variety, we can increase our =\r\nsadhana time by trying all \nthese different approaches. \n              Inde=\r\ned this is also great time. As technology advanced \nvery well with internet=\r\n and computers, now we can have a great \nawareness on many spiritual topics=\r\n. We can read and analyze about \nvarious kinds of spiritual practises and c=\r\nhoose which one fits best \nto our temper irrespective of religion. \n\n      =\r\n         However as sri Sivananda swami told as ounce of \npractise is bette=\r\nr than tons  of theory. Let us practise, practise, \npractise until being on=\r\ne with oneness.\n                                     \n\n                    =\r\n           Thanks and Regards\n                                  Kumar Ghant=\r\na\n                 \n             \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, raja=\r\nrshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Kumar,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Yes &quot;I am tha=\r\nt&quot; is a wonderful book.

Anyone who has ever tried even a minutest \nfraction \n&gt; =\r\nof \n&gt; &gt; sadhana not to gain a better happy life but to get that one \nsmall =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; fraction of an inch closer to God will know the millions of \n&gt; trouble=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; and frustation that come in the path. It was on one such moment \n&gt; w=\r\nhen \n&gt; &gt; I came across this writing and felt humbled. Ganapati Muni was \n&gt; =\r\nknown \n&gt; &gt; as a siddha who had done terrific, i repeat terrific amount of \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; penances, even before he met Sri Ramana Maharishi. If such a man \n&gt; &gt; c=\r\nould be troubled by doubts and frustation, what to speak of us \n&gt; &gt; ordinar=\r\ny men whos minds are overcrowded with multiple \nweaknessess. \n&gt; &gt; Also the =\r\nfollowinf conversation shows how a real understanding \nof \n&gt; &gt; the shastra =\r\nis possible ONLY for a man who is that spiritually \n&gt; &gt; elevated. Like Lahi=\r\nri Mahasaya used to say to his disciples, \nonly a \n&gt; &gt; true yogi will under=\r\nstand the spriptures. Others will only get a \n&gt; &gt; incomplete surface view o=\r\nf things. And based on our incomplete \n&gt; &gt; inefficient understand of shatra=\r\ns we keep fighting with others \n&gt; &gt; claiming our path our tradition our und=\r\nerstading is the only \ntrue \n&gt; &gt; one.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ganapati Muni had met the y=\r\net-to-be-called Sri Ramana on the \n&gt; &gt; southern slopes of Arunachala. One d=\r\nay he was assailed by pains, \n&gt; &gt; troubles, doubts. He remembered that the =\r\nyoung Swami was on the \n&gt; &gt; hill, and at midday, a little after noon, he cl=\r\nimbed and found \nhim \n&gt; &gt; sitting outside Virupaksha cave, alone. He prostr=\r\nated and \n&gt; said, &quot;All \n&gt; &gt; the scriptures that have to be read, I have rea=\r\nd. All the \nmantras \n&gt; &gt; and japa that have to be done, I have done. Still =\r\nI have no \npeace. \n&gt; &gt; Please save me.&quot; The young Swami took a little time.=\r\n For at \nleast \n&gt; &gt; fifteen minutes he silently gazed at him. Then in Tamil=\r\n, he \nspoke. \n&gt; &gt; The English translation is simple:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;If one watch=\r\nes whence the notion &#39;I&#39; arises, the mind is \nabsorbed \n&gt; &gt; in That; that i=\r\ns tapas. When you recite a mantra, watch where \nthe \n&gt; &gt; sound is coming fr=\r\nom, within you; when you sing a song or \nprayer, \n&gt; &gt; watch where it is ema=\r\nnating from: your Heart. Put your attention \non \n&gt; &gt; That. That is tyaga, t=\r\nhat is TAPASYA, that is all.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; All his doubts and delusions were washed=\r\n away that day. &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                            \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   &quot;Thi=\r\ns above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; -------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt;  Share files, take polls, and make new friends=\r\n - all under one \nroof.
