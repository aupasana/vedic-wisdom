I re=\r\ncommend it wholeheartedly.&quot;\n\n- Professor Subhash Kak, author of The Gods Wi=\r\nthin, The Prajna Sutras, The Architecture of Knowledge and other books.\n\n\n\n=\r\nFrom the Forward\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)\n=\r\n\nThroughout our history, a wide variety of diverse cultures and authors hav=\r\ne created written works of such notable aesthetic grandeur that they deserv=\r\ne to be termed &quot;great literature&quot;.   Such illustrious names as Homer, Shake=\r\nspeare and Kalidasa come to mind when we contemplate some of the authors of=\r\n this literature.  Within this grand literary corpus of great literature, h=\r\nowever, a further qualitative distinction can be made.  There is great lite=\r\nrature, to be sure, but then there is eternal literature.  Eternal literatu=\r\nre is comprised of such works that do much more than to merely inspire only=\r\n a specific group of people, or to endure for many generations, or even to =\r\ninspire us to think great thoughts and to aspire toward lofty heights.  Rat=\r\nher, eternal literature serves the additional vital function of being clear=\r\n windows upon the Transcendent reality, revealing that Transcendent to us i=\r\nn the most accessible of ways, and providing us with a means by which we ca=\r\nn, in turn, manifest the Eternal in our own mortal lives.  An encounter wit=\r\nh a truly eternal work of literature has more than the mere potential to co=\r\nnvey to us a great idea; it has the potential to make us into enlightened b=\r\neings.\n\nThere are several works that fall under the category of eternal lit=\r\nerature, of which one of the most profoundly illuminating is the ancient Bh=\r\nagavad Gita, or The Song of God.  The Bhagavad Gita is the historical recor=\r\nd of a conversation that took place in 3102 B.C., just before the commencem=\r\nent of the great Mahabharata War.  This was a philosophical conversation be=\r\ntween the great warrior Arjuna and Bhagavan Sri Krishna, the incarnation (a=\r\nvatara) of God who appeared at the very beginning of our era, the Kali Yuga=\r\n, to restore Dharma and Truth to the world.  So important has this profound=\r\nly illuminating dialog between man and God been throughout history, that th=\r\ne Bhagavad Gita has often been called the &quot;Bible&quot; of the tradition of Sanat=\r\nana Dharma, the Eternal Natural Way, which is commonly referred to as &quot;Hind=\r\nuism&quot;.  There has been almost no important scholar, philosopher or samprada=\r\nya Acharya (lineage preceptor) in the history of Sanatana Dharma who has no=\r\nt written a commentary upon this work.  In a further display of the truly g=\r\nlobal significance of this Song of God in the last two hundred years, speci=\r\nfically, the Gita has been translated into the English language alone over =\r\n650 separate times.\n\nOf course, having outlined the ubiquitous number of En=\r\nglish translations of the Gita, this begs the natural question: Why have ye=\r\nt another translation?  The answer lays in a proper understanding of the ep=\r\nistemic nature and soteriological function of the Gita itself.  For, again,=\r\n the Bhagavad Gita is not an ordinary piece of literature in the normative =\r\nsense.  Rather, it is a work of truly divine origin, having God as its dire=\r\nct source, and radical existential freedom (moksha) as its purpose.  This b=\r\neing the case, the Gita cannot ever be understood by a merely academic or t=\r\nheoretical exegetical analysis alone.  Rather, the truths that the Gita rev=\r\neal can only be fully understood as a result of a direct, non-mediated expe=\r\nrience of Truth.  It is only through the practice of the teachings of the G=\r\nita that the mysteries of the Gita can be known.  It is only as a result of=\r\n intense spiritual practice in the form of Yoga and meditation, under the t=\r\nutelage of an authentic and self-realized guru, that the teachings of Sri K=\r\nrishna come to life within the heart, the intellect, and the very soul (atm=\r\nan) of the spiritual seeker.  Sadly, the vast majority of the 650 English t=\r\nranslations of the Gita tend to take a dry academic approach, at the very e=\r\nxpense of just such a dynamically experiential spiritual understanding.\n\nIn=\r\n the following translation and commentary upon the Bhagavad Gita by Sri Shi=\r\nvadasa Bharati Swami, however, we find one of the brightest and most refres=\r\nhing exceptions to the above scenario.   Sri Shivadasa Swami represents one=\r\n of the very few Gita translators who has possessed both the academically c=\r\nultivated methodological ability, coupled with the spiritual insight of a d=\r\nevoted Hindu practitioner of over forty years, necessary to finally do just=\r\nice to the eternal spirit of the Bhagavad Gita.  With his highly traditiona=\r\nl religious training, rigorous philosophical background and initiatory cred=\r\nentials firmly cemented in the orthodox Smarta tradition of the Advaita sch=\r\nool of Vedantic Hinduism, Sri Shivadasa Swami has the ability to speak in t=\r\nhis work with a quietly humble, yet powerfully forceful, authority that few=\r\n other contemporary translator-commentators have been able to raise.\n\nIn an=\r\n age in which authenticity, honesty, inspired numinous insight and philosop=\r\nhical acumen seem to have taken a backseat - albeit however so temporarily =\r\n- to the latest commercially oriented, new age mystical fads of the day, th=\r\ne writings of Sri Shivadasa Bharati Swami have courageously echoed the eter=\r\nnal voices of the great sages, the rishis, reminiscent of an ancient Golden=\r\n Age of spiritual attainment.   Sri Swamiji has revealed to the world once =\r\nagain that clear window to Transcendent reality, and allowed that eternal w=\r\nork of literature known as the Bhagavad Gita to shine forth for the world t=\r\no marvel at.  I await eagerly to witness what additional jewels of writing =\r\nare destined to be unleashed from the pen of Sri Swamiji in the future.\n\nAu=\r\nm Shanti\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)\nPresident=\r\n-Acharya: International Sanatana Dharma Society\nDirector: The Center for Dh=\r\narma Studies\nOmaha, Nebraska, U.S.A.\nDecember, 2009\n\n\nOrder Your Copy Today=\r\n\n\nhttp://www.lulu.com/content/paperback-book/bhagavad-gita-the-song-of-the-=\r\nlord-an-american-translation-in-prose/8109400\n\n$10.92\nShips in 3-5 business=\r\n days.\n\n\nAbout Sri Sivadasa Bharati Swami\n\nSri Sivadasa Bharati Swami (Dr. =\r\nA.R.
