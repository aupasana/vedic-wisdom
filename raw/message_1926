In fact, during the war with Ravana, on a spec=\r\nific day he tell his men  &quot;Only I and Siva can shower arrows in this manner=\r\n&quot;.

You may call an object made with 22 c=\r\naret gold to be purer than an object made with 14 caret gold. But if the ar=\r\nrow, chain and beautiful necklace are all made of 22 caret gold, they are a=\r\nll equally pure. Simply because the necklace required more work, it is nore=\r\n purer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Rama and Krishna were both from Vishnu - pure s=\r\nattwa. One is not more &quot;evolved&quot; than the other. They just served different=\r\n purposes (like the arrow and necklace made of the same 22 pure gold) and h=\r\nence had different qualities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like I said, earlier, Rama and Krish=\r\nna are from the soul and mind principles of the cosmic being.
