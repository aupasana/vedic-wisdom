I hope Vi=\r\nshnu sahasra naama homam also catches on. Many people know how to chant Vis=\r\nhnu sahasra naama stotra and doing a homam with it adds only 10 minutes to =\r\nthe chanting time! Of course, if one wants to make it longer, one can repea=\r\nt a few times.\n \nVishnu&#39;s 1000 name prayer is very powerful and charges one=\r\n with saattwik energy, a sense of dharma and purpose in life.\n \nBest regard=\r\ns,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n            =\r\n      http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n----=\r\n &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hi Everyone, \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI am really happy to inform you all that we performed Sri Vishnu Homam at m=\r\ny Friend&#39;s place recently. One of my friends bought a house recently and wa=\r\nnted me to perform Ganapathi Homam and Sudarsana Homam. But since I did not=\r\n know how to do a Sudarsana homam and more over I was not inclined to get d=\r\netails on Sudarsana homam since it was discussed by Shri Narasimha here bef=\r\nore as a homam for a weapon, I prefered to do a more satvik homam like Vish=\r\nnuHomam and suggested the same. They agreed and we first did a Ganapathi Ho=\r\nmam and then proceeded to do a Vishnu Homam after a short break. Indeed it =\r\nwas a great experience that while reciting Vishnu Sahasranamam and offering=\r\n Ahutis, the fire has risen really nicely (almost upto a foot and half in h=\r\neight with just three dry coconut-halves and it was a wonderful sight). Thi=\r\ns is very similar to Satyanarayana vratam that we offer ahutis to navagraha=\r\ns, do the regular dikpalaka pooja etc. Except for the &#39;Pancha Loka Palaka P=\r\nooja&#39; and the five stories after the vratam, I find that in Vishnu homam, a=\r\nll the essentials are still covered. I find that this Homam is a good subst=\r\nitute (and takes lesser time) than Satyanarayana Vratam, if one is falling =\r\nshort of time! Am I right, Sri Narasimha? \n\n\n"}}
