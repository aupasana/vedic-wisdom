Their subject was the philosophy and practical\nteachings expounded =\r\nby Bhagavan in Ulladu Narpadu. Lakshman Sarma\nsubsequently summarised the e=\r\nssence of these lessons in two works: his Tamil\ncommentary on Ulladu Narpad=\r\nu and Revelation, his expanded Sanskrit rendering\nof the original Ulladu Na=\r\nrpadu verses. In the 1930s Bhagavan remarked that\nLakshman Sarma&#39;s commenta=\r\nry on Ulladu Narpadu was the best available on that\nwork. In the late 1930s=\r\n Lakshman Sarma put many of these ideas and\nexplanations into Maha Yoga, hi=\r\ns English presentation of Bhagavan&#39;s\nteachings.\n\nIn the 1950s Lakshman Sarm=\r\na made a further attempt to explain and summarise\nBhagavan&#39;s teachings. He =\r\ncomposed a Sanskrit work of over 700 verses,\nentitling it Sri Ramana Paravi=\r\ndyopanishad.\n\nBenedictory Verse\n\nWe bow our heads to holy Ramana, the ocean=\r\n of grace, the infinite,\nincommensurable, unborn primal divinity, Guru of a=\r\nll Gurus, shining in the\nHearts of all creatures as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.\n\nI=\r\nn this verse the essence of the teaching is indicated. Devotion and\nself-su=\r\nrrender to the one real being, the real Self of all creatures, is\nshown to =\r\nbe the means of attaining the goal of life, which may be here\nstated as re-=\r\nintegration with that Being, separateness from it being the\noriginal sin an=\r\nd the cause of all evil.\n\nHerein is also expressed the saving truth, the un=\r\nity of the three apparently\ndistinct entities, God, the Guru and the real S=\r\nelf, which was neatly\nexpressed in an ancient work, the Manasollasa, a comm=\r\nentary by Sri\nSureshwaracharya on the Sri Dakshinamurti Stotra by Bhagavan =\r\nSri\nSankaracharya:\n\n1 Homage to Sri Dakshinamurti, manifest in three forms =\r\nas God, the Guru and\nthe real Self, whose form is infinite as the sky.\n\nDak=\r\nshinamurti was the name of God when He appeared as the primal Guru and\ntaug=\r\nht the sacred mystery of the supreme state by silence to the four sages,\nSa=\r\nnaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara. Bhagavan our Master has said\ntha=\r\nt these three are the three stages of divine grace: first God, then the\nGur=\r\nu, and last the real Self. This will be explained later.\n\nThe subject of th=\r\nis revelation is next stated.\n\n2 In this work is expounded the teaching abo=\r\nut the natural state of the real\nSelf, known as right awareness, which was =\r\ntaught in the Mandukya and other\nUpanishads, and which has [now] been taugh=\r\nt by that same [divine Guru],\nalong with the means thereto, as experienced =\r\nby himself.\n\nBoth the ancient Upanishads and these new Upanishads have been=\r\n given out by\nthe same teacher. For all sages and Gurus are one, being iden=\r\ntical with the\nSupreme Being, the Self of all.\n\nIt is to be noted that the =\r\nstate of deliverance, the goal of all aspirants,\nis styled the =E2=80=98nat=\r\nural state=E2=80=99, because even now we are all in that state,\nour sense o=\r\nf being in other states being an illusion.\n\nBhagavan, our Master, took on a=\r\n human form and even went through sadhana\n[means of reaching the goal] so t=\r\nhat he could teach us by his own\nexperience.\n\nHow one becomes a disciple is=\r\n next briefly described.\n\n3 Becoming keenly aware that worldly life is full=\r\n of misery, because it is\ninfested with desire and fear, one should approac=\r\nh a Guru, a sage who is\nfree from those bad forces, and after doing reveren=\r\nce to his holy feet\nshould question him about how to become free.\n\nWorldly =\r\nlife is full of misery because of one=E2=80=99s subjection to desires and\nf=\r\nears that never cease but only change their forms. Only one whose\nattachmen=\r\nts have been weakened by the realisation that true and lasting\nhappiness is=\r\n not to be had in this worldly life is ripe for discipleship. Such\na one sh=\r\nould seek out a competent Guru, who is free from the bondage he\nwants to es=\r\ncape from, and who is a sage who always abides in the aforesaid\nnatural sta=\r\nte. Reverence to the Guru is imperative, because the ego, which\nis the seed=\r\n of all evil, has to be eliminated in due course, not pampered.\n\n4 The sage=\r\n will give out in reply the supreme secret, confirmed by the\n[uniform] expe=\r\nrience of all sages: =E2=80=98If you know yourself, there is no\nsuffering f=\r\nor you. If you suffer [it only means that] you do not know\nyourself.=E2=80=\r\n=99\n\n5 =E2=80=98Since you have no suffering in deep sleep, this suffering i=\r\ns only falsely\nascribed to your Self. Realise the truth of yourself by the =\r\nresolve to know\nit, and thereafter remain in your own true nature, which is=\r\n bliss.=E2=80=99\n\nThe real Self transcends the mind and is therefore unaffe=\r\ncted by pleasure\nand pain. These are in and of the mind alone. The proof of=\r\n this is that\nthese are experienced only when the mind is functioning =E2=\r\n=80=93 as in waking and\ndream =E2=80=93 and not when the mind is still, as =\r\nin deep sleep. To be free from\nsuffering the only means, therefore, is to b=\r\necome aware of one=E2=80=99s real Self\nby the quest taught by Bhagavan, our=\r\n Guru. The Self does not need to be made\nhappy. It is itself happiness. Thi=\r\ns very teaching appears in brief in the\nTamil Book, Kaivalya Navaneetam, an=\r\nd Bhagavan gave it out as the essence of\nhis own teaching.\n\nIs that all? Wh=\r\nat about the contents of the Upanishads and the rest of the\nsacred lore?\n\n6=\r\n This teaching of the Guru is the very essence of all the Upanishads. All\nt=\r\nhe texts of the latter are just commentaries on this teaching.\n\nThe teachin=\r\ng is given in a slightly more detailed form in the verses that\nfollow.\n\n7 I=\r\nn the Heart there dwells the reality that is pure consciousness, the real\nS=\r\nelf. To be in the Heart, with the mind quiescent, is knowledge [awareness]\n=\r\nof it, and also the state of deliverance.\n\nThe state of deliverance is just=\r\n the mind-free state in which the real Self,\nthe dweller in the Heart, is r=\r\nealised as such.\n\nThe real Self is not the dutiful little apparent self, ca=\r\nlled the =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99.\nWhat then is it? The answer follows.\n\n8 Th=\r\nat pure consciousness, which is the real Self shining in the Heart, ever\nth=\r\ne same [without change], and the basic substratum =E2=80=93 named Brahman =\r\n=E2=80=93 of the\nwhole universe, are both one and the same.\n\nThat is the me=\r\naning intended to be conveyed by the sacred texts of the\nUpanishads, which =\r\nsay that the Supreme Being itself entered the body as the\nsoul, while also =\r\ngiving a popular account of what is known as =E2=80=98creation=E2=80=99.\nRe=\r\nally there was no creation, except that which will be presently explained.\n=\r\n\n9 The world appearance is ignorantly superimposed by the mind upon that\nsu=\r\nbstratum, which is the truth of the Self. It [the world appearance]\nconceal=\r\ns that reality and shines [as if it is] real so long as the ignorance\npersi=\r\nsts.\n\nIgnorance and mind are inseparable; where there is mind, there alone =\r\nis\nignorance; where there is no mind, there is no ignorance, since in the\nm=\r\nind-free state the real Self is not concealed. This explains why the real\nS=\r\nelf is not known to men in general.\n\nAn analogy is next given to help to un=\r\nderstand the above statement.\n\n10 Just as, in a dim light, the snake concea=\r\nling the real rope is taken as\nreal in its own sight, so the world, conceal=\r\ning the Self, appears as real in\nits own sight. This is the state of ignora=\r\nnce.\n\nThe notion of the Self that develops because of this basic ignorance =\r\nis\ndescribed next.\n\n11 Because of ignorance, the Self is believed to be lim=\r\nited to the body. [In\nthat state] it enjoys and suffers, is bound by bonds =\r\nof desire to the world,\n[and appears to be] ignorant and distinct from the =\r\nSupreme Being. Really the\nSelf is identical with it, not other.\n\nThis mista=\r\nken view of one=E2=80=99s own Self is the starting point of all the evil,\nk=\r\nnown as samsara, which means the necessity of being born and dying in an\nen=\r\ndless cycle. But all this is unreal, as explained in the very first verse\no=\r\nf Ekatma Panchakam (The Five Verses on the One Self), where it is said that=\r\n\nmistaking the body for the Self, the cycle of births and deaths,\nSelf-real=\r\nisation and becoming the Self, are all a dream, like a world tour\nin a drea=\r\nm.\n\n12 Hence this world-wandering of the Self is just a myth. But this can =\r\nbe\nverified only in the mind-free state. =E2=80=98Apart from the mind there=\r\n is no\nignorance; the mind itself is ignorance, which is bondage to life in=\r\n the\nworld.=E2=80=99\n\nThe latter half of the verse is a quotation from Vive=\r\nka Chudamani of Sri\nSankaracharya.\n\nThe analogy of the rope-snake is here r=\r\nepeated, to explain this wrong notion\nof the Self.\n\n13 As one seeing the fa=\r\nlse snake fails to see the real rope, so, seeing the\nworld =E2=80=93 in whi=\r\nch are included the personal God and the individual soul =E2=80=93 he\ndoes =\r\nnot see the real Self as it really is, that is, as the supreme reality\n[Bra=\r\nhman].\n\nHow long will this effect of ignorance continue?\n\n14 The Self will =\r\nremain concealed [in this way] as long as the world is\ntaken to be real. It=\r\n will cease to be so taken when the mind is once and for\nall extinguished; =\r\nhence one must strive towards extinguishing the mind.\n\nThe world-appearance=\r\n being the obstacle to right awareness of the Self, and\nthe mind being the =\r\ncause of the world-appearance, the cure of this evil is\nthe attainment of t=\r\nhe mind-free state, which is done by the quest, which\nwill now be briefly d=\r\nescribed.\n\n15-16 The mind projects on the Self the illusory world appearanc=\r\ne. He who,\nseeing the Self, becomes firmly established in the true state as=\r\n that Self,\nthus uncovering that Self and dissolving the mind, which compri=\r\nses ignorance\nand the whole world, will enjoy his own true state, which is =\r\nwithout\nsamsara, which is not covered by the vehicles, which is identical w=\r\nith\nBrahman, and which exists alone, without a second.\n\nThe full significan=\r\nce of these revelations will be understood in due course,\nin the course of =\r\nthis book.\n\nAn alternative to the quest is the path of devotion to God, cul=\r\nminating in\nself-surrender, which also leads ultimately to the same goal. T=\r\nhis is\nindicated in the next two verses.\n\n17 Or if, from fear of the flood =\r\nof births and deaths, one takes refuge in\nGod, then ignorance will cease by=\r\n His grace alone, and then one will become\nestablished in the true state of=\r\n the Self.\n\nThis self-surrender is the final stage of the practice of devot=\r\nion, which is\ndealt with in the next verse.\n\n18 The wise call by the name =\r\n=E2=80=98self-surrender=E2=80=99 the offering of oneself to God\nthrough dev=\r\notion. Hence, the seeker of deliverance must practise devotion to\nGod, whic=\r\nh is described as ninefold, consisting of listening and the rest.\n\nThe nine=\r\nfold list comes from a list in the Bhagavatam: =E2=80=98Listening to tales\n=\r\nof God=E2=80=99s glory, telling and remembering them, cleaving to His feet,=\r\n worship,\nobeisance, acts of service, cherishing Him as a friend, and offer=\r\ning oneself\nto Him.\n\nA few of the different names of the supreme state are =\r\ngiven next:\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- =\r\n\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae92072a049e9306eb\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe Supreme Science as of the Self as Taught by Sri Ramana&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;In the late 1920s Lakshman Sarma had the rare privilege of having private=\r\n lessons from Bhagavan.

T=\r\nhese are in and of the mind alone. The proof of this is that these are expe=\r\nrienced only when the mind is functioning =E2=80=93 as in waking and dream =\r\n=E2=80=93 and not when the mind is still, as in deep sleep. To be free from=\r\n suffering the only means, therefore, is to become aware of one=E2=80=99s r=\r\neal Self by the quest taught by Bhagavan, our Guru. The Self does not need =\r\nto be made happy. It is itself happiness. This very teaching appears in bri=\r\nef in the Tamil Book, Kaivalya Navaneetam, and Bhagavan gave it out as the =\r\nessence of his own teaching.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Is that all? What about the contents =\r\nof the Upanishads and the rest of the sacred lore?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6 This teaching o=\r\nf the Guru is the very essence of all the Upanishads. All the texts of the =\r\nlatter are just commentaries on this teaching.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The teaching is giv=\r\nen in a slightly more detailed form in the verses that follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7 In =\r\nthe Heart there dwells the reality that is pure consciousness, the real Sel=\r\nf. To be in the Heart, with the mind quiescent, is knowledge [awareness] of=\r\n it, and also the state of deliverance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The state of deliverance i=\r\ns just the mind-free state in which the real Self, the dweller in the Heart=\r\n, is realised as such.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The real Self is not the dutiful little appar=\r\nent self, called the =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99.

The answer fo=\r\nllows.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;8 That pure consciousness, which is the real Self shining i=\r\nn the Heart, ever the same [without change], and the basic substratum =E2=\r\n=80=93 named Brahman =E2=80=93 of the whole universe, are both one and the =\r\nsame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That is the meaning intended to be conveyed by the sacred text=\r\ns of the Upanishads, which say that the Supreme Being itself entered the bo=\r\ndy as the soul, while also giving a popular account of what is known as =E2=\r\n=80=98creation=E2=80=99. Really there was no creation, except that which wi=\r\nll be presently explained.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;9 The world appearance is ignorantly su=\r\nperimposed by the mind upon that substratum, which is the truth of the Self=\r\n. It [the world appearance] conceals that reality and shines [as if it is] =\r\nreal so long as the ignorance persists.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;Ignorance and mind are inseparable; where there is mind, there alone=\r\n is ignorance; where there is no mind, there is no ignorance, since in the =\r\nmind-free state the real Self is not concealed.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0This explains w=\r\nhy the real Self is not known to men in general.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;An analogy is nex=\r\nt given to help to understand the above statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10 Just as, in a =\r\ndim light, the snake concealing the real rope is taken as real in its own s=\r\night, so the world, concealing the Self, appears as real in its own sight. =\r\nThis is the state of ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The notion of the Self that develo=\r\nps because of this basic ignorance is described next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11 Because of =\r\nignorance, the Self is believed to be limited to the body. [In that state] =\r\nit enjoys and suffers, is bound by bonds of desire to the world, [and appea=\r\nrs to be] ignorant and distinct from the Supreme Being. Really the Self is =\r\nidentical with it, not other.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This mistaken view of one=E2=80=99s =\r\nown Self is the starting point of all the evil, known as samsara, which mea=\r\nns the necessity of being born and dying in an endless cycle. But all this =\r\nis unreal, as explained in the very first verse of Ekatma Panchakam (The Fi=\r\nve Verses on the One Self), where it is said that mistaking the body for th=\r\ne Self, the cycle of births and deaths, Self-realisation and becoming the S=\r\nelf, are all a dream, like a world tour in a dream.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;12 Hence this =\r\nworld-wandering of the Self is just a myth. But this can be verified only i=\r\nn the mind-free state. =E2=80=98Apart from the mind there is no ignorance;=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;the mind itself is ignorance, which =\r\nis bondage to life in the world.=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The latter half o=\r\nf the verse is a quotation from Viveka Chudamani of Sri Sankaracharya.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;The analogy of the rope-snake is here repeated, to explain this wrong no=\r\ntion of the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;13 As one seeing the false snake fails to see the =\r\nreal rope, so, seeing the world =E2=80=93 in which are included the persona=\r\nl God and the individual soul =E2=80=93 he does not see the real Self as it=\r\n really is, that is, as the supreme reality [Brahman].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;How long wi=\r\nll this effect of ignorance continue?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;14 The Self will remain concea=\r\nled [in this way] as long as the world is taken to be real. It will cease t=\r\no be so taken when the mind is once and for all extinguished; hence one mus=\r\nt strive towards extinguishing the mind.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The world-appearance bein=\r\ng the obstacle to right awareness of the Self, and the mind being the cause=\r\n of the world-appearance, the cure of this evil is the attainment of the mi=\r\nnd-free state, which is done by the quest, which will now be briefly descri=\r\nbed.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;15-16 The mind projects on the Self the illusory world appear=\r\nance. He who, seeing the Self, becomes firmly established in the true state=\r\n as that Self, thus uncovering that Self and dissolving the mind, which com=\r\nprises ignorance and the whole world, will enjoy his own true state, which =\r\nis without samsara, which is not covered by the vehicles, which is identica=\r\nl with Brahman, and which exists alone, without a second.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The full=\r\n significance of these revelations will be understood in due course, in the=\r\n course of this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alternative to the quest is the path of dev=\r\notion to God, culminating in self-surrender, which also leads ultimately to=\r\n the same goal. This is indicated in the next two verses.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;17 Or if=\r\n, from fear of the flood of births and deaths, one takes refuge in God, the=\r\nn ignorance will cease by His grace alone, and then one will become establi=\r\nshed in the true state of the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This self-surrender is the final=\r\n stage of the practice of devotion, which is dealt with in the next verse.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;18 The wise call by the name =E2=80=98self-surrender=E2=80=99 the =\r\noffering of oneself to God through devotion. Hence, the seeker of deliveran=\r\nce must practise devotion to God, which is described as ninefold, consistin=\r\ng of listening and the rest.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The ninefold list comes from a list i=\r\nn the Bhagavatam: =E2=80=98Listening to tales of God=E2=80=99s glory, telli=\r\nng and remembering them, cleaving to His feet, worship, obeisance, acts of =\r\nservice, cherishing Him as a friend, and offering oneself to Him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nA few of the different names of the supreme state are given next:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgo=\r\ndman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.o=\r\nrg/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin=\r\n-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;marg=\r\nin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=\r\n=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd25cae92072a049e9306eb--\r\n\n"}}
