How else can one see G=\r\nod? Has God talked to anyone who is devoid of ecstatic fervour? One sees Go=\r\nd in spiritual vision, talks to him, and establishes relationship with him =\r\nin spirit.\n=C2=A0\n\n\nThrough these spiritual disciplines the ties of past ka=\r\nrma are cut asunder.

You can find some answers =\r\nin the archives. I will briefly answer again.\n&gt; \n&gt; On your first point: Yes=\r\n, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaan=\r\naam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/rituals, I am the japa yajna, i.e. c=\r\nhanting of mantras).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; We can get it in right perspective by =\r\nnoting that the very previous line says &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Y=\r\nes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe. However, is it=\r\n possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;Om&quot; and reach god? Probably =\r\nnot. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as the mahamantra (Har=\r\ne krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om&quot;, because Krishna said I am=\r\n &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same thing holds to japam vs othe=\r\nr sadhanas such as homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as one may need ropes and other gear to=\r\n climb mount everest, one may need to employ mantras other than &quot;Om&quot; and pr=\r\nactices other than &quot;japam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s short-comings and reach the su=\r\nmmit of the absolute, represented by Om (and all other things mentioned by =\r\nKrishna).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; When you do an external sacrifical ritual such as=\r\n homam, your body is engaging in actions. So your mind has to be attached t=\r\no the body and use it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while doin=\r\ng homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the e=\r\nxternal actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absorb =\r\nfully in the mantra at some stage then.\n&gt; \n&gt; From the point of view, japam =\r\n(sitting still and meditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ho=\r\nwever, not everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas (con=\r\nditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until that =\r\nis done, japam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the help of a=\r\nn external pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying effect on one&#39;s =\r\nsubtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one for good japam.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of priests do homam and then leave the fire and go away. =\r\nIn the homam manuals, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam=\r\n with their favorite mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still wi=\r\nth closed eyes. The idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *p=\r\nrepares* one for reaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one to =\r\ngod. After every homam, one&#39;s internal purity is at a maximum (a local maxi=\r\nmum, temporally speaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will b=\r\ne more fruitful than at other times.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now onto other questio=\r\nns:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) It is unfruitful in the sense that it does not take you closer=\r\n to god. It is fruitful in the sense that it stops you from going much furt=\r\nher away from god. After all, if you weren&#39;t engaged in that japam and you =\r\nwere doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander even more.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I suggest looking at disturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as a =\r\nheckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguing and fighting with the =\r\nheckler, simply take note of him, pause for a second and move on. Instead o=\r\nf panicking or worrying, simply take note of your thoughts, pause for a sec=\r\nond and move on.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the mind (=\r\nmana). Various vasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in different dir=\r\nections to react to various situations in various ways and that activity ti=\r\nres out the mind. You protect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teaching i=\r\nt to overcome the pulls of vasana.\n&gt; \n&gt; The proof of whether a mantra or ja=\r\npam or homam is working for you or not is whether there is a slow internal =\r\ntransformation in you or not, whether your internal reaction to various ext=\r\nernal things is changing for the better or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Difficult. This is=\r\n where a good guru is helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, in this age, technical perfec=\r\ntion is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of=\r\n surrender and humility. If there is something partly correct that somebody=\r\n is doing, it will slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfe=\r\nctions with time.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) I can write Obama&#39;s name and Gordon&#39;s name on sh=\r\neets of paper next to me and pretend that they came there and sat there. Wi=\r\nll they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader holding a s=\r\nummit, probably I can make them actually come and sit there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nyasa mea=\r\nns placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrations (sound patter=\r\nns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most of us with distra=\r\ncted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing. Only a sadhaka with=\r\n a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place various vibrations and=\r\n energies in various body parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; I always suggest to people to do nyas=\r\na as taught by elders (so that the knowledge lives and is passed on), but n=\r\not worry too much about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, we are in the midst of deepenin=\r\ng Kali and the level of sadhakas is not as high as in the old days. Technic=\r\nal perfection will become rarer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrend=\r\ner and humility.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Films that make=\r\n a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; In t=\r\nhe Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Japa&quot; amongst all Yajnas.

You can find some answers in the archives. I wi=\r\nll briefly answer again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On your first point: Yes, Lord Kr=\r\nishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaanaam japay=\r\naGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/rituals, I am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting o=\r\nf mantras).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We can get it in right=\r\n perspective by noting that the very previous line says &quot;I am Om among all =\r\nmantras&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence=\r\n of universe. However, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;=\r\nOm&quot; and reach god? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras=\r\n such as the mahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om=\r\n&quot;, because Krishna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Same thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Just as one may need ropes and other gear to climb mount everest, o=\r\nne may need to employ mantras other than &quot;Om&quot; and practices other than &quot;jap=\r\nam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s short-comings and reach the summit of the absolute, r=\r\nepresented by Om (and all other things mentioned by Krishna).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you do an external sacrifical ritual such a=\r\ns homam, your body is engaging in\n actions. So your mind has to be attached=\r\n to the body and use it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while do=\r\ning homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the=\r\n external actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absor=\r\nb fully in the mantra at some stage then.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From the point o=\r\nf view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sa=\r\ndhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, not everyone can reach god like that. Ther=\r\ne are so many vasanas (conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/pu=\r\nrified slowly. Until that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Until =\r\nthen, taking the help of an external pure object (such as fire) that has a =\r\npurifying effect on one&#39;s subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares=\r\n* one for good japam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A lot of prie=\r\nsts do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manuals, I h=\r\nave made it a point to\n insist that people do japam with their favorite man=\r\ntra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. The idea=\r\n is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for reachin=\r\ng god, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every homam, =\r\none&#39;s internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking=\r\n - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at =\r\nother times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now onto other questio=\r\nns:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) It is unfruitful in the sense that it does not tak=\r\ne you closer to god. It is fruitful in the sense that it stops you from goi=\r\nng much further away from god. After all, if you weren&#39;t engaged in that ja=\r\npam and you were doing some other activity, probably your mind will wander =\r\neven more.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I suggest looking at disturbing thoughts in the=\r\n middle of a japam as a heckler interrupting your speech. Instead of arguin=\r\ng and fighting\n with the heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a seco=\r\nnd and move on. Instead of panicking or worrying, simply take note of your =\r\nthoughts, pause for a second and move on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Mantra means=\r\n that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) =\r\nare pulling the mind in different directions to react to various situations=\r\n in various ways and that activity tires out the mind. You protect it by an=\r\nchoring it in a mantra and teaching it to overcome the pulls of vasana.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working fo=\r\nr you or not is whether there is a slow internal transformation in you or n=\r\not, whether your internal reaction to various external things is changing f=\r\nor the better or not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) Difficult. This is where a good =\r\nguru is helpful.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actually, in this age, technical perfecti=\r\non is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of s=\r\nurrender\n and humility. If there is something partly correct that somebody =\r\nis doing, it will slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfec=\r\ntions with time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (4) I can write Obama&#39;s name and Gordon&#39;s=\r\n name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that they came there and sa=\r\nt there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader =\r\nholding a summit, probably I can make them actually come and sit there.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various v=\r\nibrations (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For=\r\n most of us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothi=\r\nng. Only a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place=\r\n various vibrations and energies in various body parts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I =\r\nalways suggest to people to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the knowl=\r\nedge lives and is passed on), but not worry too much about it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; As I said, we are in the midst of deepening Kali and the level of sad=\r\nhakas is not as high as in the old days. Technical perfection will become r=\r\narer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrender and humility.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jy=\r\notish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals fo=\r\nr short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; F=\r\nilms that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifil/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil&lt;/A&gt; ms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/JyotishWri\n tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@yahoo. com&=\r\ngt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Japa=\r\n&quot; amongst all Yajnas.

The chanting done at these instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sen=\r\nse of devotion in the mind and are merely a physical chanting.

Do those deities actually come and protect the=\r\n entire process of Japa?
