Does this mean that we =\r\nshould all leave what we are doing and go back to our native places and kee=\r\np doing our kula vritti as defined by our vihita karmas as defined by our s=\r\ncriptures? I am very confused and need PVRjis help to understand this bette=\r\nr. \n\n\n\nNagraj\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
