We human beings are =\r\nvery slow to recognise our\nown weakness, our own faults, so long as we can =\r\nlay the blame upon somebody\nelse. Men in general lay all the blame of life =\r\non their fellow-men, or,\nfailing that, on God, or they conjure up a ghost, =\r\nand say it is fate. Where\nis fate, and who is fate? We reap what we sow. We=\r\n are the makers of our own\nfate. None else has the blame, none has the prai=\r\nse. The wind is blowing;\nthose vessels whose sails are unfurled catch it, a=\r\nnd go forward on their\nway, but those which have their sails furled do not =\r\ncatch the wind. Is that\nthe fault of the wind? Is it the fault of the merci=\r\nful Father, whose wind of\nmercy is blowing without ceasing, day and night, =\r\nwhose mercy knows no decay,\nis it His fault that some of us are happy and s=\r\nome unhappy?\n\nWe make our own destiny. His sun shines for the weak as well =\r\nas for the\nstrong. His wind blows for saint and sinner alike. He is the Lor=\r\nd of all,\nthe Father of all, merciful, and impartial. Do you mean to say th=\r\nat He, the\nLord of creation, looks upon the petty things of our life in the=\r\n same light\nas we do? What a degenerate idea of God that would be! We are l=\r\nike little\npuppies, making life-and-death struggles here, and foolishly thi=\r\nnking that\neven God Himself will take it as seriously as we do. He knows wh=\r\nat the\npuppies&#39; play means.Our attempts to lay the blame on Him, making Him=\r\n the\npunisher, and the rewarder, are only foolish. He neither punishes, nor=\r\n\nrewards any. His infinite mercy is open to every one, at all times, in all=\r\n\nplaces, under all conditions, unfailing, unswerving. Upon us depends how w=\r\ne\nuse it. Upon us depends how we utilise it. Blame neither man, nor God, no=\r\nr\nanyone in the world. When you find yourselves suffering, blame yourselves=\r\n,\nand try to do better.\n\nThis is the only solution of the problem. Those th=\r\nat blame others =97 and,\nalas! the number of them is increasing every day =\r\n=97 are generally miserable\nwith helpless brains; they have brought themsel=\r\nves to that pass through\ntheir own mistakes and blame others, but this does=\r\n not alter their position.\nIt does not serve them in any way. This attempt =\r\nto throw the blame upon\nothers only weakens them the more. Therefore, blame=\r\n none for your own\nfaults, stand upon your own feet, and take the whole res=\r\nponsibility upon\nyourselves.\n\nSay, &quot;This misery that I am suffering is of m=\r\ny own doing, and that very\nthing proves that it will have to be undone by m=\r\ne alone.&quot; That which I\ncreated, I can demolish; that which is created by so=\r\nme one else I shall\nnever be able to destroy. Therefore, stand up, be bold,=\r\n be strong. Take the\nwhole responsibility on your own shoulders, and know t=\r\nhat you are the\ncreator of your own destiny. All the strength and succour y=\r\nou want is within\nyourselves. Therefore, make your own future. &quot;Let the dea=\r\nd past bury its\ndead.&quot; The infinite future is before you, and you must alwa=\r\nys remember that\neach word, thought, and deed, lays up a store for you and =\r\nthat as the bad\nthoughts and bad works are ready to spring upon you like ti=\r\ngers, so also\nthere is the inspiring hope that the good thoughts and good d=\r\needs are ready\nwith the power of a hundred thousand angels to defend you al=\r\nways and for\never.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Work=\r\ns_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Jnana-Yoga/The_Cosmos:_The_Microcosm\n\n-- \nO=\r\nm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00163600cfe42efd130471b8091a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(=\r\n51, 51, 51); &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Volume 2, Jnana-Yoga&lt;br&gt;CH=\r\nAPTER XII THE COSMOS The Microcosm (Delivered in New York, 26th January 189=\r\n6)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;We do not look at our =\r\nown faults; the eyes do not see themselves, they see the eyes of everybody =\r\nelse.&lt;/span&gt;=A0We human beings are very slow to recognise our own weakness,=\r\n our own faults, so long as we can lay the blame upon somebody else.
