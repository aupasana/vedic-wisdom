Instead of explicitly admitting a body (whether it is subtle or gross=\r\n) that survives upon death, haven&#39;t you just created an \nimplicit body boun=\r\nd to your concept of a soul?&gt;&gt;\n\nI am not sure that I understood your questi=\r\non correctly. \n\n\nKarma &quot;attaches&quot; itself by setting certain preconditions/c=\r\nircumstances based on the desires of the soul and lessons the egosense must=\r\n learn for manifesting the soul. This process is taken care of by Nature&#39;s =\r\nlaws. These two - desire and need - are slightly different. At the moment o=\r\nf death the soul has a specific ability to internalize and project what it =\r\nneeds/wants to experience in the next birth. That gets set firmly. That cou=\r\nnts as a desire of the soul. And the basic reaction process of actions perf=\r\normed is the need or the consequence to be faced in order that the egosense=\r\n can learn to be more responsible in its actions.. And, here is the catch i=\r\nn the theory of Karma that I believe in, the reaction process again is exac=\r\nt and divided into a reaction to the body or to the mind or to the life bas=\r\ned on the instrument which was used to perform/engage in a specific karma. =\r\nNow since our ego-sense will identify with these to hold them together, so =\r\nthe\n egosense will experience the reaction. We mostly live from our egosens=\r\ne. But soul is hardly the ego. It lies much much deeper. Now assuming sudde=\r\nnly that the individual in the next birth has a total spiritual transformat=\r\nion and is able to manifest the soul and live life from it, the reactions m=\r\nay not come or if they do may be highly reduced in nature such as not to be=\r\n of any real consequences. When the soul starts governing an individual ins=\r\ntead of his/her egosense, Nature laws for such an individual becomes differ=\r\nent from others. \n\n\nIn another model of reality, it is the karana sharir wi=\r\nll hold the seeds of the karma. which is never destroyed. But the karana sh=\r\narir is very different from the normal mind or life or body. It is more lik=\r\ne a super subtle background process in all individuals. To be able to reach=\r\n consciousness the karana sharir, is a very very high spiritual achievement=\r\n. Our karmas are mostly and almost always in the realm of body, life and mi=\r\nnd. Karana is way beyond this. A typal repository of various things. It is =\r\ninfact only when a person can experience the karana sharir that he/she can =\r\nreally enter into the realm of the Great Gods. They are Beings of this kara=\r\nna jagat, typal and fixed in essence, never changing, like the individual k=\r\narana sharir. Now one can logically ask, so if the karana sharir is recordi=\r\nng karma, is it not getting fatter? This is a problem of our logical mind w=\r\nhich may not hold true in that realm. If=C2=A0 we keep adding jugs of water=\r\n to the ocean,\n will it overflow? No. This is quite beyond the normal mind =\r\nwhich is limited by its own regimented logic.\n\n\nEach of the sharir is not o=\r\nnly an individual&#39;s own but is also effectively and fluidly connected to th=\r\ne whole world of that realm. So with the physical we interact and live in t=\r\nhe physical world, with the sukshma we interact and be a part of the sukshm=\r\na jagat, same with the karan. Only difference being the depth, intensity an=\r\nd the nature of these three. The Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle.=\r\n Like a seed. While the sthula is the maximum changeable of the three. Ever=\r\nything that is there in the sthula jagat is born out of a seed from the kar=\r\nana. As such, nothing in the sthula can go beyond the potentialities held b=\r\ny its most fundamental essence that lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, =\r\nthose who can access this realm at will, can know the most essential nature=\r\n of a thing by experiencing what a thing is in its deepest essence in this =\r\nKarana jagat, and thus get to know all its possibilities without ever tryin=\r\ng to explore them in the physical realm\n or the subtle realm. Quite off lim=\r\nits for most of us.\n\n\nHope this helps.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI =\r\nhave a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / =\r\nBe sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them=\r\n all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n\nOn Monday, 28 October 2013 11:44 PM, Ajit Krishnan &lt;=\r\najit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n \n=C2=A0 \nDear Narasimha,\n\n&gt;=C2=A0Most of t=\r\nhe past life regression therapies ... are just gimmics and/or hallucination=\r\ns.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoesn&#39;t all sadhana belong in the same bucket?

Though we know f=\r\nor sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the other =\r\nway around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=\r\n=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing=\r\n with activities which\n helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense t=\r\nhat I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at=\r\n the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities. When we say that the Go=\r\nd is infinite, we just can not say that the universe can behave in any part=\r\nicular limited ways. Before anyone comments about the utility of any branch=\r\n of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincere dip into the same. By sayi=\r\nng so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one really takes a sincere dip int=\r\no any subject one would definitely be convinced about the same.=C2=A0By say=\r\ning that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere dip, I just me=\r\nan to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmat=\r\nic, narrow.

So having left with no choice, I ag=\r\nreed to give her a session over phone. The phone session continued for arou=\r\nnd one and half an hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent dream =\r\nand also started improving her professional life. Since that day the dream =\r\nhas not yet visited her again.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;It all depends on the openness of=\r\n the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe is much=\r\n more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to see.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM,=\r\n rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understanding of =\r\nthe reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. Reincar=\r\nnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments from=\r\n past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousness.=\r\n Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportunity =\r\nfor the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalled.=\r\n For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and ne=\r\nw set is generated based on need.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in the =\r\nexistence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our idea =\r\nof Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. It is=\r\n like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to gi=\r\nve the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegrate=\r\nd and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can =\r\ncoalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can s=\r\nimultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. =C2=\r\n=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to=\r\n have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while another =\r\npart of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a L=\r\nama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his ener=\r\ngy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnating=\r\n in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with the=\r\nir philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a rei=\r\nncarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governe=\r\nd only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain =\r\nscriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get =\r\nrid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirva=\r\nna. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tenden=\r\ncy towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;B=\r\nut the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not diss=\r\nolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to =\r\nanother and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this=\r\n soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/bod=\r\ny vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and uni=\r\nque soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be ab=\r\nle to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divi=\r\nne Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is on=\r\nly one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state \nof com=\r\nplete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then the=\r\nre was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-action=\r\ns. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea o=\r\nf give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The im=\r\nportant thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come f=\r\north to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immed=\r\niately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. Th=\r\nat is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can=\r\n transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get b=\r\norn a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. Whe=\r\nreas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play,=\r\n are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and ta=\r\nke of energy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything =\r\nelse being perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and p=\r\nresent life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never =\r\na complete cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if th=\r\nere have been lives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at =\r\nall, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. =\r\nFor Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Moreover all t=\r\nhese are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts living in and throu=\r\ngh the soul in a very very strong manner. That is not easy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Regards\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ =\r\nTo grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/=\r\n Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Sa=\r\nturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Even for a great yogi with tremendous self-control=\r\n, calming the mind down to suppress \ncurrent conditioning sufficiently to r=\r\nemember past life is not easy.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;For example, at least 3 saints/yo=\r\ngis of a high spiritual caliber claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa. If such saints cannot accurately know their own past life, a=\r\nnybody thinking that someone else can make one aware of one&#39;s past life is =\r\njust kidding oneself.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Remembering past life or making someone el=\r\nse do so, is not at all easy. In comparison, hallucinating that one remembe=\r\nred past life or making someone else \nhallucinate that one remembered past =\r\nlife, is certainly very easy! In fact, I suspect that is what happens in mo=\r\nst past life regressions..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;There is a deep reason why \nNature=\r\n has built this mechanism of forgetting a life when another life \nstarts. O=\r\ntherwise, this game will end very quickly.

I am sure there too one can find good exorcists,=\r\n maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge about =\r\nPanchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhan=\r\na of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particular man=\r\ntra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency for the=\r\nse kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuk=\r\na. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose m=\r\nother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Rud=\r\nrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava ha=\r\ns been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for=\r\n protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation gro=\r\nund. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this =\r\nmantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay=\r\n Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of=\r\n the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily=\r\n till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, =\r\nIF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I hav=\r\ne seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist fro=\r\nm a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to =\r\ncure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in front of th=\r\ne victim is a must for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members=\r\n, who live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the=\r\n Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas w=\r\nith this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that =\r\neasy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Plea=\r\nse ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhai=\r\nrava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main pr=\r\niest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent=\r\n sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative =\r\ninfluence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the pa=\r\nrents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/ti=\r\nthi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actu=\r\nally benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too=\r\n. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit=\r\n ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter=\r\n through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b=\r\n_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, =\r\n10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for prot=\r\nection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Nam=\r\naste.

For there are various classes and kinds and ty=\r\npes of entities which can possess an individual and some of them can be dow=\r\nnright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many different people have =\r\nadvised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one =\r\nof them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple fa=\r\nctors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on wh=\r\nat kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their l=\r\nink for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or sour=\r\nce of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person.\n Sometimes=\r\n it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s)=\r\n reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and being susceptible =\r\nto such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cas=\r\nes where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual=\r\n, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of=\r\n removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of th=\r\ne spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to ge=\r\nnerate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent a=\r\nnd extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it =\r\nis an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;These thin=\r\ngs like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall under th=\r\ne ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting into, =\r\nany sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away. Every =\r\naction has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n handle the same =\r\ntoo. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time till which, bas=\r\ned on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the individual=\r\n, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not so pl=\r\neasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It is al=\r\nl a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew=\r\n some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exor=\r\ncism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the ti=\r\nme frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous =\r\nkarmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rit=\r\nuals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, pro=\r\nmising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by fo=\r\nrce. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very vio=\r\nlent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do is a) fi=\r\nnd someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope f=\r\nor the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members =\r\nto pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Na=\r\nrasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with=\r\n samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 min=\r\ns path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession=\r\n.

I had tr=\r\nouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  creaking and s=\r\nomething moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I =\r\ndon&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather evil is p=\r\nresent in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because=\r\n of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I start=\r\ned focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrifie=\r\nd state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some steps near =\r\nthe bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become ful=\r\nly aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits li=\r\nve in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying =\r\nat that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not jus=\r\nt me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place=\r\n before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep prop=\r\nerly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waki=\r\nng up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up=\r\n to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises=\r\n, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral=\r\n beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This ha=\r\ns been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\r\n--1844268657-445267141-1382987665=:71900\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:He=\r\nlveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dear Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: r=\r\ngb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16.363636016845703px; font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;=\r\nHelvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; background-=\r\ncolor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Could you please provide the sourc=\r\ne (book or teacher) of this information?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rg=\r\nb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16.363636016845703px; font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;H=\r\nelvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; background-c=\r\nolor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(=\r\n0, 0, 0); font-size: 16.363636016845703px; font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Hel=\r\nvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; background-col=\r\nor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Thanks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yahoo_quot=\r\ned&quot;\n style=3D&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Helvet=\r\nicaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; f=\r\nont-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue=\r\n&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div d=\r\nir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; On Monday, October 28, 2013 1:=\r\n00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;  &lt;div class=3D&quot;y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2162938695&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2162938695ygrp-mlmsg&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2162938695ygrp-msg&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv2162938695ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0=\r\n, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: &#39;times new roma=\r\nn&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Ajit,&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;ti=\r\nmes new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; fo=\r\nnt-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;colo=\r\nr: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york=\r\n&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;If the body and mind get dissolved upon death, then where do=\r\nes karma \nattach?&gt;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(=\r\n0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, time=\r\ns, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt; If the soul =\r\ncan recall, doesn&#39;t this soul now have some sort of a\n body and/or mind?

This process is taken care of by Nature&#39;s\n laws. These two - desire =\r\nand need - are slightly different. At the moment of death the soul has a sp=\r\necific ability to internalize and project what it needs/wants to experience=\r\n in the next birth. That gets set firmly. That counts as a desire of the so=\r\nul. And the basic reaction process of actions performed is the need or the =\r\nconsequence to be faced in order that the egosense can learn to be more res=\r\nponsible in its actions.. And, here is the catch in the theory of Karma tha=\r\nt I believe in, the reaction process again is exact and divided into a reac=\r\ntion to the body or to the mind or to the life based on the instrument whic=\r\nh was used to perform/engage in a specific karma. Now since our ego-sense w=\r\nill identify with these to hold them together, so the egosense will experie=\r\nnce the reaction. We mostly live from our egosense. But soul is hardly the =\r\nego. It lies much much deeper. Now assuming suddenly that the individual in=\r\n the next birth has a total spiritual\n transformation and is able to manife=\r\nst the soul and live life from it, the reactions may not come or if they do=\r\n may be highly reduced in nature such as not to be of any real consequences=\r\n. When the soul starts governing an individual instead of his/her egosense,=\r\n Nature laws for such an individual becomes different from others. &lt;br clea=\r\nr=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-f=\r\namily: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: trans=\r\nparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: =\r\nrgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, =\r\ntimes, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;In anothe=\r\nr model of reality, it is the karana sharir will hold the seeds of the karm=\r\na. which is never destroyed. But the karana sharir is very different from t=\r\nhe normal mind or life or body. It is more like a super subtle background p=\r\nrocess in all individuals. To be able\n to reach consciousness the karana sh=\r\narir,\n is a very very high spiritual achievement. Our karmas are mostly and=\r\n almost always in the realm of body, life and mind. Karana is way beyond th=\r\nis. A typal repository of various things. It is infact only when a person c=\r\nan experience the karana sharir that he/she can really enter into the realm=\r\n of the Great Gods. They are Beings of this karana jagat, typal and fixed i=\r\nn essence, never changing, like the individual karana sharir. Now one can l=\r\nogically ask, so if the karana sharir is recording karma, is it not getting=\r\n fatter? This is a problem of our logical mind which may not hold true in t=\r\nhat realm. If&nbsp; we keep adding jugs of water to the ocean, will it over=\r\nflow? No. This is quite beyond the normal mind which is limited by its own =\r\nregimented logic.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0)=\r\n; font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif=\r\n; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br\n clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;time=\r\ns new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font=\r\n-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Each of the sharir is not only an individual&#39;s own but is =\r\nalso effectively and fluidly connected to the whole world of that realm. So=\r\n with the physical we interact and live in the physical world, with the suk=\r\nshma we interact and be a part of the sukshma jagat, same with the karan. O=\r\nnly difference being the depth, intensity and the nature of these three. Th=\r\ne Karana is very fixed and supremely subtle. Like a seed. While the sthula =\r\nis the maximum changeable of the three. Everything that is there in the sth=\r\nula jagat is born out of a seed from the karana. As such, nothing in the st=\r\nhula can go beyond the potentialities held by its most fundamental essence =\r\nthat lies in the Karana. Hence great Yogis, those who can access this realm=\r\n at will, can know the most essential nature of a thing\n by experiencing wh=\r\nat a thing is in its deepest essence in\n this Karana jagat, and thus get to=\r\n know all its possibilities without ever trying to explore them in the phys=\r\nical realm or the subtle realm.
