I received=\r\n your private email (I hope you don&#39;t mind that I&#39;m replying here, so that =\r\nit&#39;s clear to everyone that all misunderstandings have been resolved).\n\nThe=\r\nre is no need at all to apologise. It was just a misunderstanding that coul=\r\nd happen to any of us. I apologise to you and other respected members if my=\r\n strong language to God was offensive....I can understand that it may have =\r\ncome across that way. Durga is lucky that she has a daughter like to you de=\r\nfend her! :) On a more serious note, I speak freely to Durga as my spiritua=\r\nl mentor...sometimes lovingly, sometimes with irritation/anger- but ultimat=\r\nely I love her really (though the love is not yet perfect). \n\nHere is a lin=\r\nk to a blog containing some quotes by Ramakrishna. He says &quot;direct the six =\r\npassions to God&quot;. I&#39;m a beginner on the path and can&#39;t stop bad emotions fr=\r\nom arising. But when they arise, I give them back to the Divine from where =\r\nthey came. All good and bad things come from God, and belong to God not me.=\r\n I try my best to control anger etc, but if it arises, I just offer it to G=\r\nod. Also, japa helps a lot. I find I get less angry now compared to before =\r\nthough there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\nhttp://jnanagni.com/quotes/=\r\nramakrishna-paramahamsa/\n\nAs we are all apologising, I was to apologise sin=\r\ncerely to Mr Nobody ji for being rude. His excellent advice to repeat God&#39;s=\r\n name constantly made me feel guilty because I&#39;m so useless at following it=\r\n. I know I should but I don&#39;t repeat it enough. I will set a timer and repe=\r\nat His Name at least once on the hour every hour (aside from my sit down pr=\r\nactice). I will do extra japa thanks to you Nobody ji, hope Durga showers h=\r\ner choicest blessings on you (you seem to be pretty lovesick for God, lucky=\r\n man).\n\nOk, I feel the air is clear. Hope everyone has a nice day. I am run=\r\nning to work now. Many thanks to the kind members who have written to me on=\r\n tantra. I will read in detail and look forward to replying when I get home=\r\n.\n\nWarm regards to all,\n\nAparna\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prm=\r\n7782&quot; &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear respected members,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Owing to hea=\r\nlth reasons I have been having some anger management issues going on. Coupl=\r\ne of my recent posts must have reflected my behavior. I realized my mistake=\r\n then and was really looking for an opportunity to apologize. Many thanks U=\r\ntpal ji,your mail made me realize that, this is the right time to do so. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Hence with all my humility I apologize  to all those whom I have hurt-e=\r\nd so far. Without an apology I won&#39;t be able to look at my god in his eyes.=\r\n Thanks all for being so patient and understanding and never letting your h=\r\nurt-ed feelings out. \n&gt; \n&gt; I have tried meditation, long morning walks but =\r\nmind still feels restless. I am going to join yoga classes to see if that w=\r\norks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having said that now I can finally relax and concentrate on my e=\r\nvening prayers without any guilt, \n&gt; \n&gt; Many thanks and regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Priya=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
