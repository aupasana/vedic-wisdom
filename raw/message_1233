I&#39;ve seen Scholars (Who are \nhaving knowledge of Jyot=\r\nisha as well as Sankrita) debating endlessly \non a particular verse . one o=\r\nr two lines or sometimes even a couple \nof words in a verse seems to create=\r\n great confusions. we have seen \nthat different scholars tend to interpret =\r\nand derive different \nmeaning from a same verse. i took the example of jyot=\r\nish classics \nbecause we are more familiar with controversies in that area.=\r\n\n\nThis confusion is also applicable in other literature of Sanskrit \nlangua=\r\nge.\n\nWhy Sanskrit (Held as the finest language and mother of all the \nother=\r\n language - One Arabic language teacher recently made a bold \ncomment that =\r\nbasis of Arabic language is sanskrit) should create so \nmuch confusions amo=\r\nng the scholars. is it that ambiguous or the \nwriters didn&#39;t wrote in a clu=\r\ntter-less fashion or the current \ngeneration is not sharp enough to grasp t=\r\nhe right meaning. Whatever \nmay be the case, why a verse should fail to giv=\r\ne one a simple \nundisputable meaning at least literally like in our modern =\r\nlanguages?\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n"}}
