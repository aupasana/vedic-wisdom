What you ca=\r\nll \n&gt; first stage is dominated by tamas, with some rajas too. What you call=\r\n \n&gt; the second stage is dominated by rajas, with some tamas too. What you \n=\r\n&gt; call the third stage is dominated by satta, with some rajas too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns can be further broken down as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Mostly tamas: Does not th=\r\nink about spiritual sadhana or progress. \n&gt; May fear god and go to temple o=\r\nr see/do poojas now and then.\n&gt; (2) Mostly tamas, with some rajas: Engages =\r\nin some sadhana. But the \n&gt; ignorance and attachments bring fears, worries,=\r\n anxieties, doubts etc. \n&gt; As tamas reduces and rajas increases, doubts and=\r\n fears are allayed to \n&gt; some extent, some direction is found and there is =\r\nmore focused effort.\n&gt; (3) Mostly rajas, some tamas: Engages in a lot of sa=\r\ndhana, but still has \n&gt; some misconceptions and doubts in mind. As tamas re=\r\nduces, doubts and \n&gt; misconceptions reduce.\n&gt; (4) Mostly rajas, some sattwa=\r\n: Engages in a lot of sadhana and focus and \n&gt; clarity of thinking starts t=\r\no set in. As sattwa increases, one&#39;s \n&gt; thinking, vision and focus become c=\r\nlearer.\n&gt; (5) Mostly sattwa, some rajas: Weaknesses that troubled earlier s=\r\ntart to \n&gt; trouble less and there is mental clarity. There is still some pa=\r\nssion, \n&gt; attachment and resultant internal stress (i.e. resisting divine w=\r\nill or \n&gt; the fruits of previous karmas), which reduces as rajas reduces.\n&gt;=\r\n (6) Mostly sattwa: Clear vision, nice focus of mind in sadhana, very \n&gt; go=\r\nod acceptance of divine will (fruits of previous karmas) and flowing \n&gt; wit=\r\nh the divine rhythm.\n&gt; \n&gt; There can be several other abstractions to look a=\r\nt stages in sadhana. \n&gt; Vasishtha describes some in Yoga Vaasishtham.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One important thing to note is that sadhana and sp=\r\niritual progress are \n&gt; not something to flaunt. If one is in stage 2 or 3,=\r\n it is nothing to be \n&gt; ashamed of and one need not pretend otherwise. The =\r\nmost important thing \n&gt; is to be honest internally. If there are doubts and=\r\n anxieties, there is \n&gt; no point in suppressing them. They should be addres=\r\nsed in the earnest. A \n&gt; proper and natural evolution of understanding come=\r\ns with time to \n&gt; everyone. Pretensions of being someone one is not and for=\r\nceful \n&gt; suppression of misunderstandings does not help in the long run.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Secondly, one need not spend a fixed amount of time in each stage. Some =\r\n\n&gt; people make fast progress and some people take more time. If God wills, =\r\n\n&gt; one can become liberated in a second. So don&#39;t worry wherever you are in=\r\n \n&gt; terms of these &quot;stages&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, what you sa=\r\ny of &quot;external experiences&quot; applies to &quot;internal \n&gt; experiences&quot; as well. A=\r\nfter all, mind (especially an imaginative one) is \n&gt; capable of &quot;manufactur=\r\ning&quot; over time whatever it fancies. Some \n&gt; experiences can be hallucinatio=\r\nns. Even when not, they can reinforce \n&gt; some unneeded conditioning. I am n=\r\not just talking about beginners, but \n&gt; even highly evolved sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFor example, there have been several elevated yogis claiming to be the \n&gt; r=\r\neincarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may all have genuinely \n&gt; be=\r\nlieved it and not trying to deceive anyone. If one&#39;s mind nurtured a \n&gt; sec=\r\nret desire to be somebody important and if one likes Ramakrishna, it \n&gt; is =\r\npossible to experience an internal vision suggesting that one is a \n&gt; reinc=\r\narnation of Ramakrishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me give a subtler example. I was once dis=\r\ncussing the meaning of \n&gt; &quot;Mantra Pushpam&quot; here (see \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7015). A learned yogi \n&gt; wrote to me that i=\r\nt was about denser elements dissolving in lighter \n&gt; elements as Kundalini =\r\nascends and denser elements coming back from \n&gt; lighter elements as Kundali=\r\nni descends. When I pointed out weaknesses in \n&gt; that interpretation, he to=\r\nld me that that was the *vision* (internal \n&gt; experience) he got when he me=\r\nditated with it. However, that absolutely \n&gt; does not add up. What is descr=\r\nibed in Mantra Pushpam is not chain of X \n&gt; merging in Y, Y merging in Z, e=\r\ntc. Moreover, all elements are not \n&gt; covered. Moreover, water is common, i=\r\n.e. X lies in water, water lies in \n&gt; X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, =\r\nand so on. That is different from \n&gt; dissolution and creation of elements a=\r\ns happens when Kundalini ascends \n&gt; and descends.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I can belie=\r\nve that that yogi may have indeed gotten the vision \n&gt; as he claimed. When =\r\none looks at a verse (or any other notion or idea), \n&gt; one&#39;s rational mind =\r\nmay consciously or sub-consciously come up with an \n&gt; intellectual understa=\r\nnding. If an imaginative and focused mind meditates \n&gt; then, it may indeed =\r\nexperience a corresponding vision! It is all a play \n&gt; of mind and of no si=\r\ngnificance. Not every internal experience of even an \n&gt; elevated yogi who g=\r\nenuinely experienced aspects of divine (but not yet \n&gt; liberated) may mean =\r\nsomething.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing which internal experience is a result of some condi=\r\ntioning, some \n&gt; desire or some rational/emotional notion still present in =\r\nthe mind, is \n&gt; not easy, even for good and sincere sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; External and internal experiences cannot be avoided as one=\r\n does sadhana. \n&gt; Depending on one&#39;s conditioning, one may experience many =\r\nthings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether an experience is external or internal is not IMHO the =\r\nmain \n&gt; thing. Both can be useful in some cases and increase faith and \n&gt; c=\r\nonfidence or give clarity of thinking, and trigger positive internal \n&gt; tra=\r\nnsformation. Both can be detrimental in some cases and increase pride \n&gt; or=\r\n reinforce some wrong notions, and delay positive internal \n&gt; transformatio=\r\nn or even trigger negative internal transformation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vasishtha&#39;s guidan=\r\nce is very clear. Neither seek nor avoid experiences \n&gt; (which are like roa=\r\ndside trees as one travels on a hilly road to the top \n&gt; of the hill). Keep=\r\n the mind focused on sadhana to the best of your \n&gt; ability.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though I =\r\nsaid it before, I will say this again, because it is worth \n&gt; saying many t=\r\nimes:\n&gt; \n&gt; The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and the only \n=\r\n&gt; experience worth longing is the internal experience of detachment. If \n&gt; =\r\none experiences less stress in situations that would&#39;ve stressed one \n&gt; bef=\r\nore, if one experiences less anger in situations that would&#39;ve \n&gt; angered o=\r\nne before, if one experiences less lust in situations that \n&gt; would&#39;ve made=\r\n one lusty before, if one experiences less jealosy in \n&gt; situations that wo=\r\nuld&#39;ve made one jealous before, and so on, then one is \n&gt; making progress.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @=\r\nhomam108\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, May 10, 2012 at 2:57 PM, rajarshi14 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Three s=\r\ntages of sadhana, as I see it. Purely my own observations. Not \n&gt; points of=\r\n debate. Everyone is free to disagree.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1st stage of Sadhana: Try out s=\r\ncoops of everything, hanging on to \n&gt; solicited or unsolicited advice from =\r\nanywhere and everwhere, and \n&gt; eventually moving in confused circles, feeli=\r\nng proud and happy about the \n&gt; fact that, yes I am doing something called =\r\nsadhana while many others are \n&gt; not. The mind lies in the communal stage (=\r\ncommunal =3D anyone one who \n&gt; mentally identifies to a community not neces=\r\nsarily in a religious \n&gt; sense), trying to find a community of similar mind=\r\ned individuals and \n&gt; hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to defi=\r\nne itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of &quot;experiences&quot; =\r\nin an \n&gt; external format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhan=\r\na and \n&gt; either feels happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of =\r\nthese \n&gt; so called external &quot;experiences&quot; are consistent or even replicable=\r\n at \n&gt; will. Doubts start creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and=\r\n \n&gt; some fall back to stage 1 described above.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3rd stage: One realizes=\r\n the absolute futility of the external \n&gt; experiences compared to what is h=\r\nappening inside, if at all anything is \n&gt; happening. Until a transformation=\r\n process triggers inside the mind, all \n&gt; of it is meaningless. The externa=\r\nl world may crack open and 33 millions \n&gt; deities may dance infornt, yet it=\r\n eventually counts for nothing if it is \n&gt; not able to still the &quot;monkey-mi=\r\nnd&quot; and make the sadhaka enjoy a \n&gt; concentrated feeling of internal joy. T=\r\nhis joy will overflow into other \n&gt; secular activities and thoughts, it&#39;s s=\r\no powerful and dynamic in nature. \n&gt; One who is firmly established in this =\r\nstage, will never bother too much \n&gt; about the external ritual, its source,=\r\n its accuracy etc. He/she does not \n&gt; shun external rituals, but he/she rea=\r\nlizes that the real barometer for \n&gt; judging the efficacy of a sadhana is i=\r\nnside the mind and heart. This is \n&gt; the beginning of the &quot;alone&quot; phase. Al=\r\none, but not lonely. In loneliness \n&gt; one craves for external validation, i=\r\nn being alone one needs no \n&gt; validation apart from his/her own joy.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\ns such, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy \n&gt; inf=\r\normation he/she will try to extract is what has the other person \n&gt; experie=\r\nnced internally, and be least bothered about what path he/she \n&gt; walks and =\r\nwhich deity he/she is trying to worship. Fancy names and \n&gt; theoretical cla=\r\nssifications do not impress him/her anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt;  From here starts the rea=\r\nl journey. Before that, stage 1 and stage 2 is \n&gt; like a kindergarten attit=\r\nude. So each sadhaka must ask himself/herself \n&gt; objective, where does he/s=\r\nhe stand and where is he/she headed!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
