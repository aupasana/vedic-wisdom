I seek your\n&gt; &gt; clarification on this p=\r\noint:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) The rahasyas of Chandipath describes the Sarvasya Aadyaa (t=\r\nhe &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Original Root of All) form of Mahalakshmi and also the 3 derived f=\r\norms &gt;\n&gt; &gt; of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati (the two Mahalakshmi =\r\nforms &gt;\n&gt; &gt; are different!).

It does not specifically describe the form of &quot;Chandi&quot;.&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2) The=\r\n real form of deities is energy, that can manifest within one&#39;s &gt;\n&gt; &gt; own c=\r\nonsciousness.&gt; &gt; (3) Lalita is a gentle form as the name implies.\n&gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner, some of her &gt; names describe a fierce form. Similarly, some of\n&gt; &gt; the =\r\nnames of a fierce &gt; deity may describe a gentle form. Bottomline is\n&gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt different deities &gt; describe different energy forms and several\n&gt; &gt; other=\r\n enegy forms can be &gt; *derived* from that energy. Energy is\n&gt; &gt; convertible=\r\n.&gt; &gt; For example, you can generate electric energy or\n&gt; &gt; magnetic energy o=\r\nr &gt; mechanical kinetic energy from nuclear energy from\n&gt; &gt; a big nuclear fu=\r\nsion. &gt; If 1000 names of the nuclear fusion describe it\n&gt; &gt; in one name as =\r\nenergy &gt; that lights up a house or a town, don&#39;t think it\n&gt; &gt; is a gentle f=\r\norm. It &gt; can support that gentle aspect too, but it is a\n&gt; &gt; very fierce f=\r\norm. If you &gt; really see that energy in its raw form, you\n&gt; &gt; will see that=\r\n nuclear fusion &gt; is certainly not gentle.&gt; &gt; One who\n&gt; &gt; experienced the e=\r\nnergy of a supposed fierce deity as being &gt; gentle or\n&gt; &gt; vice versa hasn&#39;t=\r\n experienced that deity in the complete form &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; experienced only a s=\r\nmall derived aspect of that deity.&gt; &gt; (4) Though I\n&gt; &gt; say that the real fo=\r\nrm of deities is energy, the &gt; iconography IS very\n&gt; &gt; important and holds =\r\nkeys. However, some keys of some &gt; particularly\n&gt; &gt; powerful siddha mantras=\r\n are intentionally misplaced by &gt; rishis.&gt; &gt; For\n&gt; &gt; example, I know someon=\r\ne who was doing sadhana of a higher deity. He &gt;\n&gt; &gt; was imagining her in a =\r\nform using a popular dhyana shloka. This popular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dhyana shloka for th=\r\nat mantra - which is known to be a siddha mantra -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; matches the imager=\r\ny created by some key words in the mantra. He was &gt;\n&gt; &gt; doing the sadhana s=\r\nincerely, but never formed a connection to the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or experienced =\r\nanything. After a few weeks, his guru/mentor gave him a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different dhy=\r\nana shloka of the same deity composed by a great yogi of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; past, which =\r\nis not typically used with that particular mantra, because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some words=\r\n in the mantra suggest a different imagery. This sadhaka &gt;\n&gt; &gt; switched to =\r\nit. He started visualizing the deity differently. Though &gt;\n&gt; &gt; this visuali=\r\nzation was contrary to the words in the mantra, this &gt;\n&gt; &gt; actually worked.=\r\n It made a big difference. The person started to &gt;\n&gt; &gt; experience some thin=\r\ngs internally and understood the essence of the &gt;\n&gt; &gt; mantra in a flash. No=\r\nw, the true meaning of the mantra became crystal &gt;\n&gt; &gt; clear through an int=\r\nernal experience.&gt; &gt; The final understanding was\n&gt; &gt; internal, philosophica=\r\nl and based on subtle &gt; play of different cosmic\n&gt; &gt; energies. But, that be=\r\nautiful understanding was &gt; triggered ONLY AFTER a\n&gt; &gt; specific physical fo=\r\nrm was imagined by the mind.&gt; &gt; Some powerful\n&gt; &gt; mantras do have a specifi=\r\nc physical form associated with &gt; them and you\n&gt; &gt; will be kind of lost wit=\r\nhout knowing that form or &gt; corresponding\n&gt; &gt; dhyana.&gt; &gt; (5) BTW, having sa=\r\nid the above, I need to make one important\n&gt; &gt; point.&gt; &gt; It is foolish to g=\r\no around asking people and gurus to give you\n&gt; &gt; the right &gt; mantra or dhya=\r\nna of this or that mantra. Until you are pure\n&gt; &gt; enough and &gt; prepared, no=\r\n real yogi will ever give you the keys to\n&gt; &gt; anything really &gt; siddha, i.e=\r\n. powerful and potent enough to work\n&gt; &gt; quickly.
