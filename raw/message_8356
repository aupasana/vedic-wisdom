Wish getting Darshan was so easy!\n\nNo =\r\nno I don&#39;t hate Durga. She and Hari are my two favourite forms of the Divin=\r\ne. I&#39;m even named after her, how can I hate her! But I wish I could live up=\r\n to my name- Parvati as Aparna did a great tapas- but my tapas is not quite=\r\n up to the mark. That&#39;s why I&#39;m pissed off with her.\n\nThere is a generation=\r\nal gap or some gap that has caused this misunderstanding- I&#39;m 29 and belong=\r\n to this shocking generation of children who are not as polite to their par=\r\nents and elders as they should be. This lack of politeness (sometimes) exte=\r\nnds to the divine parents also. \n\nThanks for the kind words Utpal ji, it&#39;s =\r\nmuch appreciated. I wish you speedy attainment of your Ishta. And you too P=\r\nriya ji and others. :)\n\nRegards,\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste My dear friend,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Listening alone to the song which i heard for the first time....tears ar=\r\ne flowing in torrent and i cried like a child who is looking for his mother=\r\n lost in a mela.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its looks dramatic but its naturally true for the per=\r\nson who has Chanda in Rohini in Pushkara bhaga.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna ji...K=\r\noi baat nahi...Damn Durga...But develop that disgust to the level of tremen=\r\ndous hatred towards Jagadamba so that, that becomes the Mantra which your h=\r\neart, mind and soul can not live without for a second.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is my deep c=\r\nonviction that Hatred is as much intense as love...probably even a bit more=\r\n. because once you hate somebody, you cant take out that person from you mi=\r\nnd easily...It is ruinous if it is for anything else then Divine.

The gentle man who liked God thought that It is ver=\r\ny heavy rain and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn&#39;t go to temp=\r\nle on that morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though co=\r\nuld not stop himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water v=\r\nery pain-stakingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job o=\r\nf abusing the deity.\n&gt; \n&gt; The lord became very pleased with him and gave hi=\r\nm Darshana.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you.

It becomes a play, a play of that=\r\n only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; understand.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A little point about lo=\r\nve these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; &gt; the sun, was doing hom=\r\nam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; open field with no shad=\r\ne, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusely=\r\n as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; sweat coming into his e=\r\nyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that yo=\r\nu are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and aske=\r\nd himself,\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away th=\r\nis very\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with=\r\n sweat.\n&gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming o=\r\nut to\n&gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him a=\r\nway, we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to a=\r\nll that\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave hi=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say ba=\r\nck\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to=\r\n 48.\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs=\r\n of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its m=\r\nere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives an=\r\nd gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads =\r\nto oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proo=\r\nf. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, n=\r\no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves=\r\n us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t gi=\r\nve one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; I am talking about=\r\n people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a few=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favora=\r\nbly,\n&gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t=\r\n give\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;=\r\nll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlove with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nctually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; do=\r\nn&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; Well,=\r\n he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; mother =\r\nwill decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; bata-oo=\r\nn ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; chahiy=\r\ne, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; quite a l=\r\not of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that y=\r\nou are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; You love then claim that so=\r\nmebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to =\r\nget. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for =\r\nher, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwe=\r\nd, because I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that=\r\n, and when did i become big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh to=\r\nh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; should be so intense=\r\n, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;,=\r\n and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, des=\r\nerve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is even=\r\ntually her.\n&gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, =\r\nhow can then\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhe=\r\nnge. If you\n&gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. Tha=\r\nt doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I n=\r\need to do,\n&gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki na=\r\nukri kari\n&gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if the=\r\n results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are go=\r\nd&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you w=\r\non&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful=\r\n life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet h=\r\nouse, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greates=\r\nt, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog=\r\n will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is de=\r\nvotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or m=\r\nutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t b=\r\nring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants ma=\r\nster, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master w=\r\nith god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master=\r\n brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya =\r\npaneer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai=\r\n kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t=\r\n want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; then we claim t=\r\no others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

I=\r\nt becomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; understand.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who is in love=\r\n with\n&gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, i=\r\nn an\n&gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrade=\r\ns and\n&gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated with=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do yo=\r\nu want\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; The man looked dow=\r\nn in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in su=\r\nmmers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is=\r\n trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in t=\r\nhe winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we a=\r\nbuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is =\r\nthis my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to h=\r\nide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologiz=\r\ned profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is th=\r\ne sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter w=\r\nhat.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; mag=\r\nnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; there=\r\n is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; brea=\r\nthing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; exist=\r\n, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; Hell, he bur=\r\nns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yet wh=\r\nat do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; births =\r\ncombined.\n&gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this worship busines=\r\ns. And\n&gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a gir=\r\nl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for t=\r\nhat man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!=\r\n!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I=\r\n know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has neve=\r\nr spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence=\r\n, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know t=\r\nhese characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his=\r\n chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t yo=\r\nu ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorak=\r\nhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri ky=\r\na aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye=\r\n, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is fa=\r\nr more insane than\n&gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Then he w=\r\nent on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; love????=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n slap!!\n&gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask =\r\nfrom God\n&gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. T=\r\nhe moment\n&gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but=\r\n then\n&gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to know =\r\nwhats\n&gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather =\r\nmy love\n&gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come and tell me =\r\n&quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells=\r\n me first\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already=\r\n have that\n&gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; To top it all he says since=\r\n he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; he say anything to his god=\r\n? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it s=\r\nhould be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warm=\r\ning it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun=\r\n bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Surrender =\r\nis you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the=\r\n results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; If you act=\r\nually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; counselor=\r\n, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; in a jh=\r\nuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One =\r\nof the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; alway=\r\ns maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; whe=\r\nn he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; mas=\r\nter , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; dogg=\r\ny is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; doggy =\r\nis happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Equ=\r\nate doggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; We are =\r\nnever happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; expecting butt=\r\ner chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero,=\r\n phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal =\r\nbolo)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want t=\r\nhe food, and\n&gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I =\r\nonly want him,\n&gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so sh=\r\nit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOU=\r\nSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, th=\r\nat chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want=\r\n the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs d=\r\no, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we=\r\n too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an=\r\n illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then y=\r\nou walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will =\r\nsalute you.
