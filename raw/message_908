Its quick !\nI have some questions though:\n\n1) I=\r\n see that mahaganpati homam has tarpanam (offering water towards \nthe end o=\r\nf homa) but in krishna and laxmi homam manual I could not \nfind that. Is it=\r\n supposed to be like this ?\n\n2) Is vaushat is necessary only if we are swit=\r\nching mantra ? If we \nchant ganapati atharva shirsha 8 times at last of all=\r\n the ganesh \nmantra, so at the 8rth time do we have to say vaushat instead =\r\nof \nswaha at the end of every verse ?\n\n3) I do homa with ghee mainly. Can w=\r\ne offer flower petal (single \npetal) when we say svaha. what does offering =\r\nof flower signify like \nu said murmura for finance amd white sesame for spi=\r\nrituality. Can we \noffer fruits also as offering in main mantra ?\n\n4) if i =\r\nsay a particular mantra 10 times can i do 2-2 offering like \n2 with ghee, 2=\r\n with flower etc ?\n\n4) I use small homa kund, only 4.5 &quot; to 4.5 &quot;. Is it fi=\r\nne ?\n\n5) Please post homam for Vishnu and Shiva also.\n\nThanks very much for=\r\n these homam procedures.\nReagards.\n\n\n"}}
