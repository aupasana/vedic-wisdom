They have helped me =\r\na lot on the query. Actually, I recently visited few (not to name any but a=\r\nlso including 1 or 2 from your list) places with my parents. But, my experi=\r\nence was really bad. I could see lot of commercialism and greed invloved am=\r\nongst everyone there including those in position over there. And spirituali=\r\nsm was difficult to find. I could feel spiritual vibes more outside (slight=\r\nly away from the main building and crows) the temples than inside. And to m=\r\ny believe, these places would not have been like this always. So, I kept wo=\r\nndering, that if these famous and energised idols have the power to raise t=\r\nhe spiritual energies, then why did &quot;locals&quot; who have always been here, are=\r\n getting corrupted. But, then probably the tamas energies of people coming =\r\nday in and out have overpowered or as you say visitors have made the incens=\r\ne disappear over the period of time.\n\nI have one experience to share, which=\r\n is somewhat on similar lines. I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certa=\r\nin &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking bath, they started looking for a cow to feed as=\r\n per the custom. Fortunately or unfortunately, we could found a few (around=\r\n 10) sitting at a certain place. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd=\r\n people trying to feed them. And per my estimate a 10000 people would have =\r\nalready fed them per their &quot;Custom&quot;. Now, does it really make sense to forc=\r\nibly feed a cow who already had her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her=\r\n to have digestion or food poisoning problems. I tried to convince my paren=\r\nts not to try to feed the, but could not succeed. And the whole day felt ba=\r\nd about it.\n\nIn general, whatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly =\r\nfound it spiritual enough and have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I alwa=\r\nys happen to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that t=\r\no keep whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these=\r\n places. As they are highly filled with Tamas now.\n\nBest Regards,\nSriram\n\n-=\r\n-- On Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Na=\r\nrasimha P.V.R.

At \nthe same time, =\r\nsome not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine \npresence.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nI was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple \nin Mayapur (ISKCO=\r\nN head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and \nArunachalam hills in =\r\nTiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a \ntremendous amount of =\r\nspiritual energy in those places. There are several temples \nwhere the idol=\r\n is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after \nRamakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did \nnot get the=\r\n same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in \nCalcutta.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThere was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was \ntaken to by a p=\r\nriest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu \nbefore we =\r\ndid the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that \ntempl=\r\ne before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form of \nt=\r\nhe divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not=\r\n \nunderstand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my=\r\n eyes \nand started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was da=\r\nzzled by a \nvision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays lik=\r\ne Sun. I felt \nthat there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I d=\r\no not remember the \nname of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple wi=\r\nthout roof over the \ngoddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a f=\r\new times, but the roof \ncame down in a fire accident each time and they fin=\r\nally decided that the goddess \nlikes open air and no roof. Though we spent =\r\nonly 5 min and left in a hurry, I \nwas very pleased with that temple. Someo=\r\nne from Tamil Nadu probably knows the \nname of the temple and goddess.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nLike this, I am sure there are many temples with a \npowerful divine pre=\r\nsence across India.\n=C2=A0\nApart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, on=\r\ne \nof my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple=\r\n at \nAalandi near Pune.

But some temples are \nreally good.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nIf one has a chance to spend a few months doing \nspiritual sadhana =\r\nnear a temple, I suggest the following:\n=C2=A0\nMayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri=\r\n and Kamakhya in east \nIndia, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=\r\n=C2=A0and \nNarayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi,=\r\n Aalandi, \nDwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Vara=\r\nnasi, Vrindavan \nand Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralaya=\r\nm=C2=A0and Ujjain in \ncentral India.\n=C2=A0\nThere are many other good place=\r\ns, but the above \ncome to my mind.

These western countries are so filled with \nrajas and t=\r\namas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of \nsattwa th=\r\nere. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my \nvi=\r\new is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are \n=\r\nreally good.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;If one has a chance to spend a=\r\n few months doing \nspiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following=\r\n:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya=\r\n in east \nIndia, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)&nbsp;and \nNa=\r\nrayana&nbsp;vanam (near Tirupati)&nbsp;in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, \nDw=\r\naraka&nbsp;and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindav=\r\nan \nand Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam&nbsp;and Uj=\r\njain in \ncentral India.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;There are many othe=\r\nr good places, but the above \ncome to my mind. Visiting a temple once is on=\r\ne thing and staying there for \nseveral months while maintaining a simple li=\r\nfestyle and doing a spiritual \nsadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite=\r\n another.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;
