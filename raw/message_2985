While returning from the cowshed, Bhagavan remarked t=\r\no the people\nfollowing him,=93Look at those people. See what they are doing=\r\n. They\nconcentrate their mind on that sort of work. What to do? Let them ca=\r\nrry on.\nBe careful not to step on the drawings. Why should we step on them =\r\nwhen they\nare doing it with such great devotion?=94 So saying, he walked ca=\r\nrefully\nwithout disturbing the designs and sat in the hall.\n\nImmediately af=\r\nter that, Bhagavan noticed an old lady of the Ashram carefully\ndrawing desi=\r\ngns with dry lime powder on the floor below the steps opposite\nto the hall.=\r\n\n\nBhagavan called her by the familiar name, Granny, and when she came with\n=\r\ngreat expectations, he said, =93Look here,Granny. You are taking so much\ntr=\r\nouble for decorating the floor with that powder, but is it rice flour?=94\nW=\r\nhen she replied that it was powdered lime only, Bhagavan said, =93What a\npi=\r\nty! It will not be useful even for the ants. The ladies there are also\ndoin=\r\ng the same thing. It is mere waste of time.\n\nTheir work is of no use whatso=\r\never. The paste they are using is made of rice\ndough which sticks to the gr=\r\nound and so the ants cannot eat it. Decorating\nthe floor really means feedi=\r\nng the ants. If that dharma is given up and\npowdered lime is used not only =\r\nthe ants cannot eat it but if, by\nmistake,they come anywhere near, they die=\r\n because of the strong pungent\nsmell. Why all that? Please add at least som=\r\ne rice flour to it.=94\n\nAn Andhra gentleman enquired, =93Is it for feeding =\r\nthe ants that in the\ndhanurmasa, i.e., in the month of December- January, t=\r\nhat floors are\ndecorated with rice powder?=94\n\n=93Yes, of course!=94 said B=\r\nhagavan. =93Out of their feelings of happiness and joy\nat the receipt of th=\r\ne fresh crop of rice, they decorate the floor with rice\npowder thus feeding=\r\n the ants.Practices laid down by elders are always based\non kindness to liv=\r\ning creatures.
