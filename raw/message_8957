Very interesting.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n This reminds me of an incident with a good friend of mine. There is an\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; individual I know, who had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He used to feel, as per his own confession, no special love or attrac=\r\ntion\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin family, there was=\r\n no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introduced to th=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One day while meditating on some Tantrik mantras,=\r\n he got a random\n&gt; &gt;&gt; inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had=\r\n a vague idea of what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of =\r\ncorrect swara or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and soun=\r\ndlessly, the Savitur\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of t=\r\nhe mantra, he felt/saw -\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and I describe it as he told me - an unbroken=\r\n steam of tremendous, pure,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; flood of Golden Light above his head. Like=\r\n a world above and outside our\n&gt; &gt;&gt; world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine=\r\n. The eventual idea, he told me, was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to enter into that stream of Ligh=\r\nt above and see things from that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective. But as long as there are=\r\n impurities in the mind and body, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is not possible to enter into tha=\r\nt realm easily. The gunas must be in a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stable equilibrium. Neither the=\r\n laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rajas is conducive for it, b=\r\nut the stable, illuminating, self-assurance of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satwa leading to a deep=\r\ner equanimity in mind and life is needed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently, he also rea=\r\nlized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which serve a similar =\r\npurpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the spiritual pla=\r\nnes above.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; So I asked him why did you not continue the meditation=\r\n or japa of Gayatri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said=\r\n it would have pulled him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in and he would not have been able to contin=\r\nue the spiritual practices\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which he was already doing for some time, a=\r\nnd leaving something half way is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not good.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reading the =\r\nexplanation your provided below, that is :\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that=\r\n Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). =\r\nHe blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we would not be=\r\n able to distinguish different objects.

He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then gives 4 explanations / me=\r\nditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; narayana, (3) paramashiva =\r\nand (4) paramatma.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not attempting a literal or scholarly tra=\r\nnslation ... I&#39;ll try to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; summarize the main point, from a practical po=\r\nint of view. I&#39;ll start with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the first of the meditations, on Gayatri.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  ----\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The first meditation is the &quot;common&quot; understandi=\r\nng of the Gayatri mantra,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the Sun as the devata. This follows the=\r\n famous verse from the Agastya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Smriti -- &quot;yo devaH savitA  .asmAkam dh=\r\niyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of t=\r\nhe deva\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light o=\r\nf the sun,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy=\r\n to meditate\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upon.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whatever is experienced is easy to medita=\r\nte upon, and that which is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experienced can be difficult to meditat=\r\ne upon. Everyone can meditate upon\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the light of the Sun. This is why t=\r\nhis meaning for the Gayatri mantra is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; always taken first.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; va=\r\nreNyam =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through all karmas and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upaasa=\r\nnaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. &quot;Savitaa&quot; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fru=\r\nit of all karmas ... this is taught in the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; explanation follows, which is omitted here ].  We meditate upon the\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n splendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon that Sa=\r\nvitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). He =\r\nblesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we would not be ab=\r\nle to distinguish different objects. This is explained in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Aitatery=\r\na Upanishad &quot;The sun, having become eyesight, entered the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; eyes&quot;.
