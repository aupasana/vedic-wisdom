(Narayan&#39;s own inspiring =\r\nmessage in this regard can be read at http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic=\r\n- wisdom/message/ 727). After the manual was prepared, Narasimhaji emailed =\r\nthe first copy to Narayan. Such was Narayan&#39;s dedication that he started go=\r\ning through the manual over and over. A few days later I met Narayan and en=\r\nquired about the Homam manual and all. He very casually mentioned that he w=\r\nas doing the Homam mentally. I was dumbstruck. I said &quot;What?&quot;. He said he w=\r\nould perform the whole procedure as mentioned in the document, IN MIND.

I implemented Narayan&#39;s idea and =\r\ndid my homam mentally for those few days. It then helped me avoid that feel=\r\ning that I missed my homam.

I implemented Narayan&#39;s\n idea and did my homam mentally for =\r\nthose few days. It then helped me avoid that feeling that I missed my homam=\r\n. Though this process is not a replacement for the Homam with all the physi=\r\ncal materials, yet, it is a form of a prayer to God. Something is better th=\r\nan nothing.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Naliniji, She has=\r\n already decided when you would start the Homam, it&#39;s just that we have not=\r\n been informed yet. &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish y=\r\nou all the very best.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards&lt;BR&gt;Ravi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: tahoma, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, n=\r\new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR S=\r\nIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Jyotisa Shis=\r\nya &lt;achyutagaddi@ gmail.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;=\r\nTo:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEI=\r\nGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Tuesday, February 10, 2009 3:50:36 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regar=\r\nding Homam video and Narasimhaji - My Master&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-=\r\ntext&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: tahoma, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(255,102=\r\n,0)&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: large&quot; class=3DAppl=\r\ne-style-span&gt;|om|&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: tahoma=\r\n; COLOR: rgb(255,102,0)&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:=\r\n large&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;Dear Nalini, namaste&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: tahoma; COLOR: rgb(255,102,0)&quot; class=3DAppl=\r\ne-style-span&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(204,204,204) 1px solid&quot; class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;...thought I should probably start with Ganapati Homam and&nbs=\r\np;wondered if I also start Chandi homam...&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: tahoma; COLOR: rgb(255,102,0=\r\n)&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: large&quot; class=3DApple-=\r\nstyle-span&gt;{Hari} I also had similar thoughts like you but I think that sta=\r\nrting with Ganesha homam is better and then one can &#39;graduate&#39; to Chandi ho=\r\nmam.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: large&quot; class=3DApple-style-span=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: large&quot; class=3DApple-styl=\r\ne-span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(204,204,20=\r\n4) 1px solid&quot; class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: rgb(255,=\r\n255,255)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: verdana, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sadly, when I enquired loca=\r\nlly (New Zealand) at the Indian shops I could not find Homa Kundam...&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: tahoma; COLOR: rgb(255,10=\r\n2,0)&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: large&quot; class=3DApp=\r\nle-style-span&gt;{Hari} Why not try to purchase it from &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://redi=\r\nff.com/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;rediff.com&lt;/A&gt;?
