Regarding =\r\nKrishna and gopis:\n\nThe love of gopis for Krishna is not physical. Gopis we=\r\nre re-incarnations of blessed beings from higher lokas (realms of conscious=\r\nness) and were instinctively drawn to Krishna as they were aware that Krish=\r\nna was the perfected being. They had perfect surrender to the perfected bei=\r\nng and aspired for his company always.\n\nThe story of vastraapaharana (Krish=\r\nna stealing the clothes of gopis from the riverbank while they were bathing=\r\n in the river and forcing them to come out of the river without clothes) ex=\r\nplains complete surrender and has an esoteric meaning. The sensual overtone=\r\ns some may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect of the over=\r\nly sensualized society we live in.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me talk about the esoteric m=\r\neaning.\n\nGopi literally means the shakti that has control over the cows. Co=\r\nws and horses in RigVeda symbolize the jnanendriyas and karmendriyas respec=\r\ntively. After all, this is the meaning in &quot;Sri Sooktam&quot; also, where we enco=\r\nunter &quot;ashvadaayI ca godaayI&quot;, though that line has been superficially inte=\r\nrpreted by scholars as &quot;one who gives cows and horses&quot;. Extolling Sri Maha =\r\nLakshmi as the giver of two specific kinds of cattle would be too frivolous=\r\n for RigVeda, which represents the timeless and uncreated absolute knowledg=\r\ne rather than relative knowledge bound by space and time. The true meaning =\r\nis that our jnanendriyas and karmendriyas come into being and operate throu=\r\ngh the shakti of the Mother. Anyway, let us go back to gopis.\n\n* * *\n\nWithi=\r\nn us, gopis represent the control over the senses. Control of various kinds=\r\n over the senses will restrict the sense activity and safeguard one&#39;s purit=\r\ny. But, merely by controlling or restricting the senses, one cannot reach g=\r\nod or merge in god. The goal of the shaktis that represent control over sen=\r\nses is to merge in the Infinite. That is what the desire of gopis to be wit=\r\nh Krishna represents.\n\nClothes represent conditioning with gunas. Even as o=\r\nne controls/restricts sense activity, there may be pride about it and sever=\r\nal other types of conditioning that colors the control exerted over sense a=\r\nctivity. That is what the clothes of gopis represent! Gopis going to Krishn=\r\na without clothes represents pride and other conditioning being withdrawn f=\r\nrom one&#39;s control over senses, one&#39;s self-control becoming pure and devoid =\r\nof ANY conditioning and then merging in the Supreme.\n\nAs I said, the sensua=\r\nl overtones some may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect o=\r\nf the overly sensualized society we live in.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding all people b=\r\neing women and the Supreme being a man:\n\nThis is also an esotetic concept a=\r\nnd not physical or sensual in nature.\n\nIn this universe, masculine spirit r=\r\nepresents the potential energy and feminine spirit represents the kinetic e=\r\nnergy. Supreme Cosmic Being or Parama Purusha exists as the potentiality be=\r\nhind the entire universe. He is the potential energy. Shakti or the kinetic=\r\n energy that is running the show in this entire universe manifests in each =\r\nperson as his/her Kundalini shakti. It is through the Kundalini shakti that=\r\n one is aware of the universe and acts in it. One&#39;s awareness of the world =\r\nis colored by one&#39;s conditioning. As Kundalini shakti awakens, rises, purif=\r\nies herself and drops off all conditioning that colors one&#39;s self-awareness=\r\n, it will rise to sahasrara and has a union with Parama Purusha. Instead of=\r\n being aware of oneself as a limited object that perceives and interacts wi=\r\nth so many other objects, one then is absorbed in an awareness of the Supre=\r\nme Potentiality of the entire universe. Kundalini shakti (one&#39;s self-awaren=\r\ness) is symbolically represented\n as a female deity. She awakens (one start=\r\ns to search for true self), purifies herself, sheds her clothing (condition=\r\ning that colors one&#39;s self-awareness) and ultimately has a union with the s=\r\nupreme being in sahasrara.\n\nAll this is symbolic and esoteric in meaning. A=\r\nny sensuality one perceives in this depiction is simply due to the conditio=\r\nning of one&#39;s mind.\n\n* * *\n\n[Warning: Some raw and uninhibited language in =\r\nthe remainder of this mail MAY offend some sensitive and conservative reade=\r\nrs.]\n\n2. Regarding references to body parts:\n\nThere is nothing inherently &quot;=\r\ntitillating&quot; in a breast or other body parts. When a baby sees the breast, =\r\nfor example, the baby thinks of milk and nourishment. There are no other th=\r\noughts in the baby&#39;s mind!\n\nOur problems and weaknesses do not lie in exter=\r\nnal objects. They lie in our own minds. When one sees a luxury car, one can=\r\n just appreciate its elegance, power and beauty and leave it at that. One n=\r\need not think, &quot;I must somehow have this car&quot; or imagine what one can do if=\r\n one has that car. When one sees a briefcase containing one million dollars=\r\n, one can just appreciate that it is a lot of money and a lot of things can=\r\n be bought with it. One need not think, &quot;I must somehow have this money&quot; or=\r\n imagine what one can do if one has that money. Similarly, when one sees a =\r\nbreast, one can just appreciate its ability to nurture new life. One need n=\r\not imagine what one can do with it. When one sees a vagina, one can just ap=\r\npreciate it as the source of new life.\n\n* * *\n\nUnfortunately, ego and condi=\r\ntioning make one think unnecessary thoughts about every object perceived by=\r\n senses. Ego and mental conditioning make one introduce oneself mentally in=\r\n the middle of all objects perceived by senses and engage in mental actions=\r\n with those objects. Those mental actions are of course shaped by one&#39;s own=\r\n conditioning! THAT is the problem. The over-materialization and over-sexua=\r\nlization prevalent in our society makes the conditioning deeper and more di=\r\nfficult to shake off. But the goal of sadhana is to shake off all condition=\r\ning.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen an evolved yogi sees a beautiful naked body, he need not =\r\nclose eyes and run away. He need not feel uncomfortable or embarrassed or s=\r\nelf-conscious when looking at or talking about it. There is nothing inheren=\r\ntly wrong or sinful in a naked body. It is not an object of lust by itself,=\r\n though it may seem like an object of lust to a mind conditioned with lust.=\r\n Even if such a conditioned person takes sannyasa and remains in a forest f=\r\nor 30 years away from everybody, he may feel lust if he suddenly sees a bea=\r\nutiful naked body after those 30 years of brahmacharya. On the other hand, =\r\nwhen an evolved yogi who overcame this conditioning sees a beautiful naked =\r\nbody, he may not close eyes and run away. He may notice its beauty (just li=\r\nke one may notice the beauty of a roadside scenery or waterfall or snowfall=\r\n over a mountain or a sunrise over a lake etc) and appreciate the Creator f=\r\nor creating objects of infinite variety and beauty. Thoughts of lust (e.g. =\r\nI can\n do so and so thing with this body, it will be nice to do so and so t=\r\nhing with this body, etc) may not even arise in his mind!\n\nOf course, when =\r\none is lustful, the best thing to do is to keep oneself away from objects t=\r\nhat provoke lust. But the final goal is to reach the above state.\n\n* * *\n\nW=\r\nhen you encounter references of body parts in ancient devotional literature=\r\n, you should realize that those authors had overcome lust and were childlik=\r\ne. Talking of a breast or navel would not make them lustful or uncomfortabl=\r\ne or embarrassed. There was no difference between talking about a breast or=\r\n a navel that they saw and talking about a scenery or a waterfall or snowfa=\r\nll over a mountain or sunrise over a lake that they saw.\n\nWhen a goddess re=\r\nvealed herself to them, there was no need to cover her breasts. Clothes rep=\r\nresent covering by additional conditioning and gunas. If goddess revealed h=\r\nerself to one with more conditioning, there was a need for more clothes, je=\r\nwellery etc. If goddess revealed herself to a childlike one with no conditi=\r\noning, unconditioned raw form is just fine. After all, a woman may feel com=\r\nfortable standing naked in front of a baby, while she will cover herself pr=\r\noperly when coming in front of a twenty year old son whose mind looks at th=\r\nings differently.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline: Those yogis and authors were uncondit=\r\nioned by lust and were shown what they were ready to see and they described=\r\n what they saw. Moreover, everything has a symbolic meaning too. However, i=\r\nf you are teaching a young and conditioned mind, I&#39;d suggest not teaching v=\r\nerses that can appear to be explicit or provocative. It is easy to misunder=\r\nstand or get erotic thoughts in the mind, though that is not the intention =\r\nof the author. After all, let me give an analogy. Suppose seeing anything r=\r\ned makes a person remember a bloodbath one saw earlier, become enraged and =\r\ngo and kill the enemies. Suppose you have a picture of abhishekam of a Lali=\r\nta idol with kumkum (sacred red vermillion powder). You better not show the=\r\n picture to that person..\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 =\r\nLessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sh=\r\nort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make=\r\n a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaste all learned friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a few questions for which I am sin=\r\ncerely seeking answers. The questions pertain to Mathura Bhakti tradition a=\r\ns well as some very popular works of great sages and saints of our beloved =\r\nBharata Varsha. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. There is this tradition of envisioning the lord (p=\r\naramatma) as the only purusha and all the humanity (various jeevatmas) as w=\r\nomen and thereby jeevatmas seeking union with paramatma culminating in salv=\r\nation. We have seen examples of great saints like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu who=\r\n were stalwarts of this path. And this explains the Krishna tatva in Srimad=\r\n bhagavatam as well in gopika vastra apaharana / rasaleela episodes. While =\r\nI think I understand this concept very well, I find it very hard to explain=\r\n it 1. To someone who is foreign to our culture and 2. To people who intent=\r\nionally malign the image of our rich Vedic traditions and 3. To kids who mi=\r\nght come up with questions on this subject. What is the best way to explain=\r\n it in these situations? \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In Lalitha Sahasranama stotra as well as =\r\nSaundarya Lahari stotra, Veda Vyasa and Adi Sankara respectively have descr=\r\nibed the mother goddess in a very detailed way detailing on specific body p=\r\narts. Yes, undoubtedly they have envisioned the formless nirguna Brahman as=\r\n their beloved mother, but where from is this tradition anga-anga varnana (=\r\npart - by part description) of mother? While I have no problem in accepting=\r\n those and include those in my daily prayers, how do we sensibly / convinci=\r\nngly explain these to the above groups of people? \n&gt; \n&gt; Not only in these, =\r\nI find reference to woman&#39;s body parts quite liberally in most of the ancie=\r\nnt sanskrit / telugu literature and I want to know why? Examples are Sri Kr=\r\nishna Ashtakam, Venkateshwara stotra that follows soon after Suprabhata (ka=\r\nmala kucha choochuka kumkumatO ....) and so on. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pardon me if I am sou=\r\nnding naive...

He may notice its beauty=\r\n (just like one may notice the beauty of a roadside scenery or waterfall or=\r\n snowfall over a mountain or a sunrise over a lake etc) and\n appreciate the=\r\n Creator for creating objects of infinite variety and beauty. Thoughts of l=\r\nust (e.g. I can do so and so thing with this body, it will be nice to do so=\r\n and so thing with this body, etc) may not even arise in his mind!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O=\r\nf course, when one is lustful, the best thing to do is to keep oneself away=\r\n from objects that provoke lust. But the final goal is to reach the above s=\r\ntate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When you encounter references of body parts in an=\r\ncient devotional literature, you should realize that those authors had over=\r\ncome lust and were childlike. Talking of a breast or navel would not make t=\r\nhem lustful or uncomfortable or embarrassed. There was no difference betwee=\r\nn talking about a breast or a navel that they saw and talking about a scene=\r\nry or a waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or sunrise over a lake that t=\r\nhey saw.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When a goddess revealed herself to them, there was no need =\r\nto cover her breasts. Clothes represent covering by\n additional conditionin=\r\ng and gunas. If goddess revealed herself to one with more conditioning, the=\r\nre was a need for more clothes, jewellery etc. If goddess revealed herself =\r\nto a childlike one with no conditioning, unconditioned raw form is just fin=\r\ne. After all, a woman may feel comfortable standing naked in front of a bab=\r\ny, while she will cover herself properly when coming in front of a twenty y=\r\near old son whose mind looks at things differently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bot=\r\ntomline: Those yogis and authors were unconditioned by lust and were shown =\r\nwhat they were ready to see and they described what they saw. Moreover, eve=\r\nrything has a symbolic meaning too. However, if you are teaching a young an=\r\nd conditioned mind, I&#39;d suggest not teaching verses that can appear to be e=\r\nxplicit or provocative. It is easy to misunderstand or get erotic thoughts =\r\nin the mind, though that is not the intention of the author. After all, let=\r\n me give an analogy. Suppose seeing anything\n red makes a person remember a=\r\n bloodbath one saw earlier, become enraged and go and kill the enemies. Sup=\r\npose you have a picture of abhishekam of a Lalita idol with kumkum (sacred =\r\nred vermillion powder). You better not show the picture to that person..&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free=\r\n Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make=\r\n a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofoll=\r\now&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.=\r\nmc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste all learned friends, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have a fe=\r\nw questions for which I am sincerely seeking answers. The questions pertain=\r\n to Mathura Bhakti tradition as well as some very popular works of great sa=\r\nges and saints of our beloved Bharata Varsha. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1. There is=\r\n this tradition of envisioning the lord (paramatma) as the only purusha and=\r\n all the humanity (various jeevatmas) as women and thereby jeevatmas seekin=\r\ng union with paramatma culminating in salvation. We have seen examples of g=\r\nreat saints like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu who were stalwarts of this\n path. An=\r\nd this explains the Krishna tatva in Srimad bhagavatam as well in gopika va=\r\nstra apaharana / rasaleela episodes. While I think I understand this concep=\r\nt very well, I find it very hard to explain it 1. To someone who is foreign=\r\n to our culture and 2. To people who intentionally malign the image of our =\r\nrich Vedic traditions and 3. To kids who might come up with questions on th=\r\nis subject. What is the best way to explain it in these situations? &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2. In Lalitha Sahasranama stotra as well as Saundarya Lahari sto=\r\ntra, Veda Vyasa and Adi Sankara respectively have described the mother godd=\r\ness in a very detailed way detailing on specific body parts. Yes, undoubted=\r\nly they have envisioned the formless nirguna Brahman as their beloved mothe=\r\nr, but where from is this tradition anga-anga varnana (part - by part descr=\r\niption) of mother? While I have no problem in accepting those and include t=\r\nhose in my daily prayers, how do we sensibly / convincingly\n explain these =\r\nto the above groups of people? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Not only in these, I find =\r\nreference to woman&#39;s body parts quite liberally in most of the ancient sans=\r\nkrit / telugu literature and I want to know why? Examples are Sri Krishna A=\r\nshtakam, Venkateshwara stotra that follows soon after Suprabhata (kamala ku=\r\ncha choochuka kumkumatO ....) and so on. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pardon me if I a=\r\nm sounding naive... But having to teach some of these to a teenage kid... I=\r\n really do not know how to approach, in case of any questions! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Regards, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nagraj&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUO=\r\nTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-512541928-1281925856=:21632--\r\n\n"}}
