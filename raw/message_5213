How can we purify the five elements?\n \nIf there=\r\n is attachment to something which we think of as our possession, can the ea=\r\nrth element inside us be considered to be pure? If there is attachment to s=\r\nomething which we want to control, can the fire element inside us be consid=\r\nered to be pure? And so on.\n \nIf we are vulnerable to the six internal enem=\r\nies - lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy - then aren&#39;t th=\r\nere still impurities?\n \nComplete surrender and humility that I mentioned ar=\r\ne not some hollow virtues. They are the real signs of purity.\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nWhatever mantra you are given by your guru, whatever mantra you =\r\npicked out of attraction, or whatever mantra you otherwise do, please do no=\r\nt think too much whether it is the right mantra. That is secondary. IF ther=\r\ne is a mantra you use, use it sincerely and with devotion. Use it as a tool=\r\n to increase your surrender and devotion. At that end, THAT is what matters=\r\n and brings results.\n \nA person with a broken leg needs to use a walking st=\r\nick until the leg cures and becomes fit. How big or heavy the stick is, wha=\r\nt wood it is made of, what is the carving on it, etc, is not that important=\r\n. The main purpose of the stick to give complete rest to the leg and help i=\r\nt cure fast. If one worries too much about the beauty and technical details=\r\n of the stick and ends up putting stress on the leg, the stick does not ser=\r\nve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if you consciously spare the leg =\r\nfrom effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not only walk but also run. S=\r\nimilarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra do not matter much. Use =\r\nmantra to focus the mind and cure it of its conditioning (i.e. impurity!).\n=\r\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a di=\r\nfference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, Chandan Sabharwal &lt;chanda=\r\nn.sabharwal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; then what about tantras which proclaim that unl=\r\ness the 5 elements are \n&gt; not purified first , every puja / ritual is simpl=\r\ny abhichara ?\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Chandan Sabharwal.\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Ranjan-da,\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Nice words!
