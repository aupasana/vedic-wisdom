Sensation of pressure or tightness \nlightness or heat or coldness or tingling may occur in any body parts \n(usually in the main torso) when one is in meditation. It is a sign praana \nvaayu flowing some nadis and doing some cleanup. It is better to not worry \nabout it and just focus on the meditation.\n\nOf course, it can also be a mere physical thing and suggest some other \nphysical problem. For example, your meditation posture may be putting \npressure on a leg or hand. So observe it for some time and seek help if \nneeded.\n\nBut you are saying that it happens only during meditation. Just verify that \nyour posture is not putting pressure on it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vikas&quot; &lt;vikasjeer@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, March 09, 2009 12:58 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] what should I understand by pain like sensation in \nleft arm while meditating\n\n\n&gt; ||HARE RAMA KRSHNA||\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Narsimha ji,\n&gt; Just a small query- since last 2 days I am feeling a pain like \n&gt; sensation/pressure in left arm while meditating, does it signify anything? \n&gt; This sensatin remains for some time while meditating and there are no \n&gt; traces of it afterwords.\n&gt;\n&gt; with regards\n\n\n"}}
