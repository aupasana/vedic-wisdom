This represents the first time in history,\nhowever, t=\r\nhat such a large number of Americans have been welcomed into\nthe tradition =\r\nat one time.  \n\nIn accepting Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya as their guru (s=\r\npiritual\nteacher), these newly committed American Hindus vowed to devote\nth=\r\nemselves to living a Dharma lifestyle, to meditate upon God each\nday, and t=\r\no express compassion toward all they encounter.  \n\nIncluded among the new i=\r\nnitiates were: two professors, a practicing\npsychiatrist, a retired lawyer,=\r\n and a nurse, among others.  \n\n\nFirst Non-Indian Women Awarded with Brahman=\r\na Thread\n\nIn a related historical development, Ms. Heather &quot;Tulasi&quot; Mortens=\r\nen\nwas awarded brahmana initiation during the same ceremony, and awarded\nwi=\r\nth a sacred thread.  Though traditionally Hindu women were known to\nhave be=\r\nen given sacred threads during Vedic times, this practice came\nto a stop at=\r\n some point in the history of Hinduism.  Thus, this\nthread-giving ceremony =\r\n(known as upavita-samskara in Sanskrit)\nrepresents the very first time in w=\r\norld history that a non-Indian\nwoman has been awarded such a sacred thread.=\r\n  Sri Acharyaji stated to\nthe large audience observing this event that &quot;I k=\r\nnow that this\nhistoric precedent is only the beginning of the reclamation o=\r\nf an\nancient and important Vedic tradition.  My hope is that this\nrepresent=\r\ns only the first of many thousands of women who I will see\nawarded the sacr=\r\ned thread in my lifetime.&quot;\n\nThe two hour event was followed by a celebratio=\r\nn dinner in the\ntemple&#39;s auditorium.  \n\nFor further information, please con=\r\ntact us at info@...,\n(402) 896-4294\n\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentra=\r\nl.com\n\n\n\n"}}
