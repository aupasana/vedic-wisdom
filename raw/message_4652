O=\r\nne of them had\nrecently lost her husband in an air crash. She asked Sri Bha=\r\ngavan:\n\nLady. Is there rebirth?\n\nBh. Do you know what birth is?\n\nL. O yes, =\r\nI know that I exist now, but I want to know if I=E2=80=99ll exist in\nthe fu=\r\nture.\n\nBh. Past!.... Present!.... Future!....\n\nL. Yes, today is the result =\r\nof yesterday, the Past, and tomorrow, the\nFuture, will be the result of tod=\r\nay, the Present. Am I right?\n\nBh.There is neither Past nor Future. There is=\r\n only the\nPresent.Yesterday was the present to you when you experienced it,=\r\n and\ntomorrow will be also the present when you will experience it.\nTherefo=\r\nre experience takes place only in the present, and beyond\nexperience nothin=\r\ng exists.\n\nL. Are then Past and Future mere imagination?\n\nBh. Yes, even the=\r\n Present is mere imagination, for the sense of time\nis purely mental. Space=\r\n is similarly mental;therefore birth and\nrebirth, which take place in time =\r\nand space cannot be other than\nimagination.\n\nSource: GURU RAMANA MEMORIES A=\r\nND NOTES By S. S.
