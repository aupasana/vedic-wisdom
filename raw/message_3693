Ra=\r\no&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; A few quick points:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) There=\r\n is no absolute right and wrong. Dharma often requires judging and balancin=\r\ng different criteria and the judgment may vary from place to place, time to=\r\n time and person to person.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a long tim=\r\ne without getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfortu=\r\nnately, people cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not exp=\r\nect cooked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Similarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures and t=\r\naught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do good =\r\nto others. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant always, while =\r\nvery specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circumstances (e.=\r\ng. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam with m=\r\nustard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for money, giv=\r\ne whatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstances in mind =\r\nand may be irrelevant in other circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I reject spoiled food=\r\n cooked by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food made by my siste=\r\nr-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would not have expected m=\r\ne to hang on to her food and eat it even after it expires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunate=\r\nly, many great yogis give specific guidelines to people based on the circum=\r\nstances (desa-kaala- paatra), as people are not smart enough to know the ri=\r\nght thing if given only generic guidelines and want specific guidance. So t=\r\nhey run the risk of someone using the guideline meant for a specific circum=\r\nstance in other inapplicable circumstances while attributing it to them.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; (2) Eating the meat of an animal that self-identifies with the body part=\r\ns strongly is always a much stronger karma than eating the stuff from plant=\r\ns that have much subtler self-identification with the leaves and vegetables=\r\n they grow. Irrespective of which spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it=\r\n is bad karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and h=\r\nope for them balance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karm=\r\nas, so many austerities and such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have off=\r\nset any bad karma accumulated by eating fish during the time they were not =\r\nyet fully realized (after full realization, there are no karmas).\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) =\r\nIn the old days - even a century back - people did much more sadhana than n=\r\now and lived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middl=\r\ne of deep pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bom=\r\nbarded with so much corrupting influence. One may do a homam in the evening=\r\n, go and turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may h=\r\nave sexual innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mail about sexualit=\r\ny. There are images of half-naked people and struggle for money everywhere.=\r\n There are too many temptations for the mind and too many opportunities to =\r\nfall and commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world of today is =\r\nmore challenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.\n&gt; \n&gt; How go=\r\nod shoes one wears may not matter if one is walking on a normal road in sum=\r\nmer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking on an icy pavement=\r\n during winter, lest one should fall!\n&gt; \n&gt; When there is so much corrupting=\r\n influence around us that we cannot control and that is challenging us, we =\r\ncan atleast control our own actions and habits and minimize the bad karmas =\r\nwe regularly commit and the chance of a fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) When Lord Vishnu cam=\r\ne to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importance of Eka Patni Vrata (havin=\r\ng only one wife). When he came back as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize t=\r\nhat anymore and had many wives. When he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama=\r\n, he killed demons. When he came as Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc =\r\ncome also, their message is tuned for their desa-kaala-paatra. Different ti=\r\nmes require different leelas, different missions, different messages and di=\r\nfferent styles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize when Lord=\r\n Rama came back as Lord Krishna and even fought with him!\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) While it=\r\n is illogical to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for the belief=\r\ns of these people, I admire their blind faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. t=\r\nhey just want to eat fish and use the icons of their organization as an exc=\r\nuse, that is bad. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were p=\r\nerfected beings and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make =\r\nit. Opportunistic and egoistic faith is useless, but blind and complete fai=\r\nth accompanied by complete surrender is very powerful. People with such fai=\r\nth WILL find their way.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) The nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi does=\r\n not go through Calcutta. But, if someone insists on going through Calcutta=\r\n, what can you do? Everyone takes a spiritual path based on one&#39;s condition=\r\ning. If we see a short path, we can only suggest it to others but nor force=\r\n them to take it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFil ms.org\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, ra=\r\njarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ .=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vimalananda&#39; s opinion on &#39;Meat=\r\n-eaters&#39; (Aghor -at the left hand of God)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom\n&gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear KK,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Nice question=\r\n. I was also thinking that.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Few days back when I went to C=\r\nalcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one person told me confidently th=\r\nat there is no harm in eating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, a=\r\nnd in a Bengali book on the=C3=82=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one=\r\n example mentioned where a man came to ask him if should quite non veg food=\r\n, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then=\r\n think of food. =C3=82=C2=A0Also a similar examples was quoted to me from=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she advised=\r\n an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just focus mind=\r\n on God.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; When I tried to reason with them that if these pe=\r\nople were to come back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg=\r\n eating - considering the state of the world today - I=C3=82=C2=A0 was cate=\r\nrgorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in=\r\n eating fish they would have told right then.=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n Then I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to =\r\nwhich I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such examples =\r\neven today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve =\r\nfish.

However, you are free to addre=\r\nss me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just =\r\ncame across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has man=\r\ny a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one =\r\nself-identifies with it.\n&gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intelle=\r\nctually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it=\r\n&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important i=\r\nnformation about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he=\r\n was a big time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life wh=\r\nen he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physi=\r\ncal body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally\n&gt; a=\r\nte meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also ag=\r\nree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our m=\r\ninds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say =\r\nvery frequently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do wh=\r\nat he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the =\r\nquestions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are=\r\n thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). Wh=\r\nen we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or=\r\n any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they =\r\nare all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realizatio=\r\nn. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe. Their indi=\r\nvidual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short the=\r\ny *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n&gt; Relevant to ou=\r\nr topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or =\r\nchew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. The=\r\nre would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every action of their=\r\ns because as I said, they know complete background behind their each action=\r\n and moreover their self identification is missing from the action and henc=\r\ne it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose w=\r\nithout binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; Ramakrishna used to freque=\r\nntly say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from others. He =\r\nhas a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume anything =\r\nand everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything w=\r\nithout getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake i=\r\ns extremely important.\n&gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, i=\r\nt&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not\n&gt; possible for majority o=\r\nf us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He might be =\r\nremoving `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can=\r\n be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their =\r\nhabits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also possibl=\r\ne at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with th=\r\ne `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have shower=\r\ned his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s po=\r\nssible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inco=\r\nnsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Natu=\r\nre know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA =\r\nwhile he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the=\r\n boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami =\r\nimmediately told him to stay away from water\n&gt; and when he requested swami =\r\nto accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that=\r\n he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silver C=\r\nup as a gift.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A few quick points:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) There is no absolute righ=\r\nt and wrong. Dharma often requires judging and balancing different criteria=\r\n and the judgment may vary from place to place, time to time and person to =\r\nperson.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a long time withou=\r\nt getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfortunately, =\r\npeople cannot\n eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not expect coo=\r\nked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Similarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures =\r\nand taught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do =\r\ngood to others. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant always, w=\r\nhile very specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circumstance=\r\ns (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam w=\r\nith mustard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for money=\r\n, give whatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstances in =\r\nmind and may be irrelevant in other circumstances.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If I re=\r\nject spoiled food cooked by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food=\r\n made by my sister-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would no=\r\nt have expected me to hang on to her food and eat it even after it\n expires=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, many great yogis give specific guidelines=\r\n to people based on the circumstances (desa-kaala- paatra), as people are n=\r\not smart enough to know the right thing if given only generic guidelines an=\r\nd want specific guidance. So they run the risk of someone using the guideli=\r\nne meant for a specific circumstance in other inapplicable circumstances wh=\r\nile attributing it to them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Eating the meat of an anim=\r\nal that self-identifies with the body parts strongly is always a much stron=\r\nger karma than eating the stuff from plants that have much subtler self-ide=\r\nntification with the leaves and vegetables they grow. Irrespective of which=\r\n spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it is bad karma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A=\r\nll of us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and hope for them balance =\r\nout. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karmas, so many austeriti=\r\nes and such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have offset\n any bad karma ac=\r\ncumulated by eating fish during the time they were not yet fully realized (=\r\nafter full realization, there are no karmas).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) In the o=\r\nld days - even a century back - people did much more sadhana than now and l=\r\nived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middle of dee=\r\np pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bombarded w=\r\nith so much corrupting influence. One may do a homam in the evening, go and=\r\n turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may have sexu=\r\nal innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mail about sexuality. There=\r\n are images of half-naked people and struggle for money everywhere. There a=\r\nre too many temptations for the mind and too many opportunities to fall and=\r\n commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world of today is more cha=\r\nllenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ho=\r\nw good shoes one wears may not matter if one is\n walking on a normal road i=\r\nn summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking on an icy pav=\r\nement during winter, lest one should fall!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When there is s=\r\no much corrupting influence around us that we cannot control and that is ch=\r\nallenging us, we can atleast control our own actions and habits and minimiz=\r\ne the bad karmas we regularly commit and the chance of a fall.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; (4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importa=\r\nnce of Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife). When he came back as Lord Kr=\r\nishna, he did not emphasize that anymore and had many wives. When he came a=\r\ns Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed demons. When he came as Lord Buddh=\r\na, he taught non-violence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vi=\r\nvekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, their message is tuned =\r\nfor their desa-kaala-paatra. Different times require different leelas, diff=\r\nerent missions, different messages and\n different styles.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nUnfortunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize when Lord Rama came back as Lo=\r\nrd Krishna and even fought with him!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (5) While it is illog=\r\nical to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for the beliefs of thes=\r\ne people, I admire their blind faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just =\r\nwant to eat fish and use the icons of their organization as an excuse, that=\r\n is bad. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfected =\r\nbeings and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make it. Oppor=\r\ntunistic and egoistic faith is useless, but blind and complete faith accomp=\r\nanied by complete surrender is very powerful. People with such faith WILL f=\r\nind their way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (6) The nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi d=\r\noes not go through Calcutta. But, if someone insists on going through Calcu=\r\ntta, what can you do? Everyone takes a spiritual path based on one&#39;s condit=\r\nioning. If we see a short path,\n we can only suggest it to others but nor f=\r\norce them to take it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms=\r\n.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; Jyo=\r\ntish\n writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri ti=\r\nngs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ .=\r\n..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vimalananda&#39; s opinion on &#39;Meat-eater=\r\ns&#39; (Aghor -at the left hand of God)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wis=\r\ndom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dat=\r\ne: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear KK,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nice question.

Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely impo=\r\nrtant statement to answer our queries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Important informati=\r\non about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a b=\r\nig time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he di=\r\ndn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body=\r\n. He used to\n as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; at=\r\ne meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agr=\r\nee) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our mi=\r\nnds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say v=\r\nery frequently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do wha=\r\nt he does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to =\r\nanswer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you=\r\n, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to n=\r\nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or =\r\nSainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget=\r\n that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual=\r\n realization. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe.=\r\n Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. I=\r\nn\n short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat =\r\nor smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what t=\r\nhey are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and eve=\r\nry action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind=\r\n their each action and moreover their self identification is missing from t=\r\nhe action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a=\r\n special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very di=\r\nfferent from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him whi=\r\nch can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind hi=\r\nm. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others,=\r\n a kind of food intake is extremely important.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If Vivekananda\n ate =\r\nmeat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which i=\r\ns not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by=\r\n a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seek=\r\ners amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them an=\r\nd then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other u=\r\nndesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifyi=\r\nng some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is al=\r\nso possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;=\r\ns soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent rea=\r\nsons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only =\r\nVivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved =\r\na boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did no=\r\nt even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years\n actually met S=\r\nwami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away fro=\r\nm water&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, =\r\nswami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his gur=\r\nu will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later be=\r\ncame disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually g=\r\niven a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami=\r\n Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Vivekananda was=\r\n all knowing and most of us are NOT.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; So moral of my whole =\r\nwritings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of th=\r\ne unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda,=\r\n Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justi=\r\nfy our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@&lt;BR&gt;&gt; yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Utpal Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Great co=\r\nincidence of thoughts!!=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;I was about to ask this q=\r\nuestion today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; It is clear fro=\r\nm the below passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;reading a book on=\r\n Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he =\r\nsurvived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relis=\r\nhed it.

That is why=\r\n you find a meat-eater reborn either as a predator or prey or as both in su=\r\nccession. Human beings cry a lot at funerals of their own kind but they hav=\r\ne absolutely no thought for the sufferings of the animals they slaughter. T=\r\nhey never\n hesitate to kill and eat. Just think, first they kill the chicke=\r\nn. Often they will cut its throat and let it bleed to death, which&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nis a most painful way to die. Then it will be cleaned, cooked and eaten, an=\r\nd if it happens to be tough everyone will curse it for not satisfying their=\r\n palates. How many humans would give beautiful tender lean meat if they wer=\r\ne slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Meat-eaters conve=\r\nniently forget that animal mothers too love their children. Do they ever th=\r\nink of the agony a hen goes through when her chicks are slain in front of h=\r\ner eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness, do they consider how muc=\r\nh she suffers when she sees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has =\r\ngrown in her own body and nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than=\r\n her own life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the ter=\r\nrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own children\n =\r\nbeing murdered before their own eyes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; How is Ma to teach such =\r\ndonkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subtle enough to self-iden=\r\ntify&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with another being of a different species and experience its p=\r\nersonal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make them suffer, al=\r\nlowing the animals they have tortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fai=\r\nr, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth you have every right to cu=\r\nt mine in the next or some succeeding birth. Experience is the best teacher=\r\n and a fool will learn from no other.&quot;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The INTERNET now ha=\r\ns a personality.
