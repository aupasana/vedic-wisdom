It has six words - \n&gt; shava, \n&gt; &gt; vasha, shav, vash, shiva and shiv. Each word is written in \n&gt; Devanagari script \n&gt; &gt; and then in English.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though the first word in that picture is &quot;shava&quot;, YOU will \n&gt; pronounce it as \n&gt; &gt; &quot;shav&quot;. Please note that the second symbol in &quot;shava&quot; is identical \n&gt; to the \n&gt; &gt; first symbol in &quot;vasha&quot;. However, YOU end up pronouncing that \n&gt; symbol as &quot;v&quot; \n&gt; &gt; in the first word and as &quot;va&quot; in the second word. You pronounce the \n&gt; same \n&gt; &gt; symbol as &quot;va&quot; in some cases and as &quot;v&quot; in some cases. But please \n&gt; note that \n&gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not like English and each symbol has a unique \n&gt; pronunciation. If \n&gt; &gt; you pronounce correctly, that symbol is pronounced identically \n&gt; (as &quot;va&quot;) in \n&gt; &gt; both words. If you really want it to be &quot;v&quot; (without a), it should \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; written differently (as at the end of 3rd and 6th words in the \n&gt; picture).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please go through the six examples carefully to know how to write \n&gt; things in \n&gt; &gt; Devanagari correctly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: Things like &quot;Raam&quot; or &quot;Shiv Uvaach&quot; are wrong and mean \n&gt; nothing \n&gt; &gt; in Sanskrit. The Arabic influence on some modern Indian languages \n&gt; (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; Hindi) that use the same script as Sanskrit corrupted people &#39;s \n&gt; &gt; pronunciation of Sanskrit. What are pronounced by people as &quot;Raam&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;Shiv \n&gt; &gt; Uvaach&quot; should actually be &quot;Raama&quot; and &quot;Shiva Uvaacha&quot;.

So you may do either.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, some combinations tried by others successfully in the \n&gt; past\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are better and faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding the specific mantra below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (or &quot;jai&quot;) have no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be &quot;raama&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and &quot;jaya&quot; respectively. Arabic has words mostly ending in \n&gt; consonants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word). That Arabic influence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made Indians change Sanskrit words to remove &quot;a&quot; at the end of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; words. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay Raam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restore &quot;a&quot; at the end of words. The correct version of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is &quot;Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my guru went to \n&gt; many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka that had a \n&gt; nice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) together. Apparently some yogi did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intense sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with the \n&gt; mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you mentioned). The mantra above is written all over the walls of \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Though that yogi is not there now, the vibrations created by his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana are still there. We were quite impressed when we spent \n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time there. You have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village (a few km from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; main Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small temple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than many \n&gt; famous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend visiting that temple and spending a couple of hours \n&gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The mantra you gave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; - \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available \n&gt; now\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   |om|\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve \n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and \n&gt; neecha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the \n&gt; walls of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be \n&gt; a 7\n&gt; &gt; &gt; word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th \n&gt; house\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My \n&gt; question\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? \n&gt; Is it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Some say it should be 13 aksharas....\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Sorry for astrological content in this mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   Hari\n\n\n"}}
