His subject was &quot;India&#39;s Gift to the World&quot;.\n\n&quot;In religion=\r\n,&quot; he said, &quot;she has exerted a great influence on Christianity,\nas the very=\r\n teachings of Christ would [could] be traced back to those of\nBuddha.&quot; He s=\r\nhowed by quotations from the works of European and American\nscientists the =\r\nmany points of similarity between Buddha and Christ. The\nlatter&#39;s birth, hi=\r\ns seclusion from the world, the number of his apostles,\nand the very ethics=\r\n of his teachings are the same as those of Buddha, living\nmany hundred year=\r\ns before him.\n\n&quot;Is it mere chance,&quot; the lecturer asked, &quot;or was Buddha&#39;s re=\r\nligion but the\nforeshadowing of that of Christ? The majority of your thinke=\r\nrs seem to be\nsatisfied in the latter explanation, but there are some bold =\r\nenough to say\nthat Christianity is the direct offspring of Buddhism just as=\r\n the earliest\nheresy in the Christian religion =97 the Monecian [Manichaean=\r\n] heresy =97 is now\nuniversally regarded as the teaching of a sect of Buddh=\r\nists. But there is\nmore evidence that Christianity is founded in Buddhism. =\r\nWe find it in\nrecently discovered inscriptions from the reign of Emperor Os=\r\nhoka [Asoka] of\nIndia, about 300 B.C., who made treaties with all the Greci=\r\nan kings, and\nwhose missionaries discriminated [disseminated ?] in those ve=\r\nry parts,\nwhere, centuries after, Christianity flourished, the principles o=\r\nf the\nBuddhistic religion.\n\n&quot;The same holds good with respect to sciences. =\r\nIndia has given to antiquity\nthe earliest scientifical physicians, and, acc=\r\nording to Sir William Hunter,\nshe has even contributed to modern medical sc=\r\nience by the discovery of\nvarious chemicals and by teaching you how to refo=\r\nrm misshapen ears and\nnoses. Even more it has done in mathematics, for alge=\r\nbra, geometry,\nastronomy, and the triumph of modern science =97 mixed mathe=\r\nmatics =97 were all\ninvented in India, just so much as the ten numerals, th=\r\ne very cornerstone of\nall present civilization, were discovered in India, a=\r\nnd are in reality,\nSanskrit words.\n\n&quot;In philosophy we are even now head and=\r\n shoulders above any other nation, as\nSchopenhauer, the great German philos=\r\nopher, has confessed. In music India\ngave to the world her system of notati=\r\non, with the seven cardinal notes and\nthe diatonic scale, all of which we e=\r\nnjoyed as early as 350 B.C., while it\ncame to Europe only in the eleventh c=\r\nentury. In philology, our Sanskrit\nlanguage is now universally acknowledged=\r\n to be the foundation of all\nEuropean languages, which, in fact, are nothin=\r\ng but jargonized Sanskrit.\n\n&quot;In literature, our epics and poems and dramas =\r\nrank as high as those of any\nlanguage; our &#39;Shaguntala&#39; [Shakuntala] was su=\r\nmmarized by Germany&#39;s greatest\npoet, as &#39;heaven and earth united&#39;. India ha=\r\ns given to the world the fables\nof Aesop, which were copied by Aesop from a=\r\nn old Sanskrit book; it has given\nthe Arabian Nights, yes, even the story o=\r\nf Cinderella and the Bean Stalks.\nIn manufacture, India was the first to ma=\r\nke cotton and purple [dye], it was\nproficient in all works of jewelry, and =\r\nthe very word &#39;sugar&#39;, as well as\nthe article itself, is the product of Ind=\r\nia. Lastly she has invented the\ngame of chess and the cards and the dice.So=\r\n great, in fact, was the\nsuperiority of India in every respect, that it dre=\r\nw to her borders the\nhungry cohorts of Europe, and thereby indirectly broug=\r\nht about the discovery\nof America.\n\n&quot;And now, what has the world given to I=\r\nndia in return for all that? Nothing\nbut nullification [vilification] and c=\r\nurse and contempt. The world waded in\nher children&#39;s life-blood, it reduced=\r\n India to poverty and her sons and\ndaughters to slavery, and now it adds in=\r\nsult to injury by preaching to her a\nreligion which can only thrive on the =\r\ndestruction of every other religion.\nBut India is not afraid. It does not b=\r\neg for mercy at the hands of any\nnation. Our only fault is that we cannot: =\r\nfight to conquer; but we trust in\nthe eternity of truth. India&#39;s message to=\r\n the world is first of all, her\nblessing; she is returning good for the evi=\r\nl which is done her, and thus she\nputs into execution this noble idea, whic=\r\nh had its origin in India. Lastly,\nIndia&#39;s message is, that calm goodness, =\r\npatience and gentleness will\nultimately triumph. For where are the Greeks, =\r\nthe onetime masters of the\nearth? They are gone. Where are the Romans, at t=\r\nhe tramp of whose cohorts\nthe world trembled? Passed away. Where are the Ar=\r\nabs, who in fifty years had\ncarried their banners from the Atlantic to the =\r\nPacific? and where are the\nSpaniards, the cruel murderers of millions of me=\r\nn? Both races are nearly\nextinct; but thanks to the morality of her childre=\r\nn, the kinder race will\nnever perish, and she will yet see the hour of her =\r\ntriumph.&quot;\n\nAt the close of the lecture, which was warmly applauded, Swami V=\r\nivekananda\nanswered a number of questions in regard to the customs of India=\r\n. He denied\npositively the truth of the statement published in yesterday&#39;s =\r\n[February 25]\nStandard Union, to the effect that widows are ill-treated in =\r\nIndia. The law\nguarantees her not only her own property, before marriage, b=\r\nut also all she\nreceived from her husband, at whose death, if there be no d=\r\nirect heirs, the\nproperty goes to her. Widows seldom marry in India, becaus=\r\ne of the scarcity\nof men. He also stated that the self-sacrifices of wives =\r\nat the death of\ntheir husbands as well as the fanatical self-destruction un=\r\nder the wheels of\nthe Juggernaut, have wholly stopped, and referred his hea=\r\nrers for proof to\nSir William Hunter&#39;s &quot;History of the Indian Empire&quot;.\n\nSou=\r\nrce:\nhttp://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/=\r\nVolume_2/Reports_in_American_Newspapers/India&#39;s_Gift_to_the_World\n\n-- \nOm N=\r\namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb54782c714a0471dda29b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;INDIA&#39;S GIFT TO THE WO=\r\nRLD (Brooklyn Standard Union, February 27, 1895)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Viveka=\r\nnanda, the Hindoo monk, delivered a lecture Monday night under the auspices=\r\n of the Brooklyn Ethical Association before a fairly large audience at the =\r\nhall of the Long Island Historical Society, corner Pierrepont and Clinton s=\r\ntreets.=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;His subject was &quot;India&#=\r\n39;s Gift to the World&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;In religion,&quot; he sa=\r\nid, &quot;she has exerted a great influence on Christianity, as the very te=\r\nachings of Christ would [could] be traced back to those of Buddha.&quot;=A0=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;He showed by quotations from the works =\r\nof European and American scientists the many points of similarity between B=\r\nuddha and Christ.&lt;/span&gt;=A0The latter&#39;s birth, his seclusion from the w=\r\norld, the number of his apostles, and the very ethics of his teachings are =\r\nthe same as those of Buddha, living many hundred years before him.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&quot;Is it mere chance,&quot; the lecturer asked, &quot;or was Buddha&#39;=\r\ns religion but the foreshadowing of that of Christ?=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight: bold; &quot;&gt;The majority of your thinkers seem to be satisfied in the la=\r\ntter explanation, but there are some bold enough to say that Christianity i=\r\ns the direct offspring of Buddhism&lt;/span&gt;=A0just as the earliest heresy in =\r\nthe Christian religion =97 the Monecian [Manichaean] heresy =97 is now univ=\r\nersally regarded as the teaching of a sect of Buddhists.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;=A0But there is more evidence that Christianity is founded=\r\n in Buddhism.&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;We find it in re=\r\ncently discovered inscriptions from the reign of Emperor Oshoka [Asoka] of =\r\nIndia, about 300 B.C., who made treaties with all the Grecian kings, and wh=\r\nose missionaries discriminated [disseminated ?] in those very parts, where,=\r\n centuries after, Christianity flourished, the principles of the Buddhistic=\r\n religion.&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;The same holds good with respect to scie=\r\nnces.
