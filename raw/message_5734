Navaneeta\nmeans butter. Kaivalya or Revala is the state in which the=\r\n soul exists,\nisolated from all connection with the body etc. From the vast=\r\n ocean of milk\n(the Upanishads etc.) the great teachers have drawn the milk=\r\n of wisdom and\nfilled it in pots (ancient texts).\n\nTandavaraya Swami, the a=\r\nuthor of Kaivalya Navaneeta says that he has\nextracted the butter from the =\r\nmilk. Those who have obtained this (being fed\non the butter of divine wisdo=\r\nm - Brahma Jnana - and being eternally\nsatisfied) will not roam about feedi=\r\nng on dust (non-real objects of sense).\n\nThe two sections of this work are =\r\ncalled &#39;The exposition of the Truth&#39;\n(Tattva Vilakkappadalam) and &#39;Doubts c=\r\nleared Away&#39;(Sandeham\ntelitarppadalam). They explain the basic philosophica=\r\nl principles and clear\ndoubts which are likely to arise in understanding th=\r\nese principles.\n\nV. A. Devasenapathi\n\n_____________________________________=\r\n________________________________________________\n\n\nKaivalya Navaneeta\n\n1. P=\r\nrostrations to the Holy Feet of the Unique Lord who like ether remains\nas s=\r\nole witness in the hearts of all beings, whether they are swayed by\ndesire =\r\nfor wealth, lands, and women, or are free from such desire, and who\nshines =\r\nas the towering peak over the seven successive spiritual heights,\nwhich are=\r\n in themselves exalted over all other planes (of mind), or in\nNannilam, the=\r\n holiest of the seven holy places!\n\n5. I adore the feet of the Holy Master =\r\nwho shines forth forever as the wide\nExpanse which has no beginning or end =\r\nor interval, and I proceed to tell you\nthe true nature of the Absolute Bein=\r\ng, to explain bondage and liberation so\nthat even those who are too dull to=\r\n learn the scriptures, may understand.\n\n7. After adoring my Master, Venkate=\r\nsa Mukunda, who is himself ever-free, and\nwho made me his own, I write this=\r\n Kaivalya Navaneeta divided into two parts,\nthe first of which contains a c=\r\nlear exposition of the Truth, and the second\nclears away all doubts arising=\r\n from the former.\n\n\nThe First Section\n\nThe Exposition Of The Truth\n\n8. The =\r\nSages say that there are four prerequisites for realisation of the\nTruth:\n\n=\r\n1. Viveka: discrimination between the temporary (therefore unreal phenomena=\r\n)\nand the permanent (therefore the Reality, i.e., the noumenal);\n2. indiffe=\r\nrence to the enjoyment of pleasures here or hereafter;\n3. the group of six =\r\nqualities and\n4. the longing for Liberation.\n\n\n9 and 10. The six qualities =\r\nare sama, dama, uparati, titiksha, samadhana and\nsraddha. Of these, sama is=\r\n control of mind; dama is control of the senses;\nuparati is cessation of ac=\r\ntivities (relating to caste, creed, family etc.);\ntitiksha is control of pa=\r\nssions, and includes endurance(The power to\nwithstand hardship or stress); =\r\nsamadhana is, according to the sages, the\nsettling down of the mind to refl=\r\nect the Truth, as revealed (by the\nscriptures and the sages); sraddha denot=\r\nes faith in the master and the\nscriptures; such are the meanings of the six=\r\n terms of this category.\n\n14. After eagerly saluting his Master, he stood u=\r\np and sobbed out his heart,\nsaying &quot;O Lord! I have suffered long the tortur=\r\ne or worldly life, which is\nafter all so false! Gracious Master, save me by=\r\n tearing off the cords which\nbind me to the five sheaths, so that my heart =\r\nmay be at peace!&#39;&#39;\n\n19 and 20. &quot;Look here, my son! He who has forgotten his=\r\n true nature is\nalternately born and dies, turning round and round in the u=\r\nnceasing wheel of\ntime, like a feather caught up in a whirlwind, until he r=\r\nealised the true\nnature of the Self. If he comes to see the individual self=\r\n and its\nsubstratum, the Overself, then be becomes the substratum, i.e., Br=\r\nahman, and\nescapes rebirths. Should you know yourself no harm will befall y=\r\nou. As you\nasked I have told you this.&#39;&#39;\n\n51. The question then arises: Whe=\r\nreon does the superimposition rest when the\nsubstratum is completely hidden=\r\n? And how can there be any superimposition if\nthe substratum is not hidden?=\r\n &quot;(The answer is:) The substratum is twofold,\ngeneral and particular, of wh=\r\nich the general substratum remains continuous\nand unbroken. Transient super=\r\nimposition is particular.\n\n52. In the world, the common substratum &#39;This is=\r\n&#39; can never be veiled; but\nonly the particular identity - &#39;This is a rope.&#39;=\r\n Similarly with the jiva,\nignorance does not veil the substratum - &#39;I AM&#39;; =\r\nbut it veils the specific\nknowledge - &#39;I am Brahman&#39;.&#39;&#39;\n\n72. By the Lord un=\r\nder the sacred banyan tree! I speak the truth;You are the\nunchanging Witnes=\r\ns of the gross, subtle and (casual) ignorance, the waking\ndream and sleep s=\r\ntates, and the passage of time - past, present and future,\nwhich endlessly =\r\nrise and fall, like waves in the ocean of bliss.\n\n80. In the example; &#39;This=\r\n is that Devadatta,&#39; the man who was seen in\nanother place and on another o=\r\nccasion, and also known as Devadatta, is this\nman who is seen in this place=\r\n and on this occasion. Although the time and\nplace are different, a little =\r\nconsideration reveals the man to be the same.\n\n81. Similarly, in the words =\r\n&#39;That&#39; and &#39;thou&#39;, their literal meanings\nexcluded, the Consciousness-Princ=\r\niple is taken as Brahman and the Witness,\nwhose unbroken identity is establ=\r\nished by &#39;art&#39;, so that Brahman is the\nSelf, and the Self is Brahman.\n\n107.=\r\n Just as the ether though all-pervading seems to be newly opened in a\nwell =\r\nwhich is newly dug, so Brahman though ever-present yet appears as if\nrealis=\r\ned afresh by enquiry into the self as taught by a master or the\nscriptures.=\r\n Therefore, O son, be at peace that we are always the same\nlimitless Being!=\r\n\n\n108. The whole universe is as unreal as water in a mirage, silver in\nmoth=\r\ner-of-pearl, the city of Gandharvas in the air, the dreamland of dream,\nthe=\r\n blue of the sky, the serpent in the rope, the off-spring of a barren\nwoman=\r\n, the horn of a hare, or the thief in the thick post. O Son! Pure\nConscious=\r\nness is alone real. Do not therefore forget the Self at any moment.\n\n\nSecti=\r\non Two\n\nDoubts Cleared Away\n\n1. &quot;Just as men dig a hole, gently plant a lon=\r\ng post in it, fill in earth\nand ram it in, to fix it firmly so too, I take =\r\nto clearing away doubts that\nyour mind which has realised the Self as being=\r\n the Supreme Consciousness may\nremain unshaken.&#39;&#39;\n\n44. Disciple: &quot;O Siva in=\r\n the form of my Master. If these powers and\nDeliverance are together the fr=\r\nuits of tapas, then all the sages should\npossess both, as the ancient sages=\r\n did. We have known that the ancient sages\nhad these siddhis and were also =\r\nliberated at the same time. Why do not all\njnanis possess such powers as we=\r\nll?&#39;&#39;\n\n45. Master: &quot;Of the two types of tapas, namely, tapas, for the fulfi=\r\nllment\nof one&#39;s desires, and dispassionate tapas, the former bestows the po=\r\nwers\ndesired, and the latter wisdom. Each can yield its allotted fruits onl=\r\ny.\nThat is the law. The ancient sages had evidently performed both kinds of=\r\n\ntapas.\n\n46. &quot;Sinless son, Janaka, Mahabali, Bhagirata and others got deliv=\r\nerance\nonly.\nDid they display any siddhis? (No). Some of the sages sought s=\r\niddhis only;\nothers sought both siddhis and emancipation. These siddhis are=\r\n simply for\ndisplay and nothing more. They do not make for liberation.&#39;&#39;\n\n1=\r\n07. Disciple: &quot;O Master! I do not see the propriety of the statement that\na=\r\nll beings are permeated by the single non-dual Self which is all-embracing\n=\r\nas Being-Consciousness-Bliss. The existence of the jivas is clear because\nt=\r\nhey all say &#39;I&#39;; Consciousness also is clear because of knowledge which is\n=\r\nobvious; why does not-Bliss show forth in a similar way?&#39;&#39;\n\n108. Master: &quot;S=\r\non, although there are shapes, fragrance and softness\ntogether present in t=\r\nhe same flower, each of them is cognised by a separate\nsense only. Otherwis=\r\ne they are not perceived; such is the law of nature.\nSimilarly though the b=\r\neatific qualities, Being, Consciousness and Bliss\ntogether form the Self, y=\r\net the modes vary constantly and give rise to the\ndifference which appear a=\r\ns the world.\n\n109. My son! the three qualities - Satva, Rajas and Tamas - g=\r\nive rise to the\nthree modes - repose, agitation and ignorance respectively.=\r\n Being,\nConsciousness and Bliss which are themselves glorious, always remai=\r\nn a\nhomogeneous Whole yet appear different.\n\n110. Bare existence alone is n=\r\noticed in plants, minerals and the earth which\nlook insentient and are igno=\r\nrant.\n\nThere can be no happiness in the state of disturbance caused by pass=\r\nions,\nsuch as lust, which act like poison. But Being and Consciousness are =\r\nevident\nin it.\nBeing, Consciousness and Bliss together become manifest in t=\r\nhe state of\nPeace which is characterised by a stern detachment (from extern=\r\nalities).\nTherefore Bliss becomes clear in a peaceful mind rid of ignorance=\r\n and\nagitation.&#39;&#39;\n\n168. Disciple: &quot;How should I remain, so that I may exper=\r\nience what you have\ndescribed as Bliss?&#39;&#39;\n\nMaster: &quot;If you get rid of the m=\r\node of mind which give rise to the states of\nwaking, dream and sleep, you w=\r\nill remain as your true being and also\nexperience Bliss.\n\n169. If you ask h=\r\now to control the activities of the mind, rising up from\nits latencies: Rul=\r\ne over the intellect and sense as your slaves. They will\nbecome extinct.\n\n1=\r\n70. Also by gentle control of the breath which blows like bellows, the\nacti=\r\nvities of the mind cease. If you are not inclined to practice this yoga,\nth=\r\ney will cease if you root out the massive ignorance of the casual body.\nThe=\r\nn too the mind stops its activities.&#39;&#39;\n\n171. Disciple: &quot;By what means can I=\r\n root out ignorance, the casual body?&#39;&#39;\n\nMaster: &quot;The srutis can never misl=\r\nead one. How can there be ignorance if you\nfirmly fix their teaching in you=\r\nr mind; &#39; I am the all-perfect being in whom\nthe worlds appear?&#39;&#39;\n\n172. Dis=\r\nciple: &quot;How can I remain so when I engage in worldly transactions,\nwith wan=\r\ndering mind?&#39;&#39;\n\nMaster: &quot;There is nothing apart from Me. Whatever is seen, =\r\nis of Me. I am I\nwho is consciousness which sees all this as fictitions as =\r\nmy dream.\n\n173. If you always remain aware that &#39;I&#39; am perfect Consciousnes=\r\ns, what does\nit matter how much you think, or what you do? All this is unre=\r\nal like dream\nvisions after waking. I am all-Bliss!&#39;&#39;\n\n178 and 179. Such is=\r\n Vidyananda. Those who study this work with devotion\nwill realise the high =\r\nstate of Repose and be liberated here and now. In\norder that all may unders=\r\ntand clearly Vidyananda, the true spirit of the\nHoly books, in Nannilam Mas=\r\nter Narayana appeared in my samadhi and commanded\nme to make this Kaivalya =\r\nNavaneeta perfect in every detail, and free from\ndefect.\n\n184. Praise, prai=\r\nse to the author of my salvation! He placed on his head the\nFoot of Narayan=\r\na, the Infinite Lord, who made him his slave, and who, by\nmeans of the proc=\r\ness of negation had destroyed what through imposition had\narisen as a mere =\r\nfictitious appearance, and put me in such a condition that\nI, with eyes of =\r\nGrace, can remain for ever the Spectator.\n\nSource: http://bhagavan-ramana.o=\r\nrg/kaivalyanavaneeta.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636284a34629247049b208fff\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The Kaivalya Navaneeta is a widely known Advai=\r\nta classic in Tamil.

Should you know yourself no harm w=\r\nill befall you. As you asked I have told you this.&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;51. The question then arises: Whereon does the superimposition rest when t=\r\nhe substratum is completely hidden? And how can there be any superimpositio=\r\nn if the substratum is not hidden? &quot;(The answer is:) The substratum is=\r\n twofold, general and particular, of which the general substratum remains c=\r\nontinuous and unbroken. Transient superimposition is particular.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;52. In the world, the common substratum &#39;This is&#39; can never be=\r\n veiled; but only the particular identity - &#39;This is a rope.&#39; Simil=\r\narly with the jiva, ignorance does not veil the substratum - &#39;I AM&#39;=\r\n; but it veils the specific knowledge - &#39;I am Brahman&#39;.&#39;&#39;=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;72.

In the e=\r\nxample; &#39;This is that Devadatta,&#39; the man who was seen in another p=\r\nlace and on another occasion, and also known as Devadatta, is this man who =\r\nis seen in this place and on this occasion. Although the time and place are=\r\n different, a little consideration reveals the man to be the same.=C2=A0&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;81. Similarly, in the words &#39;That&#39; and &#39;thou&#39;, their=\r\n literal meanings excluded, the Consciousness-Principle is taken as Brahman=\r\n and the Witness, whose unbroken identity is established by &#39;art&#39;, =\r\nso that Brahman is the Self, and the Self is Brahman.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;107. J=\r\nust as the ether though all-pervading seems to be newly opened in a well wh=\r\nich is newly dug, so Brahman though ever-present yet appears as if realised=\r\n afresh by enquiry into the self as taught by a master or the scriptures. T=\r\nherefore, O son, be at peace that we are always the same limitless Being!=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;108. The whole universe is as unreal as water in a mirage, =\r\nsilver in mother-of-pearl, the city of Gandharvas in the air, the dreamland=\r\n of dream, the blue of the sky, the serpent in the rope, the off-spring of =\r\na barren woman, the horn of a hare, or the thief in the thick post. O Son! =\r\nPure Consciousness is alone real. Do not therefore forget the Self at any m=\r\noment.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Section Two&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dou=\r\nbts Cleared Away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. &quot;Just as men dig a hole, gently plan=\r\nt a long post in it, fill in earth and ram it in, to fix it firmly so too, =\r\nI take to clearing away doubts that your mind which has realised the Self a=\r\ns being the Supreme Consciousness may remain unshaken.&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;44. Disciple: &quot;O Siva in the form of my Master. If these powers a=\r\nnd Deliverance are together the fruits of tapas, then all the sages should =\r\npossess both, as the ancient sages did. We have known that the ancient sage=\r\ns had these siddhis and were also liberated at the same time. Why do not al=\r\nl jnanis possess such powers as well?&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;45. Master: =\r\n&quot;Of the two types of tapas, namely, tapas, for the fulfillment of one&=\r\n#39;s desires, and dispassionate tapas, the former bestows the powers desir=\r\ned, and the latter wisdom. Each can yield its allotted fruits only. That is=\r\n the law. The ancient sages had evidently performed both kinds of tapas.=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;46. &quot;Sinless son, Janaka, Mahabali, Bhagirata and others =\r\ngot deliverance only.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;Did they display any siddhis? (No). Some of =\r\nthe sages sought siddhis only; others sought both siddhis and emancipation.=\r\n These siddhis are simply for display and nothing more. They do not make fo=\r\nr liberation.&#39;&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;107. Disciple: &quot;O Master! I do not se=\r\ne the propriety of the statement that all beings are permeated by the singl=\r\ne non-dual Self which is all-embracing as Being-Consciousness-Bliss. The ex=\r\nistence of the jivas is clear because they all say &#39;I&#39;; Consciousne=\r\nss also is clear because of knowledge which is obvious; why does not-Bliss =\r\nshow forth in a similar way?&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;108. Master: &quot;Son, although there are shapes, fragrance an=\r\nd softness together present in the same flower, each of them is cognised by=\r\n a separate sense only. Otherwise they are not perceived; such is the law o=\r\nf nature. Similarly though the beatific qualities, Being, Consciousness and=\r\n Bliss together form the Self, yet the modes vary constantly and give rise =\r\nto the difference which appear as the world.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;109. My =\r\nson! the three qualities - Satva, Rajas and Tamas - give rise to the three =\r\nmodes - repose, agitation and ignorance respectively. Being, Consciousness =\r\nand Bliss which are themselves glorious, always remain a homogeneous Whole =\r\nyet appear different.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;110. Bare existence alone is noticed i=\r\nn plants, minerals and the earth which look insentient and are ignorant.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;There can be no happiness in the state of disturbance caused by passio=\r\nns, such as lust, which act like poison. But Being and Consciousness are ev=\r\nident in it.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\nBeing, Consciousness and Bliss together become mani=\r\nfest in the state of Peace which is characterised by a stern detachment (fr=\r\nom externalities).=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Therefore Blis=\r\ns becomes clear in a peaceful mind rid of ignorance and agitation.&lt;/span&gt;&#=\r\n39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;168. Disciple: &quot;How should I remain, so that I=\r\n may experience what you have described as Bliss?&#39;&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master: =\r\n&quot;If you get rid of the mode of mind which give rise to the states of w=\r\naking, dream and sleep, you will remain as your true being and also experie=\r\nnce Bliss.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;169. If you ask =\r\nhow to control the activities of the mind, rising up from its latencies: Ru=\r\nle over the intellect and sense as your slaves. They will become extinct.&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;170.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Also by gentl=\r\ne control of the breath which blows like bellows, the activities of the min=\r\nd cease.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0If you are not inclined to practice this yoga, they wi=\r\nll cease if you root out the massive ignorance of the casual body. Then too=\r\n the mind stops its activities.&#39;&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;171. Disciple: &quot;By =\r\nwhat means can I root out ignorance, the casual body?&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Master: &quot;The srutis can never mislead one. How can there be ignoranc=\r\ne if you firmly fix their teaching in your mind; &#39; I am the all-perfect=\r\n being in whom the worlds appear?&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;172. Disciple: &=\r\nquot;How can I remain so when I engage in worldly transactions, with wander=\r\ning mind?&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Master: &quot;There is nothing apart from =\r\nMe. Whatever is seen, is of Me. I am I who is consciousness which sees all =\r\nthis as fictitions as my dream.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;173. If you always remain aw=\r\nare that &#39;I&#39; am perfect Consciousness, what does it matter how much=\r\n you think, or what you do? All this is unreal like dream visions after wak=\r\ning. I am all-Bliss!&#39;&#39;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n178 and 179. Such is Vidyanan=\r\nda. Those who study this work with devotion will realise the high state of =\r\nRepose and be liberated here and now. In order that all may understand clea=\r\nrly Vidyananda, the true spirit of the Holy books, in Nannilam Master Naray=\r\nana appeared in my samadhi and commanded me to make this Kaivalya Navaneeta=\r\n perfect in every detail, and free from defect.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;184. Praise,=\r\n praise to the author of my salvation! He placed on his head the Foot of Na=\r\nrayana, the Infinite Lord, who made him his slave, and who, by means of the=\r\n process of negation had destroyed what through imposition had arisen as a =\r\nmere fictitious appearance, and put me in such a condition that I, with eye=\r\ns of Grace, can remain for ever the Spectator.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/=\r\nkaivalyanavaneeta.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/kaival=\r\nyanavaneeta.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0p=\r\nx;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:=\r\n0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636284a34629247049b208fff--\r\n\n"}}
