I am practicing it\nfor about a year & found it to be very good in st=\r\nress relief & am unable\nto state about my spiritual progress before & after=\r\n SK.=C2\n&gt; I was so much miserable in 2005 that i learned few stotras & mant=\r\nras &\nrecited them for about a year daily for one year. Now I recite only o=\r\nn\nMonday & Saturday. May be cause of that itself i came to know about the\ns=\r\npiritual masters & my misery reduced. And now after 7 years although\nmuch o=\r\nf family & fincancial issue are still there but I feel very\ncontented & cal=\r\nm. The calm I feel after SK i also feel the same after\nthe mantra & stotra =\r\nrecitation I do.

I think you are treating him as Spir=\r\nitual\nConsultant.\n&gt; Anyway, as Narasimha ji has said it is finally individu=\r\nal preference.\nSo even he try out on request, what do you expect him to say=\r\n one is 80%\neffective, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this=\r\n is my\ncomparative judgment but it may be different for you.=C2  So best yo=\r\nu\ntry out and read his post on spiritual progress and judge what works\nbett=\r\ner for you, or you want both.\n&gt; Now on my experience, I learnt SK in 2002 a=\r\nnd within 25 days learnt\nPS. =C2 I have practiced both regularly for 1 year=\r\ns and SK alone for 7\nyears. I have done Advance course 8 times. Also have l=\r\nisten Narad Bhakti\nSutra, Astavakra Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL se=\r\nrvice is\nconsidered very important part, I had also done lots of volunteeri=\r\nng\nactivities in AOL including being Administrator for Primary School.\nSinc=\r\ne 2009, I have stopped practicing SK, as I felt that I after initial\ncouple=\r\n of years of progress, I did not find progressing much on\nspiritual level. =\r\nI found really helpful in stress relief and mental\ncalmness, but considered=\r\n commodity/retail spirituality.\n&gt; Now from last 10 months, by taking Ganapa=\r\nthi as Guru, I have started\ndoing japa every day and homam every weekend. I=\r\n have not spent equal\namount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you=\r\n comparison. Yes,\nit will take longer than SK to master the technique, and =\r\ninitially mind\nis more occupied in maintaining the fire.\n&gt; So can only say,=\r\n if you like in the reasoning and explanation of\nNarasimha ji, better try y=\r\nourself and see how you feel. Anyway, AoL also\nteaches Agnihotra, and also =\r\nhomam in their Veda school. During Navaratri\nin Bangalore ashram there are =\r\nall the homam done. So =C2 Homam is not\ncontradiction to AOL.\n&gt; Hope this h=\r\nelps.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Mihir. --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vinayak tand=\r\nle\nvinayakmechie@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Guruji,\n&gt; &gt; I consider you as my G=\r\nuru as you are the one of the 4\n&gt; &gt; prominent people who have influenced & =\r\ninspired me on spiritual\npath(whatever\n&gt; &gt; little I do) & I find your expla=\r\nnations\n&gt; &gt; very very convincing.
