The names of the tongues of fire \nwere not &quot;coined&quot; by me. They are actually quite well-known. It is regarding \nthe significance and meaning of each tongue that I had to fall back to what \nI referred to as internal sources. I thought you were enquiring about the \ninterpretation and not about the actual names themselves, because the names \nthemselves are quite famous. So I explained how I got that understanding of \nthe meaning.\n\nSo, I did not really coin any &quot;fancy names&quot;.\n\nUsually scriptures only mention raw knowledge and interpretation is left \nout. A lot of interpretive knowledge is usually not found in scriptures. You \nusually do not get it by research or checking many references. You usually \nget it from either a learned person or from within.\n\n*        *        *\n\nGood or bad, I do not think in terms of whether a piece of knowledge I share \nhere is an amazing insight that inspires someone or a &quot;bastardization&quot; that \n&quot;eventually leads to wrong practices&quot;. What I know from inside and feel \ninspired to share, I share.\n\nSomeone may have a question. When She wants to answer, She may use me as an \ninstrument. She may want to delude some with wrong knowledge in one case or \ninspire some with good knowledge in another case. In either case, I look at \nmyself as a mere instrument and do not try to distinguish between the two \ncases. She does whatever She does in each case. I submit myself to Her and \nShe can use me for *any* purpose. I am a servant who carries the parcel. My \nmaster is welcome to use me for carrying valuable articles or useless junk. \nMy master must have a reason for giving me a parcel to carry and I carry it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 16, 2009 11:22 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Agni\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes I am little disappointed, I did not expect this from you. I feel\n&gt; that when we put things out on internet, they should be backed up\n&gt; with appropriate reference and should try to stick to our scriptures,\n&gt; as there is lot of depth. We can interpret them as per our abilities\n&gt; and state that too.\n&gt;\n&gt; For one when information posted on internet, we donot know when, how\n&gt; and who will use the information. This leads to a lot of\n&gt; bastardization and eventually lead to wrong practices for the wrong\n&gt; reason. We practice many even today without understanding or if we\n&gt; need.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why coin new fancy names and definitions as there may already be\n&gt; appropriate names and definitions in our scripture.\n&gt;\n&gt; You always question Pt Sanjay Rath and ask for source parampara or\n&gt; himself or other, I appreciate that.\n&gt;\n&gt; I hope you take this in a positive way. There a lot of good things\n&gt; that you have done and are trying to do, please keep it up and as\n&gt; time goes on, you need to be more vigilant and careful.\n&gt;\n&gt; I recommend take some time to get your references straight and then\n&gt; share as that would also improve the quality greatly. If you donot\n&gt; have time, give pointers to others to research and come up.\n&gt; Collabrating is always good.\n&gt;\n&gt; Why do you want to share something and tell please accept it with a\n&gt; pinch of salt, types of agni, we definately should have definition in\n&gt; black and white.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I know\n&gt;&gt; some things because I heard from a person or read in a book and\n&gt; hence I can\n&gt;&gt; identify the external source of that knowledge. But some knowledge\n&gt; just\n&gt;&gt; comes from inside and I am not really sure of the source.

So please take what I write with a pinch of\n&gt; salt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I always remind people that I am not much of a scholar and merely a\n&gt; dumb\n&gt;&gt; servant of my guru and Mother.

It symbolizes absorbing\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; digesting experiences. As you make offerings in fire and they\n&gt; burn in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fire, various spiritual experiences are processed and digested by\n&gt;&gt; &gt; your internal fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Tongue is that which allows one to taste things that one is going\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to accept inside and digest. Each tongue of fire stands for a\n&gt; spirit\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that controls how you absorb spiritual experiences.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The seven tongues of Agni are: Kaali, Karaali, Manojava,\n&gt; Sulohita,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sudhoomra-Varna, Sphulingini, and Vishwaruchi.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Kaali is the dark and black/blue fire. It symbolizes the spirit\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; detachment. Spirit of detachment controls how you absorb your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Karaali is the monstrous, dreadful fire that looks like a wide\n&gt; open\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mouth. Spirit of attachment and desire controls how you absorb\n&gt; your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Manojava is the swiftly moving, flickering and unstable flame.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirit of wavering (could also be flexibility) controls how you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of\n&gt; fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sulohita is the (copper like) dark red color flame. Spirit of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; determination and strength controls how you absorb your\n&gt; experiences,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sudhoomra-Varna is the greyish/purple/smoke-colored fire. Spirit\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; confusion (could also be resolution of confusion) controls how you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of\n&gt; fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sphulingini is the fire with sparks. Spirit of aggression and\n&gt; haste\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (could also be a great intuition/insight) controls how you absorb\n&gt;&gt; &gt; your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vishwaruchi is the bright fire. Spirit of focus, knowing, being\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; bliss controls how you absorb your experiences, when you are\n&gt; offering\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As you keep performing homam and a relationship is formed between\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you and fire, the external fire in the homa kundam will reflect\n&gt; your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; internal fire. When your mind is well-focused and blissful, the\n&gt; fire\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will automatically burn bright.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The state of your mind will decide how you will taste the\n&gt; spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experiences you are going to absorb from around you. That in turn\n&gt;&gt; &gt; decides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal fire are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; receiving food right now. That in turn decides which tongues of\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; external fire are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The external fire is a mirror to your internal state. An adept\n&gt; may\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be able to detect, looking at the fire, which tongues of fire are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; active right now and hence guess the state your mind is in.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, trying to pay too much attention to this technicality\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and becoming over-conscious of the nature of fire is unneeded.\n&gt; Though\n&gt;&gt; &gt; external can be used to manipulate the internal (within some\n&gt; limits),\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it can become a distraction.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether internal follows external or external follows internal a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; invalid question. The reality is that the two change together.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Neither is the cause and neither is the effect. They just happen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; together.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fire with the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; automatically. It may take time, but it will happen by itself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What do the seven &quot;tongues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
