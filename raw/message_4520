They were not written in any particular order to form a poem. =\r\nSri\nMuruganar therefore suggested that Bhagavan should write twenty stanzas=\r\n more\nto make it the conventional forty. Accordingly, Bhagavan composed twe=\r\nnty\nmore stanzas. Out of these forty, Kavyakanta Ganapati Muni selected two=\r\n as\nthe invocatory stanzas.\n\nThen Bhagavan wrote two more to complete the f=\r\norty. Some of the stanzas were\ntranslations from Sanskrit, but as devotees =\r\nwanted all the forty verses to\nbe original they were eliminated and new sta=\r\nnzas composed in their place.\n\nThe verses were all arranged in a continuous=\r\n order to form a poem. Later, a\nsupplement consisting of a second forty ver=\r\nses was added. So indifferent to\nauthorship was Bhagavan that he did not wr=\r\nite all those supplementary verses\nhimself. When he came upon a suitable on=\r\ne he used it =E2=80=94 mostly translations\nfrom Sanskrit\n=E2=80=94 and when=\r\n not, he made one. The verses eliminated from the original forty\nverses wer=\r\ne included in the supplement.\n\nThese eighty verses are the most comprehensi=\r\nve exposition of the Maharshi=E2=80=99s\nteaching. A number of translations =\r\nhave been made and commentaries written\non them. They have been published a=\r\ns separate books by the ashram under the\ntitles Ulladu Narpadu, Sad Vidya a=\r\nnd Truth Revealed. Bhagavan translated\nthese verses into Telugu prose under=\r\n the name of Unnadi Nalubadi and into\nMalayalam verse under the name of Sad=\r\ndarsanam.\n\nInvocation\n\n1. Unless Reality exists, can thought of it arise? S=\r\nince,devoid of thought,\nReality exists within as Heart, how to know the Rea=\r\nlity we term the Heart?\nTo know That is merely to be That in the Heart.\n\n2.=\r\n When those who are in dread of death seek refuge at the feet of the\ndeathl=\r\ness, birthless Lord Supreme, their ego and attachments die; and they,\nnow d=\r\neathless, think no more of death.\n\nThe Text\n\n1. Since we know the world, we=\r\n must concede for both a common Source, single\nbut with the power of seemin=\r\ng many.The picture of names and forms, the\nonlooker, the screen, the light =\r\nthat illumines =E2=80=94 all these are verily He.\n\n2. On three entities =E2=\r\n=80=94 the individual, God and the world =E2=80=94 every creed is\nbased. Th=\r\nat =E2=80=98the One becomes the three=E2=80=99 and that =E2=80=98always the=\r\n three are\nthree=E2=80=99, are said only while the ego lasts. To lose the =\r\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and in the Self\nto stay is the State Supreme.\n\n3. =E2=\r\n=80=98The World is true=E2=80=99; =E2=80=98No, it is a false appearance=E2=\r\n=80=99;=E2=80=98The World is Mind=E2=80=99;\n=E2=80=98No, it is not=E2=80=99=\r\n; =E2=80=98The World is pleasant=E2=80=99;=E2=80=98No, it is not=E2=80=99 =\r\n=E2=80=94 What avails such\ntalk? To leave the world alone and know the Self=\r\n, to go beyond all thought\nof =E2=80=98One=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Two=E2=80=\r\n=99, this egoless condition is the common goal of all.\n\n4. If Self has form=\r\n, the world and God likewise have form. If Self is\nwithout form, by whom an=\r\nd how can form (of world and God) be seen? Without\nthe eye, can there be si=\r\nght or spectacle? The Self, the real Eye, is\ninfinite.\n\n5. The body is made=\r\n up of the five sheaths;in the term body all the five are\nincluded. Without=\r\n the body the world is not. Has one without the body ever\nseen the world?\n\n=\r\n6. The world is made up of the five kinds of sense perceptions and nothing\n=\r\nelse. And those perceptions are felt as objects by the five senses. Since\nt=\r\nhrough the senses the mind alone perceives the world, is the world other\nth=\r\nan the mind?\n\n7. Though the world and mind rise and fade together,the world=\r\n shines by the\nlight of the mind. The ground whence the world and mind aris=\r\ne, and wherein\nthey set, that Perfection rises not nor sets but ever shines=\r\n. That is\nReality.\n\n8. Under whatever name or form we worship It, It leads =\r\nus on to knowledge of\nthe nameless, formless Absolute. Yet,to see one=E2=80=\r\n=99s true Self in the Absolute,\nto subside into It and be one with It, this=\r\n is the true Knowledge of the\nTruth.\n\n9. =E2=80=98Twos=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=\r\n=98threes=E2=80=99 depend upon one thing, the ego.If one asks in one=E2=80=\r\n=99s\nHeart, =E2=80=98What is this ego?=E2=80=99 and finds it,they slip away=\r\n. Only those who have\nfound this know the Truth, and they will never be per=\r\nplexed.\n\n10. There is no knowledge without ignorance; and without knowledge=\r\n ignorance\ncannot be. To ask, =E2=80=98Whose is this knowledge? Whose this =\r\nignorance?=E2=80=99 and thus\nto know the\nprimal Self, this alone is Knowled=\r\nge.\n\n11. Without knowing the Self that knows, to know all objects is not\nkn=\r\nowledge; it is only ignorance. Self, the ground of knowledge and the\nnon-Se=\r\nlf, being known, both knowledge and ignorance fall away.\n\n12. True Knowledg=\r\ne is being devoid of knowledge as well as ignorance of\nobjects. Knowledge o=\r\nf objects is not true knowledge. Since the Self shines\nself-luminous, with =\r\nnothing else for It to know, with nothing else to know\nIt, the Self is Know=\r\nledge. Nescience It is not.\n\n13. The Self that is Awareness, that alone is =\r\ntrue. The knowledge which is\nvarious is ignorance. And even ignorance,which=\r\n is false, cannot exist apart\nfrom the Self. False are the many jewels, for=\r\n apart from gold, which alone\nis true, they cannot exist.\n\n14. =E2=80=98You=\r\n=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 these appear only when =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 does.But when the nature of\nthe =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 is sought=\r\n and the ego is destroyed, =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98he=E2=80=99 a=\r\nre at an end.\nWhat shines then as\nthe One alone is the true Self.\n\n15. Past=\r\n and future are dependent on the present. The past was present in\nits time =\r\nand the future will be present too.Ever-present is the present. To\nseek to =\r\nknow the future and the past, without knowing the truth of time\ntoday, is t=\r\no try to count without the number =E2=80=98One=E2=80=99.\n\n16. Without us th=\r\nere is no time nor space. If we are only bodies, we are\ncaught up in time a=\r\nnd space. But are we bodies? Now, then and always =E2=80=94 here,\nnow and e=\r\nverywhere =E2=80=94 we are the same.
