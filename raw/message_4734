That\nstill mind which is adorned with the attainment of th=\r\ne limitless supreme\nSelf, alone is the reality of God.\n\nWhen the mind is in=\r\n communion with the Self in darkness, it is called nidra\n[sleep], that is, =\r\nthe immersion of the mind in ignorance.Immersion in a\nconscious or wakeful =\r\nstate is called samadhi. Samadhi is continuous\ninherence in the Self in a w=\r\naking state. Nidra or sleep is also inherence in\nthe Self but in an unconsc=\r\nious state. In sahaja samadhi the communion is\ncon-tinuous.\n\nQuestion : Wha=\r\nt are kevala nirvikalpa samadhi and sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi?\n\nRamana Maha=\r\nrshi :The immersion of the mind in the Self, but without its\ndestruction, i=\r\ns kevala nirvikalpa samadhi. In this state one is not free\nfrom vasanas and=\r\n so one does not therefore attain mukti. Only after the\nvasanas have been d=\r\nestroyed can one attain liberation.\n\nQuestion : When can one practise sahaj=\r\na samadhi?\n\nRamana Maharshi : Even from the beginning. Even though one prac=\r\ntises kevala\nnirvikalpa samadhi for years together, if one has not rooted o=\r\nut the vasanas\none will not attain liberation.\n\nQuestion : May I have a cle=\r\nar idea of the difference between savikalpa and\nnirvikalpa?\n\nRamana Maharsh=\r\ni : Holding on to the supreme state is samadhi. When it is\nwith effort due =\r\nto mental disturbances, it is savikalpa. When these\ndisturbances are absent=\r\n, it is nirvikalpa. Remaining permanently in the\nprimal state without effor=\r\nt is sahaja.\n\nQuestion : Is nirvikalpa samadhi absolutely necessary before =\r\nthe attainment\nof sahaja?\n\nRamana Maharshi : Abiding permanently in any of =\r\nthese samadhis, either\nsavikalpa or nirvikalpa, is sahaja [the natural stat=\r\ne]. What is\nbody-consciousness? It is the insentient body plus consciousnes=\r\ns. Both of\nthese must lie in another consciousness which is absolute and un=\r\naffected and\nwhich remains as it always is, with or without the body-consci=\r\nousness. What\ndoes it then matter whether the body-consciousness is lost or=\r\n retained,\nprovided one is holding on to that pure consciousness? Total abs=\r\nence of\nbody-consciousness has the advantage of making the samadhi more int=\r\nense,\nalthough it makes no difference to the knowledge of the supreme.\n\nQue=\r\nstion : Can the meditator be affected by physical disturbances during\nnirvi=\r\nkalpa samadhi? My friend and I disagree on this point.\n\n\nRamana Maharshi : =\r\nBoth of you are right. One of you is referring to kevala\nand the other to s=\r\nahaja samadhi. In both cases the mind is immersed in the\nbliss of the Self.=\r\n In the former, physical movements may cause disturbance\nto the meditator, =\r\nbecause the mind has not completely died out. It is still\nalive and can, as=\r\n after deep sleep, at any moment be active again.\n\nIt is compared to a buck=\r\net, which, although completely submerged under\nwater, can be pulled out by =\r\na rope which is still attached to it. In sahaja,\nthe mind has sunk complete=\r\nly into the Self, like the bucket which has got\ndrowned in the depths of th=\r\ne well along with its rope. In sahaja there is\nnothing left to be disturbed=\r\n or pulled back to the world. One&#39;s activities\nthen resemble that of the ch=\r\nild who sucks its mother&#39;s milk in sleep, and is\nhardly aware of the feedin=\r\ng.\n\nQuestion : How can one function in the world in such a state?\n\nRamana M=\r\naharshi : One who accustoms himself naturally to meditation and\nenjoys the =\r\nbliss of meditation will not lose his samadhi state whatever\nexternal work =\r\nhe does, whatever thoughts may come to him. That is sahaja\nnirvikalpa. Saha=\r\nja nirvikalpa is nasa [total destruction of the mind]\nwhereas kevala nirvik=\r\nalpa is laya [temporary abeyance of the mind].\n\nThose who are in the laya s=\r\namadhi state will have to bring the mind back\nunder control from time to ti=\r\nme. If the mind is destroyed, as it is in\nsahaja samadhi, it will never spr=\r\nout again. Whatever is done by such people\nis just incidental, they will ne=\r\nver slide down from their high state.\n\nThose that are in the kevala nirvika=\r\nlpa state are not realized, they are\nstill seekers. Those who are in the sa=\r\nhaja nirvikalpa state are like a light\nin a windless place, or the ocean wi=\r\nthout waves; that is, there is no\nmovement in them. They cannot find anythi=\r\nng which is different from\nthemselves. For those who do not reach that stat=\r\ne, everything appears to be\ndifferent from themselves.\n\nQuestion : Is the e=\r\nxperience of kevala nirvikalpa the same as that of\nsahaja, although one com=\r\nes down from it to the relative world?\n\nRamana Maharshi : There is neither =\r\ncoming down nor going up - he who goes up\nand down is not real.In kevala ni=\r\nrvikalpa there is the mental bucket still\nin existence under the water, and=\r\n it can be pulled out at any moment. Sahaja\nis like the river that has link=\r\ned up with the ocean from which there is no\nreturn. Why do you ask all thes=\r\ne questions? Go on practising till you have\nthe experience yourself.\n\nQuest=\r\nion : What is the use of samadhi and does thought subsist then?\n\nRamana Mah=\r\narshi : Samadhi alone can reveal the truth. Thoughts cast a veil\nover reali=\r\nty, and so it is not realized as such in states other than\nsamadhi. In sama=\r\ndhi there is only the feeling `I am&#39; and no thoughts. The\nexperience of `I =\r\nam&#39; is `being still&#39;.\n\nQuestion : How can I repeat the experience of samadh=\r\ni or the stillness that\nI obtain here in your presence?\n\nRamana Maharshi : =\r\nYour present experience is due to the influence of the\natmosphere in which =\r\nyou find yourself. Can you have it outside this\natmosphere? The experience =\r\nis spasmodic(Occurring in spells and often\nabruptly). Until it becomes perm=\r\nanent, practice is necessary.\n\nSource: from David Godman Excellent Book &quot;Be=\r\n As You are&quot;\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=\r\n=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=\r\n=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00c09f923134d064b8048cd1e36e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nQuestion : What is samadhi?&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ramana Maharshi :=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The state in w=\r\nhich the unbroken experience of existence-consciousness is attained by the =\r\nstill mind, alone is samadhi.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0That still mind which is adorned =\r\nwith the attainment of the limitless supreme Self, alone is the reality of =\r\nGod.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When the mind is in communio=\r\nn with the Self in darkness, it is called nidra [sleep]&lt;/span&gt;, that is, th=\r\ne immersion of the mind in ignorance.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Immer=\r\nsion in a conscious or wakeful state is called samadhi.
