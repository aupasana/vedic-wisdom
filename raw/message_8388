Will also check out the=\r\n Aghorpir blog.

Those who know dont write and those=\r\n who write dont know. (by the way it took a some time to realise that there=\r\n exists full range from easy/nice/happy tantra to downright black arts sham=\r\nshan tantra) even the cute looking buddhist monks might follow the extreme.=\r\n \n&gt; http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/baby-magic.html\n&gt; \n&gt; and also it to=\r\nok me a while to understand that aghori beneath all the seemingly freaky st=\r\nuff carry &quot;Bleeding for longing Heart&quot; and &quot;Life is a dream - Interpretatio=\r\nn&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; anyhow i found this blog to be a good read on tantra, its written=\r\n by a Aghori\n&gt; http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/\n&gt; \n&gt; His recommended book list\n=\r\n&gt; http://aghorpir.blogspot.ca/2012/05/resources-for-traditional-hindu-tantr=\r\na.html\n&gt; \n&gt; but guess what he has put an end to it with following words\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nSome words of advice:  Don&#39;t allow yourself to be imprisoned by life and ci=\r\nrcumstances by living a zombie-like monotonous 9 to 5 life like a slave!  T=\r\nhe system is designed to keep you subservient and perpetuate itself.  Life =\r\nis way too short to waste it.  Seek for a way out!  Sorcery and Tantra is a=\r\nbout Freedom, especially freedom from mental shackles.  It will give you th=\r\ne edge you need to get ahead in life.  Seek for freedom from the Matrix and=\r\n its archons.  Emancipate yourself even if it is only mentally!  You are a =\r\nspark of the Divine and are meant for greater things than this!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; There=\r\n are couple of FB forum but they mostly dish around sadhanas for solving is=\r\nsues and provide less theory on tantra. one guy post his tantra sadhana jou=\r\nrney, all i can say is that on that path fanatics only reach such high leve=\r\nls.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; and if you want to read about bhairavies \n&gt; (good interpretatio=\r\nn must otherwise ull get lost in words)\n&gt; Diaries of a Bhairavi\n&gt; http://ww=\r\nw.newrealities.com/index.php/component/content/category/170-diaries-of-bhai=\r\nravi?start=3D50\n&gt; \n&gt; there are enough clues to find her out. she is a dance=\r\nr in jakarta i guess. she teaches some basic classes also and quite accessi=\r\nble.\n&gt; \n&gt; in case you find any good links do share.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for the very int=\r\neresting information about tantra, a subject I know very little about. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; It sounds fascinating. Making an idol of Durga from the mud collected=\r\n from the house of a widow and a prostitute! I interpret that ritual to dem=\r\nonstrate that Durga abides in the heart of a prostitute as much as she does=\r\n in the heart of a saint, and so the soil from both their houses is equally=\r\n sacred. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad to hear you say that tantra has so many women o=\r\nf high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very inspiring. What a pity we don&#39;t hear=\r\n much about them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I recently read a wonderful book about the women=\r\n saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of the Goddess&quot;, written by an American=\r\n devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She asked the same question &quot;Where=\r\n are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pandit ji replied, &quot;just because they d=\r\non&#39;t stand on public stages and give seminars, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exis=\r\nt!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to India and met Ammachi (of Kerala), =\r\nAnandi Ma and other living realised saints in the female form. I&#39;ve met Amm=\r\na, but would love to meet some of the yoginis and Bhairavis you mention.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about tantra and would like to learn more about it. I li=\r\nke Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but I&#39;m open to learning about othe=\r\nr paths (tantra probably includes Japa for all I know). And learning more a=\r\nbout Goddess worship would be great. I see Durga as my spiritual guide, kee=\r\nping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with me (because I&#39;m too lazy to do =\r\nit on my own), and Hari as the goal (actually they&#39;re the same in my head a=\r\nnd are both my goal as my divine parents). The cowherd girls of yore, cleve=\r\nr girls, knew that the Goddess alone could give them Hari...as we all know,=\r\n they famously worshipped Katyayani asking for Krishna, and She gave Him to=\r\n them! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please could you reccommend some articles/books on tantra.=\r\n I would love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may be even, a=\r\ndd something to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (aside from =\r\nabusing and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgay=\r\nai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra that I got=\r\n intiated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanay=\r\na.) And I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only once in 2 =\r\nweeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it&#39;s not a perfect homam te=\r\nchnique wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I can&#39;t find a=\r\nny heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of abuse from=\r\n me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, it&#39;s her own fault). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks a=\r\ngain for the message, and here&#39;s to tantra, the path that treats women as e=\r\nquals! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
