First, the =\r\nsystem used to be referred to as the Varnapratha. Just like our philosophy =\r\nhad the system of ashramas to define an ordinary man&#39;s life, like the Brahm=\r\nacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha etc.\n=A0\nNow of course not every man would,=\r\n I am presuming, would follow every one of the ashrams ideally. Everybody h=\r\nas his her own nature. So, the first idea that one must understand is that,=\r\n like the Ashramas, the Varnapratha was a classification, which could be pu=\r\nt to good use, IF, it was followed in the right spirit.\n=A0\nAs we have alre=\r\nady seen, the varna of a person is a product of his birth (genetics/environ=\r\nment) and his own self-efforts. If one understands this, then things make m=\r\nore sense because change of own one varna is but a fundamental process in S=\r\nanatana Dharma. It not change of a personality, from a limited flawed being=\r\n to something better and flawless the aim of ALL sadhana? So by that logic,=\r\n anyone who is making such an effort is by default striving to be a Brahama=\r\nna. And that means, the change of varna is an accepted idea of Sanatana Dha=\r\nrma. Because if it were not, it would be contradicting the essence of this =\r\nDharma.\n=A0\nOften, if you think carefully, you will find that a person acts=\r\n like different varnas at different times based on situations. So most peop=\r\nle are but an amalgamation of all these four, with some tendencies predomin=\r\nating. Again, with time and experience, a person,s tendencies too change.\n=\r\n=A0\nNow it has been asked why is Aswathama and people like that not conside=\r\nred as Sudras. Well, maybe in THAT act he was a Sudra or a Chandal? Maybe i=\r\nn his other acts he was a Kshtriya? Maybe when he mediates he is a Brahmana=\r\n? The problem that we face today, which the ancients never faces, was our f=\r\nixation with tags. As the example of Gauthama Rishi accepting Satyakama as =\r\na student shows, tags were defined by the person. Out here we try to define=\r\n a person based on a tag, which is wrong, I feel. Swami Vivekananda was not=\r\n a brahmin by birth. But is he a &#39;Brahmin&#39; or not a &#39;Brahmin&#39;? And if he is=\r\n not a brahmin, then there can never be any more barhmins in India. \n=A0\nIt=\r\n was the writer of Manu Smriti (some scholars=A0say his name was Brhigu, no=\r\nt Manu, and loived around the time of or just before Pushayamitra Sangha) w=\r\nho advoacted a rigid &quot;caste system&quot;. This maybe been the necessity of the t=\r\nimes. Infact even inside the Manusmriti, there are slokas that talk of flui=\r\ndity of the system, but I guess people ignored them for their own vested in=\r\nterests. It is from that time onwards that the present day caste system evo=\r\nlved and took on a rigid, horrible, flawed shape, egged on by various secti=\r\nons of society out of circumstantial necessities (Like Buddhism) as well as=\r\n plain self interest. The Manusmriti, specially with respect to the issue o=\r\nf castes, has run out its worth. No scripture, specially rule based once, c=\r\nan be applicable across all lengths of time. Same here.\n=A0\nAnd today you h=\r\nave the goverments, every party, right or left, have used the castes as a v=\r\note begging tool to stay in power.=A0 All this roots in the fixation with &quot;=\r\ntags&quot;, which probably was non existent during the time of the Mahabharatas =\r\netc.\n=A0\nSo, practically, the caste system, as it stands now=A0must end.
