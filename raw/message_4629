Who is=\r\n\nit that sees the object as distinct from himself, the subject?\n\nMaharshi: =\r\nWho is it that is putting this question?\n\nV.: One who seeks the Truth.\n\nM.:=\r\n Who is he?\n\nV.: He who desires to know the Truth.\n\nM.: Instead of having a=\r\n mere desire to know the truth, if he has the\nanubhava (experience) such qu=\r\nestions as these would not arise.\n\nV.: True, after Realization they cannot =\r\narise. But until he has the\nexperience, he has not only the desire for it, =\r\nbut also some doubts\nregarding the nature of the ultimate Reality. Hence ar=\r\nises the question, why\nthe world should appear as an object different from =\r\nthe subject who sees it.\nI do admit that the question has significance only=\r\n until the desire for\nRealization is fulfilled. But till then, the question=\r\n remains, and it has to\nbe answered.\n\nM.: That there is no answer to your q=\r\nuestion is the only answer, because the\nquestion does not really arise. In =\r\norder to know the truth, you who seek to\nknow it should exist as such, i.e.=\r\n, as yourself, the primal being. It is\ntherefore yourself that you should k=\r\nnow in the first instance. It is of you\nthat knowledge or ignorance is pred=\r\nicated.You said you do not know the Truth\nand desire to know it. Instead of=\r\n engaging your mind with such thoughts as\n&quot;I know,&quot; &quot;I am ignorant,&quot; etc., =\r\nyou should direct it towards the enquiry as\nto what the &#39;I&#39; itself is. Thro=\r\nugh such enquiry you will find, as a matter\nof experience and not merely as=\r\n something to think and argue about, that\nwhat remains alone and absolute i=\r\ns the Self. So that your question, viz.,\nwhy the world should appear as an =\r\nobject seen by a subject, cannot and does\nnot at all arise. A question that=\r\n does not arise cannot have an answer.\n\nV.: How then should I know the &#39;I&#39;?=\r\n\n\nM.: By investigation into this question itself, and thereby will you get =\r\nthe\nexperience or Atmanubhuti. The ardent desire to know the Truth has a\nbe=\r\nneficial purpose to serve until one has such experience.\n\nV.: Mental activi=\r\nty during meditation does not seem to converge at a point,\nas it should, on=\r\n the object of meditation and it does not stay there but\ngets diverted into=\r\n numerous thought channels. Why is it so? How can the mind\nbe made to overc=\r\nome this tendency towards diffused thinking and attain its\nPrimal State of =\r\nfreedom from thought?\n\nM.: It is the mind&#39;s attachment to objects, constitu=\r\nting the non-self that\nmakes the mind wander about during meditation. There=\r\nfore, the mind should be\nwithdrawn from the non-self, and an effort should =\r\nbe made to fix it in\nSelf-enquiry. All extraneous thought is effectively el=\r\niminated when you\nattune the entire mind to the one question: &quot;Who is it th=\r\nat is making the\nenquiry?&quot;\n\nV.: In spite of having come to the definite con=\r\nclusion as a result of one&#39;s\ninvestigation that &#39;I&#39; has no essential relati=\r\non with the non-self, i.e.,\nwith the body, senses and the objects perceived=\r\n by the senses, the mind\npersists in going after these very same things whi=\r\nch constitute the\nnon-self. What is it due to and how can it be remedied?\n\n=\r\nM.: It is due to lack of abhyasa and vairagya. When Self-enquiry has become=\r\n\nsteady through practice, and the spirit of renunciation firm through\nconvi=\r\nction, your mind will be free from the tendency of thinking about the\nnon-s=\r\nelf.\n\nV.: How can I gain steadiness in practice?\n\nM.: Only through more pra=\r\nctice.\n\n=E2=80=93 The Call Divine\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsle=\r\ntters/2001/?pg=3Djul-aug\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e644c68cb1c263048ac3d4d1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe following conversation took place on January 2, 1942 when so=\r\nme visitors from North India, well versed in Hindu Sastras, visited Sri Ram=\r\nanasramam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Visitor: If the ultimate=\r\n Reality is one and absolute, why does the world appear as an object, seen =\r\nas different from the subject who sees it?
