This is truly a case of the\n&gt; &gt; blind =\r\nleading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the blind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it =\r\ndoes not help in \novercoming\n&gt; &gt; the basic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, suppress=\r\ning desire will make the desire come back \nlater.\n&gt; &gt; But, if one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\neeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the \nnature\n&gt; &gt; of desir=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One of my favourite books is the mudgala-purana, which=\r\n is a \npurana\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesha. Here, Ganesha has 8 avatAras, which =\r\ncome to destroy 8\n&gt; &gt; demons: envy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lust, delusion, greed, anger, des=\r\nire, &quot;my-ness&quot; and pride. In \nthe\n&gt; &gt; chapter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where Ganesha destroys =\r\nthe &quot;desire demon&quot;, the demon is \ndescribed\n&gt; &gt; as having\n&gt; &gt; &gt; two childre=\r\nn -- shoShaNa and duShpUra i.e. (1) one who dries\n&gt; &gt; things up /\n&gt; &gt; &gt; des=\r\ntroys and (2) one who can never be satisfied.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satisfying desire=\r\n always results in fanning the fire of desire.\n&gt; &gt; And in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process=\r\n, other things become neglected (dried up). Eventually, \none\n&gt; &gt; feel&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; guilt / shame, where, again, the heart literally feels like it \nis\n&gt; &gt; d=\r\nrying up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesha comes to uproot the &quot;desire demon&quot; as the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n avatAra &quot;vikaTa&quot;, which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means &quot;one who is horrible / monstrous&quot;. The=\r\n purana explains \nthat\n&gt; &gt; we have to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; see things &quot;as they are&quot;. To do=\r\n this, we should think of \ndesired\n&gt; &gt; objects, as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something horrible=\r\n. The desire falls away, and we will be able \nto\n&gt; &gt; see\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesha in h=\r\nis vikaTa form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This technique is described in Shankaracharya&#39;s=\r\n famous \nstotra &quot;moha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mudgara&quot;, i.e. taking a hammer to &quot;delusion&quot;. T=\r\nhis is also \nknown\n&gt; &gt; as &quot;bhaja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; govindam&quot;. Here, he teaches that we =\r\nshould repeatedly remember\n&gt; &gt; that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; female form is merely a modif=\r\nication (rather a horrible\n&gt; &gt; contortion) of flesh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and fat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Thus, we pray to Ganesha, who illuminates the world, and shows \nit\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nas it is,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contorted and un-deserving of desire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadIya=\r\nH,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;        ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  -------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo!
