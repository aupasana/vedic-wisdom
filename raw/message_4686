[kru=\r\npA]\n\n&gt; Yajamana get fruits\nof the rituals from the inbuilt bank balance of =\r\ndeities &gt; and not of a\npriest. A powerhouse of divine energy, called devata=\r\n can give &gt; million\ndollar check to unlimited no of people &gt; So in this who=\r\nle exercise priest is\na mere mediator or a technician who can &gt; interact wi=\r\nth both parties.\n\nIt is valid to say that\none gets blessings of a deity thr=\r\nough deity&#39;s krupa (kindness and compassion).\nBut then, why do you need a\n\n=\r\n&quot;technician&quot;\nand &quot;mediator&quot; to apply for the &quot;kindness and compassion&quot;\nof A=\r\nlmighty god??? Why cannot one directly interact with the kind and\ncompassio=\r\nnate deity, without a &quot;mediator&quot; in between?\n\nAt least, you thing my\npoint =\r\nto be valid for reply. I was hoping that being a Sanskrit scholar you\nwill =\r\neasily understand meaning of krupa in this context but it seems I was\nwrong=\r\n so let me explain. I replace word kripa by [=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=\r\n=A4=B8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6] prasada which will make this\nsimple. We do all ri=\r\ntuals through priests pleasing the devata due to which we\nget prasada. Now =\r\nthis doesn=E2=80=99t include kindness, compassion qualities of devata\nand m=\r\nakes the understanding clear. From my side this is due to mixing of religio=\r\nn and\nspirituality. Religion as a whole is for all four purusharthas i.e. d=\r\nharma,\nartha, kama and moksha while spirituality is\nfor moksha only. In oth=\r\ner words you may think this as pathway to desire\nfulfillment and pathway to=\r\n god. Desire fulfillment has nothing to do with\nmoksha and for moksha vasan=\r\nakshaya, desire elimination is needed. In this\nperspective you can understa=\r\nnd me better.\n\nWe need remedies to\nfulfill our desires which are blocked by=\r\n our own sins, curses, papa etc. So law\nof karma including devatas will not=\r\n forgive us for our sins; so where is the\nquestion of kindness, compassion?=\r\n Due to some past birth sins you don=E2=80=99t have\nthat much punya so you =\r\nhave to generate that by doing some rituals, japa etc. I\nthink you didn=E2=\r\n=80=99t read my aacharyavarana and shreyodana words in real sense\nthough yo=\r\nu know some vedic karmakanda concepts. To understand mediator think of\nwhol=\r\ne process of getting a job i.e. application, call letter, interview, perks\n=\r\nnegotiation etc. You want job so you do all these things; in the same way y=\r\nou\nneed solution for puzzle of your own karma so you must do all these thin=\r\ngs. I\naffirmed that you are also a mediator to all those who are doing homa=\r\n by\nfollowing your homa manuals. If you understand my affirmation it will b=\r\ne easy\nfor you to know real meaning of mediator. Mediator understand needs =\r\nof both\nparties as he is qualified, trained for that so he can show us way =\r\nto desire\nfulfillment. \n\nRegarding whether the\nresult is from the priest&#39;s =\r\naccount or deity&#39;s account, both viewpoints are\ncorrect in their own way. L=\r\net me elaborate. \n\nDeities are present in\nmicrocosmic form in everyone. Whe=\r\nn one prays to a deity and contemplates on the\ndeity&#39;s nature and\n\nqualitie=\r\ns, an interaction\noccurs between one&#39;s consciousness and the *microcosmic* =\r\nrepresentation of the\ndeity within one&#39;s\n\nconsciousness (which is\nidentical=\r\n to the [macro]cosmic deity!). A tangible result - material or\nspiritual - =\r\nmay occur as a result.\n\nOne can say that it is\nbestowed by the deity&#39;s krup=\r\na. One can also say that a veil in one&#39;s\nconsciousness has been removed,\n\na=\r\nllowed one to interact\nwith the microcosmic representation of the deity and=\r\n get some shakti (from the\ndeity). Whether you say\n\nthat one has accumulate=\r\nd\nshakti now or it is god&#39;s shakti is a matter of terminology. Bottomline i=\r\ns that\none could not access that shakti earlier (due to dense impurities in=\r\n one&#39;s\nconsciousness that blocked one&#39;s consciousness from interacting with=\r\n the\n\nmicrocosmic\nrepresentation of deity within one&#39;s consciousness). With=\r\n sadhana, those\nimpurities were removed and one could\n\naccess the shakti. A=\r\ns\nsimple as that. BTW, one may look at the word &quot;shakti&quot; in an egoistic\nway=\r\n, but shakti comes with humility\n\nand purity. Shakti is\nalmost synonymous t=\r\no purity.\n\nNow, the same holds for a\npriest. Just because one is born in a =\r\nspecific family, learnt to repeat a few\nsentences and a few actions, one&#39;s =\r\nconsciousness does not automatically have an\nopen access to the microcosmic=\r\n representation of the deity within it. One is born\nwith the same kind of v=\r\neil and needs to be develop purity to remove it. In the\nold days, most peop=\r\nle from the priestly class were very pure and had a free\naccess to the divi=\r\nnity within them. Unfortunately, though I have seen excellent\npriests, they=\r\n are a very very small minority today.\n\nTruth will always have\none face onl=\r\ny. We can=E2=80=99t say both sides of coin are same. Should we accept A+B=\r\n=3DC\nand A+B=3DD? I again replace word krupa by Prasad for better understan=\r\nding. Let\nus understand veil removal concept. Consider veil as a dark shado=\r\nw / covering\nof past karma. When we sit in closed room we don=E2=80=99t hav=\r\ne access to sunlight due\nto room walls, but if we come out of it we get lig=\r\nht. In same way room walls is\nour karma, sun is deity and the effort of com=\r\ning out of that room is Prayers.\nHere we don=E2=80=99t accumulate any shakt=\r\ni but our darkness is removed due to sunlight\nand in this light we can see =\r\nthings more clearly. Do we become stronger in sunlight?\nI don=E2=80=99t kno=\r\nw what you mean as shakthi i.e. purity; but if I understood\ncorrectly punya=\r\n and shakti are totally different things. By shakthi you can\nhave a standin=\r\ng to have negotiations with devata if you wish and by punya you\nhave ticket=\r\n for your aspirations in any birth. Do we have standing by doing\nsome japa =\r\netc for some years to have interaction with devata ? That really\nrequires =\r\n=C2=A0authority[=E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0]\ni.e=\r\n. a state of trans which comes from lot of penance in many births. There ar=\r\ne\nand were many pure, noble people by mind, heart but that is not a criteri=\r\non,\nqualification for devata interaction. Vasanakshaya [=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=\r\n=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=AF] up to\ncert=\r\nain extent,\ndepth of dharana is imp to have interaction with divine. Same h=\r\nolds good for yesterdays\nor today=E2=80=99s priests and that=E2=80=99s why =\r\nfruits were/are given by devatas from their\nbank balance. \n\nIf we say pries=\r\nt must\nhave shakti how can we count his nature of shakti in terms of qualit=\r\ny,\nquantity, depth and need? Should we consider shakti to beget baby, remov=\r\ne\ndiseases, give immense wealth is same?, how to differentiate priest with =\r\nand\nwithout shakthi, most imp who will differentiate priests with or withou=\r\nt\nshakti, what are the parameters to define this, what are the tools to\nund=\r\nerstand all these subtle points, etc will be the complex issues before\nyaja=\r\nmana/us when he/we think of doing any remedy. Do we have any universal\nsyst=\r\nem for this? If you think over these issues you will come to know the\ntruth=\r\n. If a priest perform a puja every third day he must have at least tons of\n=\r\nshakti to give results. Only person who is in unmani/trans avashta can have=\r\n\nsuch a huge shakti [even great sages don=E2=80=99t have such shakti as per=\r\n vishvamitra,\ntrishanku story] =C2=A0and such person will\nnot use his power=\r\n to wash sins of so many people unless asked by his superiors\nto do this. S=\r\nuch great shakthi is not accumulated in one birth and no wise man\nwill wast=\r\ne his shakti obtained from penances of so many births to wash sins of\npeopl=\r\ne for money. We read lot of stories of saints, sages refusing to change,\nin=\r\ntervene in prarbdhha of people. Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansa didn=E2=80=99t r=\r\nescue\nmathurbabu, akshay from death trap though he was having immense shakt=\r\ni. If you\ngive some serious thinking on this topic I hope you will understa=\r\nnd futility of\nshakti concept. Can you proclaim that predictions of all ast=\r\nrologers always\ncome true? Can you give guaranty that if there is X yoga th=\r\nere will be Y\nresults?=C2=A0 Today maximum astrologers are\nunable to give c=\r\norrect predictions so do you call for learning astrology on their\nown to fi=\r\nx remedies? Now a days many astrologers are giving fake remedies,\nwrong pre=\r\ndictions so will you say that don=E2=80=99t visit astrologers but learn\nast=\r\nrology to have remedies for your bad yogas in horoscope?=C2=A0 The main dut=\r\ny of priests is to have\nsubstantially good knowledge / practice of rituals,=\r\nmantras etc. with accuracy\nand not sadhana as a mortal human being can not =\r\nbless yajamana. That\nresponsibility rest with devatas; a divine powerhouse.=\r\n \n\n=C2=A0\n\nOne can disagree with me,\nbut cannot change the facts on the gro=\r\nund. Remedies done by most people with\nblind faith in priests do not work. =\r\nAs a result, generation after generation is\nlosing faith in god, in sanatan=\r\na dharma and in remedies. The current sorry\nstate of sanatana dharma cannot=\r\n be improved by sticking to the letter (of\northodoxy) and ignoring the spir=\r\nit (of shastras). If people directly put faith\nin god (instead of priests),=\r\n surrender to god and do small amount of sadhana\nthemselves, they will get =\r\nbetter results. If more and more people (possibly\nlaymen) do safe and effec=\r\ntive spiritual sadhanas such as homam and start to see\nthe material and spi=\r\nritual benefits, I am confident that eventually faith in\ngod and sanatana d=\r\nharma will be improved in the coming generations. The proof\nof the pudding =\r\nis in eating it. If you do a sadhana or remedy, there must be\nsome tangible=\r\n result. Either you get a desired goal or something related ot you\nsee a si=\r\ngnificant transformation in your attitude and thinking, or some such\nclear =\r\nresult. In their first meeting, do you know what Swami Vivekananda told\nhis=\r\n foremost disciple Sister Nivedita? He said, &quot;religion is not a matter\nof f=\r\naith. It is a matter of experience.&quot;\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI think we are discussing\npri=\r\nests, remedies, astrology etc so we should stick to this only. I understand=\r\n,\nappreciate your stress for sadhana, spreading of sanatana dharma principl=\r\nes but\nin doing so we must not spread wrong ideas or interpret scriptures i=\r\nn a wrong\nway. People do or get done remedies for fulfilling their desires =\r\nand at that\npoint they don=E2=80=99t need divine experiences; but they want=\r\n money, happiness, good\nhusband etc. If some body wants money desperately a=\r\nnd by doing remedy if he\ngets great peace of mind but no money; will he be =\r\nsatisfied? We need food,\nlove, happiness etc. to survive in this world and =\r\nmere peace can=E2=80=99t make us to\nsurvive.=C2=A0 People are loosing faith=\r\n in\ndharma, remedies due to nature of kaliyuga as low morals, more desires,=\r\n less\nfaith for almighty, fake spiritualists etc. will be a majority and no=\r\nt due to\nvedics or priests. Spiritual experiences come under the fourth pur=\r\nushartha i.e.\nmoksha and all remedies comes under other three purusharthas,=\r\n mainly dharma,\nartha and kama. \n\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt; WE, the jIvAs are\nnot beggars b=\r\nut anshA of GOD. ????? ???????\n\nWell, if, as you said,\nresults are bestowed=\r\n essentially due to the kindness and compassion (krupa) of\ngod, what is wro=\r\nng in\n\nbecoming a beggar for\nthem? Begging strangers on the street for a do=\r\nllar and begging god for his\n&quot;krupa&quot; are not the same and so\n\ndon&#39;t look at=\r\n the word\nbeggar with contempt.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI\ndidn=E2=80=99t looked word begga=\r\nr with contempt. You might have missed my last\nsentences like thousands wil=\r\nl read you and hundreds will follow you. Swami\nVivekananda every time criti=\r\ncized the words sins and sinner in some Christian\nprayers. He at that time =\r\nalways spoke of amrutasya putra. When your approach is\nnot correct how you =\r\nwill have good interaction and desired results? When we\nstand in front of g=\r\nod should we get bog down by our dharana [=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=\r\n=A3=E0=A4=BE]? See krupa and daya i.e.\nblessings and mercy are two differen=\r\nt things. When we call GOD we want HIM with\nhis krupa and when one begs he =\r\nonly wants alms with no need of his donor=E2=80=99s\nexistence. I think scho=\r\nlar of your status will understand my real meaning. =C2=A0=C2=A0\n\nDearNasim=\r\nha, either =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=\r\n=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=87\n=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=82=\r\n=E0=A4=A0=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=83 or =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87 =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=87\n=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=AC=E0=A5=\r\n=8B=E0=A4=A7=E0=A4=83=E0=A5=A4 To be\nfrank all this brain exercise is havin=\r\ng very little spiritual value and doing\nsadhana for self realization is the=\r\n key and that is the sole aim of all shruti,\nsmriti. But I posted an object=\r\nion only to request all members to have real\nunderstanding of true nature o=\r\nf above mentioned imp points as for me\nmaterialistic world is a part and pa=\r\nrcel of our existence; so materialistic\ndesires also.

We do all rituals through priests pleasing the devata due to=\r\n which we\nget prasada. Now this doesn=E2=80=99t include kindness, compassio=\r\nn qualities of devata\nand makes the understanding clear. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;&gt;From=\r\n my side this is due to mixing of religion and\nspirituality. Religion as a =\r\nwhole is for all four purusharthas i.e. dharma,\nartha, &lt;st1:place w:st=3D&quot;o=\r\nn&quot;&gt;kama&lt;/st1:place&gt; and moksha while spirituality is\nfor moksha only. In ot=\r\nher words you may think this as pathway to desire\nfulfillment and pathway t=\r\no god. Desire fulfillment has nothing to do with\nmoksha and for moksha vasa=\r\nnakshaya, desire elimination is needed. In this\nperspective you can underst=\r\nand me better.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot=\r\n;;&quot;&gt;We need remedies to\nfulfill our desires which are blocked by our own si=\r\nns, curses, papa etc. So law\nof karma including devatas will not forgive us=\r\n for our sins; so where is the\nquestion of kindness, compassion? Due to som=\r\ne past birth sins you don=E2=80=99t have\nthat much punya so you have to gen=\r\nerate that by doing some rituals, japa etc. I\nthink you didn=E2=80=99t read=\r\n my aacharyavarana and shreyodana words in real sense\nthough you know some =\r\nvedic karmakanda concepts. To understand mediator think of\nwhole process of=\r\n getting a job i.e. application, call letter, interview, perks\nnegotiation =\r\netc. You want job so you do all these things; in the same way you\nneed solu=\r\ntion for puzzle of your own karma so you must do all these things. I\naffirm=\r\ned that you are also a mediator to all those who are doing homa by\nfollowin=\r\ng your homa manuals. If you understand my affirmation it will be easy\nfor y=\r\nou to know real meaning of mediator. Mediator understand needs of both\npart=\r\nies as he is qualified, trained for that so he can show us way to desire\nfu=\r\nlfillment. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;&gt;Re=\r\ngarding whether the\nresult is from the priest&#39;s account or deity&#39;s account,=\r\n both viewpoints are\ncorrect in their own way.

The current sorry\nstate of sanatana dharma c=\r\nannot be improved by sticking to the letter (of\northodoxy) and ignoring the=\r\n spirit (of shastras). If people directly put faith\nin god (instead of prie=\r\nsts), surrender to god and do small amount of sadhana\nthemselves, they will=\r\n get better results. If more and more people (possibly\nlaymen) do safe and =\r\neffective spiritual sadhanas such as homam and start to see\nthe material an=\r\nd spiritual benefits, I am confident that eventually faith in\ngod and sanat=\r\nana dharma will be improved in the coming generations. The proof\nof the pud=\r\nding is in eating it. If you do a sadhana or remedy, there must be\nsome tan=\r\ngible result. Either you get a desired goal or something related ot you\nsee=\r\n a significant transformation in your attitude and thinking, or some such\nc=\r\nlear result. In their first meeting, do you know what Swami Vivekananda tol=\r\nd\nhis foremost disciple Sister Nivedita? He said, &quot;religion is not a matter=\r\n\nof faith.

I understand,\nappreciate your stress for=\r\n sadhana, spreading of sanatana dharma principles but\nin doing so we must n=\r\not spread wrong ideas or interpret scriptures in a wrong\nway. People do or =\r\nget done remedies for fulfilling their desires and at that\npoint they don=\r\n=E2=80=99t need divine experiences; but they want money, happiness, good\nhu=\r\nsband etc. If some body wants money desperately and by doing remedy if he\ng=\r\nets great peace of mind but no money; will he be satisfied?
