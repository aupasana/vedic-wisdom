All the beads (54) are gray colored excep=\r\nt\none which is bright red/orange and is included like a pendant.\n\nI was rea=\r\nding one of the posts in Mid Dec about a similar topic.\nBut I have some eve=\r\nn more basic questions. Apologies for raising this\ntopic again.\n\nQ) What is=\r\n &quot;Crossing the Meru&quot;. Reading more about this, got me\nconcerned - Just woul=\r\nd like to get full practical understanding.\nPlease explain this in detail. =\r\n\n\nQ) Does the Japa mala go clockwise or counter clockwise.?\n\nQ) Usually we =\r\nare supposed to do 108 (or multiples) japa - So in my\ncase after 54 should =\r\nI turn back (reverse) the direction or reverse\nthe mala.\n\nQ) Is it okay to =\r\nwear the japa mala on a regular basis. I would rather\nwear it than keep it =\r\ndown or away or get mishandled.\nThis japa mala spent some time at Mantralay=\r\na Moola Brindavanam and is\ngiven to me by the Pontiff.\n\nAny help/directions=\r\n on these questions is highly appreciated.\n\nThanks\nShrikanth\n\n\n\n"}}
