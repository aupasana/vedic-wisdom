I had visited one Gentleman in 1980 who was curing the patie=\r\nnts by\nsimply their photographs. He was demamding photo of the patient. He =\r\nhad\npasted Gayatri Mantra sticker on all the three wings of a table fan and=\r\n\nhe was keeping the photograph of the patient just opposit the fan. He\nwas =\r\nswitching his fan on for 1 or 2 hours daily for couple of days and\nas per h=\r\nis say, he was throwing the vibrations of Gayatri Mantra\ndirectly to the ph=\r\notograph. He was claiming that he has cured so many\npatients by Gayatri Man=\r\ntra vibrations.\n\n2. Some people are arranging some Mantra cassette or CD in=\r\n their worship\nroom and playing them for couple of hours daily and believin=\r\ng that the\nroom is charged due to Mantra vibrations. Some are playing these=\r\n type of\nCDs in their Car to get protection from accidents and like. All ar=\r\ne\ndoing these as per their believes.\n\n    What I want to know from you Sir =\r\nis whether this is really working?\nCan anybody be cured by  Gayatri Mantra-=\r\nwritten Fan?\n\n   Can a CD or Cassette create vibrations? If someone is slee=\r\nping in the\nroom where whole night one CD of a cerain Mantra is played. The=\r\n person\nis unaware of it. Whether Mantra will crerate any positive effect o=\r\nn\nhim?\n\nDr. Ashwin Rawal\n\n\r\n--1-4407344579-1190367452=:8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana&quot;&gt;Dear Sir, &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;1=\r\n.
