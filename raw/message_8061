Arjuna is held in great respect at other place=\r\ns as well. The whole Kshetra of Badrinath is known as the Nara -Narayana ks=\r\nhetra. Arjuna is the Mahamuni Nara who meditated at the same spot.\n\nOne can=\r\nnot and should not attempt to determine the state of mind of such a giant b=\r\nased on a few intrepreted principles.\n\n:) In what way would it help the spi=\r\nritual development of any other person to measure one&#39;s progress using the =\r\nsupposed actions of some spiritual giant in another century.Also the story =\r\ngets distorted with time.Like Ajit ji said &quot; Only a Jivanmukta can recogniz=\r\ne a Jivanmukta&quot;.\n\nRegards\nVemparla RamKishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  Obv=\r\niously Arjuna  is not jeevanmukta\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Poor Arjuna is taking a beating i=\r\nn this thread !\n&gt; \n&gt; One&#39;s state of mind determines whether or not one is a=\r\n jivanmukta. And\n&gt; since we cannot judge someone&#39;s state of mind, we cannot=\r\n make any\n&gt; assertions about whether or not one is a jivanmukta, be he a sa=\r\nint or a\n&gt; sinner. Traditionalists say that only a jivanmukta can recognize=\r\n a\n&gt; jivanmukta.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspected that Vasishtha may have had something to =\r\nsay about Arjuna, and\n&gt; took a quick look in the Yoga Vasishtha. Indeed, he=\r\n declares Arjuna to be a\n&gt; mahAbahu, mahAmuni and a jIvanmukta.\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneh=\r\nam,\n&gt; \n&gt;    ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
