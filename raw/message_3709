He hailed from Andhra Pradesh and was a Brahmin. In=\r\n his youth he\nhad already written literary works and could speak and write =\r\nSanskrit\nfluently at the age of fourteen.When he was 22 he took part in a m=\r\neeting of\nlearned Sanskrit scholars and writers, he was awarded the title K=\r\navya-Kantha\n(one from whose throat poetry arises spontaneously) because of =\r\nhis\nvirtuosity in poetical improvisation.\n\nIn 1903 he came to Tiruvannamala=\r\ni for the first time to practise intense\ntapas (spiritual ascetic exercises=\r\n). He stayed for one year and during that\ntime he twice visited the Swami, =\r\nwho was approximately the same age as\nhimself. On both occasions his erudit=\r\nion was noticed. Finally he took up the\npost of school teacher at Vellore.\n=\r\nBut it was the renewal of India which was closest to his heart and to which=\r\n\nhe devoted most of his energy. Through intense tapas, in particular throug=\r\nh\nmantra japa, he believed he would obtain the energy required to achieve t=\r\nhis\ngoal. He dreamed of an ideal society based on the Vedas, in which there=\r\n\nwould be material prosperity\nand social justice as well as spirituality. H=\r\ne used to hold long public\ndiscourses on this theme and soon gained a circl=\r\ne of followers.\n\nIt was on the ninth day of the Kartikai festival, 18th Nov=\r\nember 1907 at\nabout half past one, when, in the midday heat, he climbed up =\r\nthe hill to the\nVirupaksha Cave. He was trembling with emotion.The young Sw=\r\nami was seated\nalone in front of his cave. Although,because of the festival=\r\n, there were\ncrowds of people everywhere,there was nobody at all near the S=\r\nwami. Even\nPalaniswami was not there. Ganapati Muni fell prostrate on the g=\r\nround,\ngrasped Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s feet with both hands and uttered trembl=\r\ning, =E2=80=9CAll that\nhas to be read I have read. Even Vedanta Sastra [the=\r\n holy scriptures of\nVedanta] I have fully understood. I have performed japa=\r\n to my heart=E2=80=99s\ncontent. Yet I have not up to this time understood w=\r\nhat tapas is. Hence have\nI sought refuge at thy feet. Pray enlighten me abo=\r\nut the nature of tapas.=E2=80=9D\n\nFor 15 minutes the Swami kept silent and =\r\nlooked at Ganapati, who sat at his\nfeet full of expectation. Then he answer=\r\ned, =E2=80=9CIf one watches whence this\nnotion of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 sprin=\r\ngs, the mind will be absorbed into that. That is tapas.\nIf a mantra is repe=\r\nated, and attention directed to the source whence the\nmantra-sound is produ=\r\nced, the mind will be absorbed in that. That is tapas.=E2=80=9D\n\nThis was t=\r\nhe first time that Sri Ramana gave a verbal answer to a\nquestion. Until\nthe=\r\nn he had kept silent and had always written the answers down. It is\nremarka=\r\nble how he led the mantra practice of his new disciple back to the\nmethod o=\r\nf Self-enquiry. For Ganapati Muni this was a real revelation. His\nheart was=\r\n filled with ecstatic joy and he meditated at the feet of his new\nmaster un=\r\ntil the evening.\n\nThe following day Ganapati Muni wrote full of enthusiasm =\r\nto his family and\nhis disciples, =E2=80=9CI have found my Master, my Guru. =\r\nHe is the Sage of\nArunachala known as Brahmanaswami. He is no ordinary Swam=\r\ni. He is a great\nSeer, a mighty spiritual personality. To me and to you all=\r\n he is Bhagavan\nSri Ramana Maharshi [elevated great Seer Ramana]. Let the w=\r\nhole world know\nhim as such.=E2=80=9D\n\nFrom that moment on the Swami became=\r\n known as the Maharshi,Bhagavan or\nsimply Ramana. Ganapati Muni and his fol=\r\nlowers made Sri Ramana known to a\nwide circle in India.\n\nGanapati Muni spen=\r\nt his whole life moving around and was often accompanied\nby his wife Visala=\r\nkshi, who also led a spiritual life.\n\nThe relationship between them remaine=\r\nd close all their lives. Sri Ramana\ncalled Ganapati Muni by the pet name Na=\r\nyana, which his disciples also used.\nThe Telugu word Nayana is used to addr=\r\ness one=E2=80=99s father as well as one=E2=80=99s\ndisciple and one=E2=80=99=\r\ns child.\n\nGanapati Muni died in 1936, aged 58, in Kharagpur, West-Bengal,wh=\r\nere his\ndevotees had built an ashram for him. When Ramana was informed abou=\r\nt his\ndeath by telegram, he said, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes, =\r\n=E2=80=9CWhere\ncan we find another like him?=E2=80=9D\n\nSome of the other sa=\r\ndhus who lived on the mountain, watched Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s\nincreasing fam=\r\ne with suspicion and envy. An elderly sadhu felt particularly\nenvious and w=\r\nanted to drive Ramana out of the Virupaksha Cave. He threw some\nrocks over =\r\na ledge at the young Swami sitting under it, but they missed.\nWhen the sadh=\r\nu tried it again, Ramana got up and caught him. But the sadhu\nonly laughed =\r\nand said that it was meant only as an innocent joke. Without\nrebuking him R=\r\namana let him go.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriel=\r\ne Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b2ac86a3ad3f047f756bf0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Ganapati Sastri, also called Ga=\r\nnapati Muni =E2=80=93 Muni means the wise,the scholar, the saint =E2=80=93 =\r\nwas the most famous and erudite of Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s disciples.
