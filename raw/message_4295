(1064)\n\nP=\r\nerfect Jnanis have always and will always say, =E2=80=9CBy the mere Grace o=\r\nf the\nSadguru, the Ture Thing =E2=80=93 the final Brahma-Jnana, which shine=\r\ns in the pure\nSilence, the rarely attainable Vedanta =E2=80=93 will dawn of=\r\n its own accord in the\nheart as I =E2=80=98-I=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D (287)\n\nTho=\r\nse who do not know through Self-enquiry what is the truth of their\nnatural =\r\nstate (Self) mistake the alien body to be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and see the w=\r\norld as\ndifferent from themselves and hence suffer in delusion. All other t=\r\nhings\nexcept that (=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99), which shines as the one undeluded\n=\r\nExistence-Consciousness-Bliss (Sat-chit-ananda), are seen on account of the=\r\n\ndeceitful play of Maya. (430)\n\nSince the nature of Reality is non-dual (i.=\r\ne, not two), true knowledge\ncannot be the knowing of another. Therefore, wh=\r\nen the mind is absolutely\nfree from delusion (i.e., does not know another) =\r\nand abides unwavering in\nbeatitude =E2=80=93 that is the true Knowledge. (4=\r\n37)\n\nBliss will surge forth in the heart which is soaked in the experience =\r\nof the\nlove-suffused true knowledge (mey-jnana). Misery-creating, delusion-=\r\ncaused\ndesire will not exist there. The extremely pure natural like of Self=\r\n will be\nfull of peace. (1093)\n\nOn being asked by a devotee as to why He ac=\r\ncepted their pranaam when all\nwere the one Siva, Bhagavan replied: But why =\r\nshouldn=E2=80=99t I ? Before they\nprostrate themselves in front of this bod=\r\ny I prostrate myself before the\nSiva in each of them.\n\nInstead of keenly en=\r\nquiring =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 within the Heart =E2=80=93 the rising p=\r\nlace\nof thought, where the divine Thing, Siva, shines devoid of thought =E2=\r\n=80=93 and\nknowing It (the divine Thing), merging into It and becoming one =\r\nwith It as\n=E2=80=98I am That=E2=80=99, it is foolish to slip down from the=\r\n Self. (609)\n\nAll other knowledges are defective and petty; the experience =\r\nof Silence\n(i.e. Self-Knowledge) is alone Perfect Knowledge. The different =\r\nobjective\nknowledges are merely superimposed on Self, the Pure Knowledge, a=\r\nnd hence\nthey are not true. (422)\n\nThose who do not know themselves to be t=\r\nhe one (non-dual) Self will perish\ndaily, vainly suffering in fear (because=\r\n of seeing the world as something\nother than themselves). (Therefore) destr=\r\noying the notion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99,\nthe root (of all misery),=\r\n by gaining the firm knowledge of your real Self,\nattain the state of non-d=\r\nuality (advaita). (955)\n\nFor those who say that He (God) does exist, He exi=\r\nsts in (their) heart as\nconsciousness. (But) in the venomous mind (of those=\r\n who do not believe in\nHim), He will never exist (that is, He will never sh=\r\nine or be known). If, by\npurifying the venomous mind, one sees without delu=\r\nsion, He will shine\ntriumphantly and unalloyed as Self. (1083)\n\nAttention t=\r\no one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is ever shining as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, the=\r\n one undivided\nand pure Reality, is the only raft with which the jive, who =\r\nis deluded by\nthinking =E2=80=9CI am the body=E2=80=9D, can cross the ocean=\r\n of unending births. (294)\n\nThe false delusion of the jiva can never be los=\r\nt, unless Self =E2=80=93 the pure\nSat-Chit, which is the one Reality ever s=\r\nhining within, without a second =E2=80=93\nis realised. (295)\n\nO mind, inste=\r\nad of looking at and thereby worrying about that which is\nimagined (the wor=\r\nld), turn towards your source and enter the Heart. In that\nsupreme state of=\r\n consciousness, all (that you were seeking before) will\nbecome the one non-=\r\ndual Self, your real nature. (785)\n\nWhoever meditates upon Self in whatever=\r\n bhava (i.e, in whatever form or with\nwhatever feeling of relationship), at=\r\ntains It only in that bhava (i.e, in a\nqualified or saguna manner). Those p=\r\neaceful ones who remain quiet without\nany such bhava, attain the noble and =\r\nunqualified state of Kaivalya (the\nnirguna state of Self). (739)\n\nSince agi=\r\ntation (or confusion) will never rise without (the rising of) the\nfeeling =\r\n=E2=80=98I am only the body=E2=80=99 (the ego) in the heart, one whose tend=\r\nencies\n(vasanas) =E2=80=93 (which are the form of) the ego or mind =E2=80=\r\n=93 are dead will not be\nmentally agitated (or confused) even in dream. (11=\r\n31)\n\nSuch a True Seeing, which is devoid of illusion and deception, is the =\r\nState\nin which one shines as the Ocean of Bliss. Only in the Supreme Silenc=\r\ne which\nis thus achieved in Self-Abidance, will be soul never again have a =\r\ndownfall.\n(350)\n\nOnly the truth of Self is worthy of being scrutinized and =\r\nknown. Taking It\nalone as the aim, one should keenly attend to It and know =\r\nIt in the heart\n(i.e. within). It can be known only by the silent and clear=\r\n mind which is\nfree from agitation and activity. (433)\n\nWhen the delusive m=\r\nind which sees differences drowns and dies in the state\nof Self, the one ex=\r\nistence-consciousness (Sat-Chit), all the delusive\ndifference will also tur=\r\nn out to be nothing but the consciousness (chit) of\nBrahman (Self), the exi=\r\nstence (sat). (580)\n\nThe consciousness of the extremely pure Self-experienc=\r\ne =E2=80=93 which silently\nexists devoid of both =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =\r\n=E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 in one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is the one\nbright r=\r\neality, that which exists devoid of defects =E2=80=93 alone is that which\ns=\r\nhines above (all). (1068)\n\nThe One Supreme Bliss, =E2=80=98Sadhasivam=E2=80=\r\n=99 (i.e, Self) is alone approved (by\nJnanis) to be the Whole Reality. This=\r\n world, seem as full of miseries and\ndefects, is known only by the mind whi=\r\nch is unreal and divided with\ndifferences. (66)\n\nHe whose delusive ego (com=\r\npletely) subsides and becomes one with existence\nconsciousness, will cease =\r\nfrom making the effort of starting (any action or\nkarma) and will shine in =\r\nthe Heart, having attained the natural and peaceful\nstate of bliss. (864)\n\n=\r\nGive up all attachments towards the petty sense-objects (vishayas), which\na=\r\nre caused by the delusion =E2=80=98I am this fleshy body=E2=80=99. The sile=\r\nnt mind (thus\nstilled by renouncing sense-objects) is the pure mani-lingam =\r\n(superior form\nof Sivalingam). If this is adored (i.e, if this mental silen=\r\nce is carefully\npreserved with great love, which is the real worship of it)=\r\n, it will bestow\nunending bliss. (517)\n\nWhen the mind which wanders outside=\r\n, knowing only other objects (2nd and 3rd\npersons) =E2=80=93 beings to atte=\r\nnd to its own nature, all other objects will\ndisappear, and then, by experi=\r\nencing it=E2=80=99s own true nature (i.e. Self), the\npseudo =E2=80=93 =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 will also die. (193)\n\nDo not make any real and firm effort=\r\n except to annihilate the feeling =E2=80=98I am\nthe body=E2=80=99 (the ego)=\r\n. Know that the ego, =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, is the sole cause\nof =\r\nall samsara-dukha (the miseries of life). (846)\n\n(By confronting it) no one=\r\n can destroy the (mind=E2=80=99s) nature (of rising and\njumping out through=\r\n the senses). (The only way to destroy it is to) ignore\nit as something non=\r\n-existent (i.e, as a mere false appearance). If you know\nand consciously ab=\r\nide in Self, the base (for the rising and setting) of the\n(mind=E2=80=99s) =\r\nnature, the velocity of the (mind=E2=80=99s) nature (i.e, the velocity with=\r\n\nwhich it rises and jumps out through the senses) will gradually come to an=\r\n\nend (since there will be no one to attend to it). (921)\n\nWhen the feeling =\r\n=E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 (dehatma-buddhi) goes, the delusive\nconfusi=\r\non and anxieties will end. Aha! The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 shinning in the hea=\r\nrt in\nwhich enquiry is conducted, is the sans difference supreme consciousn=\r\ness\n(nirvikalpa chit-param). (866)\n\nHe (i.e, Self) who exists as the form o=\r\nf consciousness, will not become\nnon-existent. If one remains devoid of oth=\r\ner knowledge, (that is) if the\ndeceptive, unreal and dual imaginations (sup=\r\nerimposed) on consciousness are\nremoved, for oneself who (thus) exists as (=\r\nmere) consciousness there will be\nno destruction. (981)\n\nThat knowledge is =\r\nnot a quality (guna) of Self, because the nature of Self\nis nirguna (devoid=\r\n of qualities). (moreover) Self-knowledge is not an act\n(of knowing), becau=\r\nse (Self is) without doership (akartritva. (Therefore)\nknowledge is the ver=\r\ny nature (of Self). (1038)\n\nReality is only one. Know that firm, whole perf=\r\nect reality alone is that\nwhich is described in many ways by Brahma-jnanis,=\r\n who have known (it) by\nquietly entering the heart with a very subtle intel=\r\nlect. (1234)\n\nThe reality which is the mere consciousness (one one=E2=80=99=\r\ns own existence) that\nremains when ignorance (of objects) is destroyed alon=\r\ng with knowledge (of\nobjects), alone is Self (atma). In that Brahma-swarupa=\r\n, which is abundant\nSelf-awareness (prajnana), there is not the least ignor=\r\nance (ajnana). Know\nthus. (1036)\n\nThe projected picture of this world of tr=\r\niads is a play of Chit-Para-Shakti\n(i.e. the power or reflected light of Se=\r\nlf-Consciousness) on the screen of\nSupreme Consciousness. (43)\n\nHe who has =\r\nattained the life of a Jnani in the heart, will not derive the\nleast pleasu=\r\nre from the life of the fleshy body and the petty (five) senses.\nIs not tha=\r\nt life of Silence itself the unlimited and unbroken experience of\n(the blis=\r\ns of) the supreme Brahman? (1120)\n\nThere is One who governs the world, and =\r\nit is His lookout to look after the\nworld. He who has given life to the wor=\r\nld knows how to look after it also.\nHe bears the burden of the world, not y=\r\nou.\n\nThis whole world of triads which deludes us, seeming to be an undisput=\r\nable\nreality, is only the form of the Supreme Power (Chit-Shakti), which ab=\r\nides\neternally as none other than the Supreme Self. (48)\n\nTo know the sense=\r\n-objects as true instead of knowing the truth of the seer\nis due to ignoran=\r\nce born of false delusion. The True Knowledge is not\nlearning all the arts =\r\nwhich you want to know, the imaginary relative\nknowledge in Self-Knowledge =\r\n(420)\n\nAll kinds of knowledge (even the knowledge of all the arts and scien=\r\nces)\nwill completely merge into the Silence =E2=80=93 the pure knowledge of=\r\n Self. All\nother states (as well as knowledges) appear to exist only becaus=\r\ne of the\nplay of Chit-Sakti (the knowing power, i.e. the mind), which exist=\r\ns in Self,\nthe supreme and natural state of Bliss. (434)\n\nThe true, love-su=\r\nffused life of abiding unobstructedly in the heart as one=E2=80=99s\nown rea=\r\nlity alone is the beauty if Jnana, the enjoyment of the nature of\n(Siva swa=\r\nrupa-bhoga), in which the unreal and delusive ego, which prevailed\n(formerl=\r\ny), has been destroyed. (1091)\n\nFor the Jnani, who, free from the =E2=80=98=\r\nI-am-the-body=E2=80=99 idea, is established in\nSelf, this world shines as H=\r\nis own Self-Knowledge; and therefore it is wrong\nfor us to see it as someth=\r\ning different (i.e, as multiple names and forms).\n(59)\n\nKnow well that the =\r\nexperience of Bliss exists only in Self and never in this\nlife of delusion,=\r\n and hence achieve Self-Knowledge, which is the Space of\nGrace and the fina=\r\nl state of Supreme Silence. (238)\n\nThe true form (nature) of God (Self) can=\r\nnot be understood except by the mind\nwhich stands firmly still in nishta (S=\r\nelf-abidance or samadhi). Therefore,\nwithout allowing the mind either to wa=\r\nnder as a vagabond (i.e. to undergo\nwaking and dream =E2=80=93 sakala) or t=\r\no fall into laya (i.e, to fall into sleep =E2=80=93\nkevala) due to tirednes=\r\ns, train the mind to be conscious and still on one\ntarget (Self). (516)\n\nWh=\r\nen the ego, the feeling of being separate entity, is removed, chittam\nremai=\r\nns as Shivam, the Supreme Chit, having merged within the Heart as =E2=80=9C=\r\nI am\nConsciousness Itself=E2=80=9D, and having thus destroyed all the false=\r\n and dense\nmental conceptions.

(1064)&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;Perfect Jnanis have always and will always say, =E2=80=9CBy the mere G=\r\nrace of the Sadguru, the Ture Thing =E2=80=93 the final Brahma-Jnana, which=\r\n shines in the pure Silence, the rarely attainable Vedanta =E2=80=93 will d=\r\nawn of its own accord in the heart as I =E2=80=98-I=E2=80=99.=E2=80=9D (287=\r\n)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Those who do not know through S=\r\nelf-enquiry what is the truth of their natural state (Self) mistake the ali=\r\nen body to be =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and see the world as different from thems=\r\nelves and hence suffer in delusion. All other things except that (=E2=80=98=\r\nI=E2=80=99), which shines as the one undeluded Existence-Consciousness-Blis=\r\ns (Sat-chit-ananda), are seen on account of the deceitful play of Maya. (43=\r\n0)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Since the nature of Reality is non-dual (i.e, not two), =\r\ntrue knowledge cannot be the knowing of another. Therefore, when the mind i=\r\ns absolutely free from delusion (i.e., does not know another) and abides un=\r\nwavering in beatitude =E2=80=93 that is the true Knowledge. (437)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nBliss will surge forth in the heart which is soaked in the experience of th=\r\ne love-suffused true knowledge (mey-jnana). Misery-creating, delusion-cause=\r\nd desire will not exist there. The extremely pure natural like of Self will=\r\n be full of peace. (1093)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On being asked by a devotee as to why He=\r\n accepted their pranaam when all were the one Siva, Bhagavan replied: But w=\r\nhy shouldn=E2=80=99t I ? Before they prostrate themselves in front of this =\r\nbody I prostrate myself before the Siva in each of them.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Instead o=\r\nf keenly enquiring =E2=80=98Who am I?=E2=80=99 within the Heart =E2=80=93 t=\r\nhe rising place of thought, where the divine Thing, Siva, shines devoid of =\r\nthought =E2=80=93 and knowing It (the divine Thing), merging into It and be=\r\ncoming one with It as =E2=80=98I am That=E2=80=99, it is foolish to slip do=\r\nwn from the Self. (609)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;All other knowledges are defective and pet=\r\nty; the experience of Silence (i.e. Self-Knowledge) is alone Perfect Knowle=\r\ndge. The different objective knowledges are merely superimposed on Self, th=\r\ne Pure Knowledge, and hence they are not true. (422)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Those who do not know themselves to be the one (non-d=\r\nual) Self will perish daily, vainly suffering in fear (because of seeing th=\r\ne world as something other than themselves). (Therefore) destroying the not=\r\nion =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, the root (of all misery), by gaining t=\r\nhe firm knowledge of your real Self, attain the state of non-duality (advai=\r\nta). (955)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For those who say that He (God) does exist, He e=\r\nxists in (their) heart as consciousness. (But) in the venomous mind (of tho=\r\nse who do not believe in Him), He will never exist (that is, He will never =\r\nshine or be known). If, by purifying the venomous mind, one sees without de=\r\nlusion, He will shine triumphantly and unalloyed as Self. (1083)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nttention to one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is ever shining as =E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99, the one undivided and pure Reality, is the only raft with which the=\r\n jive, who is deluded by thinking =E2=80=9CI am the body=E2=80=9D, can cros=\r\ns the ocean of unending births. (294)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The false delusion of the ji=\r\nva can never be lost, unless Self =E2=80=93 the pure Sat-Chit, which is the=\r\n one Reality ever shining within, without a second =E2=80=93 is realised. (=\r\n295)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;O mind, instead of looking at =\r\nand thereby worrying about that which is imagined (the world), turn towards=\r\n your source and enter the Heart. In that supreme state of consciousness, a=\r\nll (that you were seeking before) will become the one non-dual Self, your r=\r\neal nature. (785)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whoever meditates upon Self in whatever b=\r\nhava (i.e, in whatever form or with whatever feeling of relationship), atta=\r\nins It only in that bhava (i.e, in a qualified or saguna manner). Those pea=\r\nceful ones who remain quiet without any such bhava, attain the noble and un=\r\nqualified state of Kaivalya (the nirguna state of Self). (739)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Since agitation (or confusion) will never ris=\r\ne without (the rising of) the feeling =E2=80=98I am only the body=E2=80=99 =\r\n(the ego) in the heart, one whose tendencies (vasanas) =E2=80=93 (which are=\r\n the form of) the ego or mind =E2=80=93 are dead will not be mentally agita=\r\nted (or confused) even in dream. (1131)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Such a True Seeing,=\r\n which is devoid of illusion and deception, is the State in which one shine=\r\ns as the Ocean of Bliss. Only in the Supreme Silence which is thus achieved=\r\n in Self-Abidance, will be soul never again have a downfall. (350)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Only the truth of Self is worthy of being scrutinized and known. Taking It=\r\n alone as the aim, one should keenly attend to It and know It in the heart =\r\n(i.e. within). It can be known only by the silent and clear mind which is f=\r\nree from agitation and activity. (433)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When the delusive mind whic=\r\nh sees differences drowns and dies in the state of Self, the one existence-=\r\nconsciousness (Sat-Chit), all the delusive difference will also turn out to=\r\n be nothing but the consciousness (chit) of Brahman (Self), the existence (=\r\nsat). (580)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The consciousness of the extremely pure Self-experienc=\r\ne =E2=80=93 which silently exists devoid of both =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =\r\n=E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 in one=E2=80=99s own Self, which is the one bright r=\r\neality, that which exists devoid of defects =E2=80=93 alone is that which s=\r\nhines above (all). (1068)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The One=\r\n Supreme Bliss, =E2=80=98Sadhasivam=E2=80=99 (i.e, Self) is alone approved =\r\n(by Jnanis) to be the Whole Reality. This world, seem as full of miseries a=\r\nnd defects, is known only by the mind which is unreal and divided with diff=\r\nerences. (66)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He whose delusive ego (completely) subsides a=\r\nnd becomes one with existence consciousness, will cease from making the eff=\r\nort of starting (any action or karma) and will shine in the Heart, having a=\r\nttained the natural and peaceful state of bliss. (864)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Give up all=\r\n attachments towards the petty sense-objects (vishayas), which are caused b=\r\ny the delusion =E2=80=98I am this fleshy body=E2=80=99. The silent mind (th=\r\nus stilled by renouncing sense-objects) is the pure mani-lingam (superior f=\r\norm of Sivalingam). If this is adored (i.e, if this mental silence is caref=\r\nully preserved with great love, which is the real worship of it), it will b=\r\nestow unending bliss. (517)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When the mind which wanders outside, k=\r\nnowing only other objects (2nd and 3rd persons) =E2=80=93 beings to attend =\r\nto its own nature, all other objects will disappear, and then, by experienc=\r\ning it=E2=80=99s own true nature (i.e. Self), the pseudo =E2=80=93 =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 will also die. (193)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;Do not make any real and firm effort except to annihilate the feeling =E2=\r\n=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 (the ego). Know that the ego, =E2=80=98I am th=\r\ne body=E2=80=99, is the sole cause of all samsara-dukha (the miseries of li=\r\nfe). (846)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;(By confronting it) no one can destroy the (mind=\r\n=E2=80=99s) nature (of rising and jumping out through the senses). (The onl=\r\ny way to destroy it is to) ignore it as something non-existent (i.e, as a m=\r\nere false appearance). If you know and consciously abide in Self, the base =\r\n(for the rising and setting) of the (mind=E2=80=99s) nature, the velocity o=\r\nf the (mind=E2=80=99s) nature (i.e, the velocity with which it rises and ju=\r\nmps out through the senses) will gradually come to an end (since there will=\r\n be no one to attend to it). (921)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When the feeling =E2=80=98I am =\r\nthe body=E2=80=99 (dehatma-buddhi) goes, the delusive confusion and anxieti=\r\nes will end. Aha! The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 shinning in the heart in which en=\r\nquiry is conducted, is the sans difference supreme consciousness (nirvikalp=\r\na chit-param). (866)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He (i.e, Self) who exists as the form of cons=\r\nciousness, will not become non-existent. If one remains devoid of other kno=\r\nwledge, (that is) if the deceptive, unreal and dual imaginations (superimpo=\r\nsed) on consciousness are removed, for oneself who (thus) exists as (mere) =\r\nconsciousness there will be no destruction. (981)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That knowledge i=\r\ns not a quality (guna) of Self, because the nature of Self is nirguna (devo=\r\nid of qualities). (moreover) Self-knowledge is not an act (of knowing), bec=\r\nause (Self is) without doership (akartritva. (Therefore) knowledge is the v=\r\nery nature (of Self). (1038)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Reality is only one. Know that firm, =\r\nwhole perfect reality alone is that which is described in many ways by Brah=\r\nma-jnanis, who have known (it) by quietly entering the heart with a very su=\r\nbtle intellect. (1234)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nThe reality which is the mere consciousness=\r\n (one one=E2=80=99s own existence) that remains when ignorance (of objects)=\r\n is destroyed along with knowledge (of objects), alone is Self (atma). In t=\r\nhat Brahma-swarupa, which is abundant Self-awareness (prajnana), there is n=\r\not the least ignorance (ajnana). Know thus. (1036)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The projected p=\r\nicture of this world of triads is a play of Chit-Para-Shakti (i.e. the powe=\r\nr or reflected light of Self-Consciousness) on the screen of Supreme Consci=\r\nousness. (43)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He who has attained t=\r\nhe life of a Jnani in the heart, will not derive the least pleasure from th=\r\ne life of the fleshy body and the petty (five) senses. Is not that life of =\r\nSilence itself the unlimited and unbroken experience of (the bliss of) the =\r\nsupreme Brahman? (1120)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Th=\r\nere is One who governs the world, and it is His lookout to look after the w=\r\norld. He who has given life to the world knows how to look after it also. H=\r\ne bears the burden of the world, not you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This whole world =\r\nof triads which deludes us, seeming to be an undisputable reality, is only =\r\nthe form of the Supreme Power (Chit-Shakti), which abides eternally as none=\r\n other than the Supreme Self. (48)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To know the sense-objects as true=\r\n instead of knowing the truth of the seer is due to ignorance born of false=\r\n delusion. The True Knowledge is not learning all the arts which you want t=\r\no know, the imaginary relative knowledge in Self-Knowledge (420)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nll kinds of knowledge (even the knowledge of all the arts and sciences) wil=\r\nl completely merge into the Silence =E2=80=93 the pure knowledge of Self. A=\r\nll other states (as well as knowledges) appear to exist only because of the=\r\n play of Chit-Sakti (the knowing power, i.e. the mind), which exists in Sel=\r\nf, the supreme and natural state of Bliss. (434)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The true, love-su=\r\nffused life of abiding unobstructedly in the heart as one=E2=80=99s own rea=\r\nlity alone is the beauty if Jnana, the enjoyment of the nature of (Siva swa=\r\nrupa-bhoga), in which the unreal and delusive ego, which prevailed (formerl=\r\ny), has been destroyed. (1091)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For the Jnani, who, free from the =\r\n=E2=80=98I-am-the-body=E2=80=99 idea, is established in Self, this world sh=\r\nines as His own Self-Knowledge; and therefore it is wrong for us to see it =\r\nas something different (i.e, as multiple names and forms). (59)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Kn=\r\now well that the experience of Bliss exists only in Self and never in this =\r\nlife of delusion, and hence achieve Self-Knowledge, which is the Space of G=\r\nrace and the final state of Supreme Silence. (238)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The true form (nature) of God (Self) cannot be understood e=\r\nxcept by the mind which stands firmly still in nishta (Self-abidance or sam=\r\nadhi). Therefore, without allowing the mind either to wander as a vagabond =\r\n(i.e. to undergo waking and dream =E2=80=93 sakala) or to fall into laya (i=\r\n.e, to fall into sleep =E2=80=93 kevala) due to tiredness, train the mind t=\r\no be conscious and still on one target (Self). (516)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When t=\r\nhe ego, the feeling of being separate entity, is removed, chittam remains a=\r\ns Shivam, the Supreme Chit, having merged within the Heart as =E2=80=9CI am=\r\n Consciousness Itself=E2=80=9D, and having thus destroyed all the false and=\r\n dense mental conceptions.
