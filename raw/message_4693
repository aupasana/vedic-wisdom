One week later,Munagala S. Venkataramiah, later known as\nRaman=\r\nananda Saraswati, went home from Madurai to Sholavandan and told his\nmother=\r\n that a brahmin boy who was studying in Madurai at an adjoining school\nhad =\r\nrun away from home. At that time he little realised that he was to meet\nthi=\r\ns runaway boy later in 1918 at Skandasramam and that he was to become his\nd=\r\nisciple, live in close proximity of Sri Bhagavan from 1933 to 1950, and be\n=\r\nthe compiler of Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi.\n\nS.V. Ramanathan and M. V. =\r\nKrishnan, sons of Munagala S. Venkataramiah came\nto the Ashram with their p=\r\narents in the summer of 1930. They were just\nthirteen and ten years of age.=\r\nOne morning they were standing near the old\ndining hall (where now Sri Bhag=\r\navan=E2=80=99s samadhi stands) when Ramu, the elder\nbrother,remarked that f=\r\nor the last few days no onion sambar had been tasted\nby them. At that preci=\r\nse moment Sri Bhagavan was passing by the boys, as he\nwas returning from th=\r\ne kitchen. He smiled and asked Ramu: =E2=80=9CSo, you want\nvengaaya (onion)=\r\n sambar!=E2=80=9D The boys blushed and kept quiet. Next morning, the\nboys w=\r\nere served with vengaaya sambar. Everybody thought it was onion\nsambar.Sri =\r\nBhagavan later in the day asked Ramu how he relished the sambar\nto which he=\r\n replied: =E2=80=9CVery well.=E2=80=9D\n\nRamu, however, was surprised to kno=\r\nw the truth only a few days later when\nhis mother told him that what he ate=\r\n was not onion but garlic sambar! There\nwas no onion at that time in the As=\r\nhram and yet Sri Bhagavan wanted to\nfulfil the boy=E2=80=99s wish. Through =\r\nhis expert culinary knowledge, he brought the\nsmell and taste of onion to g=\r\narlic itself!\n\n\nIN THE 1930s, Dr. T. N. Krishnaswamy wanted to visit the As=\r\nhram and be with\nSri Bhagavan during the weekend. He asked a friend to acco=\r\nmpany him. This\nfriend at that time did not even put on his shirt. He was i=\r\nn his dhoti and\nupper cloth and had two\nor three rupees in his purse. He re=\r\nadily agreed to go then and there. Both\ntravelled up to Katpadi by train, t=\r\nook a bus to Vellore and changed onto\nanother bus for Tiruvannamalai. In Ve=\r\nllore the friend wanted to take\nsomething to Sri Bhagavan. On the roadside =\r\nhe saw a woman selling kovai kai.\nHe bought the lot for a few annas. It was=\r\n about one viss, or 1=C2=BD kg in\nweight. Since he had no bag to carry the =\r\nvegetable, he bundled them at one\nend of his upper cloth. Both of them reac=\r\nhed Tiruvannamalai in the evening.\nThe vegetable bundle was put in front of=\r\n Sri Bhagavan when both the devotees\npaid their respects. On an enquiry fro=\r\nm Sri Bhagavan, the bundle was opened.\nSri Bhagavan saw the contents and sa=\r\nid that if kovai kai was cooked with\nbrinjals it\nwould be tasty. The next m=\r\norning a devotee arriving from Madras through\nVillupuram brought brinjals! =\r\nThe curry was cooked in the morning and all of\nthem relished it.\n\nIN 1937, =\r\nAN elderly American came along with a group to visit Sri Bhagavan.\nThe tren=\r\nd of the discussion was that the five senses were to be put under\ncheck. Si=\r\nnce the old American was deaf he could not follow the discussions.\nSri Bhag=\r\navan remarked that the American needed to control only four senses\nas the f=\r\nifth (hearing) was already under check. Someone in the Hall\nexplained this =\r\nto the American and he beamed with joy.\n\nMUNAGALA V. KRISHNAN went to Delhi=\r\n in December,1940, in search of a job. He\ncould not secure a job up to the =\r\nend of February, 1941. So he wrote to his\nfather Sri Venkataramiah saying t=\r\nhat he had to return to the south as no job\nwas available. This letter was =\r\nshown to Sri Bhagavan who went through it and\nsaid: =E2=80=9CLet him stay o=\r\nn in Delhi.=E2=80=9D In March he got a job. From then V.\nKrishnan prospered=\r\n very well.\n\nAFTER SRI BHAGAVAN moved down and settled near the Mother=E2=\r\n=80=99s samadhi there\nwas only a thatched roof over the samadhi and an adjo=\r\nining hut. Some\ndevotees decided to build\na more solid hall. So bricks and =\r\nbuilding material were gathered.The bricks\nwere carried to the site by the =\r\ndevotees. Sri Bhagavan also wanted to work\nbut the devotees would not permi=\r\nt him.One moonlit night, when all were\nasleep, a devotee woke up and found =\r\nthat Sri Bhagavan was missing. He woke\nup the others and they all began to =\r\nsearch for him. They found Sri Bhagavan\ntaking part in bringing bricks to t=\r\nhe site from a kiln opposite the Ashram.\n\nIN THE EARLY 1920s there was a bi=\r\ng mango tree near Palitirtham. Chinna Swami\nwas also in the Ashram, althoug=\r\nh he had not yet taken charge of the\nmanagement. Dandapani Swami, a huge fi=\r\ngure, was another Ashram inmate.\nChinna Swami and Dandapani Swami did not l=\r\nike each other. One night\nDandapani Swami wanted to settle scores with Chin=\r\nna Swami, so he seized\nChinna Swami to crush him. Bhagavan appeared on the =\r\nscene and slapped the\nback of Dandapani Swami, who immediately put Chinna S=\r\nwami down. No words\nwere spoken and each retired to his place of rest. Late=\r\nr Dandapani Swami\ndescribed the slap as =E2=80=98terrific=E2=80=99.\n\nSource=\r\ns:\n\n1) SURPASSING LOVE AND GRACE By His Devotees Book\n2) Arunachala&#39;s Raman=\r\na Boundless Ocean Of Grace Volume III Book\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0015175ce130e7f13e048bf4a63a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;ON August 29, 1896, Venkataraman (later Sri Bhagavan) left Madurai for T=\r\niruvannamalai.
