I \n&gt; want to make some more comments on recent post=\r\ns in this series. Some of \n&gt; the strong points made in this series have a p=\r\notential to mislead and \n&gt; instill wrong notions.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The arg=\r\numents of the karma-kandins are not sound. For there cannot be \n&gt; &gt; any mot=\r\nive\n&gt; &gt; or desire to act when there is the knowledge of the highest truth. =\r\nHe \n&gt; &gt; does not find\n&gt; &gt; any use in the performance of karma. When one get=\r\ns a desire to know \n&gt; &gt; the atman which\n&gt; \n&gt; This notion that the paths of =\r\nkarma (action) and gyaana/jnaana \n&gt; (knowledge) oppose each other is one of=\r\n the major misconceptions of \n&gt; contemporary Vedic knowledge. I found the s=\r\name thinking at WAVES (World \n&gt; Association of Vedic Studies) conference in=\r\n Aug 2010. Some Vedic \n&gt; scholars talk about vedanta and knowledge. Some ta=\r\nlk about karma and \n&gt; actions/rituals. They think that those are two opposi=\r\nng paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vasishtha very clearly said at the beginning of &quot;Yoga Vaasis=\r\nhtham&quot; that \n&gt; the bird of individual self flies into the sky of undivided =\r\nand infinite \n&gt; consciousness, by flapping the two wings of karma and gyaan=\r\na. A bird \n&gt; cannot fly with just one wing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowledge without action t=\r\no rid oneself of the blocking conditioning \n&gt; cannot free one. Without acti=\r\nons, knowledge remains merely intellectual. \n&gt; Only with repeated actions d=\r\noes knowledge get ingrained in one&#39;s \n&gt; consciousness so deeply that all of=\r\n one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and deeds \n&gt; are shaped by that correct knowledg=\r\ne (instead of underlying \n&gt; conditioning). Just &quot;knowing&quot; intellectually th=\r\nat a movie is not real \n&gt; and there is no need to take what happens on the =\r\nscreen seriously is not \n&gt; enough to stop you from getting startled when a =\r\nreally scary scene comes \n&gt; in the movie! You need to practice a lot before=\r\n that knowledge becomes \n&gt; natural and permanent and you stop getting start=\r\nled.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, actionss without knowledge are useless too. One keeps =\r\n\n&gt; performing actions forever then. One watching a movie 1000 times without=\r\n \n&gt; the knowledge that it is unreal and should not be taken seriously will =\r\n\n&gt; get startled each time and enjoy the experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; In http://tinyurl.=\r\ncom/homamwhy document (from WAVES 2010 conference), I \n&gt; gave an analogy. S=\r\nuppose one needs to walk to the top of a mountain. One \n&gt; with gyaana but n=\r\no karma is like a person standing at the base and \n&gt; staring at the pinnacl=\r\ne. He knows where to go, but he will remain at the \n&gt; base forever. One wit=\r\nh karma but no gyaana is like a person going around \n&gt; the mountain forever=\r\n. One balancing karma and gyana, i.e. engaging in \n&gt; actions cocupled with =\r\nthe correct understanding that all is Brahman, is \n&gt; like a person climbing=\r\n the mountain and watching the top from time to \n&gt; time to correct one&#39;s co=\r\nurse. He will eventually reach the pinnacle. \n&gt; Karma and gyaana need to go=\r\n hand in hand and are definitely not \n&gt; opposites or alternatives.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; i=\r\ns free from all the faults of samsaraf samsara, one does not find any \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbenefit out\n&gt; &gt; of actions which he has done or which he has to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ac=\r\ntions with attachment (i.e. actions with agyaana) can be criticized \n&gt; and =\r\ndismissed. But detached actions (i.e. actions with gyaana) should be \n&gt; enc=\r\nouraged.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; This equating of liberation and spiritual progress=\r\n with akarma \n&gt; (inaction), instead of detached action (nishkaama karma), i=\r\ns what led to \n&gt; the temporary downfall of Sanatana Dharma in the world. Th=\r\nis is \n&gt; pseudo-Vedanta and not the real deal.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as you self-ide=\r\nntify with a body, desires arise from time to \n&gt; time. The purer your condi=\r\ntioning is, the more dharmik those desires \n&gt; will be. Perform the best act=\r\nion within your capability to fulfil those \n&gt; desires. Once action is done,=\r\n surrender it to the Lord and do not think \n&gt; about it anymore. Whatever re=\r\nsult comes, take it as God&#39;s will and do \n&gt; not regret or rejoice. No pride=\r\n and no shame. As you do this more and \n&gt; more, your conditioning will drop=\r\n more and more and your consciousness \n&gt; will become purer and purer. Your =\r\nconscience will speak louder and \n&gt; louder and your sense of dharma will be=\r\n refined. Your desires will \n&gt; become more and more dharmik. You will trans=\r\nition from fulfilling dharma \n&gt; towards individual self to fulfilling dharm=\r\na towards universal self. \n&gt; Eventually, you will reach a stage where you p=\r\nerform actions with no \n&gt; identification. Then action become non-action.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, rishis etc also do not engage in inaction. Instead, they =\r\n\n&gt; engage in detached action for maintaining and supporting the Cosmic \n&gt; O=\r\nrder, as determined by the Supreme Cosmic Being and His Shakti (his \n&gt; Kine=\r\ntic aspect).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; One acts only when there is desire. A desire=\r\nless man, whose desires \n&gt; &gt; have been\n&gt; &gt; fulfilled, who has risen above d=\r\nesires, whose desire is the atman, has \n&gt; &gt; no\n&gt; &gt; necessity to act.\n&gt; \n&gt; F=\r\nirst of all, everybody whose self-identification with a body remains \n&gt; atl=\r\neast to a small extent IS performing actions continually. At the bare \n&gt; mi=\r\nnimum, one performs actions like breathing, eating, drinking water, \n&gt; urin=\r\nating and defecating, which affect the lives of millions of \n&gt; micro-organi=\r\nsms.\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, one &quot;whose desire is the atman&quot; still needs to perform ac=\r\ntions \n&gt; to fulfil that desire and be established in atman always. Running =\r\naway \n&gt; from actions and samsara will not free one from samsara.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sannyasa is absolutely necessary whether it be vividisha-sannyasa o=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; vidvat-sannyasa.\n&gt; &gt; Without perfect renunciation it is impossible t=\r\no pursue the path of \n&gt; &gt; Brahmavidya. ...\n&gt; &gt; it is foolish to cite instan=\r\nces of Janaka and others who did not take \n&gt; &gt; sannyasa but\n&gt; &gt; possessed B=\r\nrahmajnana. Such instances are quoted by householders who \n&gt; &gt; are unwillin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; to leave their attachments, for there is no reason why they should \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; stick to\n&gt; &gt; household life after attaining knowledge. For knowledge by =\r\nits very \n&gt; &gt; nature is\n&gt; &gt; against all senses of worldly duty and activity=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, many people who quote such examples may indeed be unwilling to =\r\n\n&gt; leave their attachments and take sannyasa. However, it is not correct to=\r\n \n&gt; think that external sannyasa is a must for Self-knowledge. In fact, \n&gt; =\r\nVasishtha gave so many criteria and paths towards Self-knowledge in \n&gt; &quot;Yog=\r\na Vaasishtham&quot;, but did not say that you have take sannyasa.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, =\r\nthere is an interesting story given by Vasishtha in that \n&gt; Vedanta epic. S=\r\nee the story of Chudala and Sikhidhwaja. King Sikhidhwaja \n&gt; leaves his wif=\r\ne and kingdom, becomes an ascetic, lives in a small hut in \n&gt; a forest for =\r\na few decades and spends all his time in meditation. Wife \n&gt; Chudala rules =\r\nkingdom on behalf of her husband and becomes \n&gt; Self-realized. She later he=\r\nlps her husband in realization! So much for \n&gt; sannyasa being &quot;absolutely n=\r\necessary&quot; for Brahmavidya!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The sannyasin can find adequat=\r\ne leisure and freedom from the \n&gt; &gt; distractions of life.\n&gt; &gt; Renunciation =\r\nis desirable even to those who have not attained jnana. \n&gt; &gt; Only the\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nannyasin can devote the whole time for meditation. Householders \n&gt; &gt; cannot=\r\n give\n&gt; &gt; themselves up completely for meditation.\n&gt; \n&gt; :-) If one can find=\r\n some focus despire the distractions, one progresses \n&gt; faster. If one has =\r\nno jnana and mind tends to get distracted, then \n&gt; sannyasa may not help th=\r\nat much. Merely having more free time will not \n&gt; allow one to focus on god=\r\n. One will get all kinds of thoughts when \n&gt; meditating.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, =\r\nwe see sannyasins getting caught engaging in sexual \n&gt; scandals and politic=\r\nal scandals now-a-days. We see sannyasins fighting \n&gt; among themselves chea=\r\nply, to become the heads of their mathas \n&gt; (monasteries). We see sannyasin=\r\ns trying to raise their profile among \n&gt; devotees and politicians or to get=\r\n better TRPs on TV. We see sannyasins \n&gt; running after siddhis and talking =\r\nabout siddhis like a child may talk \n&gt; about chocolates. We see sannyasins =\r\ntrying to raise a lot of money for \n&gt; their mathas and resorting to cheap g=\r\nimmicks for it. When people not \n&gt; ready for sannyasa and having dense cond=\r\nitioning take up sannyasa to \n&gt; have more &quot;leisure&quot; or escape from &quot;the dis=\r\ntractions of life&quot;, this is \n&gt; what happens!\n&gt; \n&gt; Remain in the material wo=\r\nrld and do sadhana. Develop detachment from \n&gt; body and individual needs, c=\r\nompassion to others, dispassion and \n&gt; detachment in actions, surrender to =\r\nthe Lord and the ability to engage \n&gt; in powerful actions while being absol=\r\nutely prepared for any end result. \n&gt; As you make progress, perhaps oneday =\r\nyou will be ready for sannyasa and \n&gt; it will just happen. Or perhaps you w=\r\nill become realized even without \n&gt; sannyasa. In either case, the end goal =\r\nis internal detachment and \n&gt; self-realization and not external renunciatio=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anybody who tells you that a *specific* external action or object i=\r\ns a \n&gt; *must* for internal purification and liberation is over-selling it.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without abandonment of the concerns of worldly life, know=\r\nledge cannot \n&gt; &gt; be pursued\n&gt; &gt; with unabated vigor and devotion. It does =\r\nnot mean that the sannyasin \n&gt; &gt; undervalues\n&gt; &gt; human society and discards=\r\n all men without helping them at all. As the \n&gt; &gt; life of a\n&gt; &gt; sannyasin i=\r\ns meant only to reach the highest Reality, and as he has \n&gt; &gt; already passe=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; through the lower stages of spiritual evolution, he may appear to be =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; not working\n&gt; &gt; for the rest of humanity at large; but it is to be bor=\r\nne in mind that \n&gt; &gt; he exercises\n&gt; &gt; a silent and unnoticed but powerful i=\r\nnfluence for the good of the \n&gt; &gt; public. That\n&gt; &gt; itself is the service he=\r\n is rendering to the society and that is the \n&gt; &gt; highest and\n&gt; &gt; the most =\r\nbeneficent service that one could ever do to man. One who is \n&gt; &gt; intent up=\r\non\n&gt; &gt; realizing the peace, the bliss, the One Without a Second=C3=83=C2=A2=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot;Shantam, \n&gt; &gt; Shivam,\n&gt; &gt; Advaitam=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot;is the most powerful and the useful friend of the world!\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Correct. But, not every sannyasin may have enough &quot;spiritual evolution&quot; =\r\n\n&gt; to exert such &quot;powerful influence for the good of the public&quot;. The \n&gt; qu=\r\nestion here is not whether one has renounced X, Y, Z external things \n&gt; or =\r\nnot. The question is whether one has renounced ego, doership of one&#39;s \n&gt; ac=\r\ntions and surrendered to the Supreme Cosmic Being completely or not. \n&gt; One=\r\n who has, whoever he is and wherever he is, has a highly purified \n&gt; consci=\r\nousness and exerts a powerful subtle influence on the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Twitter ID: @homam10=\r\n8\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have great respect for Swami Sivananda and commentary=\r\n on &quot;Yoga \n&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham&quot; by his disciple Swami Venkatesananda is one of =\r\nmy \n&gt; &gt; favorite books.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, I want to put my foot down and rec=\r\nord my exception to some \n&gt; &gt; ideas expressed in this series. Swamiji may h=\r\nave been trying to \n&gt; &gt; inspire some sadhakas into the sannyasa order when =\r\nhe wrote this \n&gt; &gt; series and he goes a bit overboard.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; all members of your family will cling to you like leeches\n&gt; &gt;&gt; till the =\r\nend of your life\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do not appreciate this tone at all. One can reno=\r\nunce if one wants. \n&gt; &gt; But, why belittle family members and call them leec=\r\nhes?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one&#39;s wife wants to cling to one, because of her conditioni=\r\nng and \n&gt; &gt; spiritual evolution, it is fine. She is not necessarily a bad p=\r\nerson \n&gt; &gt; or a &quot;leech&quot;. If one engages in dharmik and unselfish actions to=\r\n make \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s wife happy in various ways, as far as possible, it is not =\r\nbad \n&gt; &gt; and does not imply an undesirable attachment. If one *expects* \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; something from wife in return, THAT expectation is bad. THAT \n&gt; &gt; expecta=\r\ntion of something back from wife is a leech that sucks blood \n&gt; &gt; from one&#39;=\r\ns soul.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Seeing the world, people and objects as obstructions or tem=\r\nptations or \n&gt; &gt; &quot;leeches&quot; is silly. Being disgusted with the world is as m=\r\nuch an \n&gt; &gt; attachment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated with =\r\nit! \n&gt; &gt; World and people can exist and act in ways that may be natural to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; them. Whatever they do, they are never the problem or blockage for \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; your own spiritual evolution. You may do various actions and give \n&gt; &gt; va=\r\nrious things to various people, based on kaarmik debts, and nothing \n&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu do is necessarily a bondage. Actions never bind you, it is \n&gt; &gt; expectati=\r\non of specific results from those actions that binds you. \n&gt; &gt; Give freely =\r\nand magnanimously; and take whatever comes back naturally, \n&gt; &gt; with no exc=\r\nitement and no regret. Remove ANY expectation that may \n&gt; &gt; exist in your m=\r\nind, from ANYONE, and become completely free. THAT is \n&gt; &gt; true sannyasa or=\r\n renunciation, not seeing people as leeches that cling \n&gt; &gt; on to you.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; If one becomes a sannyasin because one is fed up with the world, it is =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; probably a bad idea. When one discharges most of one&#39;s duties and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n responsibilities to others, a sense of genuine renunciation will \n&gt; &gt; natu=\r\nrally develop. If one runs away from the world prematurely, Nature \n&gt; &gt; wil=\r\nl drag one back later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When Adi Shankara renounced, h=\r\nis mother was very sad. But Adi Shankara \n&gt; &gt; did not see her as a leech. I=\r\nn fact, when she was on deathbed, he came \n&gt; &gt; all the way back and did her=\r\n final rites himself, though that was \n&gt; &gt; completely against the tradition=\r\nal notions of sannyasa dharma. There \n&gt; &gt; is a big lesson in this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nActions and paying off your debts do not bind you. In fact, inaction \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd pushing off a debt to future MAY bind you! It is expectation in \n&gt; &gt; wha=\r\nt you do and egoistic attachment to what you do (feeling proud or \n&gt; &gt; asha=\r\nmed) is what binds you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is only when you take san=\r\nnyasa that they will leave\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you free.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even to a sannyasin, many=\r\n people may cling. They may come for \n&gt; &gt; knowledge or wisdom or to fulfil =\r\ntheir pride related to doing good \n&gt; &gt; religious work. So many people clung=\r\n to Vivekananda and other monastic \n&gt; &gt; disciples of Ramakrishna. If one ex=\r\npects something back from such \n&gt; &gt; followers, well-wishers and disciples (=\r\ne.g. admiration, learning well, \n&gt; &gt; spreading knowledge or message in the =\r\nworld, giving money for the \n&gt; &gt; religious order, etc), there is no differe=\r\nnce really between wife and \n&gt; &gt; children and them. In other words, attachm=\r\nent can form and bind you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What binds you is your attitude towards =\r\npeople and your expectations \n&gt; &gt; from people and NOT how much people like =\r\nyou and how attached THEY are \n&gt; &gt; to you. To be free, you do not need peop=\r\nle to &quot;leave you free&quot;. You \n&gt; &gt; can be surrounded by thousands of people w=\r\nho are attached to you \n&gt; &gt; heavily and yet you can be free. Their attachme=\r\nnt binds *them*. To be \n&gt; &gt; free, have no attachment and no expectations. G=\r\nive other whatever your \n&gt; &gt; body, mind and soul allow you to give. Have no=\r\n expctations of getting \n&gt; &gt; anythying back. Take whatever comes back by it=\r\nself. Simple!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you fall sick You will be tempted=\r\n to go in for their help and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; vice versa.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Vice versa&quot; is not =\r\na problem. Taking care of a sick person if one is \n&gt; &gt; able to, whether it =\r\nis wife or parents or children or someone else, is \n&gt; &gt; not binding. If the=\r\nre is an expectation of a return favor, THEN it is \n&gt; &gt; binding.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Re=\r\ngarding taking help: Expecting anything from anyone causes bondage, \n&gt; &gt; bu=\r\nt taking what comes by itself, with neither excitement nor regret, \n&gt; &gt; doe=\r\ns not cause bondage. Ma Sarada nicely demonstrated this once.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When =\r\nSwami Yogananda was badly sick, Ma Sarada asked his erstwhile \n&gt; &gt; wife (be=\r\nfore sannyasa!) to come and serve him. That is so \n&gt; &gt; unconventional! Swam=\r\ni Yogananda protested saying it will set a bad \n&gt; &gt; example. But Swami Yoga=\r\nnanda did not have any expectations and this \n&gt; &gt; was done voluntarily by h=\r\nis wife (or under the instruction of Ma \n&gt; &gt; sarada, but not due to any exp=\r\nectations or pressure from Yogananda). \n&gt; &gt; After Yogananda overcame his re=\r\nservations, he was neither excited nor \n&gt; &gt; regretful. He accepted the serv=\r\nice equanomously and not worrying about \n&gt; &gt; what others will think or say.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In fact, if one puts pressure on oneself and wants to prove to the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; world how good one&#39;s renunciation us, THAT may be an attachment. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Expecting&quot; the world to see one&#39;s renunciation and appreciate one (or \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; not criticize one) is a very subtle attachment. Ma Sarada may have \n&gt; &gt; d=\r\netected a subtle attachment and put Swami Yogananda in a spot \n&gt; &gt; intentio=\r\nnally and made him overcome the attachment. Great teachers \n&gt; &gt; like Ramakr=\r\nishna and Ma Sarada teach subtle and valuable lessons in a \n&gt; &gt; practical w=\r\nay. It may not even be obvious to onlookers that there was \n&gt; &gt; a lesson th=\r\nere! This is how sadgurus operate..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Being able to ren=\r\nounce wife, children, parents, siblings, house, car \n&gt; &gt; etc is a great thi=\r\nng. But, if one thinks that those are &quot;all \n&gt; &gt; connections and ties&quot; that =\r\nbind one, one is badly mistaken. Those are \n&gt; &gt; the gross ones - the extern=\r\nal ones. The biggest bondage is internal. \n&gt; &gt; The identification with a bo=\r\ndy and identification with a subtle \n&gt; &gt; individual identity (e.g. the noti=\r\non that one is Narasimha, an \n&gt; &gt; engineer, a scholar, an astrologer etc) a=\r\nre much stronger bondages \n&gt; &gt; than any others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one&#39;s hands or l=\r\negs are cut off or if a tiger is eating one alive \n&gt; &gt; or if one is sufferi=\r\nng from a terrible disease, can one focus the mind \n&gt; &gt; on god and not thin=\r\nk of the body and its suffering? If one thinks &quot;*I* \n&gt; &gt; am suffering&quot; and =\r\nstarts weeping, is one really free?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If someone praises a sannyasin =\r\nfor his renunciation, devotion to god, \n&gt; &gt; wisdom or spiritual attainment,=\r\n will no sannyasin feel even a little \n&gt; &gt; pride? If so, is one really free=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a sannayasin does sadhana and experiences some special things =\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; gets some siddhis, will it not give a little bit of pride or \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\natisfaction? If so, is one really free?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Focusing so heavily on exte=\r\nrnal renunciation and making external \n&gt; &gt; objects of attachment seem like =\r\na major thing, while ignoring the real \n&gt; &gt; attachment inside one (the sens=\r\ne of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;these are mine&quot;), \n&gt; &gt; is like beating up a tiger cub=\r\n and feeling proud of the achievement, \n&gt; &gt; while ignoring the big tiget ju=\r\nst lurking behind one and waiting to \n&gt; &gt; pounce on one!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Let me say one thing clearly. Sannyasa or external renunciation is an \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; *attempt* to cut oneself off from a few external objects that cause \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; temptation (and bondage!) internally. It is not a guarantee that \n&gt; &gt; int=\r\nernal temptations and bondages are completely destroyed. The real \n&gt; &gt; bond=\r\nage comes from the internal attachment and not from the external \n&gt; &gt; objec=\r\nts. Work hard on removing it. Do not despise the external objects \n&gt; &gt; or s=\r\nee them as &quot;leeches&quot; or become fed up with them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyot=\r\nish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 3, 2011 at 2:00 PM, chaudhuri.krishnendu wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSannyasa has got its own glory and advantages!

I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; want to make some more=\r\n comments on recent posts in this series. Some of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the strong point=\r\ns made in this series have a potential to mislead and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; instill wron=\r\ng notions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The arguments of t=\r\nhe karma-kandins are not sound. For there cannot be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; any motiv=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or desire to act when there is the knowledge of the highest =\r\ntruth. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; does not find&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; any use in the performan=\r\nce of karma. When one gets a desire to know &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the atman which&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This notion that the paths of karma (action) and gyaana/jna=\r\nana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (knowledge) oppose each other is one of the major misconceptio=\r\nns of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; contemporary Vedic knowledge. I found the same thinking at W=\r\nAVES (World &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Association of Vedic Studies) conference in Aug 2010. =\r\nSome Vedic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; scholars talk about vedanta and knowledge. Some talk ab=\r\nout karma and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions/rituals. They think that those are two oppos=\r\ning paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vasishtha very clearly said at the beginning of=\r\n &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the bird of individual self flies into th=\r\ne sky of undivided and infinite\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness, by flapping the tw=\r\no wings of karma and gyaana. A bird &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cannot fly with just one wing.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Knowledge without action to rid oneself of the blocking c=\r\nonditioning &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cannot free one. Without actions, knowledge remains me=\r\nrely intellectual. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Only with repeated actions does knowledge get i=\r\nngrained in one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness so deeply that all of one&#39;s instin=\r\ncts, thoughts and deeds &lt;BR&gt;&gt; are shaped by that correct knowledge (inst=\r\nead of underlying &lt;BR&gt;&gt; conditioning). Just &quot;knowing&quot; intellectually tha=\r\nt a movie is not real &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and there is no need to take what happens on=\r\n the screen seriously is not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; enough to stop you from getting start=\r\nled when a really scary scene comes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in the movie! You need to prac=\r\ntice a lot before that knowledge becomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; natural and permanent and=\r\n you stop getting startled.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, actionss without kn=\r\nowledge are useless too.\n One keeps &lt;BR&gt;&gt; performing actions forever the=\r\nn. One watching a movie 1000 times without &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the knowledge that it i=\r\ns unreal and should not be taken seriously will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; get startled each =\r\ntime and enjoy the experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In http://tinyurl.com/homam=\r\nwhy document (from WAVES 2010 conference), I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; gave an analogy. Supp=\r\nose one needs to walk to the top of a mountain. One &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with gyaana bu=\r\nt no karma is like a person standing at the base and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; staring at th=\r\ne pinnacle. He knows where to go, but he will remain at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; base f=\r\norever. One with karma but no gyaana is like a person going around &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n the mountain forever. One balancing karma and gyana, i.e. engaging in &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; actions cocupled with the correct understanding that all is Brahman, i=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; like a person climbing the mountain and watching the top from ti=\r\nme to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time to correct one&#39;s course. He will eventually reach the p=\r\ninnacle. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n Karma and gyaana need to go hand in hand and are definit=\r\nely not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; opposites or alternatives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is free f=\r\nrom all the faults of samsaraf samsara, one does not find any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n benefit out&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of actions which he has done or which he has to d=\r\no.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actions with attachment (i.e. actions with agyaana) can=\r\n be criticized &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and dismissed. But detached actions (i.e. actions w=\r\nith gyaana) should be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; encouraged.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; This equating of liberation and spiritual progress with akarma &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; (inaction), instead of detached action (nishkaama karma), is what led =\r\nto &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the temporary downfall of Sanatana Dharma in the world. This is=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pseudo-Vedanta and not the real deal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As long as=\r\n you self-identify with a body, desires arise from time to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time. T=\r\nhe purer your conditioning is, the more dharmik those desires &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will=\r\n be.\n Perform the best action within your capability to fulfil those &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; desires. Once action is done, surrender it to the Lord and do not think =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about it anymore. Whatever result comes, take it as God&#39;s will and=\r\n do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not regret or rejoice. No pride and no shame. As you do this m=\r\nore and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; more, your conditioning will drop more and more and your c=\r\nonsciousness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will become purer and purer. Your conscience will spe=\r\nak louder and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; louder and your sense of dharma will be refined. You=\r\nr desires will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; become more and more dharmik. You will transition f=\r\nrom fulfilling dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; towards individual self to fulfilling dharma=\r\n towards universal self. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Eventually, you will reach a stage where =\r\nyou perform actions with no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; identification. Then action become non=\r\n-action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vishnu, Shiva, rishis etc also do not engage in i=\r\nnaction. Instead, they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; engage in detached action for maintaining\n =\r\nand supporting the Cosmic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Order, as determined by the Supreme Cosm=\r\nic Being and His Shakti (his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kinetic aspect).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One acts only when there is desire. A desireless m=\r\nan, whose desires &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have been&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fulfilled, who has r=\r\nisen above desires, whose desire is the atman, has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; no&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; necessity to act.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; First of all, everybody whose self=\r\n-identification with a body remains &lt;BR&gt;&gt; atleast to a small extent IS p=\r\nerforming actions continually. At the bare &lt;BR&gt;&gt; minimum, one performs a=\r\nctions like breathing, eating, drinking water, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; urinating and defec=\r\nating, which affect the lives of millions of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; micro-organisms.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Second, one &quot;whose desire is the atman&quot; still needs to perform=\r\n actions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to fulfil that desire and be established in atman always.=\r\n Running away &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from actions and samsara will not free one\n from sam=\r\nsara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sannyasa is absolutely n=\r\necessary whether it be vividisha-sannyasa or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; vidvat-sannyasa.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Without perfect renunciation it is impossible to pursue the p=\r\nath of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Brahmavidya. ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it is foolish to cite in=\r\nstances of Janaka and others who did not take &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sannyasa but&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; possessed Brahmajnana. Such instances are quoted by householders=\r\n who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are unwilling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to leave their attachments, f=\r\nor there is no reason why they should &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; stick to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; h=\r\nousehold life after attaining knowledge. For knowledge by its very &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; nature is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; against all senses of worldly duty and activit=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes, many people who quote such examples may indeed be =\r\nunwilling to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; leave their attachments and take sannyasa. However, i=\r\nt is not correct to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; think that external sannyasa\n is a must for Se=\r\nlf-knowledge. In fact, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vasishtha gave so many criteria and paths t=\r\nowards Self-knowledge in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, but did not say that =\r\nyou have take sannyasa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In fact, there is an interesting s=\r\ntory given by Vasishtha in that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vedanta epic. See the story of Chu=\r\ndala and Sikhidhwaja. King Sikhidhwaja &lt;BR&gt;&gt; leaves his wife and kingdom=\r\n, becomes an ascetic, lives in a small hut in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a forest for a few d=\r\necades and spends all his time in meditation. Wife &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Chudala rules k=\r\ningdom on behalf of her husband and becomes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Self-realized. She lat=\r\ner helps her husband in realization! So much for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sannyasa being &quot;a=\r\nbsolutely necessary&quot; for Brahmavidya!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; The sannyasin can find adequate leisure and freedom from the &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; distractions of life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Renunciation is desirable even t=\r\no those who have not attained jnana. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Only the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\nannyasin can devote the whole time for meditation. Householders &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; cannot give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves up completely for meditation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; :-) If one can find some focus despire the distractions, one pro=\r\ngresses &lt;BR&gt;&gt; faster. If one has no jnana and mind tends to get distract=\r\ned, then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sannyasa may not help that much. Merely having more free =\r\ntime will not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; allow one to focus on god. One will get all kinds of=\r\n thoughts when &lt;BR&gt;&gt; meditating.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For example, we see sa=\r\nnnyasins getting caught engaging in sexual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; scandals and political =\r\nscandals now-a-days. We see sannyasins fighting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; among themselves c=\r\nheaply, to become the heads of their mathas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (monasteries). We see =\r\nsannyasins trying to raise their profile among &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devotees and politi=\r\ncians or to get better TRPs on TV. We see sannyasins &lt;BR&gt;&gt; running after=\r\n siddhis and talking about siddhis like a\n child may talk &lt;BR&gt;&gt; about ch=\r\nocolates. We see sannyasins trying to raise a lot of money for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the=\r\nir mathas and resorting to cheap gimmicks for it. When people not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nready for sannyasa and having dense conditioning take up sannyasa to &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; have more &quot;leisure&quot; or escape from &quot;the distractions of life&quot;, this is &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; what happens!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Remain in the material world and do =\r\nsadhana. Develop detachment from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; body and individual needs, compas=\r\nsion to others, dispassion and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; detachment in actions, surrender to=\r\n the Lord and the ability to engage &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in powerful actions while bein=\r\ng absolutely prepared for any end result. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As you make progress, pe=\r\nrhaps oneday you will be ready for sannyasa and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it will just happe=\r\nn. Or perhaps you will become realized even without &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sannyasa. In e=\r\nither case, the end goal is internal detachment and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; self-realizati=\r\non and not external\n renunciation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Anybody who tells you t=\r\nhat a *specific* external action or object is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *must* for interna=\r\nl purification and liberation is over-selling it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Without abandonment of the concerns of worldly life, kn=\r\nowledge cannot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be pursued&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with unabated vigor an=\r\nd devotion. It does not mean that the sannyasin &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; undervalues&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; human society and discards all men without helping them at all.=\r\n As the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; life of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sannyasin is meant only to rea=\r\nch the highest Reality, and as he has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; already passed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; through the lower stages of spiritual evolution, he may appear to be &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; not working&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for the rest of humanity at large; bu=\r\nt it is to be borne in mind that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he exercises&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a =\r\nsilent and unnoticed but powerful influence for the good of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; public.\n That&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; itself is the service he is rendering to the =\r\nsociety and that is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; highest and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the most ben=\r\neficent service that one could ever do to man. One who is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; int=\r\nent upon&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realizing the peace, the bliss, the One Without a Sec=\r\nond=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot;Shantam, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Shivam,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Advaitam=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC&quot;is the most powerful and th=\r\ne useful friend of the world!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Correct. But, not every sann=\r\nyasin may have enough &quot;spiritual evolution&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to exert such &quot;powerfu=\r\nl influence for the good of the public&quot;. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; question here is not =\r\nwhether one has renounced X, Y, Z external things &lt;BR&gt;&gt; or not. The ques=\r\ntion is whether one has renounced ego, doership of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; actions a=\r\nnd surrendered to the Supreme Cosmic Being completely or not. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One =\r\nwho has, whoever he is and wherever he is, has a highly purified &lt;BR&gt;&gt; c=\r\nonsciousness and exerts a powerful subtle\n influence on the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sh=\r\nort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have great =\r\nrespect for Swami Sivananda and commentary\n on &quot;Yoga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vaasisht=\r\nham&quot; by his disciple Swami Venkatesananda is one of my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; favori=\r\nte books.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, I want to put my foot down and=\r\n record my exception to some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ideas expressed in this series. =\r\nSwamiji may have been trying to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; inspire some sadhakas into th=\r\ne sannyasa order when he wrote this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; series and he goes a bit =\r\noverboard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; al=\r\nl members of your family will cling to you like leeches&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ti=\r\nll the end of your life&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I do not appreciate this =\r\ntone at all. One can renounce if one wants. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But, why belittle=\r\n family members and call them leeches?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one&#39;s w=\r\nife wants to cling to one, because of her conditioning and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sp=\r\niritual evolution, it is fine. She is not necessarily a bad person &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; or a &quot;leech&quot;. If one engages\n in dharmik and unselfish actions to mak=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s wife happy in various ways, as far as possible, it is=\r\n not bad &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and does not imply an undesirable attachment. If one=\r\n *expects* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something from wife in return, THAT expectation is=\r\n bad. THAT &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; expectation of something back from wife is a leech=\r\n that sucks blood &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from one&#39;s soul.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nSeeing the world, people and objects as obstructions or temptations or &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;leeches&quot; is silly. Being disgusted with the world is as much an =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attachment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated wit=\r\nh it! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; World and people can exist and act in ways that may be =\r\nnatural to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; them. Whatever they do, they are never the problem=\r\n or blockage for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your own spiritual evolution. You may do var=\r\nious actions and give &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; various things to various people, based=\r\n on kaarmik debts, and\n nothing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you do is necessarily a bonda=\r\nge. Actions never bind you, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; expectation of specific res=\r\nults from those actions that binds you. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Give freely and magna=\r\nnimously; and take whatever comes back naturally, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with no exc=\r\nitement and no regret. Remove ANY expectation that may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; exist =\r\nin your mind, from ANYONE, and become completely free. THAT is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; true sannyasa or renunciation, not seeing people as leeches that cling &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; on to you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one becomes a sannyasin=\r\n because one is fed up with the world, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; probably a bad i=\r\ndea. When one discharges most of one&#39;s duties and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; responsibil=\r\nities to others, a sense of genuine renunciation will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; natural=\r\nly develop. If one runs away from the world prematurely, Nature &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; will drag one back later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; When\n Adi Shankara renounced, his mother was very sad. But Adi =\r\nShankara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; did not see her as a leech. In fact, when she was on=\r\n deathbed, he came &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; all the way back and did her final rites h=\r\nimself, though that was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; completely against the traditional no=\r\ntions of sannyasa dharma. There &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is a big lesson in this.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Actions and paying off your debts do not bind you. In=\r\n fact, inaction &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and pushing off a debt to future MAY bind you=\r\n! It is expectation in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; what you do and egoistic attachment to=\r\n what you do (feeling proud or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ashamed) is what binds you.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is only when=\r\n you take sannyasa that they will leave&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you free.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even to a sannyasin, many people may cling. They may come=\r\n for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge or wisdom or to fulfil their pride related to =\r\ndoing good\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; religious work. So many people clung to Vivekanan=\r\nda and other monastic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; disciples of Ramakrishna. If one expect=\r\ns something back from such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; followers, well-wishers and discip=\r\nles (e.g. admiration, learning well, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spreading knowledge or m=\r\nessage in the world, giving money for the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; religious order, et=\r\nc), there is no difference really between wife and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; children a=\r\nnd them. In other words, attachment can form and bind you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; What binds you is your attitude towards people and your expectati=\r\nons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from people and NOT how much people like you and how atta=\r\nched THEY are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to you. To be free, you do not need people to &quot;=\r\nleave you free&quot;. You &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can be surrounded by thousands of people=\r\n who are attached to you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; heavily and yet you can be free. The=\r\nir attachment binds *them*. To be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; free, have no attachment an=\r\nd no\n expectations. Give other whatever your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body, mind and s=\r\noul allow you to give. Have no expctations of getting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; anythyi=\r\nng back. Take whatever comes back by itself. Simple!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When you fall sick You will be temp=\r\nted to go in for their help and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vice versa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Vice versa&quot; is not a problem. Taking care of a sick person if=\r\n one is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; able to, whether it is wife or parents or children or=\r\n someone else, is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not binding. If there is an expectation of =\r\na return favor, THEN it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; binding.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Regarding taking help: Expecting anything from anyone causes bondage, &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; but taking what comes by itself, with neither excitement nor regr=\r\net, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; does not cause bondage. Ma Sarada nicely demonstrated thi=\r\ns once.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When Swami Yogananda was badly sick, Ma\n =\r\nSarada asked his erstwhile &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wife (before sannyasa!) to come an=\r\nd serve him. That is so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; unconventional! Swami Yogananda prote=\r\nsted saying it will set a bad &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; example. But Swami Yogananda di=\r\nd not have any expectations and this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was done voluntarily by =\r\nhis wife (or under the instruction of Ma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sarada, but not due =\r\nto any expectations or pressure from Yogananda). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After Yogana=\r\nnda overcame his reservations, he was neither excited nor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reg=\r\nretful. He accepted the service equanomously and not worrying about &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; what others will think or say.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, if=\r\n one puts pressure on oneself and wants to prove to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world=\r\n how good one&#39;s renunciation us, THAT may be an attachment. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nExpecting&quot; the world to see one&#39;s renunciation and appreciate one (or &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; not criticize one) is a very subtle attachment. Ma Sarada\n may hav=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; detected a subtle attachment and put Swami Yogananda in a s=\r\npot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; intentionally and made him overcome the attachment. Great=\r\n teachers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; like Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada teach subtle and val=\r\nuable lessons in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; practical way. It may not even be obvious =\r\nto onlookers that there was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a lesson there! This is how sadgu=\r\nrus operate..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bei=\r\nng able to renounce wife, children, parents, siblings, house, car &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; etc is a great thing. But, if one thinks that those are &quot;all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; connections and ties&quot; that bind one, one is badly mistaken. Those are =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the gross ones - the external ones. The biggest bondage is in=\r\nternal. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The identification with a body and identification wit=\r\nh a subtle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; individual identity (e.g. the notion that one is N=\r\narasimha, an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; engineer, a scholar, an\n astrologer etc) are muc=\r\nh stronger bondages &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; than any others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; If one&#39;s hands or legs are cut off or if a tiger is eating one alive &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; or if one is suffering from a terrible disease, can one focus the=\r\n mind &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on god and not think of the body and its suffering? If =\r\none thinks &quot;*I* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; am suffering&quot; and starts weeping, is one real=\r\nly free?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If someone praises a sannyasin for his r=\r\nenunciation, devotion to god, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wisdom or spiritual attainment,=\r\n will no sannyasin feel even a little &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pride? If so, is one re=\r\nally free?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If a sannayasin does sadhana and exper=\r\niences some special things or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; gets some siddhis, will it not =\r\ngive a little bit of pride or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; satisfaction? If so, is one rea=\r\nlly free?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Focusing so heavily on external renunci=\r\nation and making external &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n objects of attachment seem like a =\r\nmajor thing, while ignoring the real &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attachment inside one (t=\r\nhe sense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;these are mine&quot;), &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is like beatin=\r\ng up a tiger cub and feeling proud of the achievement, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while =\r\nignoring the big tiget just lurking behind one and waiting to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n pounce on one!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; L=\r\net me say one thing clearly. Sannyasa or external renunciation is an &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; *attempt* to cut oneself off from a few external objects that cause=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; temptation (and bondage!) internally. It is not a guarantee =\r\nthat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; internal temptations and bondages are completely destroy=\r\ned. The real &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bondage comes from the internal attachment and n=\r\not from the external &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; objects. Work hard on removing it. Do no=\r\nt despise the external objects &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or see them as &quot;leeches&quot; or be=\r\ncome fed up with them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish =\r\nWritings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: =\r\n@homam108&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; On Fri, Jun 3, 2011 at 2:00 PM, chaudhuri.=\r\nkrishnendu wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sannyasa has got its own glory =\r\nand advantages!
