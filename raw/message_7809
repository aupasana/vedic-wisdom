I realized that I have very little time these days, apart from \nspiritual sadhana, work, driving and other daily activities.\n\nI have uploaded the first cut of a &quot;super-short&quot; manual at\n\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja/satya_ss_san.pdf (mantras in \nDevanagari script)\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/pooja/satya_ss_eng.pdf (mantras in \nEnglish script)\n\nThese are works in progress. Please feel free to point out errors by \nprivate email (pvr@...).\n\nI hope to upload a &quot;short&quot; version in a few days. I am still working on \nit. The &quot;regular&quot; version will most probably take a few more weeks.\n\nThe purpose of this upload is to get feedback and also make it available \nto anyone who wants to peruse it for the coming Full Moon. They will \nhave a couple of days to go through it and prepare.\n\nOnce these are ready, versions with mantras written in Telugu, Kannada, \nGujarati etc will be prepared. That will take a while.\n\nIn the next few months, homam and fire yoga manuals will also be \nre-edited and streamlined. Manual will be split into two manuals giving \nwhy and how. If you have any suggestions, please send them to me by \nprivate email (pvr@...).\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
