For example, &quot;kravyaada&quot; form of Agni is requested to \nleave in that Veda mantra. But it is that form of Agni, which will consume \nthe corpse and carry the person. So that Veda mantra is inappropriate when \ndoing a fire ritual using funeral pyre.\n\nI was told that a Chandi homam can be performed on a funeral pyre with some \nsmall changes and know someone who actually did it.\n\nHowever, if one&#39;s conditioned mind has ANY discomfort with that idea and \ncannot respectfully and humbly visualize the divine Mother coming in that \nfire, there is no point in doing such a ritual. When you call a deity into \nan idol or fire and worship, you should be able to imagine that deity in \nthat object. If an object is impure and inappropriate for a deity&#39;s entry in \none&#39;s mind, one should not call that deity into that object.\n\nAs I was not interested, I did not find out details about changes to homam \nprocedure when using funeral pyre. But there are methods given in shastras. \nThe bottomline is that your pandit may have known what he was doing and \ndoing something quite appropriate.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; sir\n&gt; i am &lt;deleted&gt; from indore india\n&gt; sir, can you suggest me literature to find the proper ways to perform\n&gt; the final ritual of a person  as called the &quot;Daah sanskar or antim \n&gt; sanskar&quot;\n&gt; few days back i went to a  cremation and there the pundit used the chita\n&gt; as somekind of homam kund and performed ahutis with ghee in it chanting\n&gt; mantras like &quot;somay swaha &quot; and &#39;yamay swaha&quot;\n&gt; I am not sure what he was doing was right or not but i had a feeling\n&gt; that it was not shastrokta vidhi.\n&gt; kindly guide me as to where i could find the material on the same.\n&gt; thanks\n\n\n"}}
