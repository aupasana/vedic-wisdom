He was a \nspiritually elevated soul. He believed that search for god was the same \nall over the world through ages and believed that correct answers were \nfound by great seers in various parts of the world at various times. As \nthese findings are often expressed allegorically, understanding any \nsingle version becomes tough but putting multiple versions together \ngives better insight.\n\nHe studied under Sufi Islamic saints and also studied Hindu scriptures. \nHe put them together and tried to find some common ground. His \nconclusions were recorded in &quot;Majma ul-Bahrain&quot; (The Mingling of Two \nOceans). He detailed the similarities between Vedantic and Sufi notions \nof the Absolute Truth.\n\nHe learnt Sanskrit and, taking help from scholars and ascetics of \nVaranasi, translated 52 Upanishads, Yoga Vasishtham and Bhagavad Gita \n(what a wonderful and thoughtful selection!) into the Persian language. \nHe believed that Upanishads are the book referred to in Quran as Kitab \nal-Maknun (The Hidden Book)!\n\nHe saw this as his mission and spent much of his time and energy in this \ntranslation effort. As though this was indeed what he was born for, his \nlife ended a couple of years after he finished this work. He was \npersecuted by the clergy and his younger brother Aurangazeb and was \nexecuted.\n\nInterestingly, his work served an important purpose. Apart from laying \nfoundation for an integration of Hindu and Muslim philosophies, it was \nthe first step in awakening the Western intellectual circles to the \nwisdom of Vedanta. Twelve years after his death, a French visitor took \nthe Persian translation to France and that laid the foundation for \nawakening European interest in Indian philosophy.\n\nHad he become the Mughal emperor, which was expected at some stage, \nworld history would have been so different. His ambitious younger \nbrother Aurangazeb did some machinations and won the throne finally. \nAgain, had he left Dara Shikoh alone and enjoyed the throne, world \nhistory would have been so different. He made the singular sin of \nkilling Dara Shikoh. Dara Shikoh was not a normal soul and this Brahma \nHatya was a terrible sin. The weight of such a huge sin was needed to \npull down a strong empire. Mughal empire fell soon.\n\nWe do not know the divine plan fully. We need to play our role as we see \nit in this divine drama and trust the director (god) to have a solid \nscript that ties everything together!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
