If one is seething with an=\r\nger and yet behaves politely to show off one&#39;s &quot;gentle nature&quot;, it is not t=\r\nhat useful. Similarly, if one is calm and composed inside and yet behaves f=\r\niercely, it may still be saattwik.\n \nMore than what we do, why we do it and=\r\n with what attitude we do it is important. We should all try to search insi=\r\nde to find our dharma and engage in actions to fulfil our dharma. Unfortuna=\r\ntely, it is not easy to find one&#39;s dharma. One&#39;s vision of one&#39;s dharma is =\r\ncorrupted by one&#39;s conditioning. As one fulfills more and more of one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma with less and less ego identification, slowly conditioning drops off an=\r\nd the clarity with which one sees one&#39;s dharma increases. This is a long pr=\r\nocess.\n \nSomebody who criticizes me as a person in darkness and trying to b=\r\necome a guru may genuinely feel that he is doing his dharma. If my sense of=\r\n dharma impels to be harsh and fight with that person, I will. But, in this=\r\n case, my sense of dharma tells me to take it easy and that is why I show r=\r\nestraint.\n \nIn general, dharma towards oneself (one&#39;s body, name etc) is le=\r\nss important than dharma towards one&#39;s family (physical family, intellectua=\r\nl family and spiritual family), larger society and universe. Sadly, we ofte=\r\nn spend a lot of our energy fulfilling dharma towards ourselves (body, name=\r\n etc).\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jy=\r\notish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n \n---- Vinay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Yoga is rest=\r\nraint, which PVR possesses.
