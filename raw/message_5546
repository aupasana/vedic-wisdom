In or around 1955 A jagadgur ShankarAc=\r\nArya is guest at my father&#39;s elder brother&#39;s house in Marredpally. I can re=\r\nmember he drove up in a huge car that had no number plate but a big &quot;sha~gk=\r\nu&quot; - We kids were supposed to take off our shits - and receive his blessing=\r\ns. There were two queues - one for girls most of them wearing bright new si=\r\nlk &quot;paTTu&quot; dresses. One of the sha~gkarAcarya&#39;s goons come up and asked one=\r\n little Punjabi girl that was our neighbour age about about 10 or 11 that w=\r\nas wearing shalwar kameez to go out of the line. And the poor girl was in t=\r\nears. I asked my elder brother (cousin) what was happening - he said - &quot;I t=\r\nhink he thinks she is Muslim or God knows what&quot; I slipped way from the line=\r\n unnoticed and went over to a Billiard Saloon.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. A couple of years lat=\r\ner I made peace with Adi sha~gkarAcArya on a trip to Kedarnath with my Guja=\r\nrati class mate from a business family and My father - The three of us walk=\r\ned about 45 miles up and down stopiing at different &quot;chaTTis&quot; and cooking o=\r\nur own. On reaching kedarnath, I told him about the incident of the punjabi=\r\n dress. He in his typical tone said - &quot;dandho ni bAt ce .. we have come so =\r\nfar .... anybody that has re built a shiva temple and that too bearing your=\r\n name cannot be all that bad&quot; We both had a laugh. My father asked us wheth=\r\ner we wanted to have a dip in the river in biting cold... &quot;both of us had o=\r\nne voice ... are you joking&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; 3, Years later a &quot;shankarAcarya&quot; gets arre=\r\nsted and charged with murder. My heart goes out to him The most surprising =\r\nthing neither his followers nor the brave community whimper.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. 2 of my=\r\n labour boys 18 and 19 were from Nalgonda - They were working on daily wage=\r\ns doing hard work. They told me they were H.Sc. passed - I said &quot;ruZu - pro=\r\nof&quot; In a matter of a week they brought their certificates - Both of them ha=\r\nd marks that I never even imagined was possible. Immediately - we started w=\r\norking on &quot;demarcations&quot;, &quot;contour survey&quot; and plants inventory of our plac=\r\ne - and all mapped on graph paper note books. and graph sheets. How do you =\r\ndraw a perfect square on the ground? Simple you might think all sides must =\r\nbe equal. Try it for a 10,000 sq yard area. This is where my young friends =\r\nwere taught the vedic wisdom that the sides don&#39;t matter at all. It is the =\r\ndiagnols that are important and that can be obtained by formula - discovere=\r\n centuries befor in India what we are dished out in schools.\n&gt;\n&gt; Next on th=\r\neir own money - I dont believe in donations of any sort. They were told , I=\r\n was dismissing them - Unless they went after work to a nearby computer tra=\r\nining class and put all our data in spreadsheets Excel - and email it to me=\r\n in one month they can continue to lift stones elsewhere. They did all sort=\r\ns of &quot;nAtak&quot; in their typical teenage way - They took 2- 1/2 months sheddin=\r\ng crocodile tears sometimes. Next, I dismissed them - I had been pestering =\r\nan IAS officer that I want an evaluation of these two boys. I was asked whe=\r\nther they were my relatives... I didn&#39;t answer.. They had an appointment fi=\r\nxed and the officer said (1) First time warning (2) Next time suspension (3=\r\n) Next time jail - understood. They nodded their heads. I have not seen the=\r\nse boys again although they try to meet me sometime.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, lengths and br=\r\neadths and depths - you better save for people that are absolute unhygienic=\r\n morons getting wounds and infections and worms when right next door is a p=\r\nrimary health centre.\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. One of my favourite movies is Rambo - I will n=\r\not pollute a Vaidika Wisdom group with the true story of how the Adi sha~gk=\r\nara is supposed to have obtain in depth knowledge of the kAma shAstra.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nreagrds\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishn=\r\nan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You wrote earlier: &quot;With computer=\r\n facilities - it is a likely that what people took 12 years in Shankara&#39;s t=\r\nimes can be learnt by kids in 3 months&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may be able to cre=\r\nate in 3 months overconfident newbies who can cut & paste reams of material=\r\n from the computer and try to connect the dots with guesswork, but you cann=\r\not create true scholars.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was once taking to someone who is a =\r\nwell-qualified sanskrit scholar\n&gt; &gt; and poet. He related the following inci=\r\ndent that took place between\n&gt; &gt; his co-student (scholar-1) and his teacher=\r\n (scholar-2) who is a great\n&gt; &gt; pandita.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; scholar-1 -- There are so =\r\nmany Panditas these days, but people keep\n&gt; &gt; talking about the scholarship=\r\n of some particular Pandit (scholar-3).\n&gt; &gt; Is there really such a vast dif=\r\nference?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; scholar-2 -- It is difficult to see the difference, unless=\r\n you\n&gt; &gt; yourself have deep scholarship. Let me describe this by way of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n example. Though you yourself are well-qualified, you see the\n&gt; &gt; differenc=\r\ne between us. It is like you are seated at the base of the\n&gt; &gt; himalayas, a=\r\nnd I am seated at the top. Well, with this Pandita\n&gt; &gt; (scholar-3), I feel =\r\nthe same way. I am seated at the base of the\n&gt; &gt; himalayas, and he is seate=\r\nd on top. But, for the average person, or\n&gt; &gt; even a mere scholar, it is al=\r\nmost impossible to tell the difference.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many learned peop=\r\nle who have access to a wide range of books\n&gt; &gt; and materials. They concent=\r\nrate on breadth, and are limited to\n&gt; &gt; scratching the surface. A true scho=\r\nlar on the other hand, looks for\n&gt; &gt; depth. It isn&#39;t just the sheer amount =\r\nof material that they have\n&gt; &gt; studied -- they have internalized the materi=\r\nal to such an extent that\n&gt; &gt; they speak it with every breath. Their way of=\r\n thinking changes, and\n&gt; &gt; their speech is pramANam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n\n\n"}}
