External Sun shining brightly and destroying external darkn=\r\ness is akin to the inner light shining brightly and destroying inner darkne=\r\nss. Burning homam fire is meant for stimulating and making the inner light =\r\nshine brighter. So, normally, homam is performed during the daytime. When S=\r\nun is just rising and destroying darkness is a great time for homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; External rituals are meant to cause internal modification through r=\r\nesonance.

In fact, he was born around midnight!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; My 2 cents is that you should feel free to do Krishna homam in the evenin=\r\ng, after your work.
