You are very true. God is e=\r\nverywhere in every atom and only our ego is blinding our eyes in seeing him=\r\n. As you said, I will try my best not to concentrate on those trivial thing=\r\ns and rather put my thoughts on God. Visiting Varanasi and able to spend so=\r\nmetime there is our past good karma and we shouldn&#39;t waste it with our feel=\r\nings. I don&#39;t hate those people who try to cheat but only the unhygienic pa=\r\nrt makes me sick. But I will sure remember your words next time. \n\nThanks a=\r\ngain.\n\nRegards,\nPadmaja.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Balakrishna =\r\nMurthy &lt;kbk_murthi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; My dear niece,\n&gt; I appreciate you for ex=\r\npressing what you have experienced, and say,&quot;Can someone please help me on =\r\nhow to overcome the following weakness of mine?&quot;. It is a humble request.\n&gt;=\r\n We also visited Varanasi and the places around 10 years back. Our Master w=\r\nas telling all of us while we were proceeding to Varanasi, during the cours=\r\ne of journey.\n&gt; &quot;All of you may find so much of unclean environment there i=\r\nn Varanasi. You also see cows lying across the narrow streets leading to th=\r\ne Temple, with all urine and dung split on the road. After taking a holy ba=\r\nth in the Ganges, you may have have to walk on such narrow paths leading to=\r\n the Diety and you may feel hatred for the place. The Purohits at the Gange=\r\ns demand huge amounts of money and many people seem to take advantage of ou=\r\nr needs and encash illegally. But understand that the people born at Varana=\r\nsi are fortunate. People desire and make attempts to have their last breath=\r\n there, but it is not possible to all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now let you realize a truth beh=\r\nind this. In Varanasi, there are lakhs and lakhs of SIVALINGAS in the earth=\r\n, and anywhere you try to dig, you get one.. That means you are virtually w=\r\nalking with your feet over the Lord, all along the places in Varanasi. How =\r\npainful it is to keep your feet and walk over The Almighty. So remember the=\r\n energies floating in the place and even below your feet Lord is present. D=\r\non&#39;t get hatredness and feel bad about the uncleanliness environment. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Make yourself modified, transformed to contain such unclean environment, a=\r\nnd see only the abundant energy prevailing there. It is but very difficult =\r\nto improve on whatever is said about the cleanlessness.Whenever we visit a =\r\nholy place, when we come back from the visit, we have to learn some positiv=\r\ne lessons, and the lesson here is &quot;STOP HATING ANYONE, EVEN IN SLUMS AND MO=\r\nST UN-HYGENIC PLACES, TRY TO SEE THE ALMIGHTY IN THOSE DIRTY AND SMELLING A=\r\nREAS. REALIZE THE SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS PREVAILING TO SOME OF OUR CO-HUMANS.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; So when we visit Varanasi and see all kinds of hopeless things as de=\r\nscribed by you, we should try to weigh them in the back drop of the High En=\r\nergies prevailing there, and from that point, we should learn to love peopl=\r\ne as and when, it is an instant that have to hate them.\n&gt; \n&gt; This requires =\r\na transformation in us, and we should go only with such prior preparation=\r\n=C2=A0 for pilgrimages. We should also find some positive changes in our pe=\r\nrformance, character, behavior after any visit to a holy place , a temple o=\r\nr a Master. Then the purpose served.\n&gt; \n&gt; When you will leave something in =\r\nthe Ganges, with a vow not to have it in future, you observe people leaving=\r\n vegetables, fruits etc. You may also find many leaving things they really =\r\ndo not like.\n&gt; \n&gt; But what you have to leave for ever in Ganges, is the ang=\r\nular points of character to be rounded off, anger, hatreds, jealousy,narrow=\r\n mind,stubbornness and so on. Thus every visit makes us polished.\n&gt; \n&gt; This=\r\n is not to hurt the feelings, or not to look down the deficiencies pointed =\r\nout. But to accept the realities, expect the unexpected and utilize the vis=\r\nit as an opportunity to make amends to personality.\n&gt; Love and Blessings to=\r\n you.\n&gt; Uncle Bala Krishna Murthi, Vijayawada.\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On=\r\n Sun, 17/1/10, padmaja.yarlagadda &lt;padmaja.yarlagadda@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From=\r\n: padmaja.yarlagadda &lt;padmaja.yarlagadda@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Hol=\r\niplaces and Cleanliness.\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday,=\r\n 17 January, 2010, 8:18 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Namaste all,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Can someone plea=\r\nse help me on how to overcome the following weakness of mine?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ho=\r\nw much importance should we give to the cleanliness of the holy places like=\r\n Haridwar, Varanasi etc?
