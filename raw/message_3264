You can f=\r\nind Aayushya sooktam in the following PDF file that I just uploaded:\n \nhttp=\r\n://vedicastrologer.org/mantras/aayushya_sooktam.pdf\n \nPeople perform homam =\r\nwith it by simply invoking fire, doing poorvaangam and then directly offeri=\r\nng this sooktam in fire, and then uttaraangam. In other words, praana prati=\r\nshthaa of the deity, panchopachaara pooja to the deity ets are not done. Yo=\r\nu can follow such a procedure.\n \nFor it to be more effective, finish the 9 =\r\nverses with 9 aahutis and then repeat the nine again. Repeat as many times =\r\nas you can.\n \nNormally, only ghee is used for this homam.\n \nAll the best.\n =\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;satyanandaswami@...&quot; &lt;satyana=\r\nndaswami@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha PVR Rao!\n&gt; \n&gt; Please accept my humb=\r\nle reverences.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was not able to contact you in any other way.\n&gt; I am =\r\n very happy to join\n&gt; this wonderful group.First i want to thank you from t=\r\nhe depth of my heart for you noble efforts with providing all the materials=\r\n related to Homam and wonderful recordings of the Vedic Mantras.
