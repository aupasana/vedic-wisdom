Eve=\r\nn if you leave your room with &quot;Black Shades&quot; would be fine and actually mor=\r\ne beautiful :)\n***\nAnswers to your questions:\n\n1) YES. It is portable. Ever=\r\ny day I adjust it near my window and after finishing homam, i take it back =\r\nlittle inside so that window can be closed. I am able to adjust it myself a=\r\nlone in just a few *seconds*.\n\n2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron=\r\n) of 22 Gauge. This was manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company dea=\r\nling in AC Duct installation. A Technical Supervisor of that company is my =\r\nclose family friend. He did this for me. I suggest checking with any Restau=\r\nrants. They all are having such arrangements and they would be able to help=\r\n you to contact such manufacturers.\n\n3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI Shee=\r\nt) it gets quite heated up. One can not touch during Homam. However, it als=\r\no cools down quickly. Within half an hour after Homam is finished, temperat=\r\nure of the chimney comes down to room temperature. \n\n4) It has a Metallic F=\r\nAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes of and lot of Sm=\r\noke is generated. Reasons are as follows:\n      i)The fan is powerful and m=\r\nakes a lot of noise which disturbs concentration.\n      ii) In the beginnin=\r\ng, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, disturbed the =\r\nflames and sometimes extinguished it.\n      1ii) When Fire is there in the =\r\nHomam, one need not worry about smoke handling. the reason is that the smok=\r\ne naturally travels upward and it is automatically guided to the exit of th=\r\ne chimney. Once the fire becomes strong, it generates vacuum around Homam k=\r\nundam area and starts pulling outside air. For instance, smoke from incense=\r\n stick (Agarbatti), though outside of chimney and quite far away, actually =\r\ngets diverted into the Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Hence duri=\r\nng homam, FAN is not required.\n\n      iv) Now very important thing. I used =\r\nfan for many months (only at the end of Homas). One day my fear proved righ=\r\nt. Due to heat of chimney, the cable of the Fan got burnt and there was a s=\r\nhort-circuit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not using the Fan. You may have=\r\n to go for Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you wish to use it but i am =\r\nfine without using the fan in my chimney.\nActually without Fan, The whole a=\r\nrrangement will become much Lighter and much easier to handle. Please also =\r\ndo not forget to make a support. You can see that in pictures which I have =\r\nloaded. Support is a separate part\n\n(Please check the Picture of Fan which =\r\ni have added in the Photo section)\n\nIf you have further queries, please do =\r\nnot hesitate to ask.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, Girish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram Phatakji,\n&gt; Y=\r\nou know what I am faced with the same problem that you had (and I am sure m=\r\nany \n&gt; others doing regular homam do)..

Needless to say, my neighbors will call &gt;9-1-1 in \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;no-time :)\n&gt; \n&gt; The above lighter quote is actually a practical worry whi=\r\nch many aspirants \n&gt; harbour and rightly so. I am inspired to write my stor=\r\ny in this regard. Hoping \n&gt; that it can inspire somebody on the list and re=\r\nmoves mainly the fear factor.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; about 2.5 years back, Narasimha wr=\r\note to me this: &quot;Do whatever compromises, but \n&gt; 20 minutues Homam every da=\r\ny is a must. find out ways to do that&quot;. I remember \n&gt; different fears i was=\r\n having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying guest \n&gt; with a family. =\r\nthough i had a separte room, i was not sure if they would allow \n&gt; me to do=\r\n something related to fire. that was the main worry. then there was self \n&gt;=\r\n doubt concerning my ability to perform Homam but I decided to perform and =\r\ndid \n&gt; the first Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin N=\r\navaraatri. I \n&gt; remember that i took me around 2.5 hours total including al=\r\nl the preparation \n&gt; after that rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homa=\r\nms. each Chandi homam took \n&gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtam=\r\ni day, some of My colleagues with \n&gt; family came to see my chandi Homam and=\r\n they told me that the smoke was even \n&gt; visible in the ground floor (The A=\r\npartment i was staying was on 4th) and there \n&gt; were nice smell every where=\r\n. The interesting thing is that Old lady of the \n&gt; family actually co-opera=\r\nted with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray coconut \n&gt; in to small pei=\r\nces with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions while \n&gt; cutting cocon=\r\nuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained coconut \n&gt; peices i=\r\nn Chandi Homas.\n&gt; \n&gt; My all previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-exist=\r\nent. From the very first \n&gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted af=\r\nter Navaratri and could not \n&gt; continue and there was a break of a week or =\r\nso. Then again i started daily Maha \n&gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the techn=\r\nic of breaking Dry coconut halves by \n&gt; crushing it with both palms.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nfter few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried to se=\r\narch \n&gt; for it. few families rejected when i put the condition of doing Hom=\r\nam everyday. \n&gt; at last One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger=\r\n amount but they \n&gt; allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around=\r\n 3 months. during that \n&gt; time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path =\r\neveryday for 1 year.\n&gt; \n&gt; after 3 months, i started searching for my own se=\r\nparate Rental Apartment because \n&gt; my family was joining me. Again the same=\r\n concern (Prime) is to search for \n&gt; Apartment where there is no obstacle t=\r\no do Homam. I got a brand new apartment. I \n&gt; observed the flat and finalis=\r\ned the dealing. continued Homam every day for 1 \n&gt; year. The whole flat bec=\r\name black. even the Home applicances liem refrigerator \n&gt; etc.. were covere=\r\nd with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes in the wardrobe, \n&gt; Openings of Ce=\r\nntral A/c etc... were all filled with black dust. My whole brand \n&gt; new apa=\r\nrtment became dark due to the Homam. Smoke particles travelled to my \n&gt; lun=\r\ngs and throat and i started coughing badly. I suffered with severe Cough fo=\r\nr \n&gt; many months and there was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or atl=\r\neast \n&gt; perform it once every week. But there was lot of determination prov=\r\nided by *some \n&gt; power* which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; After 1 year=\r\n in that Apartment, i started serching different place. I searched \n&gt; whole=\r\n area and was looking for a apartment which also has Balcony so that My \n&gt; =\r\nhomam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look black and there =\r\nare \n&gt; no more complaints from my wife .\n&gt; I could not get one such perfect=\r\n place which gives me a Blacony and at the same \n&gt; time there are no buidli=\r\nngs in front which can observe me doing homam in balcony \n&gt; and make a inst=\r\nant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very \n&gt; comfirtabl=\r\ne and required option so that i can do it there and smoke handling \n&gt; becom=\r\nes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky because any \n&gt;=\r\n road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.\n&gt; Finally i got on=\r\ne aprtment without balcony but with a special location. When i \n&gt; vacated t=\r\nhe previous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was shell-shocked \n&gt; look=\r\ning at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone - &quot;Aaap Kya =\r\n\n&gt; karata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the =\r\n\n&gt; compensation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal i=\r\nnstaed \n&gt; of going to police station.\n&gt; \n&gt; In new Apartment (current one), =\r\nsecurity is very tight. But I decided to make an \n&gt; arrangement so that i d=\r\no not *spoil* condition of the  Apartment. hence i came \n&gt; out with the Ide=\r\na of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo section) \n&gt; and starte=\r\nd doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible to neighbours and other \n&gt; fla=\r\nt owners, no body has complained till now. neither to police nor to securit=\r\ny \n&gt; personnel. Only once Security person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a fe=\r\nw days and \n&gt; started as usual. It is going on till today. I do not know ab=\r\nout tomorrow but i \n&gt; do not worry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, =\r\nit is more than clear to me \n&gt; that It is not I who is arranging all these =\r\nbut there is Mother behind all \n&gt; these. SHE is making my road clear so tha=\r\nt i can perform Homam as i wish.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; The moral of the story is that =\r\nif you genuinely desire to perform Homam/Havan, \n&gt; then It will be done. No=\r\n obstacle will stand on your way.\n&gt; Do not fear. All the fears will break l=\r\nike Papads once you start walking over \n&gt; them to do homam. i can swear for=\r\n it!\n&gt; \n&gt; No owner will kick you out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1 and even=\r\n if that \n&gt; happens, there will open a way!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;=\r\n PS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar! \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Thanks very much for the photo.
