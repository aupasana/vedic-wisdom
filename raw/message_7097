When we are \ntense or agitated, our breathing will be agitated and out of rhythm. \nBreathing is an important indicator of the mental state and it is very \nimportant to control the breathing. In fact, we say &quot;prANAnAyamya&quot; \nbefore every ritual. It means &quot;having disciplined the pranas&quot;.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLet me give an analogy.\n\nPhysical body is like a chariot. Pranas or lifeforces are like the \nhorses driving the chariot. Without horses, chariot does not move (like \ncorpse). Horses are what makes the chaiot move. Simialarly, it is the \nlifeforce within us that makes us live and do things.\n\nMind is like the driver controlling the horses. Breathing is like the \nreins held by the driver to control the horses. Intellect is like the \nminister sitting in the chariot and instructing the driver now and then \non where to go. Soul is like the king sitting back in the chariot and \nenjoying the ride. Whether the ride is good or bad, king is relaxed and \nsits back. He leaves it to the minister and the driver to take care of \nthings and does not get involved.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf the driver loses control, horses may run here and there and things \nmay get out of control. When the horses are running out of control, \ndriver needs to pull the reins and try to gain control over the horses. \nSimilarly, when the lifeforce is going out of control, mind needs to \nregain control by controlling the breathing.\n\nThere are many different kinds of pranayamas (breathing control \nexercises). The most popular one is &quot;Anulom Vilom Pranayam&quot;. Even \nwithout any special exercise, it is possible to control breathing by \nsimply becoming aware of it.\n\nFocus the attention on breathing. Become aware of air coming in, lugs \ngetting filled and expanding, lungs pushing diaphragm down, diaphragm \npushing down and stomach expanding out, then stomach depressing in, \ndiaphragm being pushed up, diaphragm pushing lungs us, lungs \ncontracting, lungs being emptied and air going out. Become aware of all \nthis and do it slowly, rhythmically and calmly. Don&#39;t breath too full \nthat lungs struggle for space. Breath in slowly and fill lungs slightly \nless than the capacity so that it feels comfortable even when lungs are \nfull. Make sure that breathing out also happens slowly and rhythmically. \nIf you do this slowly and with attention, for a few minutes, pranas will \nbecome regular and mind will become calm. This enables one to focus \nbetter on whatever mind is doing.\n\nAfter all, if horses are running around out of control, driver will \nstruggle to take the chariot where it needs to go. Once the driver gets \ncontrol over horses, it is far easier to take the chariot where it needs \nto go. Similarly, controlling breathing and pranas enhance one the \nability to do what one is doing, better.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn the modern society, so many people are stressed out and their systems \nare out of order. Consciously controlling the breathing will benefit \nmany of them. Even 5-10 minute pranayama daily can make a difference. \nDoing pranayama for 2-3 minutes before any important activity can also \nhelp a lot.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
