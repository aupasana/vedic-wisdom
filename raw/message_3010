I occasionally visit this forum. I happened to s=\r\nee several emails about AOL and the below email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; As =\r\na follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sr=\r\ni Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few things to the extent of my under=\r\nstanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of S=\r\nat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devoti=\r\non, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does=\r\n not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo =\r\nwould call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly em=\r\nerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowl=\r\ny and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karm=\r\na yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan=\r\n Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan =\r\nKriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind and preparing for med=\r\nitation and doing other spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest=\r\n of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya rem=\r\noves / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; \n&gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepar=\r\ne the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and S=\r\nun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses fall u=\r\nnder this category.\n&gt; \n&gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams,=\r\n Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living cour=\r\nse, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Knowled=\r\nge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sut=\r\nras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravi=\r\nshankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the above. His commen=\r\ntary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available com=\r\nmentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily stud=\r\ny of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of=\r\n this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to become Art of Living tea=\r\nchers.\n&gt; \n&gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to =\r\nGuru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL s=\r\natsangs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder=\r\n about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me clarify from my perso=\r\nnal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master livi=\r\nng in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotee=\r\ns in every step of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Se=\r\nveral get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice)=\r\n, some in person and several via various other ways. However, to get these =\r\nguidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stag=\r\ne, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries o=\r\nn various Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage wher=\r\ne conscious inner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several of t=\r\nhe senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high =\r\norder capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during medita=\r\ntion. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as chan=\r\nnels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achieve=\r\nd highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Ma=\r\nharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are in phys=\r\nical form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;=\r\ns largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder =\r\nSri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the chari=\r\ntable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teachers ha=\r\nve given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to become=\r\n teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the mon=\r\ney. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very bad an=\r\nd sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses.=\r\n This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum =\r\nnumber of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives=\r\n by going without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, te=\r\nrrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. =\r\nwith nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I know,=\r\n money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Past experience s=\r\nhowed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices mor=\r\ne diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be d=\r\nenied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was par=\r\nt of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where pe=\r\nople took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. =\r\nWhenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their =\r\nown pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the =\r\nvictims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) This is my=\r\n understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL =\r\nteachers and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fina=\r\nlly, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and expres=\r\ns the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one foll=\r\nows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai=\r\n Gurudev!\n&gt;    Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PV=\r\nR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was some discussion o=\r\nn breathing exercises such as Sudarshan kriya taught at AOL courses. I do n=\r\not want to comment on specific courses or techniques, but will make a comme=\r\nnt on Raja yoga practices in general.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Breathing is a very important=\r\n activity and is connected to the balance between sympathetic and parasympa=\r\nthetic nervous systems. It maintains the life force and emotional balance. =\r\nSeveral breathing exercises are taught by various scriptures and traditions=\r\n, such as praanaayaama taught by Baba Ramdev of Patanjali Yoga Foundation, =\r\nKriya yoga taught by Mahavatar Babaji and Paramahamsa Yogananda, Sudarsana =\r\nkriya taught by Art Of Living foundation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All these fall under Raja=\r\n yoga, in the four-fold division of Jnaana, Bhakti, Karma and Raja yogas. I=\r\nf these exercises are used as a means to regulate breathing and thoughts up=\r\nto some level and keep the body fit, it is fine. They are quite useful.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was watching a nice TV program of a Baba=\r\n who popularized praanaayaamas like kapaalabhaati and anuloma-viloma among =\r\nIndian masses. He talked about breathing in and out slowly and gradually re=\r\naching nirbeeja samadhi through it. I was amused. Most people have too many=\r\n (and quite firm) impurities in their subtle bodies in the form of prior me=\r\nntal conditioning to be cleared just through breathing exercises and to rea=\r\nch samadhi - nirbeeja or sabeeja - just by doing praanaayaama. However, I l=\r\nike the praanaayaamas he teaches. In fact, things like anuloma-viloma praan=\r\naayaama and kapaalabhaati are badly needed in today&#39;s stressed out world. H=\r\nowever, I see this as something that relieves physical and emotional stress=\r\n and enables better spiritual sadhana, rather than something that enables s=\r\npiritual realization.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, there are yogic techniques meant f=\r\nor raising Kundalini forcefully (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhara bandha). B=\r\nut, with such techniques, one is playing with fire. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=\r\n discouraged his disciples (e.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda) fro=\r\nm Hatha yoga and other Raja yoga practices, telling them to stay away from =\r\npractices that emphasize the body and to absorb the mind in god&#39;a name inst=\r\nead. He said that realizng god through practices that emphasize the body an=\r\nd its perfection, is nearly impossible in this age due to impurities presen=\r\nt everywhere, in food, water, air and thinking.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one practices ya=\r\nma, niyama etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be possible to go=\r\n into samadhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrealistic for m=\r\nost people. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a boat (body) =\r\nis given to one. If one is close to the bank (liberation), one can just jum=\r\np out of the boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle of an ocean ju=\r\nmps out of the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaana yoga, bhakt=\r\ni yoga or karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability to work withou=\r\nt expectations as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank. In raaja yog=\r\na, one takes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of the boat. Tha=\r\nt will work if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite elevated. Other=\r\nwise, just jumping out of the boat is very risky. Raja yoga requires a lot =\r\nof preparation. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru to gauge one&#39;s=\r\n progress and prescribe the next steps at every stage. If some things are d=\r\none too early, it may result in irreversible damage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: Us=\r\ne various praanaayaamas, kriyas and other exercises for physical and emotio=\r\nnal health and to create an environment conducive to spiritual sadhana. But=\r\n do not be under an impression that you can realize god through such activi=\r\nties alone. That may have been possible in the past, but it nearly impossib=\r\nle for most people today.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding cha=\r\nrging a lot of money for such things, one should realize that Ramakrishna a=\r\nnd Ramana maharshi stayed away from money for a reason. When Srila Prabhupa=\r\nda initiated so many people into mahamantra, he did not charge any fee. He =\r\nhad faith in Krishna and ended up building a really big organization, thoug=\r\nh he did not demand any fee for his lectures or initiations and did not kee=\r\np his teachings secretive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If Ramakrishna Mutt is doing great servi=\r\nce even today, it is because the organization was built by Swami Vivekanand=\r\na, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Shivananda and Swami Premananda with a lot of s=\r\nattwa guna and they kept rajas and tamas at bay. They suffered in the begin=\r\nning and it took a long time to build, but it will last a long time. Things=\r\n built with tamas or rajas do not last too long and do not take people to g=\r\nod. One intending to build an organization to fulfil one&#39;s dharma should tr=\r\ny to ensure that sattwa drives the activities and not rajas or tamas. Usual=\r\nly, money brings rajas or even tamas into picture and that is why great mas=\r\nters have been wary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There may be exceptions of course. All activit=\r\nies of a fully realized and liberated soul without any self-identification =\r\nare guided by sattwa. If such a person builds an organization based on sell=\r\ning divine knowledge, it means that Nature wanted him/her to sell divine kn=\r\nowledge for some reason. Such things are possible but rare. In general, you=\r\n see great souls like Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi and Srila Prabhupada ope=\r\nrating within their means and not charging for spiritual knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
