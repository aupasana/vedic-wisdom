If Mother decides, She can c=\r\nonvert anybody into a great saint in a split second. I am glad you and your=\r\n parents have taken important steps and good luck.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Each being has a d=\r\nifferent background and different conditioning and hence a different purpos=\r\ne to serve in the world. We do not know what is right for us, but Mother do=\r\nes. As we plead with her to help us, She gives us exactly what is needed by=\r\n us for progressing spiritually, pay off the kaarmik debts and become free.=\r\n One person may first need material stability to progress spiritually. One =\r\nperson may need to give up material life and go to a monastery. One person =\r\nmay need to become affluent and construct temples. The kaarmik forces are d=\r\nriving each person in different paths. Mother finds the best course for eac=\r\nh person to reach the same place based on where they are and what their mom=\r\nentum is.\n&gt;  \n&gt; She may give money to one person to provide some stability =\r\nso that the person does sadhana without distractions. She may give money to=\r\n another person to test him and see if his focus on god wavers. She is the =\r\nDirector with the full script of the movie, while we are two cent actors wh=\r\no act in one or two scenes and know nothing about the rest of the movie.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; I suggest not worrying too much about any specifics. Just learn to thin=\r\nk that the Mother (or Father if you prefer that way, because Father and Mot=\r\nher are not really two different *people* but two different personification=\r\ns of the same Force that runs the universe) knows what is best and we need =\r\nto do what we can and accept what She gives us. Try to develop an equanimou=\r\ns state of mind where you accept anything She gives you (riches or poverty,=\r\n health or sickness, fame or ridicule) with an equal vision.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\nPranam Guruji,\n \n thank you so much for your reply .. a=\r\nnd i cant explain in words how much of inspiring it is to get replies from =\r\nyou and from all my seniors in here.. i always feel blessed at all times.i =\r\nwill try my best to do so .. \n\nregards sayantan,\n\nJai Maa \n\n\n"}}
