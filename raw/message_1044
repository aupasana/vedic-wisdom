\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hare Krishna\n&gt; Dear friend.\n&gt; The fact y=\r\nou are feeling this way shows your\n&gt; inclination to take the high road.\n&gt; N=\r\not a blade of grass moves without the sanction of the\n&gt; Lord.\n&gt; Everything =\r\nis happening according to his will.\n&gt; Surrender, and accept.\n&gt; Our karmas a=\r\nre so entangled , it is hard to understand\n&gt; them.\n&gt; Personally, as Ive got=\r\nten older it is easier to &quot;let\n&gt; go&quot; of things.\n&gt; Also, in the whole scheme=\r\n of things, better to devote\n&gt; our energy to positive things.\n&gt; One can exp=\r\nend our energy holding onto apparent wrongs\n&gt; and injustices, but best to t=\r\nake the high road and\n&gt; look around and see others who are must worse off t=\r\nhan\n&gt; ourselves.\n&gt; My mother used to say\n&gt; &quot; I used to complain about no sh=\r\noes until  I saw a man\n&gt; with no feet&quot;.\n&gt; So my next words are that, for me=\r\n, each day , I count\n&gt; my blessings.\n&gt; Instead of counting my complaints, I=\r\n count my fortune,\n&gt; my blessings.\n&gt; Look around and see all the animals an=\r\nd peoples who\n&gt; are oblivious of Gods divine creation.\n&gt; Give thanks, remem=\r\nber -\n&gt; Pray to the Lord that he also stays by your side even\n&gt; when you fo=\r\nrget him.\n&gt; With your human birth , take option to serve God.\n&gt; Whatever yo=\r\nur mind is fixed on determines your next\n&gt; birth, so do you want to be thin=\r\nking of these things\n&gt; with family members and injustice?\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantra- Enga=\r\nge your mind in mantra, and your body in\n&gt; service.\n&gt; With a sincere heart,=\r\n God cleans your heart of\n&gt; impurities,\n&gt; Just chant and clean the dust fro=\r\nm your heart, clean\n&gt; the dirt from many lifetimes, chant the names of the\n=\r\n&gt; Lord with love and faith, all will fall in place.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes\n&gt; Laks=\r\nhmi\n&gt; --- &quot;sri3440@...&quot; &lt;sri3440@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; since this group focu=\r\nses on vedic wisdom, and have\n&gt; &gt; seen learned \n&gt; &gt; dsicussions by Narasimh=\r\na and others, thought I send\n&gt; &gt; this out seeking \n&gt; &gt; the right (vedic) wa=\r\ny to remediate ..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for the past few years i am remembering my past =\r\nhow\n&gt; &gt; people have \n&gt; &gt; influenced me badly and made me a weaker person. b=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; lack of guidance, \n&gt; &gt; these people who are very close to me (relativ=\r\nes,\n&gt; &gt; friends) have made \n&gt; &gt; me choose wrong choices etc. i am in a mess=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; psychologically and \n&gt; &gt; spiritually. I believed in god all along, di=\r\nd my\n&gt; &gt; japam etc. why did i \n&gt; &gt; fall prey to these people? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i r=\r\nealize now that after many years, these people\n&gt; &gt; are ignorant. I \n&gt; &gt; wan=\r\nted to say &#39;ignorant fools&#39; but there are some\n&gt; &gt; elders involved \n&gt; &gt; her=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i can assume this as karma phala, but the past is\n&gt; &gt; hindering=\r\n me. there \n&gt; &gt; is so much pent up anger, that i want to go back and\n&gt; &gt; ki=\r\nck these \n&gt; &gt; people who have mis guided me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; how do I forigve thes=\r\ne people and forget? even gita,\n&gt; &gt; or homam etc are \n&gt; &gt; not any reprive. =\r\nthe soul is frustrated ... what\n&gt; &gt; does god get out of \n&gt; &gt; this drama?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; any thoughts, wise men and women?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
