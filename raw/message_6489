Having scrutinized the worlds that are attained through action, a B=\r\nrahmana should arrive at dispassion and indifference. For the sake of this =\r\nknowledge, let him go, fuel in hand, to a spiritual teacher who is learned =\r\nin the srutis and established in Brahman. Those who have ascertained the me=\r\naning of the Vedanta knowledge, the earnest seekers after truth, with natur=\r\nes purified through sannyasa yoga, they all, in the region of Brahman at th=\r\ne end of time, are liberated beyond death.=E2=80=9D \n\n\n"}}
