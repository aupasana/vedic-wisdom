I am using Baraha Unicode software. An=\r\ny way, I have to type completely, since Baraha is not supporting vedic swar=\r\nas for Tamil language (Tamil language has its own limitations for subtle so=\r\nunds) and I have to find suitable/ subtle ways to get the same word to get =\r\nthe same pronounciation. This document will be a quick reference guide (or =\r\n&quot;cheat sheet&quot;) containing only mantras and no instructions. I will send the=\r\n same to Narasimha before end of the week so that he can publish it in his =\r\nwebsite. He can also add it to the main manual.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Shankar\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thanks to the efforts of Ravi Por=\r\nuri and Kishore Chitrapu, we now have Mahagnapathi homam manual and Shiva h=\r\nomam manual available with mantras written in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam=\r\n scripts (in addition to Sanskrit and English scripts). The instructions an=\r\nd explanations continue to be in English, but the mantras are written in th=\r\nese languages for ease of reading.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We have also made available a =\r\nquick reference guide (or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;) containing only mantras and no ins=\r\ntructions. If you already read the manual and feel comfortable with the pro=\r\ncedure and only want a printout of mantras to refer to, you can download it=\r\n and use it. It is also available for Mahaganapathi homam and Shiva homam i=\r\nn Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit and English scripts.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just =\r\ngo to the homam website below and go to Mahaganapathi homam or Shiva homam =\r\nlink to download these additions.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Other homam manuals will also b=\r\ne available in this format soon. Ravi and Kishore are slowly working on one=\r\n manual after another.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Baraha software from baraha.com was used f=\r\nor Indian languages (big thanks to them!). They have Vedic swaras available=\r\n only in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. If you want the manual in any other=\r\n Indian language, please send a nice note requesting the friendly developer=\r\ns of baraha o add support for vedic swaras in that language. As they add th=\r\nis support in other languages, we will create more homam manuals.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n In the long run, I want manuals to be fully translated to various Indian l=\r\nanguages, i.e. instructions and explanations also in Telugu, Kannada, Malay=\r\nalam etc. But that may take a long time.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
