The specific person I have in mind is Pandit Gopi Krishna (http://ww=\r\nw.om- guru.com/ html/saints/ gopi.html), the most well known person in mode=\r\nrn times to have raised his Kundalini, and documented it. In his book, it i=\r\ns clearly indicated that at one point, he was virtually at the point of dea=\r\nth and was saved when he ate (probably several times - maybe even consisten=\r\ntly after that) some Kashmiri meat dish. I dont have the book in front of m=\r\ne, but he had indicated that at that stage of development, he could barely =\r\neat a few spoonfuls of rice and some milk (in the entire day), after which =\r\nhe was immediately enveloped in some sort of searing pain related to Kundal=\r\nini. But upon eating the Kashmiri meat dish, the pain subsided, his appetit=\r\ne increased, and he was quickly on the road\n to recovery. You might dismiss=\r\n his level of spiritual development, but if you simply read the link about =\r\nhis experiences, it might make you think twice about that conclusion..\n\n\n\nS=\r\neparately, I have heard from some &quot;enlightened&quot; Buddhist types, who didnt k=\r\nnow anything about Gopi Krishna, also say the same thing. \n\n\n\nI&#39;m only thro=\r\nwing in this information into the mix - I havent formed a strong opinion my=\r\nself..\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;pv=\r\nr108&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; I have been extremely busy=\r\n at work for a while now and will continue to be, working long hours everyd=\r\nay. I just saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few quick =\r\npoints.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Self-identification of human be=\r\nings and animals with body and body parts is much much stronger and denser =\r\nthan that of plants and trees. Self-identification of plants and trees is v=\r\nery subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a pla=\r\nnt or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand=\r\n, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emotion expe=\r\nrienced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify with the=\r\n body and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; The kaarmik debt formed by eating the=\r\n flesh of an animal, which the animal&#39;s mind considers as a part of &quot;I&quot; and=\r\n is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eati=\r\nng leaves, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.\n\n=\r\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; As long as we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts=\r\n is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.\n\n&gt;  \n\n=\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; You are what you eat. Our body and various ch=\r\nemicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Meat is=\r\n highly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and =\r\nidentification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After=\r\n all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its b=\r\nody, the quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not =\r\nconducive to spiritual progress.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; It is =\r\npossible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remained fully s=\r\naattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a person. One wanting to o=\r\nvercome identification with the body and make spiritual progress, is better=\r\n off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc wi=\r\nth mild spices).\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; If a meat-eating person stops eating meat and eats=\r\n cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for protein) for several month=\r\ns, while trying to read spiritual literature and trying to make spiritual p=\r\nrogress, one will see that it makes a big difference.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked deer f=\r\nor Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misguided propagand=\r\na in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes from classics o=\r\nr scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Swa=\r\nmi Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to be=\r\n more pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat. It i=\r\ns wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.\n\n&gt;  \n\n&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1278459892-1260841134=:91920\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Namaste Sundeep,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I can believe w=\r\nhat Gopi Krishna experienced.

The specific person =\r\nI have in mind is Pandit Gopi Krishna (&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.om-guru.com/html/saints/gopi.html&quot;&gt;http://www.om- guru=\r\n.com/ html/saints/ gopi.html&lt;/a&gt;), the most well known person in modern tim=\r\nes to have raised his Kundalini, and documented it. In his book, it is clea=\r\nrly indicated that at one point, he was virtually at the point of death and=\r\n was saved when he ate (probably several times - maybe even consistently af=\r\nter that) some Kashmiri meat dish. I dont have the book in front of me, but=\r\n he had indicated that at that stage of development, he could barely eat a =\r\nfew spoonfuls of rice and some milk (in the entire day), after which he was=\r\n immediately enveloped in some sort of searing pain related to Kundalini. B=\r\nut upon eating the\n Kashmiri meat dish, the pain subsided, his appetite inc=\r\nreased, and he was quickly on the road to recovery. You might dismiss his l=\r\nevel of spiritual development, but if you simply read the link about his ex=\r\nperiences, it might make you think twice about that conclusion..&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nS=\r\neparately, I have heard from some &quot;enlightened&quot; Buddhist types, who didnt k=\r\nnow anything about Gopi Krishna, also say the same thing. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;m onl=\r\ny throwing in this information into the mix - I havent formed a strong opin=\r\nion myself..&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSundeep&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;n=\r\nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;pvr108&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have been extremely busy at work for a while n=\r\now and will continue to be, working long hours everyday. I just saw a few m=\r\nails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few quick points.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Self-identification of human =\r\nbeings and animals with body and body parts is much much stronger and dense=\r\nr than that of plants and trees. Self-identification of plants and trees is=\r\n very subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a p=\r\nlant or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the other ha=\r\nnd, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emotion ex=\r\nperienced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify with t=\r\nhe body and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The kaarmik debt formed=\r\n by eating the flesh of an animal, which the animal&#39;s mind considers as a p=\r\nart of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt =\r\nformed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or killi=\r\nng bacteria.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As long as we live in a physical body, cre=\r\nation of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the deb=\r\nts we create newly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; You are what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormones in i=\r\nt are formed based on what we eat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Meat is highly taama=\r\nsik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identificatio=\r\nn with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one =\r\nis eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the qual=\r\nity of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to =\r\nspiritual progress.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; It is possible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remai=\r\nned fully saattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a person. One w=\r\nanting to overcome identification with the body and make spiritual progress=\r\n, is better off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, gr=\r\nains etc with mild spices).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If a meat-eating person sto=\r\nps eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for pro=\r\ntein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual literature and try=\r\ning to make spiritual progress, one will see that it makes a big difference=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Someone menti=\r\noned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters l=\r\nike this, there is a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertion=\r\ns not backed by specific quotes from classics or scriptures that can be ver=\r\nified by scholars are best ignored.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda a=\r\nnd Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to be more pro-active=\r\n and energetic. But that does not require eating meat. It is wrong to attri=\r\nbute to them support of meat eating.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;=\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-1278459892-1260841134=:91920--\r\n\n"}}
