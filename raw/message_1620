So, our next step =\r\nshould be practical and enable us to cultivate the niyama of performing it =\r\neveryday without any obstacles. Keeping this in mind, I myself started perf=\r\norming Mahaganapathi Homam everyday. Doing homam for all gods can be cumber=\r\nsome and more importantly to introduce the concept of niyama, which include=\r\ns sticking to one god. So, options a & b are ruled out. I suggest c.\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\negards\n&gt; -Narayan-\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaskaram friends, & anjoo,\n   I totally agree wit=\r\nh you, Praying defferent Gods on each day in the ways like homa, japa, tapa=\r\nh, puja, etc. just like doing without concentrateing our will i think this =\r\nis useless, keeping our heart clear i mean without any other thoughts, and =\r\nconcentrating on God svarupa in  our thought or in our mind, just in very s=\r\nhort time we get the blessings of that God, its personal exeriance.\n\nRegard=\r\ns\nHarikishan.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;anooj_=\r\n001&quot; &lt;anooj_001@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few questions =\r\nwhich I hope to get the answers here.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A =3D do homams for all go=\r\nds daily\n&gt; &gt; B =3D do homams daily according to the ruling day god\n&gt; &gt; C =\r\n=3D do Ganesha&#39;s homams daily too\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Should I do option &quot;A&quot; daily ? o=\r\nr option &quot;B&quot; + &quot;C&quot; ? or should it be option &quot;A&quot; + &quot;C&quot; ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please hel=\r\np me in clearing my confusion.
