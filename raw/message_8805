Some of the few intellectual leaders who have, in fact, =\r\naddressed this issue in a truly systematic and well-formulated ideological =\r\nway include Dr. David Frawley (Sri Vedacharya Vamadeva Shastri), Sitaram Go=\r\nel, Ram Swarup and Dr. Koenraad Elst.  I have also written about this topic=\r\n very extensively, but have only begun releasing a limited number of my wri=\r\ntings on this matter to the general public starting in early 2011, The Dhar=\r\nma Manifesto being the ideological d=E9nouement of these writings.  The fol=\r\nlowing are a few thoughts on the current state of contemporary Dharma polit=\r\nics on the South Asian subcontinent, with an emphasis on the specific case =\r\nof what is often termed &quot;Hindu&quot; Nationalism.\n&gt; \n&gt; As we will see, the prima=\r\nry stumbling block that has relegated the greater Hindutva movement to near=\r\n irrelevancy in the dual realms of both ideological development and engaged=\r\n political action has been:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Its preponderance of reactionary thinki=\r\nng and action, rather than proactive cultivation of a more revolutionary ou=\r\ntlook and practical strategy to both a.)gain political power and to b.) con=\r\nsequently govern the Indian nation-state along purely Dharmic principles.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 2) The lack of the divinely-bestowed spiritual empowerment that is nece=\r\nssary for any self-described religious-based movement to secure meaningful =\r\nsuccess.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the time the British and other European powers began the i=\r\nncremental process of colonial domination in India and the rest of South As=\r\nia in 1757, much of the Hindu community in north India specifically had alr=\r\neady experienced hundreds of years of genocidal religious cleansing at the =\r\nhands of the Mughals and other Islamic invaders before them. Without doubt,=\r\n the establishment of European rule over India directly saved Hinduism (and=\r\n, arguably, much of Vedic spiritual culture that served as the ancient basi=\r\ns of the later phenomenon of &quot;Hinduism&quot;) from inexorable extinction at the =\r\nhands of Islam.  If the British had not assumed the administration of India=\r\n when they did, Hinduism would most likely not exist today, and all of pres=\r\nent day India would be an Islamic state. All followers of Dharma must be et=\r\nernally grateful to the British for this inadvertent rescue of the non-Isla=\r\nmic elements of Indian culture.\n&gt; \n&gt; During the more liberal atmosphere of =\r\nthe British Raj period (1857-1947), history witnessed the beginning stages =\r\nof a budding, if often very confused, and ultimately self-abnegating, Hindu=\r\n renaissance with the emergence of such neo-Hindu movements as the Arya Sam=\r\naj, Ramakrishna Mission and Hindu Mahasabha, as well as such Hindu leaders =\r\nas Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902), Bhaktivinode Thakura (1838-1914), Bal Gan=\r\ngadhar Tilak (1856-1920), Arumuga Navalar (1822-1879), Gedong Bagus Oka (19=\r\n21-2002), Sister Nivedita (1867-1911)[2], Annie Besant (1847-1933)[3], and =\r\nmany others. As a result of the rediscovery of their Vedic heritage on the =\r\npart of many 19th century and early 20th century Hindu intellectual leaders=\r\n, a new sense of political activism in the name of a rediscovered &quot;Hinduism=\r\n&quot; cautiously developed with the nascent political theories of such people a=\r\ns Vinayak Damodar Savarkar (1883-1966) and Keshav Baliram Hedgewar (1889-19=\r\n40).\n&gt; \n&gt; The culmination of this new movement, which was decidedly devoted=\r\n to a Hindu identity politics, has resulted in the overwhelmingly dominant =\r\nrole of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (founded in 1925) and its greater S=\r\nangh Pariwar family of front organizations over the realm of Hindu politics=\r\n in India for the last 85 years.  The overtly political manifestation of th=\r\ne Sangh Pariwar movement was eventually manifest in the later Jana Sangh po=\r\nlitical party.  The party operated under this name from 1951-1980.  It was =\r\nfounded by Dr. Shyama Prasad Mookerjee (1901-1953), who was subsequently mu=\r\nrdered by the Congress Party regime in 1953. Since 1980, the party has been=\r\n known by the name Bharatiya Janata Party.[4]\n&gt; \n&gt; There has been a clear, =\r\nmulti-stage trajectory in which pro-Hindu political ideology and activism h=\r\nave progressed in the last 135 or so years.  Before I discuss the nature of=\r\n that trajectory in any significant depth, first I need to lay out the thre=\r\ne general morphologies that most political formulations have historically t=\r\naken.  There are three general forms of political activity observable in th=\r\ne modern political realm: 1) Utopian, 2) Reactionary, 3) Revolutionary.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Utopian designates a primarily futuristic-oriented politics that tends to=\r\n be very unrealistic and fantasy-fueled.  In many cases utopian-based ideol=\r\nogies tend to be eschatologically-driven and millennial in outlook, with th=\r\ne never-achieved (or achievable) promise of a perfect paradise on earth tha=\r\nt can only be delivered by the particular political movement making the giv=\r\nen promise. Such disastrously failed movements as Marxism, Leninism, Maoism=\r\n, Anarchism and the political Left in general are Utopian in nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; R=\r\neactionary, on the contrary, is primarily past-oriented[5] and looks toward=\r\n a &quot;better, more ordered time&quot;, that is historically usually no more than s=\r\neveral generations previous to the present era, as the archetypal hallmark =\r\nand model for present-day cultural renewal.  As Nicol=E1s G=F3mez D=E1vila =\r\n explains the mindset of the reactionary: &quot;The reactionary is, nevertheless=\r\n, the fool who takes up the vanity of condemning history and the immorality=\r\n of resigning himself to it.&quot; American reactionaries, for example, tend to =\r\nsee the 1950s as the apex of American civilization. As is clear from the te=\r\nrm itself, reactionaries are capable only of reacting to assaults on tradit=\r\nion that they detect around them, and are usually incapable of proffering p=\r\nro-active and positive ideas for how to foundationally transform society fo=\r\nr the better in the face of modernity&#39;s degenerate encroachment upon tradit=\r\nional values and culture. Reactionaries are especially known for timidity, =\r\nintellectual incuriosity, lack of vision, as well as narrow parochialism an=\r\nd immaturely expressed xenophobia.  Republicans, Tories, and the conservati=\r\nve Right in general fall under this general heading. Utopian and Reactionar=\r\ny represent the two furthest opposing extremes of the political spectrum.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Revolutionary, on the other hand, describes a political stance that is =\r\nproactive and constructive in nature, rather than merely utopian or reactio=\r\nnary.  Rather than supporting either unrealistic utopian goals, or merely r=\r\neacting in an ineffectively knee-jerk fashion to the incessant attacks of i=\r\nts opponents,  the revolutionary perspective proffers positive systemic cha=\r\nnge designed to transform the basic characteristics of a presently-given so=\r\ncial reality in a wholly original and fundamental way.  Revolutionaries see=\r\nk to alter society, not merely peripherally and incrementally, but foundati=\r\nonally and swiftly.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the very specifically Hindu/Vedic context, the =\r\nrevolutionary perspective looks at the ancient past (and not merely two or =\r\nthree generations back, but millennia back) as the source from which to der=\r\nive eternal principles that are designed to be used in the present day to c=\r\nreate a radically better future. The Dharmic revolutionary subscribes to an=\r\n archeofuturism, to use Guillaume Faye&#39;s instructive terminology.[6] Rather=\r\n than merely dreaming about an unobtainable future based upon blind faith a=\r\nnd wishful thinking, or conversely, merely reacting in a frustrated manner =\r\nto the negative occurrences happening around them, revolutionaries seek sys=\r\ntemic (and not merely cosmetic) change in the here and now.\n&gt; \n&gt; The term &quot;=\r\nRevolutionary&quot; tends to carry with it the stereotyped, and wholly inaccurat=\r\ne, notion of political violence, which is not at all the technical denotati=\r\non of this word in political science terminology.  Rather, by &quot;Revolutionar=\r\ny&quot; is meant a concept, ideology or movement whose aim is to affect fundamen=\r\ntal systemic changes (i.e., a change of the prevailing system itself), rath=\r\ner than merely cosmetic or surface change alone (i.e., minutial changes and=\r\n readjustments within the confines of the system).  With this proper unders=\r\ntanding of the terminology, the term &quot;Revolutionary&quot; does not in any way de=\r\nnote violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; In brief, a Revolutionary movement must have the follow=\r\ning features:\n&gt; \n&gt; A) It is predicated upon a grand, but rationally achieva=\r\nble, vision.\n&gt; \n&gt; B) It is led by a professional vanguard of elite leaders =\r\ndedicated to achieving the vision, (b.i) who are capable of intellectually =\r\nformulating that vision into ideological form, (b.ii) who know how to organ=\r\nized the masses in both the largest and most effective ways necessary to ac=\r\nhieve the vision, and (b.iii) who themselves wholly personify the vision of=\r\n the movement in their own personal character and lifestyle; i.e., the lead=\r\ner is the movement.\n&gt; \n&gt; C) It has a clearly and systematically formulated =\r\nideology that encompasses the totality of political concern, including a co=\r\nmprehensive and defensible internal ideological structure, the minutia of e=\r\nconomics, a philosophy of governance, social relations, geopolitical formul=\r\nations, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; D) It has the ability to both formulate constructive alli=\r\nances with like-motivated movements/organizations, and has a keen understan=\r\nding of all aspects of the opposing forces.\n&gt; \n&gt; E) Most importantly of all=\r\n: a revolutionary has the resolute will to win.\n&gt; \n&gt; As we look at the last=\r\n 135 or so years of modern Hinduism, we see that Hindu forms of political e=\r\nxpression have progressed roughly and sequentially, though certainly with s=\r\nignificant overlaps, through the above three stages of Utopian, Reactionary=\r\n, and Revolutionary.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We Are One&quot; =96 Utopian Stage (1875-1925)\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\neginning in the Colonial era, and continuing down to today, such historical=\r\n trends as the 19th century neo-Hindu movements and Radical Universalism, a=\r\ns well as such historic figures as Swami Vivekananda, Gandhi, and many of t=\r\nhe earlier gurus who came to the West, clearly represented an early Utopian=\r\n stage of Hindu political expression.  The concerns of such Hindu Utopians =\r\nincluded such unrealistic liberal Western notions as radical egalitarianism=\r\n, universalism, evolutionary and historico-progressive world-views, tempora=\r\nl-centrism,[7] and such emotionally-driven eschatological visions as the fu=\r\nture establishment of a pan-ecumenical world political order =96 what today=\r\n would be more accurately termed the New World Order.  Such intellectually =\r\npuerile sentiments, however, did not (and could not) lead to the type of st=\r\nrong Vedic restoration movement necessary to revive Dharma globally.\n&gt; \n&gt; S=\r\nuch a Vedic restoration is necessarily radically traditionalist in nature, =\r\nand is thoroughly opposed to all the key corrosive elements that have rende=\r\nred modernity non-viable. The German intellectual Edgar Julius Jung (1894-1=\r\n934) presciently describes a similar vision of such a restoration in the fo=\r\nllowing way.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Restoration of all those elementary laws and values with=\r\nout which man loses his ties with nature and God and without which he is in=\r\ncapable of building up a true order. In the place of equality there will be=\r\n inherent standards, in the place of social consciousness a just integratio=\r\nn into the hierarchical society, in the place of mechanical election an org=\r\nanic elite, in the place of bureaucratic leveling the inner responsibility =\r\nof genuine self-government, in the place of mass prosperity the rights of a=\r\n proud people.&quot;[8]\n&gt; \n&gt; For Sanatana Dharma to both survive and thrive in t=\r\nhe coming decades and centuries, a thorough Vedic Restoration along the lin=\r\nes of Jung&#39;s words above must be brought about =96 a reaffirmation of Sanat=\r\nana Dharma&#39;s most ancient and orthodox cultural and spiritual expression in=\r\n direct contradistinction to the values of both Western materialist moderni=\r\nty and shortsighted Indian nationalism (i.e., &quot;Hindu&quot; Nationalism).\n&gt; \n&gt; Mo=\r\nst of the formulators and present-day thinkers of the &quot;Hindu Nationalist&quot; m=\r\novement represent, to one degree or another, a rather sharp historical and =\r\nconceptual disconnect from the traditional Sanatana Dharma that had been ta=\r\nught by the Vedic Acharyas and that had been practiced by the common Hindu =\r\npeople for thousands of years.  After 1000 years of genocidal battering on =\r\nthe part of Islamic invaders, modern Hinduism was definitely not at the hei=\r\nght of its intellectual, cultural, spiritual and political/military glory b=\r\ny the time the British arrived on the scene.  By the time the British had s=\r\naved Vedic culture from extinction, a radically traditional Sanatana Dharma=\r\n, in its unapologetic, pristine, and consciously Vedic-centric form, needed=\r\n desperately to be reconstructed by her intellectuals and spiritual leaders=\r\n. Unfortunately, a serious process of tradition-oriented reconstruction was=\r\n not seriously attempted at that time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of seeing the dire prob=\r\nlems with Hinduism that were present by the 18th and 19th centuries as some=\r\nthing that needed to be addressed and cured from within the confines of San=\r\natana Dharma, the neo-Hindus instead turned to external, non-Vedic, sources=\r\n for their guiding inspiration. As a result, rather than attempting a true =\r\nreconstruction of authentic Sanatana Dharma, which would have made Sanatana=\r\n Dharma strong and pure once again, they instead attempted an unnecessary &quot;=\r\nreform&quot; of Sanatana Dharma along the lines of Christian norms and ideals.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Thus we saw the Christian-inspired, neo-Hindu obsessions with eliminati=\r\nng &quot;caste&quot;, eliminating sati, eliminating murti worship, Christian style mo=\r\nnotheism, &quot;social reform&quot; at the expense of intellectual/spiritual developm=\r\nent, Hegelian historicism, and Radical Universalism. Attendant upon these s=\r\nuperfluous &quot;reforms&quot;, we now witness the sad legacy of a Hindu world confus=\r\ned about what it believes, about what even constitutes a &quot;Hindu&quot;, about its=\r\n future, as well as Hindu children who are not interested in Hinduism, and =\r\na Hindu community of almost one billion people many of whom suffer from inf=\r\neriority complexes and the psychological scars of a people disconnected fro=\r\nm their true spiritual heritage.  What Sanatana Dharma really needed was ne=\r\nver &quot;reform&quot; along these neo-Hindu lines, but rather a positive tradition-b=\r\nased reconstruction of its eternal ideals. &quot;Hinduism&quot; needed to re-embrace =\r\nits true essence as Sanatana Dharma =96 the Eternal Natural Way.\n&gt; \n&gt; What =\r\nSanatana Dharma needed =96 and still needs! =96 were two interdependent dev=\r\nelopments.\n&gt; \n&gt; A) A reclamation of Vedic-based, traditional Sanatana Dharm=\r\na, with a highly orthodox, Vedic-centric understanding of the unitive and i=\r\nntegral Vedic culture that had sustained Sanatana Dharma for 5000 years. It=\r\n needed a purely Vedic understanding of pramana (valid means of knowledge a=\r\nnd derivation of authority), of the nature of Dharma (in the strictest of p=\r\nhilosophical senses, not just the popular sense), of what constitutes Vaidi=\r\nka (Vedic) vs. Avaidika (non-Vedic), etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; B) Once the pure Tradition o=\r\nf Sanatana Dharma was reconstructed, the next organic development needed to=\r\n be a strictly Vedic-based strategy for both juxtaposing, but also actively=\r\n interfacing, traditional Sanatana Dharma with the modern world.\n&gt; \n&gt; The l=\r\natter project of fostering dialogue between Sanatana Dharma and modernity n=\r\needed to be done, not by falsely denying the differences between the two (a=\r\ns almost all of the 19th century proto-Hindutva figures attempted via Radic=\r\nal Universalism), but in the same manner that every other ancient culture h=\r\nad met the challenge of modernity: recognition of most modern religions/ide=\r\nologies as purva-pakshas =96 opposing ideological constructs; friendly and =\r\nopen debate with these purva-pakshas; unapologetic assurance in the excepti=\r\nonal status of Sanatana Dharma, and a concomitant refusal to concede to the=\r\n forced imposition of an inferior status.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, because the u=\r\nnneeded distraction of &quot;Hindu reform&quot; became the more easily accomplished d=\r\nominant paradigm of the hour, to this very day the real project of Vedic re=\r\nconstruction outlined above has barely gotten off the ground.  It is now ti=\r\nme to begin the process.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of the &quot;Hindu reformers&quot; were well-motiv=\r\nated and sincere persons who truly felt that they were acting in the intere=\r\nsts of Sanatana Dharma. Many of Ramakrishna&#39;s words are very inspiring and =\r\nwise. Swami Vivekananda was a truly courageous and talented leader who the =\r\nHindu people can and should take immense pride in. More, many of these pers=\r\nonalities did accomplish some good in providing at least some modicum of a =\r\nvehicle for interfacing Sanatana Dharma and modernity, however self-destruc=\r\ntive this particular vehicle has ending up being in the long-run.  In formu=\r\nlating a Christian-inspired paradigm for Vedic survival with only short-ter=\r\nm successes in mind, however, they did not have the long-term implications =\r\nof their syncretism in mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We Are Different&quot; =96 Reactionary Stage =\r\n(1925-1945)\n&gt; \n&gt; Beginning roughly in the Interwar period (the 1920s and 19=\r\n30s), we then see the formulation of a strictly Reactionary form of Hindu p=\r\nolitics with the emergence of Savarkar, Savitri Devi (the European Pagan wr=\r\niter Maximiani Portas, 1905-1982),[9] the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, etc.=\r\n The uniformed paramilitary formations, martial aesthetic, stress on charac=\r\nter development, egalitarian ethos combined with a rigid hierarchical struc=\r\nture, and much of the generic patriotic rhetoric of the RSS was directly ap=\r\npropriated from the newly immerging, parallel nationalist movements that we=\r\nre sweeping the European continent during the 1920s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unlike their much=\r\n more successful European counterparts, however, this new reactionary Hindu=\r\n movement had very few innovative ideas, did not know how to successfully e=\r\nngage in politics either electorally (not till the 1980s at the earliest) o=\r\nr in terms of mass mobilization (other than borrowing heavily from the para=\r\nmilitary structure earlier developed by their much more successful counterp=\r\narts in the various nationalist organizations of contemporary Europe), were=\r\n wholly disconnected from the traditionalist and orthodox Vedic understandi=\r\nng and practice of the Yoga tradition, had no clear understanding of Dharmi=\r\nc political theory, and most importantly, did not know how to construct an =\r\nelite political vanguard capable of leading the people by their own spiritu=\r\nal example.\n&gt; \n&gt; The RSS and Sangh Pariwar defined itself, both historicall=\r\ny and to this very day, exclusively in negative juxtaposition to what they =\r\nwere not: they were not Muslims; they were not Christians; they were not Ma=\r\nrxists; thus, if only by necessary default, they were &quot;Hindus&quot;.  However, t=\r\no this very day, the RSS has found itself incapable of defining in positive=\r\n identitarian terms what it actually means to be a Hindu in the spiritual s=\r\nense of this term. Savarkar&#39;s blind imitation of then-fashionable European =\r\nracialist theory in the formulation of his interpretation of &quot;Hindutva&quot;, or=\r\n &quot;Hinduness&quot;, as designating a specifically racial group was doomed to fail=\r\nure from the outset. For Savarkar and all those who followed in his footste=\r\nps, being Hindu meant being Indian; being Indian meant being Hindu. Thus, H=\r\ninduism for the Hindu Nationalists was merely another term for the Indian r=\r\nace![10] Being a politician, and not a Vedic philosopher, Savarkar did not =\r\nunderstand that Sanatana Dharma does not equate to the Indian race. Sanatan=\r\na Dharma is a world-view and spiritual tradition. It is the sacred heritage=\r\n, not merely of those people who happen to possess an Indian passport, but =\r\nof the entirety of the Indo-European peoples.\n&gt; \n&gt; To this day, rather than=\r\n facilitating the radical, systemic change necessary to bring about a new D=\r\nharma civilization (which is clearly not at all the aim of these Hindutva m=\r\novements, and never has been), the Reactionary tendency in pro-Hindu politi=\r\ncs has shown itself to be an un-visionary, anti-intellectual, philosophical=\r\nly impotent and currently irrelevant political force. It finds itself dedic=\r\nated more to a rather light version of Indian Nationalist conservatism than=\r\n Vedic nation building.\n&gt; \n&gt; The deepest extent of their political program =\r\nessentially consists of a return to an era more within the comfort zone of =\r\nthe octogenarian men who lead this reactionary movement =96 possibly a retu=\r\nrn to India circa 1855 for Savarkar and Hedgewar, or an India circa 1955 fo=\r\nr an Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Lal Krishna Advani. A Dharma Nation will neve=\r\nr be achieved by the feckless Reactionaries, if only because such a goal is=\r\n not even within the scope of their actual aims or intellectual understandi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadly, the vast bulk of so-called &quot;Hindu activism&quot; that takes plac=\r\ne today still falls under the category of Reactionary, and is more a reflec=\r\ntion of amorphous Indian Nationalism, and general pride of place and ethnic=\r\nity than any serious attempt to reorder society (either Indian, American, o=\r\nr global) in such a manner as to reflect Dharmic principles instantiated in=\r\n concrete political form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of the attempts at polemical and ideolo=\r\ngical writing that we have seen arising from &quot;Hindu Nationalists&quot; make it a=\r\nll too apparent that they are not yet politically mature enough to either v=\r\nie for power or to govern a working nation-state. When, and only when, it c=\r\nomes to the point that self-described &quot;Hindu Nationalists&quot; develop the phil=\r\nosophical maturity to engage in the nuanced ideological struggle necessary =\r\nto win power, and only when they learn how to develop temporary and practic=\r\nal alliances with others while also keeping the greater goal of political p=\r\nower in mind, will they be ready to govern the current nation-state of Indi=\r\na. Only then will &quot;India&quot; become Vedic Bharat once again! Contemporary &quot;Hin=\r\ndu Nationalism&quot; needs to move away from the fantasy-rhetoric level that the=\r\ny have wallowed in for so many decades, and begin the hard work of engaging=\r\n in real politics in the real world.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;We are Vedic!&quot; =96 Transforming =\r\nthe RSS into a Revolutionary Movement\n&gt; \n&gt; Without doubt, the current attem=\r\npt at Vedic restoration is seen as almost being synonymous with the vision,=\r\n leadership, organizational structures and ideological pronouncements of th=\r\ne RSS movement.  With approximately six million dedicated activists, the RS=\r\nS is officially the largest volunteer organization on the Earth today. Unfo=\r\nrtunately, the RSS has served as a sadly flawed and ideologically challenge=\r\nd vehicle for Vedic restoration.  The RSS will need to address the followin=\r\ng problems if it is going to transform itself from a Reactionary movement t=\r\no a Revolutionary one:\n&gt; \n&gt; A) Distinguishing between Indian Nationalism ve=\r\nrsus Vedic Restorationism.  Many difficulties arise when these two separate=\r\n concerns become indistinguishable, as they very clearly have in the minds =\r\nof almost all &quot;Hindu Nationalists&quot;.  Indian Nationalism is an ethnicity/nat=\r\nional/racial movement.  Vedic Restoration, on the other hand, is a religiou=\r\ns/cultural/philosophical one.  The RSS has, in my opinion, been more of an =\r\nIndian Nationalist movement than a Vedic Restorationist movement. More, thi=\r\ns is the primary reason why the BJP so badly lost the Indian national elect=\r\nion of 2004 =96 because they tried to appeal to Muslims, Christians, pseudo=\r\n-secularists, and other non-Hindu Indians merely as patriotic Indians, rath=\r\ner than appealing exclusively to the majority community as follower of Sana=\r\ntana Dharma[11].  The RSS&#39;s main concern has become Indian Nationalism rath=\r\ner than Sanatana Dharma=85and this has only set the movement back.\n&gt; \n&gt; B) =\r\nWithin the current day Vedic Restorationist movement, we must clarify the d=\r\nifference between Hindu Revival (a political/social/cultural phenomenon), w=\r\nhich the RSS is predominantly engaged in, versus Vedic Reconstruction, (an =\r\nintellectual/academic/philosophical/spiritual matrix of projects), which is=\r\n precisely what such individuals as David Frawley, Swami Dayananda Sarasvat=\r\ni, Shrikant Talageri, Subhash Kak and myself, as well as other, more tradit=\r\nionalist, Vedic thinkers are engaged in. Both are projects of seemingly riv=\r\nal significance, and the different natures, goals and methods of these two =\r\nseparate projects need to be understood.\n&gt; \n&gt; C) Within the parallel projec=\r\nts of Hindu Revival and Vedic Reconstruction, we need to distinguish betwee=\r\nn a Neo-Hindu versus a Traditionalist world-view, which has been addressed =\r\nto a much greater extent in the book Radical Universalism: Are All Religion=\r\ns the Same?, by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya.\n&gt; \n&gt; The RSS is currently a =\r\nneo-Hindu, revivalist, Indian Nationalist movement. What it needs to become=\r\n is a Traditionalist Vedic Reconstructionist movement. Like some of the 19t=\r\nh century neo-Hindus of the past, the RSS has done much good for the Indian=\r\n nation-state historically. The RSS has been on the front-lines of defendin=\r\ng Hindu India from foreign aggression, both military and missionary.[12] Th=\r\ne sacrifices of countless individual RSS members are too numerous to mentio=\r\nn.  Today, however, both India and Sanatana Dharma need radically more. The=\r\n RSS needs to change quite radically if it is going to maintain itself as a=\r\nn effective organization in the future.\n&gt; \n&gt; The following is a ten point p=\r\nrogram that Hindu Nationalists should implement if they truly wish to trans=\r\nform their nation of India for the better.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Annihilate the immediate=\r\n existential threat from the Communist terrorists, Islamic Jihadists and Ch=\r\nristian missionaries who have enslaved your country.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Stop graduatin=\r\ng countless engineers, &quot;IT professionals&quot; and medical personnel, and instea=\r\nd begin to once again encourage your children to become philosophers, sadhu=\r\ns (sages), artists, thinkers, warriors and leaders.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Revive the Ksha=\r\ntriya warrior spirit of your ancestors and no longer revel in weakness in t=\r\nhe name of ahimsa.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Re-Aryanize, re-Vedicize and re-spiritualize the=\r\n entirety of your present-day culture.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Eliminate the Dalit problem =\r\nonce and for all by allowing those many individuals who are eligible among =\r\nthis community to enter the varna system in accordance with their inherent =\r\nindividual psycho-physical nature. If a Dalit behaves like a brahmana, then=\r\n he is a brahmana. Period!\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) Learn to interact with modernity in a su=\r\nccessful manner. That means, without excuses, rededicating yourselves to ex=\r\ncellence and perfection in everything you do and communicate.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) Build=\r\n your own economy instead of depending upon the West for economic success v=\r\nia immigration and outsourcing of jobs. To do this, you will need to comple=\r\ntely exorcise your economy of even the slightest taint of socialism and col=\r\nlectivism. Once and for all =96 Socialism simply does not work!\n&gt; \n&gt; 8) Sta=\r\nrt to carry yourselves with courage and pride in your Vedic heritage, rathe=\r\nr than viewing this heritage as an embarrassing burden from the past. If yo=\r\nu do not reclaim your immense Vedic heritage, someone else will reclaim it =\r\nfrom you.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9) Make spoken Sanskrit the sole recognized language of your=\r\n nation.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10) To successfully achieve all of the above, stop reaching f=\r\nor any and all excuses for why you have not yet been able to achieve these =\r\ngoals. Victory belongs only to those who reject excuses. Then, and only the=\r\nn, will Bharat regain the respect of the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dharma Nationalism: A =\r\nNew Revolutionary Approach\n&gt; \n&gt; The new stage that Hindu activism needs to =\r\ntake is undoubtedly the Revolutionary approach. It is clear that Indian Hin=\r\ndus now need to enter the Post-RSS phase of Hindu activism. As a starting p=\r\noint, 21st century Hindu activism needs to make a sharp break from its more=\r\n paranoid and pessimistic past, and begin to start thinking in much more re=\r\nalistic, concrete, strategic and winning terms.\n&gt; \n&gt; The enemies of Dharma =\r\nhave had the gift of being able to think and strategize on a long-term basi=\r\ns. Their end goal has always been the end of Dharmic civilization and the c=\r\nreation of their own dystopic vision of reality ranging centuries into the =\r\nfuture! Contemporary Hindu activism, on the other hand, has only seemed abl=\r\ne to operate reactively, only thinking about some immediate injustices that=\r\n have just occurred in the news today =96 and even then only rarely reactin=\r\ng effectively, if at all. The contemporary Indian Hindu activist movement n=\r\needs to stop looking for excuses, and beat the enemy at their own game.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; A truly Revolutionary Dharma activist movement has not existed on the wor=\r\nld scene until 2012.  The seeds of its birth have now come to fruition in t=\r\nhe form of the Dharma Nationalist movement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Indeed, the Indian nationa=\r\nlist fueled &quot;Hindu&quot; activism of the past will now quickly take a back seat =\r\nto the spiritually fueled Dharma Nationalist activism of the future. Unlike=\r\n parochial &quot;Hindu Nationalism&quot;, Dharma Nationalist activism is, indeed, com=\r\nprehensively total in its application. It is based primarily upon spiritual=\r\n/philosophical concern, and only secondarily on ethnic/national concern. It=\r\n is motivated by the spiritual insight and compassion gifted to us by the e=\r\nternal Truth of Sanatana Dharma, and not merely on an empty pride residing =\r\nin the relative and temporal, ever-changing geographical boundaries of the =\r\nnation-state of India. It fosters a true selfless action akin with that of =\r\nthe rishis, and not merely a series of political calculations based upon th=\r\ne personal need for power and aggrandizement.\n&gt; \n&gt; More crucial than any ot=\r\nher juxtaposing comparison to the failed Hindu activist endeavors of the pa=\r\nst: Dharma Nationalism presents a clear, realistic, and achievable strategi=\r\nc diagram revealing exactly how society should be best structured in order =\r\nto ensure the maximal amount of happiness and prosperity, to the fullest de=\r\ngree of qualitative and spiritual depth, for the greatest number of living =\r\nbeings. This fact will be abundantly evident upon an attentive reading of T=\r\nhe Dharma Manifesto.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Notes\n&gt; \n&gt; [1] Tentatively translated as &quot;Hind=\r\nuness&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; [2] Born as Margaret Elizabeth Noble, an Irish social worker w=\r\nho abandoned Christianity and became a follower of Sanatana Dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; [3=\r\n] The second leader of the Theosophical Society after Helena Petrovna Blava=\r\ntsky (1831-1891).\n&gt; \n&gt; [4] &quot;Indian People&#39;s Party&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; [5] Reactionaries =\r\ndo not look to ancient or Classical antecedents for guidance for the presen=\r\nt, but tend to only look back a few generations at most.\n&gt; \n&gt; [6] See Guill=\r\naume Faye&#39;s Archeofuturism: European Visions of the Post-Catastrophic Age f=\r\nor more on this innovative concept.\n&gt; \n&gt; [7] My term for the deceivingly co=\r\nmforting psychological phenomenon exhibited by any given generation that co=\r\nnvinces them that the particular era in which they find themselves represen=\r\nts the most important and advanced era in history.
