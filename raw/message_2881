The minds wants variety. It gets dis=\r\ngusted with any monotonous practice. The mental repetition is very powerful=\r\n. It is termed Manasika Japa. The verbal or loud repetition is called Vaikh=\r\nari Japa. The loud Japa shuts out all worldly sounds. There is no break of =\r\nJapa here. Repetition in a whisper or humming is termed Upamshu Japa. Even =\r\nmechanical repetition of Japa without any Bhava has a great purifying effec=\r\nt on the heart or the mind. The feeling will come later on when the process=\r\n of mental purification goes on.\n\nWrite down daily in a notebook your Ishta=\r\n Mantra or Guru Mantra for half an hour. When you write the Mantra, observe=\r\n Mouna. Write the Mantra clearly in ink. On Sundays and holidays, write thi=\r\ns for one hour. This is Likhita Japa You can develop a wonderful power of c=\r\noncentration.\n\nThe benefits of Mantra-writing or Likhita Japa cannot be ade=\r\nquately described. Besides bringing about purity of heart and concentration=\r\n of mind, mantra-writing gives you control of Asana, control of Indriyas, p=\r\narticularly the sight and the tongue, and fills you with the power of endur=\r\nance. You attain peace of mind quickly. By prolonged and constant practice =\r\nthe inherent power of the Mantra (Mantra-Sakti) will be awakened, which wil=\r\nl fill your very existence with the Divinity of the Mantra.\n\nIn Mantra writ=\r\ning, there is no restriction about any particular script. It may be written=\r\n in any language.\n\n\n"}}
