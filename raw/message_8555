Thanks for explaining.\n\nAs Nar=\r\nasimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irrevocably linked. The\n&#39;status&#39; of=\r\n the world is right in the middle of the two. We are all looking\nat this fr=\r\nom different points of view, based on our own conditioning.\n\nI can&#39;t pull m=\r\nyself out of the dream analogy. All of us dream. We are\ncreators of the dre=\r\nam world, and it is our consciousness alone that forms\nthe material for the=\r\n dream world. Once created, a portion of ourselves gets\nprojected into the =\r\ndream world, and we become subject to our own maya. We\ninteract with so man=\r\ny other created beings, and interact based on the rules\nof this dream world=\r\n. Inside the dream world, for the duration of it&#39;s\nexistence, everything ap=\r\npears true.\n\nThe world that is created is based on the thoughts that went t=\r\nhrough our\nmind at the moment we fell into deep sleep. At some point, once =\r\nwe have\nexperienced enough, we naturally wake up. We spend some time in the=\r\n &quot;real\nworld&quot;, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nOur experiences inside our crea=\r\nted dream world have an impact on us when we\nwake up. From time to time, we=\r\n remember our dreams and reflect on them. The\nexperiences certainly carry o=\r\nn into our waking state to some extent, and\nthen back into the next dream e=\r\nxperience.\n\nBy looking at every question from three points of time, we get =\r\nthree\ndifferent answers. The dream world is real for it&#39;s duration, unreal\n=\r\nbetween cycles and is conditionally real when looking across cycles.\nFreedo=\r\nm is interacting with the world with no attachment from inside the\nworld; r=\r\nealizing the absolute unreality of the world from outside; and is\nboth of t=\r\nhese when looking across cycles.\n\nFrom all points of view, the thinning of =\r\nthe accumulated conditioning\n(vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.\n\nsasneham,\n\n   aj=\r\nit\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 30, 2012 at 12:04 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo.=\r\nco.in&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Ajit,\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;Even if the play goes on, different act=\r\nors may play the part.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Interesting.

Or=\r\n perhaps something different\n&gt; altogether?&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I believe that &quot;Maya&quot; means=\r\n a sort of limited perception due lack of\n&gt; complete information.

Are higher/different states of\n&gt; awareness real? Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Everyt=\r\nhing, from the physical world to non-physical realms exist and is an\n&gt; exte=\r\nnsion of the Supreme. Maya is nothing more than whatever obstructs an\n&gt; ind=\r\nividual&#39;s mind from realizing that inherent unity. From an individual\n&gt; (hu=\r\nman entity) perspective, the point of maximum stillness is the Purusha,\n&gt; w=\r\nhat is called atmah/soul, and everything else, from points of lesser\n&gt; stil=\r\nlness to the external objective reality is Shakti. Extending this\n&gt; princip=\r\nle to the Universe, the purely transcendental non-changing,\n&gt; non-negotiabl=\r\ne reality can be called the &quot;atmah&quot; while everything else,\n&gt; semi-transcend=\r\nental to the objective reality all around is Shakti. Thus in\n&gt; short, using=\r\n scriptural terms, Nirguna Brahman is the state of mind of God,\n&gt; while the=\r\n Universe(s)/various realm(s) is the body of God. Both are\n&gt; irrevocable li=\r\nnked for all practical purposes.

I am doi=\r\nng fine and I hope you are doing fine\n&gt; too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Disagreements and differen=\r\nce of view-points are absolutely fine, afterall\n&gt; in ancient India from the=\r\n monotheists to the atheists, we had every breed\n&gt; coexisting. Having said =\r\nthat, I will explain a few of the points you have\n&gt; raised in your email, f=\r\nrom my perspective of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt; You have to complete the story.&gt;.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I cannot add anything more to it is because the individual=\r\n\n&gt; himself did not reveal anything more about this.  For me, the incidents =\r\nhe\n&gt; revealed hold an interesting view-point and a value on its own . When =\r\nI\n&gt; mention any such story I only narrate the same exactly as it is, withou=\r\nt\n&gt; adding  or subtracting anything from it. Conclusions, whatever they may=\r\nbe,\n&gt; have to be drawn by every individual. Some may reject it, some may ac=\r\ncept\n&gt; it, both of which are fine.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt; This story seems to like I used=\r\n  to read in Chandamama. This guy\n&gt; Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the  st=\r\nory so far is true.and he has the\n&gt; ability to shape shift and transportati=\r\non. So what?? But he still needs his\n&gt; daily fix of bhang.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As per the=\r\n Tantric scriptures, even Lord Shiva in his form of Bhairava\n&gt; smokes ganja=\r\n, drinks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around\n&gt; naked in the=\r\n smashana. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to\n&gt; judge anyone=\r\n&#39;s spirituality? Not for me!\n&gt;\n&gt; ,\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;what does God mean in this tale? &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means infinity. No=\r\nw what\n&gt; is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot=\r\n be\n&gt; understood using the five sense organs. Science does not understand\n&gt;=\r\n infinity, art does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody  understands=\r\n\n&gt; infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can  imagin=\r\ne\n&gt; and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible=\r\n\n&gt; force that runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most\n&gt;=\r\n despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest sain=\r\nt\n&gt; to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in th=\r\ne\n&gt; farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now question is, can an average human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious =\r\nand all\n&gt; pervading force? Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then =\r\nhow does\n&gt; one interact with such a thing? One way is to consider everythin=\r\ng, and I\n&gt; mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a manifestation of=\r\n that force\n&gt; and thus learn to love the same unconditionally without expec=\r\nting anything\n&gt; in return. No wonder such unconditional love is not easy. I=\r\nt needs\n&gt; tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of the mind, and=\r\n work on\n&gt; our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the  aim of sad=\r\nhana is, in\n&gt; my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able to\n=\r\n&gt; unconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities one can\n&gt;=\r\n love unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to\n&gt; intera=\r\ncting with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who\n&gt; can lo=\r\nve a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this\n&gt; sup=\r\nreme and unknowable force. In common language, we call them Rishis.\n&gt;\n&gt; I l=\r\nike all forms of Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of\n&gt; t=\r\nhem. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly\n&gt; transcen=\r\ndental that it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface\n&gt; area of=\r\n the fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or\n&gt; the mil=\r\nlionth part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the\n&gt; bottom=\r\nless well of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditation.\n&gt; The o=\r\nnly thing that stops me from getting a better understanding the\n&gt; grandeur =\r\nof  this formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and\n&gt; body, tha=\r\nt I have acquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To\n&gt; slowly=\r\n gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this\n&gt; endless, =\r\nnameless entity. G_d.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No =\r\nrebirth? If the Universe\n&gt; itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama=\r\n and Krshna come back at\n&gt; every cycle, who am I to demand that I should no=\r\nt get born? Infact, when a\n&gt; person proverbially finishes off his/her karma=\r\ns, they merely go to another\n&gt; plane in this Universe and stay there for eo=\r\nns of time, since time anyway\n&gt; moves very, very slowly in different realms=\r\n. But then, if this force so\n&gt; wants, it can send back any of the souls fro=\r\nm any of the realms to any of\n&gt; the other realms to serve a certain functio=\r\nn. And if a soul stays in a\n&gt; certain higher realm and in forced to take re=\r\nbirth again, the seeds of the\n&gt; karmas - which never really die off - are  =\r\nwatered again by the environment\n&gt; of birth and they sprout into saplings. =\r\nAnd this may go even beyond one\n&gt; cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna =\r\nand Arjuna fight the very same\n&gt; enemies that they had been fighting in the=\r\n past cycle of creation?\n&gt; Mahabharata says so. I believe it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What =\r\nthen is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don&#39;t know.\n&gt; Maybe,=\r\n to teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequentially lessen\n&gt; our a=\r\nttachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems.\n&gt; This =\r\nis like a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local melas. Tighten\n&gt; the=\r\n seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detached and enjoy the show!\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Best of luck and take good care of yourself!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | *\n&gt; *param bhAwam=\r\najAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _____________________________=\r\n______**\n&gt;\n&gt; *From: *Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; *To: *&quot;ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;  &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent: *Satur=\r\nday, 28 July 2012 7:30 PM\n&gt; *Subject: *Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say =\r\nthat they don=92t believe in\n&gt; any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;   Dear Rajarshi Bhai,\n&gt; How=\r\n are you?

Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The other thing is can I dare to =\r\nsay that I do not agree what is in this\n&gt; thread. Why does this so called s=\r\npiritual man has to dump his failure on\n&gt; religion. If people do not believ=\r\ne in religion or God or afterlife, it is\n&gt; their problem. We are not all eq=\r\nual. We all do not come from same stock. We\n&gt; are born with different condi=\r\ntions, go through different life experiences\n&gt; and go where our fate or des=\r\ntiny takes us. This world is composed of 3\n&gt; gunas and there is always goin=\r\ng to tension of different sort. Why  blame it\n&gt; on religion or God, why not=\r\n on greed and desire to control others and lord\n&gt; over them using what ever=\r\n mean.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This story seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This gu=\r\ny Iyengar\n&gt; seems to be a siddha if the story so far is true.and he has the=\r\n ability to\n&gt; shape shift and transportation. So what?? But he still needs =\r\nhis daily fix\n&gt; of bhang.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; what does God mean in this tale? Is it Crea=\r\ntor God or Divine Lord Of Sri\n&gt; Vrindavan or   Divine  Mother or  Self Real=\r\nisation or Universal God or\n&gt; Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? Afte=\r\nr all there was a dhoni fire\n&gt; there? Or some other God ??\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Vrinda=\r\nvan has a rolling population. They are not in confusion. Many\n&gt; people come=\r\n there only for curiosity, many other come only for Darshan in\n&gt; the Temple=\r\n and go back home happy. many others come with different desires.\n&gt; It is v=\r\nery wrong to expect from a person who is in fifth grade to have\n&gt; knowledge=\r\n of 15th grade.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Many times people go to temple to pray and ask for ce=\r\nrtain things and if\n&gt; it does not happen they become very anti religion and=\r\n anti God. So what??\n&gt; It has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else.=\r\n It is their life.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I was very very very ill. Nobody was helping me. M=\r\nany people were giving\n&gt; me lot of pain.   I went  from Religious place to =\r\nreligious place, temple\n&gt; to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to =\r\nworked. Then I took up\n&gt; religious practise of doing mantra japa and other =\r\nthings which are in\n&gt; scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It i=\r\ns totally religious\n&gt; discipline according to our scriptures.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you =\r\ndrive a car? Did you pass you exam first time? I do not drive a\n&gt; car. It w=\r\nill take me several exams to pass it. Many people pass their test\n&gt; first t=\r\nime and drive successfully. Does it mean I should blame car or exams\n&gt; or e=\r\nxaminer or road for my failure??? .Many people take up spiritual life\n&gt; and=\r\n if they do not find success quickly they blame religion and God.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I a=\r\nlso used to think that a real experience of God would be very powerful\n&gt; th=\r\ning. but there are other aspects to it. If  someone is totally  dependent\n&gt;=\r\n on Divine Mother and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready\n&gt;=\r\n for certain energy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light,=\r\n\n&gt; then Divine Mother would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him=\r\n\n&gt; and to console so that he remains on the path. She will appear right in\n=\r\n&gt; front of him but he only sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of i=\r\nt\n&gt; because he is not yet ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am fille=\r\nd\n&gt; with deep bliss and joy and wonderment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You are a special person =\r\ndoing everyday intense haven to spread the\n&gt; light.Many other people in thi=\r\ns group are doing haven everyday to fill\n&gt; their life with light of Divine =\r\nBeings. This is a complete religious method\n&gt; which is also totally spiritu=\r\nal thing.Please do not get impressed with\n&gt; pseudo spiritual talk and tales=\r\n of shape shifting. Is everything alright in\n&gt; your everyday life because I=\r\n felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am\n&gt; very wrong in  this.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; F=\r\new days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I did not go out\n&gt; t=\r\no see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes out of Divine Mothers\n&gt; F=\r\neet hoping it will become permanent in my life.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Good Luck and  Joy fo=\r\nr you.\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; *Fr=\r\nom: *rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; *To: *&quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent: *Monday, 23 July 2012, 11:=\r\n04\n&gt; *Subject: *Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who  say that they don=92t beli=\r\neve\n&gt; in any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Ajit,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I am in complete agreement w=\r\nith your thoughts.  A spiritual man once said,\n&gt; &quot;Religion has been created=\r\n to shield people from God&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; When I first heard this I was not convin=\r\nced and thought it was some fake\n&gt; secularism. Lately I realized this is li=\r\nterally true. Heavy psychological\n&gt; constructs are created by religions to =\r\nprotect an average person from the\n&gt; real experience of God, which is so po=\r\nwerful and overwhelming that if and\n&gt; when it happens, it can effectively c=\r\nause a hurricane in your average life\n&gt; and pretty much destroy all your we=\r\nll laid plans.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incide=\r\nnt.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to  stay there fo=\r\nr some\n&gt; years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the=\r\n\n&gt; discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, com=\r\nes\n&gt; over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, st=\r\nopped\n&gt; and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man=\r\n. Then\n&gt; he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some=\r\n words of\n&gt; God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste =\r\ntime talking\n&gt; of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run =\r\naway. So please\n&gt; continue with your lectures as you were doing before I ca=\r\nme in&quot;. Everyone\n&gt; became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the =\r\nsweets came, the\n&gt; man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky an=\r\nd then got up and\n&gt; started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who w=\r\nas lecturing, looked\n&gt; at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes =\r\nto Vrindavan once in a\n&gt; while, but he has probably lost his mental balance=\r\n due to smoking too much\n&gt; ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some w=\r\neird reason felt attracted\n&gt; to that ragged man and went out to see where t=\r\nhe guy was going. As he\n&gt; approached the ragged looking man, the man turned=\r\n around and spoke to X in\n&gt; clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to=\r\n come and join me.&quot; X was of\n&gt; course taken aback, did not expect the man t=\r\no speak in English and more\n&gt; over he had no clue how the man got to know t=\r\nhat he knew English (X was\n&gt; dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron cloth=\r\nes).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Che=\r\nnnai, was an\n&gt; Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have bee=\r\nn a wondering\n&gt; sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadh=\r\nu who was doing\n&gt; the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actu=\r\nally this God\n&gt; thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue.=\r\n Not the hordes\n&gt; of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is =\r\nthe reason for\n&gt; all  the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a =\r\nlittle irritated,\n&gt; &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/=\r\nsadhus etc? If you\n&gt; have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t =\r\nmet a single genuine\n&gt; sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied,=\r\n &quot;Well if I take\n&gt; Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, res=\r\nt are all as\n&gt; confused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confus=\r\nion. But you\n&gt; cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iy=\r\nengar\n&gt; continued, &quot;The root of all this problem is this God business. Know=\r\n it for\n&gt; certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyon=\r\nd the\n&gt; capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man will only =\r\nimagine\n&gt; a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the in=\r\ndividual\n&gt; keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a proje=\r\nction of\n&gt; his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities fro=\r\nm this\n&gt; form, and generally be regarded  by others as a man of god. But Go=\r\nd is\n&gt; beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying to\n=\r\n&gt; understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one ha=\r\ns\n&gt; understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small\n&gt; te=\r\na-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum.\n&gt; =\r\nThen held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the\n=\r\n&gt; smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man.=\r\n\n&gt; Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get confused by all these show of\n=\r\n&gt; spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of\n=\r\n&gt; terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young\n=\r\n&gt; man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having\n&gt;=\r\n nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly\n&gt;=\r\n realized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he\n&gt; =\r\nspoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a  young girl\n&gt; =\r\ncame out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said\n&gt;=\r\n to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to\n&gt; =\r\nVrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if\n&gt;=\r\n you join me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bo=\r\nred and irritated.\n&gt; The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for=\r\n their food while the\n&gt; young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he la=\r\ny down on a cot,\n&gt; enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more=\r\n fraud, he abuses\n&gt; everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accep=\r\nting the hospitality\n&gt; of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon a=\r\ns this thought crossed\n&gt; his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and th=\r\ne girl  stood up and with\n&gt; folded hands were bowing down towards the cot w=\r\nhere Mr Iyengar was lying\n&gt; down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the op=\r\np direction to the cot. He\n&gt; too turned round to see  what was going on. Wh=\r\nat he saw made his jaw drop\n&gt; open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragg=\r\ned beggar that was Mr Iyengar,\n&gt; there sat on the cot a young man, who look=\r\ned in his early twenties, whose\n&gt; whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating=\r\n a brilliant glow that lightened\n&gt; up the whole room. He had a shaved head,=\r\n four arms, holding lotus and\n&gt; weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! =\r\nIt looked not a human being any\n&gt; more but a god sitting in place of what w=\r\nas even five minutes back only a\n&gt; frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n X did not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards\n&gt;=\r\n him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and=\r\n\n&gt; walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all\n&gt; cons=\r\nciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote\n&gt; loca=\r\ntion with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held\n&gt; hi=\r\ns hand and took him inside the temple precincts.  There he saw a dhuni\n&gt; bu=\r\nrning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash\n&gt; a=\r\nll over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that\n&gt; meditat=\r\ning man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I\n&gt; was t=\r\nalking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only\n&gt; one i=\r\nn Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After\n&gt; provid=\r\ning directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar\n&gt; hugged X =\r\nagain and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of\n&gt; place/time and l=\r\napsed into unconsciousness again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; When X woke up, he was in the roo=\r\nm in that house, lying on the floor. Mr\n&gt; Iyengar was on the bed, his old, =\r\nragged self, with a mischievous smile on\n&gt; his face. Next day, X went to th=\r\ne temple as directed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *awaktam wyaktim=\r\nApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | *\n&gt; *param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanutta=\r\nmam ||[7:24] *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________**\n&gt;\n&gt; *From: *Ajit=\r\n Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; *To: *vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; =\r\n*Sent: *Monday, 23 July 2012  8:13 AM\n&gt; *Subject: *Re: [vedic-wisdom] To th=\r\nose who say that they don=92t believe in\n&gt; any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;   Dear Prasanth=\r\n,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To those who say that they don=92t believe in any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are bein=\r\ng\n&gt; more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in Go=\r\nd\n&gt; look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and\n&gt; =\r\nassumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion\n&gt;=\r\n has simply served to formalize these biases.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; While being mired in th=\r\nis word of duality, we think that an ounce of\n&gt; insincere prayer can undo t=\r\nhe whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in\n&gt; throughout the day. And we l=\r\nay this bias on our God. No wonder that others\n&gt; look at all the suffering =\r\nin the world and laugh at this concept of God. We\n&gt; &quot;God believers&quot; are the=\r\n culprit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipelin=\r\ne. Instead of\n&gt; asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both =\r\nkinds of fruits,\n&gt; we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact.=\r\n It is us &quot;God\n&gt; believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa =\r\nphala&quot;. We look\n&gt; at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our =\r\nprayers to be\n&gt; successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what=\r\n it is, and\n&gt; laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For t=\r\nhe most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual\n&gt; practi=\r\nces, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and\n&gt; minute=\r\ns. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time\n&gt; reall=\r\ny flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti\n&gt; and i=\r\ngnore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for\n&gt; what i=\r\nt is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The best =\r\nway to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the\n&gt; &quot;non-believe=\r\nrs&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to\n&gt; eliminate our la=\r\nck of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can\n&gt; transform ourselves=\r\n, the world will be served.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If we see God as the limitless power that=\r\n he is, he is difficult to\n&gt; define. It is difficult to capture him within =\r\na religion. Religion should\n&gt; see itself as a stepping-stone, and should as=\r\nk each of us to _eventually_\n&gt; place our feet on top of it to reach the hig=\r\nher goals. Unfortunately, most\n&gt; religions ask us to accept them without qu=\r\nestion. They ask us to place our\n&gt; heads on them with reverence, and try to=\r\n prevent the spiritually advanced\n&gt; from going any farther.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; sasneham,=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;    ajit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms=\r\n/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e6d563748a11cb04c648817a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Rajarshi,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had to re-read this a few times, but I =\r\nthink I&#39;m finally understanding what you are trying to convey.

The &#39;status&#39; of the world is righ=\r\nt in the middle of the two.

All of us dream. We are creator=\r\ns of the dream world, and it is our consciousness alone that forms the mate=\r\nrial for the dream world. Once created, a portion of ourselves gets project=\r\ned into the dream world, and we become subject to our own maya. We interact=\r\n with so many other created beings, and interact based on the rules of this=\r\n dream world. Inside the dream world, for the duration of it&#39;s existenc=\r\ne, everything appears true.=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The world that is=\r\n created is based on the thoughts that went through our mind at the moment =\r\nwe fell into deep sleep. At some point, once we have experienced enough, we=\r\n naturally wake up. We spend some time in the &quot;real world&quot;, and t=\r\nhen the cycle repeats.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our experiences inside ou=\r\nr created dream world have an impact on us when we wake up. From time to ti=\r\nme, we remember our dreams and reflect on them. The experiences certainly c=\r\narry on into our waking state to some extent, and then back into the next d=\r\nream experience.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By looking at every question fr=\r\nom three points of time, we get three different answers.=A0The dream world =\r\nis real for it&#39;s duration, unreal between cycles and is conditionally r=\r\neal when looking across cycles. Freedom is interacting with the world with =\r\nno attachment from inside the world; realizing the absolute unreality of th=\r\ne world from outside; and is both of these when looking across cycles.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From all points of view, the thinning of the accumul=\r\nated conditioning (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sas=\r\nneham,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0 =A0ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul 30, 2012 at 12:=\r\n04 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@ya=\r\nhoo.co.in&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:=\r\n1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;font-size:10pt;font-family:verdana,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;Dear Ajit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;Even=\r\n if the play goes on, \ndifferent actors may play the part.&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting. This did not cross my mind. Variety is the =\r\nspice of life!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I\n am curious -- d=\r\no you believe that the universe is maya (the way it it \ncommonly portrayed =\r\nby advaitins), or do you believe that it is &quot;real&quot; \n(the way it i=\r\ns commonly portrayed by dvaitins)? Or perhaps something \ndifferent altogeth=\r\ner?&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I believe that &quot;Maya&quot; means a sort of limite=\r\nd perception due lack of complete information. It exists not just in the ph=\r\nysical universe, but even in other non-physical states, though the degree m=\r\naybe different. Is the average waking consciousness real? Yes. Are higher/d=\r\nifferent states of awareness real? Yes. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Everything, from the phys=\r\nical world to non-physical realms exist and is an extension of the Supreme.=\r\n Maya is nothing more than whatever obstructs an individual&#39;s mind from=\r\n realizing that inherent unity. From an individual (human entity) perspecti=\r\nve, the point of maximum stillness is the Purusha, what is called atmah/sou=\r\nl, and everything else, from points of lesser stillness to the external obj=\r\nective reality is Shakti. Extending this principle to the Universe, the pur=\r\nely transcendental non-changing, non-negotiable reality can be called the &=\r\nquot;atmah&quot; while everything else, semi-transcendental to the objectiv=\r\ne\n reality all around is Shakti. Thus in short, using scriptural terms, Nir=\r\nguna Brahman is the state of mind of God, while the Universe(s)/various rea=\r\nlm(s) is the body of God. Both are irrevocable linked for all practical pur=\r\nposes.=A0 Maya is whatever inhibits an individual cell (a human being or an=\r\nimal or plant or anything) in the body of the God - that is Universe(s) - f=\r\nrom realizing the greater picture. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Am I making sense? -:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n-Regards&lt;br&gt;=A0Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div =\r\nclass=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,tim=\r\nes,serif&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;=\r\n#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyaya=\r\nmanuttamam\n ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana,helvetica,sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size:10pt&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,ser=\r\nif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\nAjit Krishnan &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:ajit.krishnan@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot;&gt;ajit.krishnan@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 30 July 2012 5:50 PM&lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Moksha&lt;br=\r\n&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana,helvetica,sans-serif;font-s=\r\nize:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small&quot;&gt;&gt; Whenever a ring falls here,=\r\n=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana,helvetica,sans-serif;font=\r\n-size:13px&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small&quot;&gt;&gt; a Hanumana follows it =\r\nand we know=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana,helvetica,sans=\r\n-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&gt; it is time for a=\r\n Rama to leave his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even if the play goes on, different actors may play the part.

In this story=\r\n, God means infinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it cann=\r\not be named, it cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science d=\r\noes not understand infinity, art\n does not understand infinity, nothing or =\r\nnobody=A0 understands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all =\r\nthat we can=A0 imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is =\r\nan incomprehensible force that runs through everything, from the most lovea=\r\nble to the most despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from th=\r\ne greatest saint to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepes=\r\nt ocean in the farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest=\r\n universe. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Now question is, can an average h=\r\numan being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowin=\r\ng implies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with such a=\r\n thing? One way is to consider\n everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from livi=\r\nng to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to love t=\r\nhe same unconditionally without expecting anything in return. No wonder suc=\r\nh unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our =\r\nown conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudice=\r\ns. That is what the=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, t=\r\no make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater=\r\n number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit clos=\r\ner one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few rare =\r\nhuman beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly th=\r\ne closest to this supreme and unknowable force. In common language, we call=\r\n them Rishis. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;V=\r\nerdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;I like all forms of\n Deities, for I find something beautifu=\r\nl in everyone of them. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so pe=\r\nrfectly transcendental that it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like t=\r\nhe surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two bre=\r\naths, or the millionth part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space,=\r\n or the bottomless well of stillness in the mind at certain points in medit=\r\nation. The only thing that stops me from getting a better understanding the=\r\n grandeur of=A0 this formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and=\r\n body, that I have acquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. T=\r\no slowly gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this end=\r\nless, nameless entity. G_d. &lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; =\r\ncolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;I do not\n believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirt=\r\nh? If the Universe itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krs=\r\nhna come back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born=\r\n? Infact, when a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they mere=\r\nly go to another plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, si=\r\nnce time anyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if t=\r\nhis force so wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realm=\r\ns to any of the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul sta=\r\nys in a certain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds=\r\n of the karmas - which never really die off - are=A0 watered again by the e=\r\nnvironment of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even bey=\r\nond one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very =\r\nsame enemies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mah=\r\nabharata says so. I\n believe it. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;What then is =\r\nthe final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don&#39;t know. Maybe, to te=\r\nach us to broaden our perspectives and consequentially lessen our attachmen=\r\nts to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems. This is like a =\r\ncircular roller-coaster ride we see in local melas.
