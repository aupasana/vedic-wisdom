They are based on the sense of\ndual=\r\nity. The Self is as It is. There is neither dvaita nor advaita, I AM\nTHAT I=\r\n AM. Simple Be-ing is the Self.(Talks, 433).\n\nOne=E2=80=99s efforts are dir=\r\nected only to remove one=E2=80=99s ignorance.Afterwards they\ncease and the =\r\nreal Self is found to be always there. No effort is needed to\nremain as the=\r\n Self. (Talks, 66).\n\nThe Truth is that the Self is constant and unintermitt=\r\nent Awareness. The\nobject of enquiry is to find the true nature of the Self=\r\n as Awareness. Let\none practise enquiry so long as separateness is perceive=\r\nd. Once realisation\narises there is no further need for enquiry. The questi=\r\non will also not\narise. Can awareness ever think of questioning who is awar=\r\ne? Awareness\nremains pure and simple. (Talks, 454).\n\nThe Self is known to e=\r\nveryone but not clearly. You always exist. The Be-ing\nis the Self. =E2=80=\r\n=98I am=E2=80=99 is the name of God. Of all the definitions of God, none\nis=\r\n indeed so well put as the Biblical statement =E2=80=98I am that I am=E2=80=\r\n=99 in Exodus\n3, Verse 14. None is so\ndirect as the name JEHOVAH... I AM. T=\r\nhe Absolute Be-ing is what is... It is\nthe Self. It is God. Knowing the Sel=\r\nf, God is known. In fact God is none\nother than the Self. (Talks, 106).\n\nTh=\r\nere is a state beyond our efforts or effortlessness. Until it is realised\ne=\r\nffort is necessary. After tasting such Bliss, even once, one will\nrepeatedl=\r\ny try to regain it. It is as difficult for a jnani to engage in\nthoughts as=\r\n it is for an ajnani to be free from thoughts. (Talks, 141).\n\nReality is si=\r\nmply the loss of the ego. Destroy the ego by seeking its\nidentity. Because =\r\nego is no entity it will automatically vanish and Reality\nwill shine forth =\r\nby itself. This is the direct method whereas all other\nmethods are done onl=\r\ny retaining the ego. In those paths there arise so many\ndoubts and the eter=\r\nnal question remains to be tackled finally. But in this\nmethod the final qu=\r\nestion is the only one and it is raised from the very\nbeginning. No sadhana=\r\ns are necessary for engaging in this quest. (Talks,\n146).\n\nEffortlessness w=\r\nhile remaining aware is the state of Bliss,and that is\nRealisation. (Talks,=\r\n 295).\n\nIn a sense, speaking of Self-realisation is a delusion. It is only =\r\nbecause\npeople have been under the delusion that the non-Self is the Self a=\r\nnd the\nunreal the Real that they have to be weaned out of it by the other d=\r\nelusion\ncalled Self-realisation,\nbecause actually the Self always is the Se=\r\nlf and there is no such thing as\nrealizing it. Who is to realize what, and =\r\nhow, when all that exists is the\nSelf and nothing but the Self? (Day by Day=\r\n).\n\nFree-will and destiny are ever-existent. Destiny is the result of past\n=\r\naction; it concerns the body. Let the body act as may suit it. Why are you\n=\r\nconcerned with it? Why do you pay attention to it? Free-will and destiny\nla=\r\nst as long as the body lasts. But Wisdom (jnana) transcends both. The Self\n=\r\nis beyond knowledge and ignorance. Should anything happen it happens as the=\r\n\nresultant of one=E2=80=99s past actions, of divine will and other factors.=\r\n (Talks,\n193).\n\nFree-will holds the field in association with individuality=\r\n.As long as\nindividuality lasts so long there is Free-will. All the scriptu=\r\nres are based\non this fact and they advise directing the Free-will in the r=\r\night channel.\nFind out to whom Free-will or\ndestiny matters. Abide in it. T=\r\nhen these two are transcended.That is the\nonly purpose of discussing these =\r\nquestions. To who do they arise? Find out\nand be at peace. (Talks, 426).\n\nY=\r\noga implies prior division and it means later union of one with the other.\n=\r\nWho is to be united with whom? You are the seeker, seeking union with\nsomet=\r\nhing. That something is apart from you. You are aware of the Self. Seek\nit =\r\nand be it.That will expand as the Infinite. Then there will be no\nquestion =\r\nof yoga, etc. Whose is the separation (viyoga)? Find it. (Talks,\n211).\n\nHe =\r\nwho instructs an ardent seeker to do this or that is not a true Master.\nThe=\r\n seeker is already afflicted by his activities and wants Peace and Rest.\nIn=\r\n other words he wants cessation of his activities. Instead of that he is\nto=\r\nld do so something in addition to or in place of his other activities. Can\n=\r\nthat be a help to the seeker? (Talks, 601).\n\nLove postulates duality. How c=\r\nan the Self be the object of Love? Love is not\ndifferent from the Self. Lov=\r\ne of an object is an inferior order and cannot\nendure. Whereas the Self is =\r\nLove,in other words, God is Love. (Talks, 433).\n\nTurn your vision inwards a=\r\nnd the whole world will be full of the Supreme\nSpirit. The world is said to=\r\n be illusion. Illusion is really Truth. Even the\nmaterial sciences trace th=\r\ne origin of the universe to some primordial\nmatter... subtle, exceedingly s=\r\nubtle. (Talks, 199).\n\nGod is the same both to those who say the world is re=\r\nal and to their\nopponents. Their outlook is different. You need not entangl=\r\ne yourself in\nsuch disputations. The goal is one and the same for all. Look=\r\n to it. (Talks,\n199).\n\nThe Bible says =E2=80=98Be still and know that I am =\r\nGod=E2=80=99.Stillness is the sole\nrequisite for the realisation of the Sel=\r\nf as God. (Talks, 338).\n\nBrahmacharya is =E2=80=98living in Brahman=E2=80=\r\n=99. It has no connection with celibacy as\ncommonly understood. A real Brah=\r\nmachari finds Bliss in the Brahman which is\nthe same as the Self. Why then =\r\nshould you look for other sources of\nhappiness? In fact the emergence from =\r\nthe Self has been the cause of all the\nmisery.(Talks, 17).\n\nWhen there is c=\r\nontact of a desirable sort or memory thereof, and when there\nis freedom fro=\r\nm undesirable contacts or memory thereof, we say there is\nhappiness. Such h=\r\nappiness is relative and is better called pleasure. (Talks,\n28).\n\nBut men w=\r\nant absolute and permanent happiness. This does not reside in\nobjects, but =\r\nin the Absolute. It is Peace, free from pain and pleasure... it\nis a neutra=\r\nl state. (Talks, 28).\n\nThis is the Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of Heaven=\r\n mentioned in the Bible\nand this world are not two different regions. =E2=\r\n=80=98The Kingdom is within you=E2=80=99\nsays the Bible. So it is.The reali=\r\nsed being sees this as the Kingdom of\nHeaven whereas others see it as =E2=\r\n=80=98this world=E2=80=99. The difference lies only in\nthe angle of vision.=\r\n (Talks, 609).\n\nNirvana is Perfection. In the Perfect State there is neithe=\r\nr subject nor\nobject; there is nothing to see, nothing to feel,nothing to k=\r\nnow. Seeking\nand knowing are the functions of the mind. In Nirvana there is=\r\n nothing but\nthe blissful pure consciousness =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99.

(Talks, 146)=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Effortlessness while remaining aware is the state of Bliss,and t=\r\nhat is Realisation. (Talks, 295).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a sense, speaking of Self-reali=\r\nsation is a delusion. It is only because people have been under the delusio=\r\nn that the non-Self is the Self and the unreal the Real that they have to b=\r\ne weaned out of it by the other delusion called Self-realisation,&lt;br&gt;\n\nbeca=\r\nuse actually the Self always is the Self and there is no such thing as real=\r\nizing it. Who is to realize what, and how, when all that exists is the Self=\r\n and nothing but the Self? (Day by Day).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free-will and destiny are e=\r\nver-existent. Destiny is the result of past action; it concerns the body. L=\r\net the body act as may suit it. Why are you concerned with it? Why do you p=\r\nay attention to it? Free-will and destiny last as long as the body lasts. B=\r\nut Wisdom (jnana) transcends both. The Self is beyond knowledge and ignoran=\r\nce. Should anything happen it happens as the resultant of one=E2=80=99s pas=\r\nt actions, of divine will and other factors. (Talks, 193).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Free-wi=\r\nll holds the field in association with individuality.As long as individuali=\r\nty lasts so long there is Free-will. All the scriptures are based on this f=\r\nact and they advise directing the Free-will in the right channel. Find out =\r\nto whom Free-will or&lt;br&gt;\n\ndestiny matters. Abide in it. Then these two are =\r\ntranscended.That is the only purpose of discussing these questions. To who =\r\ndo they arise? Find out and be at peace. (Talks, 426).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yoga implies =\r\nprior division and it means later union of one with the other. Who is to be=\r\n united with whom? You are the seeker, seeking union with something. That s=\r\nomething is apart from you. You are aware of the Self. Seek it and be it.Th=\r\nat will expand as the Infinite. Then there will be no question of yoga, etc=\r\n. Whose is the separation (viyoga)? Find it. (Talks, 211).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He who =\r\ninstructs an ardent seeker to do this or that is not a true Master. The see=\r\nker is already afflicted by his activities and wants Peace and Rest. In oth=\r\ner words he wants cessation of his activities. Instead of that he is told d=\r\no so something in addition to or in place of his other activities. Can that=\r\n be a help to the seeker? (Talks, 601).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;Love postulates duality. How can the Self be the object of Love? Lov=\r\ne is not different from the Self.

(Tal=\r\nks, 433).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Turn your vision inwards and the whole world will=\r\n be full of the Supreme Spirit. The world is said to be illusion. Illusion =\r\nis really Truth. Even the material sciences trace the origin of the univers=\r\ne to some primordial matter... subtle, exceedingly subtle. (Talks, 199).&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;God is the same both to those who say the world is real and to their=\r\n opponents. Their outlook is different. You need not entangle yourself in s=\r\nuch disputations. The goal is one and the same for all. Look to it.

A real Brahmachari finds Bliss in the Brahman whi=\r\nch is the same as the Self. Why then should you look for other sources of h=\r\nappiness? In fact the emergence from the Self has been the cause of all the=\r\n misery.(Talks, 17).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When there is contact of a desirable sort or =\r\nmemory thereof, and when there is freedom from undesirable contacts or memo=\r\nry thereof, we say there is happiness. Such happiness is relative and is be=\r\ntter called pleasure. (Talks, 28).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;men want absolute and permanent happiness.
