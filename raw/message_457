Accordi=\r\nng to the Report of Saha Calendar Reform Committee, page \n104, &quot;Kali-puja (=\r\nNishitha Vyapini), Dipavali or Diwali (Pradosha, \nMahalakshmipuja (Pradosha=\r\n), Kethar Gauri Vrata (S. India), Mahavira \nnirvana (Jain)&quot; ---all these fe=\r\nstivals are to be celebrated on \nAshvina (Mukhyamana---i.e. Amanta) Krishna=\r\n Amavasya&quot;.\n\n2. Same is the criterion as per Dharma-sindu, Nirnaya-sindhu, =\r\n\nHemadri and even Swami Kannu Pillai&#39;s Ephemeris.\n\nNow the question arises =\r\nas to when the real &quot;Ashvina Krishna \n(Mukhyamana) Amavasya&quot; took place.\n\n3=\r\n. The Vedanga Jyotisha---the ancient-most indigenous astronomical \nwork by =\r\nAcharya Lagadha, tells us that the start of Uttarayana---the \nshortest day =\r\nof the year viz. Witner Solstice---is also the start of \nthe month of Tapah=\r\n cum-(solar)- Magha. This happens these days \naround December 21/22.  That =\r\nvery ingress is known as Makara \nSankranti as per the Bhagavata, Visnhnu Pu=\r\nrana, Shva Purana etc. \netc.---in fact all the eighteen puranas, nay even a=\r\nll the sidhantas, \ninlcuding the Surya Sidhanta by Maya the mlechha. The fi=\r\nrst New Moon \nfollowing the same is the start of lunar Magha Shukla. \n \nThe=\r\n month of Tapasya and solar Phalguna start simultaneously after \nabout 30/3=\r\n1 days of Uttarayana.  That very ingress is known as \nKumbha Sankranti as p=\r\ner all the Puranas and sidhantas.  The first \nNew Moon after that is the st=\r\nart of Lunar Phalgua Shukla and so on. \n \nThese are the criteria of the rea=\r\nl Vedic solar and lunar months as \nper all the Vedas and Puranas and other =\r\nshastras---nay even the \nsidhantas including the Surya Sidhanta!\n\nAs per th=\r\ne same criterion, the Vedic month of Isha-cum-solar Ashvina \nstarted on Aug=\r\nust 22/23, 2008.  That very ingress is also known \nKanya Snakrnati as per a=\r\nll the Puranas and sidhantas.\nThe first New Moon (Amanta) after that was on=\r\n August 31, 2008.  THAT \nWAS THUS THE DATE OF START OF ASHVINA SHUKLA PAKSH=\r\nA!  THAT WAS THUS \nTHE ACTUAL STARTING DATE OF SHARADIYA NAVRATRAS!\n\nThe Am=\r\navasya at Pradosha and nisheetha after that Ashvina (Navratra)\nNew Moon was=\r\n on September 28, 2008! THAT WAS THUS THE ASHVINA \nKRISHNA AMAVASYA (MUKHYA=\r\n MANA) AS PER ALL THE SHASTRAS, INLCUING THE \nVEDAS AND PURANAS!\nHence the =\r\nreal Dipavali cum Kali-Puja cum Lakshmi-puja was on \nSeptember 28, 2008.  \n=\r\n\nSince Amavasya at sunrise is today i.e. September 29, 2008, hence \nthe rea=\r\nl Mahavira Jayanti (Jains) is today i.e. September 29, 2008.\n\nThe Navratras=\r\n and Dipavalis etc. or even Mahavira Jayanti that you \nand other Hindus/Jai=\r\nns etc. are/will be celebrating are thus NOT AS \nPER THE SHASTRAS but as pe=\r\nr the frauds who call themselves Vedic \nastrologers, since they do not know=\r\nn actually even ABC of the Vedas \nso much so so that they confuse &quot;Vedanga =\r\nJyotisha&quot; as a work of \npredictive gimmicks/astrology---when that work does=\r\n not talk of \neither Mesha,Vrisha etc. Rashis or Mangal,Shani etc. planets =\r\neven by \nmistake.\nWith regards,\nA K Kaul\n\n\n\n--- In hinducivilization@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;Anil Kurnool&quot; \n&lt;akurnool@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; Is today Diwa=\r\nli???\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Anil Kurnool\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Sep 28, 2008 at 3:07 PM, jy=\r\notirved &lt;jyotirved@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Dear friends,.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; BEST W=\r\nISHES FOR A HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS DIPAVALI.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Avtar Krishen Ka=\r\nul\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; ~~~~ www.anilprasad.com\n&gt;\n\n--- End forwar=\r\nded message ---\n\n\n\n\n"}}
