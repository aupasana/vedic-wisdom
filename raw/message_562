It contains the essence of great scri=\r\nptures such as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; and &quot;BhagavadGita&quot;, sooktas such as Purus=\r\nha Sooktam and Narayana Sooktam and hymns such as Ganapathi Atharva Seersha=\r\nm. It is a very important hymn.\n\nSavita is the highest form of Surya. He is=\r\n basically the supreme cosmic being. He is Atman, the pure spirit that fill=\r\ns the entire universe - the creation as well as the uncreated. He is the pu=\r\nre light behind all the light and darkness that we see. Good and bad, gods =\r\nand demons, pleasure and pain, all such dualities are but different manifes=\r\ntations of the same Brahman. The ONE Brahman manifests as the duality and d=\r\niverse beings.\n\nThe one Atman, which is but pure light, manifests as dualit=\r\ny - as light and darkness - and fills the entire universe. Savita dwells in=\r\n Brahman as well as the entire perishable creation. Everything that has man=\r\nifested has to perish. Savita dwells in all - in the imperishable Brahman a=\r\ns well as the perishable manifestations of Brahman (various worlds, gods, d=\r\nemons and other beings).\n\nThe ONE pure light of Savita manifests as DIVERSE=\r\n objects ranging all the way from pure light to darkness and fills all bein=\r\ngs. With the pure and untaintable essence of Brahman and the movement cause=\r\nd in Brahman due to desire, Savita enters all the beings including gods. In=\r\n other words, all the beings are created from Brahman and the desire/moveme=\r\nnt in Brahman.\n\nVedanta teaches that Brahman is unmanifested pure conscious=\r\nness. A part of Brahman causes movement in Brahman, which becomes a desire =\r\nand gets fulfilled immediately. This results in the creation of various bei=\r\nngs. The word &quot;ratha&quot; refers to this. The pure essence of Brahman (hiraNyay=\r\na) as well as the desire that caused a movement of thought in Brahman (rath=\r\na) enter all beings. Savita enters all being as Shiva as well as Shakti!\n\nW=\r\nhen all the desires come to a halt and the movement of mind stops, all bein=\r\ngs can experience the pure essence of Brahman that has entered them (i.e. s=\r\nat-chid-ananda). When the desire is there, there are thoughts and movement =\r\nof mind and the beings do not experience the pure essence of Brahman that h=\r\nas entered them.\n\nThe hymn says that the pure essence of Brahman (Shiva) an=\r\nd the desire that causes movement of thought (Shakti) are both aspects of O=\r\nNE Savita only.\n\nSavita enters all the beings with the pure essence and the=\r\n desire/thought and experiences the worlds and beings through them. If a pe=\r\nrson called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; exists, it is actually Savita who exists throug=\r\nh him. If a person called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; experiences the entire world - va=\r\nrious worlds and beings in those worlds - it is actually Savita who has ent=\r\nered him that experiences the entire world through him!! All his thoughts, =\r\nexperiences and actions are actually those of Savita - the in-dwelling spir=\r\nit.\n\nThis is the same as what Ganapathi Atharva Seersham means by &quot;tvameva =\r\nkevalam kartAsi...&quot;. This is the same as what Krishna means when he tells A=\r\nrjuna in BhagavadGita that it is Krishna who acts through various beings an=\r\nd that the beings should not be deluded to think that they are doing things=\r\n.\n\nSavita in this hymn is represented as the same supreme cosmic being that=\r\n is referred in various other Vedic scriptures!\n\nMost authorities have inte=\r\nrpreted the second line to mean that Sun goes on a chariot and watches the =\r\nentire world. That is a gross interpretation and misses the subtle and deep=\r\ner meaning.\n\nIn fact, when Atman goes on the chariot (ratha) of desire (rat=\r\nha), it moves and sees the diverse creation. When the chariot (ratha) stops=\r\n, then the desire (ratha) stops and there is no movement of thought. No lon=\r\nger a diverse creation is perceived and there is only bliss of true being (=\r\nsat-chid-ananda). Thus, even the gross chaiot interpretation is a metaphor =\r\nfor the subtle interpretation given above!\n\nThis hymn is very important as =\r\nit covers several important Vedantic concepts:\n\n(1) The supreme cosmic bein=\r\ng is one, but assumes duality.\n(2) The supreme cosmic being enters all the =\r\nbeings with the duality.\n(3) The supreme cosmic being experiences through a=\r\nll the beings.\n(4) The pure essence of supreme cosmic being enters all the =\r\nbeings and helps them experience sat-chid-ananda.\n(5) The desire (movement =\r\nof thought) in the supreme cosmic being enters all the beings and results i=\r\nn movement of thought within them and diverse world experiences. \n\nBest reg=\r\nards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJa=\r\ngannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006E_01C93643.E1DE97E0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3429&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In the next few weeks/months, I want to share with \nall m=\r\ny independent interpretations of the vedic mantras for nine \nplanets.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Though I am mostly restricting my spiritual \nwritings to=\r\n vedic-wisdom yahoogroup these days&nbsp;and sparing astrology \nrelated yah=\r\noogroups, I am sending this to astrology yahoogroups also, as BPHS \ntalks a=\r\nbout these mantras in the chapter on graha shanti.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;This mant=\r\nra is a very popular mantra for \nworshipping Surya (Sun god).

It contains th=\r\ne \nessence of great scriptures such as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; and &quot;BhagavadGita=\r\n&quot;, \nsooktas such as Purusha Sooktam and Narayana Sooktam and hymns such as =\r\nGanapathi \nAtharva Seersham. It is a very important hymn.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Savita is =\r\nthe highest form \nof Surya. He is basically the supreme cosmic being. He is=\r\n Atman, the pure spirit \nthat fills the entire universe - the creation as w=\r\nell as the uncreated. He is \nthe pure light behind all the light and darkne=\r\nss that we see. Good and bad, gods \nand demons, pleasure and pain, all such=\r\n dualities are but different \nmanifestations of the same Brahman. The ONE B=\r\nrahman manifests as the duality and \ndiverse beings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The one Atman, =\r\nwhich is but pure light, manifests as \nduality - as light and darkness - an=\r\nd fills the entire universe. Savita dwells \nin Brahman as well as the entir=\r\ne perishable creation. Everything that has \nmanifested has to perish. Savit=\r\na dwells in all - in the imperishable Brahman as \nwell as the perishable ma=\r\nnifestations of Brahman (various worlds, gods, demons \nand other beings).&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ONE pure light of Savita manifests as DIVERSE \nobjects ranging al=\r\nl the way from pure light to darkness and fills all beings. \nWith the pure =\r\nand untaintable essence of Brahman and the movement caused in \nBrahman due =\r\nto desire, Savita enters all the beings including gods. In other \nwords, al=\r\nl the beings are created from Brahman and the desire/movement in \nBrahman.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vedanta teaches that Brahman is unmanifested pure consciousness. \nA =\r\npart of Brahman causes movement in Brahman, which becomes a desire and gets=\r\n \nfulfilled immediately. This results in the creation of various beings. Th=\r\ne word \n&quot;ratha&quot; refers to this. The pure essence of Brahman (hiraNyaya) as =\r\nwell as the \ndesire that caused a movement of thought in Brahman (ratha) en=\r\nter all beings. \nSavita enters all being as Shiva as well as Shakti!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;When all the desires \ncome to a halt and the movement of mind stops, all b=\r\neings can experience the \npure essence of Brahman that has entered them (i.=\r\ne. sat-chid-ananda). When the \ndesire is there, there are thoughts and move=\r\nment of mind and the beings do not \nexperience the pure essence of Brahman =\r\nthat has entered them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The hymn \nsays that the pure essence of Brahm=\r\nan (Shiva) and the desire that causes \nmovement of thought (Shakti) are bot=\r\nh aspects of ONE Savita only.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Savita \nenters all the beings with the=\r\n pure essence and the desire/thought and \nexperiences the worlds and beings=\r\n through them. If a person called &quot;Narasimha \nRao&quot; exists, it is actually S=\r\navita who exists through him. If a person called \n&quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; experienc=\r\nes the entire world - various worlds and beings in \nthose worlds - it is ac=\r\ntually Savita who has entered him that experiences the \nentire world throug=\r\nh him!! All his thoughts, experiences and actions are \nactually those of Sa=\r\nvita - the in-dwelling spirit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the same as \nwhat Ganapathi A=\r\ntharva Seersham means by &quot;tvameva kevalam kartAsi...&quot;. This is \nthe same as=\r\n what Krishna means when he tells Arjuna in BhagavadGita that it is \nKrishn=\r\na who acts through various beings and that the beings should not be \ndelude=\r\nd to think that they are doing things.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Savita in this hymn is \nrepre=\r\nsented as the same supreme cosmic being that is referred in various other \n=\r\nVedic scriptures!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most authorities have interpreted the second line =\r\nto \nmean that Sun goes on a chariot and watches the entire world. That is a=\r\n gross \ninterpretation and misses the subtle and deeper meaning.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In =\r\nfact, when \nAtman goes on the chariot (ratha) of desire (ratha), it moves a=\r\nnd sees the \ndiverse creation. When the chariot (ratha) stops, then the des=\r\nire (ratha) stops \nand there is no movement of thought. No longer a diverse=\r\n creation is perceived \nand there is only bliss of true being (sat-chid-ana=\r\nnda).
