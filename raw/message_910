They are also for some subtle messages. For example, you can see=\r\n that the stories cover a Brahman, a shoodra (wood-cutter), a vaishya (busi=\r\nnessman named Sadhu) and a kshatriya (king names Tungadhwaja). The shoodra =\r\nand vaishya learned the procedure and did it themselves (instead of hiring =\r\na priest like people do these days). It means that anybody can do this ritu=\r\nal and do it by themselves, to the best of their ability.\n \nThe businessman=\r\n tried to do business with god. Instead of performing the ritual with a des=\r\nire in mind, he asked for his desire and took a vow that he will do the rit=\r\nual IF a child is born. He asked god to first give a result. Even after he =\r\ngot a child, he postponed it saying he will do it at his daughter&#39;s marriag=\r\ne. He tried to haggle with god and extract the most. If you have a vaishya&#39;=\r\ns temperament, you should guard against the tendency to do business with go=\r\nd.\n \nThe king was arrogant and egoistic. He ignored the ritual performed by=\r\n cowboys because they were using clay idols and clay pots and he did not th=\r\nink much of them or their ritual. He did not bow to the god and rejected th=\r\ne prasad given by them. If you have a kshatriya&#39;s temperament, you should g=\r\nuard against the tendency towards arrogance, ego, pride and belittling of o=\r\nthers.\n \nLike this, there are some hidden messages that you can get by pond=\r\nering on the stories.\n \nOf course, when I mention the castes here, I do not=\r\n necessarily mean the caste of birth. In the old days, people got their cas=\r\nte from father, but it became clear in time as their own temperament and ap=\r\ntitude developed. One interested in only knowledge is a braahmana. One inte=\r\nrested in power, authority and control over others is a kshatriya. One inte=\r\nrested in money and more money is a vaishya. One interested mainly in physi=\r\ncal pleasures is a shoodra. One&#39;s caste is decided by one&#39;s attitude and ap=\r\ntitude. Valmiki was born as a shoodra, but became a braahmana later and als=\r\no a maharshi. Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but became a braahmana l=\r\nater and also a maharshi. In the old days, the concept of caste mobility wa=\r\ns very much there and caste was not a rigid concept like today. What I said=\r\n above regarding the weaknesses that people of different castes should try =\r\nto overcome should be seen in that context and not from the context of a fi=\r\nxed caste based on birth in a family.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comca=\r\nst.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n        Dear Narasimha garu,\n\n        Is it possible to create a=\r\n manual on the procedure for Satyanarayana pooja, just like the Homam manua=\r\nls ? \n\n        What is the significance of reading the stories glorifying t=\r\nhe Satyanarayana Vratam at the end of the pooja?
