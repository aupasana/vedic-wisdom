I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward f=\r\nrom Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is=\r\n not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n\nI have gone through the =\r\nhomam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being per=\r\nformed  and have the following observations to make.\n\n1. As per rules laid =\r\nout by  srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various=\r\n rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (w=\r\nhich is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n\n2. All steps in darsapoornamasa shoul=\r\nd be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form=\r\n, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and w=\r\nhich are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by=\r\n acharyas.\n\n3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras s=\r\nuch as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omiss=\r\nions.\n\n4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. becom=\r\ne worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right proce=\r\ndure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire=\r\n ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits =\r\nStaal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n\n5. The procedur=\r\ne in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large de=\r\nviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures=\r\n. \n\n6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a part=\r\nicular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the =\r\nbottom of the prceeding ones.\n\n7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantr=\r\na parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be=\r\n from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru=\r\n karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner =\r\n(Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n\n8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles us=\r\ned in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n\n9.Prokshanee samskaram and proks=\r\nhanam for purification of the utensils is missing.\n\n10. Patra samskaram or =\r\npurifying the utensils is missing.\n\n11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam=\r\n on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with da=\r\nrbha) is missing.\n\n12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missi=\r\nng.\n\n13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of =\r\nthe homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n\n14. Darvee samskaram or purific=\r\nation of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be us=\r\ned (sruksruvou).\n\n15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n\n16=\r\n. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis m=\r\nissing.\n\n17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in=\r\n the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of g=\r\nhee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n\nand m=\r\nany more ............\n\n18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the de=\r\nity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as=\r\n carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity =\r\npronounced in satva tyaga,  agni carries the offering to the particular dei=\r\nty. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n\n1=\r\n8. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the ag=\r\nni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is convert=\r\ned into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya =\r\nahutis.\n\n19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the mantr=\r\na sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;=\r\nt involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right =\r\npronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas=\r\n who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted  to perfrom hom=\r\nam for any devata.\n\n\n20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda=\r\n work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an ab=\r\nle guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n\n21. I sugges=\r\nt that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may =\r\nnot always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge unco=\r\nrrupted.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
