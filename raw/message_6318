Science and Religion are inseparable.\nSc=\r\nience is part of Religion. Science and Religion are necessary\ncorrelatives.=\r\n Scientists are also monists in one sense.They also\nemphatically declare th=\r\nat there is only one thing viz., Matter or Energy.\n\nA Yogi tries to control=\r\n the mental forces,a scientist the physical forces.\nThis is all the differe=\r\nnce between a Yogi and a scientist. A scientist is\nalso an unconscious Raja=\r\n-Yogi, but his mind works in external grooves.\n\nBefore the invention of wat=\r\nch, Yogius used to calculate time by measuring\nthe shadow in day and by the=\r\n study of the movement of the stars in the\nheavens at night. They were perf=\r\nectly exact in their calculations. Astronomy\nand medicine received their fi=\r\nrst impulse from the exigencies of religious\nworship. Yogins have a sound p=\r\nractical knowledge of Ayurveda. One who\nendeavours to qualify himself as hi=\r\ns own doctor can become a Yogi.\n\nHe has to live sometimes in the jungles an=\r\nd has to treathimself first,\nwhenever diseases manifest. Otherwise his Sadh=\r\nana will suffer and he cannot\nhave rapid progress in Yoga. You will find in=\r\n the books on Ayurveda: &quot;A\nhealthy body is a good instrument for doing virt=\r\nuous actions and practising\nYoga.&quot; Those who wrote these Ayurvedic books we=\r\nre great Rishis and Yogins.\n\nScience is partially unified knowledge. A scie=\r\nntist observes the laws of\nNature,experiements in his laboratory, investiga=\r\ntes, infers and draws exact\nconclusions from his observations. He understan=\r\nds Nature. But he knows\nnothing of the origin or destiny of Nature! Who mad=\r\ne the sun and gave power\nto its rays?\n\nWho combined four parts of nitrogen =\r\nwith one part of oxygen? Who gave power\nto electrons? Who gave power to ato=\r\nms to combine into molecules? Who or what\nmade and bestowed upon the ultima=\r\nte particles of matter their marvellous\npower of varied interaction? Scienc=\r\ne does not know this great mystery. On\nthe contrary, Yoga is completely uni=\r\nfied knowledge. A Yogi gets inner divine\nrealisation.\n\nHe clearly sees with=\r\n his inner Yogic eyes the subtle rudiments of matter. He\nidentifies himself=\r\n with the Supreme Being who is the Lord of the Prakriti\n(matter). He gets c=\r\nontrol over the five elements. He clearly understands the\nwhole mystery\nof =\r\ncreation through direct intuitional knowledge. The scientist lacks this\nsor=\r\nt of knowledge. He has only experimental knowledge.\n\nThe business of scienc=\r\ne is generalisation of phenomena; it is the function\nof philosophy and Yoga=\r\n to explain. Religion is the practical aspect of\nphilosophy. Philosophy is =\r\nthe rational aspect of religion.The scientist\ntries to answer the &quot;How=E2=\r\n=80=9D of the problem; the philosopher and the Yogi the\n&quot;Why&quot; of it. It is =\r\na mistake to say that such and such an event occurs\nbecause of certain laws=\r\n of Nature.\n\nThe laws of Nature do not give any real explanation of the phe=\r\nnomena. It is\nsimply a\nstatement in terms as general as possible of what ha=\r\nppens under given\ncircumstances in his expression of an observed order or u=\r\nniformity in a\nnatural phenomena. Science is concerned only with the phenom=\r\nena. It shows a\nmarvellous harmony of Nature.\n\nBut it is the problem of phi=\r\nlosophy and Yoga to solve the &quot;Why&quot; of Nature&quot;s\nharmony. Scientists possess=\r\n partial knowledge of the universe. They have not\nunderstood the whole code=\r\n of Nature&quot;s laws. They have no knowledge of the\noccult side of things. The=\r\ny have no knowledge of the astral, mental and\nhigher planes such as Brahma-=\r\nLoka (world of Brahma). The unseen world is of\nfar greater importance than =\r\nthe sense-universe which is visible to the naked\neye.\n\nA fully developed Yo=\r\ngi can function in all the planes and so he has full\nknowledge of the manif=\r\nested and unmanifested Nature. The senses by which you\nget knowledge of the=\r\n external objects are not fully developed. Therefore the\nknowledge obtained=\r\n is partial. The external senses are exact counterparts of\nthe internal ast=\r\nral senses. Scientists have no knowledge of the subtle\nrudiments of matter.=\r\n Life will become fuller and richer, when one develops\nthis inner eye-sight=\r\n by the practice of Yoga.\n\nJust as blood, when seen under the microscope, r=\r\neveals many mysterious\nthings such as leucocytes, lymphocytes, nuclei, pigm=\r\nent,germs, bacilli,\netc., so also the inner Yogic eye reveals many mysterie=\r\ns of the hidden side\nof things.The knowledge of the scientists is only frag=\r\nmentary or partial\nwhereas the knowledge of the Yogi is\nfull and perfect.\n\n=\r\nScientists have to learn many things from the Seers of the East. Who gave\np=\r\nower to the electrons to revolve? Who gave life to the cell or the\nprotopla=\r\nsm? What is that power that unites atoms to form molecules? Who gave\nintell=\r\nigence to the cells to secrete milk or bile or gastric juice from the\nblood=\r\n? Scientists are still observing and experimenting.\n\nThey are still groping=\r\n in darkness.What is the cause of the origin of an\nimpulse? Who is the dire=\r\nctor of the mind? What is the cause of the origin of\nthought? Even if all t=\r\nhe living scientists were to put their heads together\nto solve these questi=\r\nons, they cannot give definite conclusive answers.\n\nBut I do not mean to co=\r\nndemn the wonderful discoveries and inventions that\nmodern\nscience has cont=\r\nributed to the vast store of knowledge and happiness which\nthe present gene=\r\nration enjoys today. The radio, the aeroplane, the\nmicrophone and other mar=\r\nvels of science are bound to baffle human\nintelligence. Scientists have fou=\r\nnd ways to fertilize an ovum with\nchemicals, without the help of semen. It =\r\nis stupendous success. Some\nchildren are also born.\n\nThey inject the semen =\r\nthat is obtained from renowned and cultured men of the\nworld in order to im=\r\nprove the race. They are attempting to fix a radio in a\nmatch-stick. They a=\r\nre trying to get the necessary nutrition to the body by\npressing an electri=\r\nc button, so that eating and defecation may be entirely\nabandoned.\n\nThey ar=\r\ne endeavouring to make the streets move so that there will be no\nnecessity =\r\nfor motor-cars and carriages. They are trying to establish means\nof communi=\r\ncation with the planet Mars. They may succeed in all their\nattempts.\n\nMay G=\r\nod bless them with roaring success in all their undertakings! But the\nquest=\r\nion is: Can all these comforts and scientific discoveries and\ninventions gi=\r\nve immortality,eternal satisfaction and everlasting peace? Have\nthese mater=\r\nial comforts enhanced human happiness? Is not man more restless\ntoday than =\r\never before? Is he not more dissatisfied and discontented despite\nall these=\r\n comforts? Life has become more complex and intricate. Luxuries are\nincreas=\r\ning day by day. Even a rich man finds it difficult to make both ends\nmeet.\n=\r\n\nThere is only one remedy for all these ills. You will have to abandon all\n=\r\nluxuries and go back to simple natural living,if you want to enjoy real and=\r\n\nlasting happiness. Immortality can be attained by realising the Self throu=\r\ngh\nsimple living, practice of Yoga, self-control, mental discipline and\nmed=\r\nitation.\n\nMatter exists in different conditions or states viz., solid, liqu=\r\nid and\ngaseous. The conditions may be made to change by variation of pressu=\r\nre and\ntemperature. Water is turned into ice at a low temperature and steam=\r\n at a\nhigher temperature.\n\nEvery solid may become a liquid or gas under sui=\r\ntable conditions; every\nliquid may be rendered solid or gaseous; every gas =\r\nmay be made liquid or\nsolid. One form of energy can be also transmuted into=\r\n another form of\nenergy. Heat can be transmuted into light and light into e=\r\nlectricity. Even\nso, seminal energy or muscular energy, anger,\netc., can be=\r\n transmuted into spiritual energy (Ojas-Shakti).\n\nThere is life in the mine=\r\nral kingdom. This has been conclusively proved by\nthe experiments of Prof. =\r\nVon Schron at Naples. Even the elements manifest\ndistinct preference.One el=\r\nement has a strong liking for the company of\nanother. One element may even =\r\ngive up the company of one substance in order\nto join another element.\n\nThi=\r\ns is chemical affinity. Every chemist fully knows this well. Hydrogen\nlikes=\r\n the company of oxygen. Two molecules of hydrogen combine with one\nmolecule=\r\n of oxygen. Water is formed. If you place sodium in the water, you\nwill not=\r\nice that oxygen\nlikes sodium better than hydrogen and immediately abandons =\r\nthe company of\nhydrogen and joins sodium.\n\nLikes and dislikes are more mark=\r\nedly present in the vegetable kingdom,than\nin the mineral.Many plants exhib=\r\nit a remarkable degree of ingenuity in\naccomplishing their ends.\n\nIt is imp=\r\nossible humanly to imagine how the earth, for instance, can move\nalong the =\r\nsame track which it was following for aeons up to this time, as if\nthers is=\r\n a set of rails laid down on its path in space.\n\nSource: GOD EXISTS By SRI =\r\nSWAMI SIVANANDA\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--20cf30050c36ace18104a35d54cc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Yoga and Science are inseparabl=\r\ne.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Science and Religion are inseparable.
