I just saw a few mails from the ve=\r\ngetarianism thread. Just a few quick points.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSelf-i=\r\ndentification of human beings and animals with body and body parts is much =\r\nmuch stronger and denser than that of plants and trees. Self-identification=\r\n of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is pluc=\r\nked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very =\r\nsubtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a huma=\r\nn being, the emotion experienced is much stronger. Even after death, an ani=\r\nmal may identify with the body and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.\n \nThe kaarmik debt f=\r\normed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the animal&#39;s mind considers a=\r\ns a part of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik =\r\ndebt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree or =\r\nkilling bacteria.\n \nAs long as we live in a physical body, creation of new =\r\nkaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we create =\r\nnewly.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYou are what you eat. Our body and various c=\r\nhemicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.\n \nMeat is high=\r\nly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and ident=\r\nification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all,=\r\n if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, =\r\nthe quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not condu=\r\ncive to spiritual progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIt is possible that a s=\r\npiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However,=\r\n it is not easy to emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identific=\r\nation with the body and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saatt=\r\nwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).\n=\r\n \nIf a meat-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, gre=\r\nens and lentils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read=\r\n spiritual literature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see t=\r\nhat it makes a big difference.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSomeone mentioned th=\r\nat Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like thi=\r\ns, there is a lot of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not b=\r\nacked by specific quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verified b=\r\ny scholars are best ignored.\n \nSwami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have giv=\r\nen a clarion call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that =\r\ndoes not require eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of m=\r\neat eating.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n\n\n\n"}}
