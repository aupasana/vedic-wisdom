Thus\n=\r\nwhatever you are saying is also unreal.Why would I need to do Karma in an\nu=\r\nnreal world ? Is Karma even unreal ?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBhagavan says that we don=E2=\r\n=80=99t deem a dream, a dream till we wake up, that the\ndream looks quite r=\r\neal while it lasts; and that similarly this waking state\nwill not appear a =\r\ndream till we wake up into jnana.Because of the above\ndifference between th=\r\ne dream and the waking states, our effort is called for\nand this is where k=\r\narma philosophy comes.\n\nThere is an elephant in the forest.The elephant is =\r\nscared about the Lion in\nthe forest.The Lion has not appeared before the el=\r\nephant in recent times. It\nwas once sighted and the elephant became totally=\r\n afraid of lion. One night,\nthe elephant dreamt of the Lion, it got scared =\r\neven its dream about the\nLion. It woke up with a huge cry.There was not Lio=\r\nn. Only it was there. The\nelephant got self realized.\n\nBhagavan Ramana used=\r\n to tell one story:\n\nOnce two persons were sleeping in a hall.Both were poo=\r\nr.During the sleep,\none man was dreaming.He dreamt that he is a very rich p=\r\nerson and he has\nstacked all the gold and currency in a cupboard.And a thie=\r\nf comes and takes\naway all the gold and currency, and runs away.The dreamin=\r\ng man shouts in\nshock: &quot;O! the thief is running away with all my wealth.\n\nP=\r\nlease catch him, please catch him....&quot;\n\nThe other man woke up. He was not d=\r\nreaming anything, neither the thief, nor\nthe gold and currency. What shall =\r\nhe do? Will he run out to the front yard\nto catch the thief? Will he rush t=\r\no the police station to complain? He will\nsimply wake that wailing man from=\r\n sleep and dream.\n\nThe Guru is like the man who wakes us, the dreaming men,=\r\n up.The only\ndifference is that the Guru is within your Heart.\n\n-----------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n\nYour Second Question :\n\nWhy does consciousness co=\r\nnstruct anything ? Why can&#39;t it just be as it is ?\nWhat is the need for an =\r\nunreal world ?\n\nAnswer:\n\nBhagavan&#39;s famous quote regarding whether the un-r=\r\neality of the world\n\nJust as the spider emits the thread [of its web] out f=\r\nrom its own mouth and\nagain withdraws it back, so the mind projects the wor=\r\nld out from itself and\nagain absorbs it back within.\n\nSince the knower [the=\r\n jiva], the known [the worldappearance] and the knowing\n[the act of perceiv=\r\ning the world through the five senses] form a triad\n[triputi], all of them =\r\nare equally false. In other words, since even the\njiva who is seen and his =\r\nact of seeing are both a part of the\nworld-appearance, they are both unreal=\r\n as that appearance.\n\nTo illustrate this, let us suppose that a film is tak=\r\nen of a king watching a\ncinema show; when this film is projected, are not t=\r\nhe king and his act of\nwatching the cinema show, both pictures in the film?=\r\n\n\nAs known Adi Shanakara said,\n\n(1) Brahman is real,\n(2) the universe is un=\r\nreal, and\n(3) The universe is Brahman.\n\nHe did not stop at the second, beca=\r\nuse the third explains the other two. It\nsignifies that the universe is rea=\r\nl if perceived as the Self, and unreal if\nperceived apart from the Self. He=\r\nnce maya and reality are one and the same.\n\nBhagavan Ramana says,At the lev=\r\nel of the spiritual seeker you have got to\nsay that the world is an illusio=\r\nn. There is no other way. When a man forgets\nthat he is Brahman, who is rea=\r\nl, permanent and omnipresent, and deludes\nhimself into thinking that he is =\r\na body in the universe which is filled with\nbodies that are transitory, and=\r\n labours under that delusion, you have got to\nremind him that the world is =\r\nunreal and a delusion. Why?\n\nSo long as a man does not see the Self which i=\r\ns the origin of all, but looks\nonly at the external world as real and perma=\r\nnent, you have to tell him that\nall this external universe is an illusion. =\r\nYou cannot help it.\n\nTake a paper. We see only the script, and nobody notic=\r\nes the paper on which\nthe script is written. The paper is there whether the=\r\n script on it is there\nor not.To those who look upon the script as real, yo=\r\nu have to say that it is\nunreal, an illusion, since it rests upon the paper=\r\n. The wise man looks upon\nboth the Paper and script as one. So also with Br=\r\nahman and the universe.\n\nJust as fire is obscured by smoke, the shining lig=\r\nht of consciousness is\nobscured by the assemblage of names and forms,the wo=\r\nrld.\n\nRamana Maharshi=E2=80=99s actual experience is ajata though he Suppor=\r\nts Simultaneous\nCreation(drishti-srishti vada)\n\nI request you to read below=\r\n link and let us know if any further doubts\nexists\n\nhttp://sri-ramana-mahar=\r\nshi.blogspot.com/2010/02/bhagavans-letter-to-ganapati-muni.html\n\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\nOn Thu, Apr 29, 2010 at 3:37 PM, Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@g=\r\nmail.com&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Jai,\n&gt; *\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan has told us that the worl=\r\nd as such is not real\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt; In the above sentence replace &quot;real&quot; with &quot;pe=\r\nrmanent&quot; and read it again\n&gt; with the\n&gt; notion that all that is not permane=\r\nnt is not important and the meaning\n&gt; might come through.\n&gt; For a moment, l=\r\net&#39;s also assume we can change viewpoint of world from us\n&gt; (duality)\n&gt; to =\r\nBrahman (non-duality). Brahman is formless and attribute-less. Any thing\n&gt; =\r\nthat has\n&gt; an attribute is temporary from that frame (as described by learn=\r\ned). World\n&gt; and life have\n&gt; attributes and will definitely look temporary.=\r\n Karmas of a normal\n&gt; individual, who will\n&gt; have multiple attributes, may =\r\nseem trivial compared to Nature&#39;s actions.\n&gt; So, it is not\n&gt; really surpris=\r\ning to see saints, those who merged into Brahman, to say\n&gt; world and\n&gt; life=\r\n are unreal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Coming back to us, karma is the most important thing.

This supreme awareness is all that=\r\n IS, and abiding therein is\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ultimate goal.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Let us now=\r\n have a look at recent developments in scientific knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; At\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one=\r\n time the world around us was supposed to consist of matter, made of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; m=\r\nolecules and atoms. Physicists chased them further and broke them down\n&gt;&gt; t=\r\no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nucleus, electrons, quanta, waves, particles, and fields. Einstein s=\r\naid\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the universe of our experience consists of matter and ener=\r\ngy in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; space-time-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D=\r\n mc2, where\n&gt;&gt; C is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a constant representing the velocity of light. Mat=\r\nter and energy became\n&gt;&gt; &gt; interchangeable.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Max Planck, famous for his=\r\n quantum theory, added a further dimension to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this, stating that it is=\r\n consciousness that is fundamental and that\n&gt;&gt; matter\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is a derivative =\r\nof consciousness. As a corollary even space and time are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; only concepts=\r\n of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are veering round\n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the c=\r\nonclusion that since every object is a sum of its qualities and\n&gt;&gt; these\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of matter\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction o=\r\nf\n&gt;&gt; &gt; consciousness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist =\r\neverywhere are experienced by\n&gt;&gt; us;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there is nothing here anywhere wh=\r\nich has not been experienced by us.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhagavan has told us that th=\r\ne world as such is not real. It is real as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Brahman or Consciousness. T=\r\nhe world we see and experience with our\n&gt;&gt; senses is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a product of the =\r\nmind; the mind is a part of the ego, which rises from\n&gt;&gt; Pure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Consciou=\r\nsness, which is the same as Reality.

Brahman is formless and attribute-less. Any thing that ha=\r\ns &lt;br&gt;an attribute is temporary from that frame (as described by learned). =\r\nWorld and life have&lt;br&gt;\n\nattributes and will definitely look temporary. Kar=\r\nmas of a normal individual, who will&lt;br&gt;have multiple attributes, may seem =\r\ntrivial compared to Nature&#39;s actions. So, it is not &lt;br&gt;really surprisi=\r\nng to see saints, those who merged into Brahman, to say world and &lt;br&gt;\n\nlif=\r\ne are unreal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming back to us, karma is the most important thing. =\r\nUntil karma is selflessly &lt;br&gt;performed, I-ness expects, observes, judges a=\r\nnd experiences the results. Those&lt;br&gt;results cause future karmas and the cy=\r\ncle continues. As long as I-ness exists, &lt;br&gt;\n\nconsciousness exists to oper=\r\nate on our karmas. Based on my understanding others &lt;br&gt;may correct this --=\r\n Consciousness constructs things just to be active till our soul is &lt;br&gt;rel=\r\nieved of all karmas.&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Which scientist says un=\r\niverse is a construction of consciousness ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Not everything scienti=\r\nsts say is real nor all real things were found by \nscientists only. So,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nwe&#39;ll leave that there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I haven&#39;t read vedas or any epics,=\r\n so I am not eligible to comment on that topic. That&lt;br&gt;said, above stateme=\r\nnt on unreal world seems to be a wise statement to trigger this&lt;br&gt;kind of =\r\nquestioning.

This supreme awaren=\r\ness is all that IS, and abiding therein is the&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; ultimate goal.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Let us now have a look at recent developments in scientifi=\r\nc knowledge. At&lt;br&gt;&gt; one time the world around us was supposed to consis=\r\nt of matter, made of&lt;br&gt;&gt; molecules and atoms. Physicists chased them fu=\r\nrther and broke them down to&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; nucleus, electrons, quanta, waves=\r\n, particles, and fields. Einstein said that&lt;br&gt;&gt; the universe of our exp=\r\nerience consists of matter and energy in a&lt;br&gt;&gt; space-time-continuum. He=\r\n established the famous equation E =3D mc2, where C is&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; a const=\r\nant representing the velocity of light. Matter and energy became&lt;br&gt;&gt; in=\r\nterchangeable.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Max Planck, famous for his quantum theory, added a f=\r\nurther dimension to&lt;br&gt;&gt; this, stating that it is consciousness that is =\r\nfundamental and that matter&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; is a derivative of consciousness. =\r\nAs a corollary even space and time are&lt;br&gt;&gt; only concepts of our conscio=\r\nus- ness. Thus scientists are veering round to&lt;br&gt;&gt; the conclusion that =\r\nsince every object is a sum of its qualities and these&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; qualiti=\r\nes are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of matter and&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nenergy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction of&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nconsciousness.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that e=\r\nxist everywhere are experienced by us;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; there is nothing here a=\r\nnywhere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Bhagav=\r\nan has told us that the world as such is not real. It is real as&lt;br&gt;&gt; Br=\r\nahman or Consciousness. The world we see and experience with our senses is&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&gt; a product of the mind; the mind is a part of the ego, which ri=\r\nses from Pure&lt;br&gt;&gt; Consciousness, which is the same as Reality.
