The \n&gt; imagery is ver=\r\ny powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Om! Verily, the dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse=\r\n; the \nsun, \n&gt; his eye; the wind his breath; universal fire, his open mouth=\r\n. The \nyear \n&gt; is the body; the sky, his back; the atmosphere his belly; th=\r\ne \nearth, \n&gt; the underpart of his belly; the quarters his flanks; the \ninte=\r\nrmediate \n&gt; quarters, his ribs; the seasons his limbs; the months and half =\r\n\nmonths \n&gt; his joints; the days and night his fee; the stars his bones; the=\r\n \nclouds \n&gt; his flesh. Sand is the food inhis stomach; rivers are his \nentr=\r\nails. His \n&gt; liver and lungs are the mountains; plants and trees his hair. =\r\nThe \n&gt; orient is his fore part; the occident his hind part. When he yawns \n=\r\nthen \n&gt; it lightens. Whe he shakes himself it thunders. When he urinates \nt=\r\nhen \n&gt; it rains. Voice indeed is his voice&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; If one lets the imaginatio=\r\nn go wild then the concept of birth \n(dawn) / \n&gt; rising ascendant, (and the=\r\nrefore also death of the sacrificial \nhorse?); \n&gt; the atman; the elements; =\r\nthe space; the time; the energies; the \n&gt; physical; the five senses; everyt=\r\nhing appears to be there. in the \nvery \n&gt; first shloka.\n&gt; \n&gt; The theme of s=\r\nacrifice / sacrificial oblations, etc. occur again \nand \n&gt; agian throughout=\r\n the text of this Upanishad.\n&gt; \n&gt; My questions are:\n&gt; \n&gt; why, is it essenti=\r\nal to use imagination to understand what is \nwritten? \n&gt; Does that mean tha=\r\nt each person has to experience the meaning on \nhis or \n&gt; her own depending=\r\n on his or her awareness? Then the question is \nhow \n&gt; real is imagination?=\r\n Can we depend on it to understand things? \n&gt; correctly? The shlokas appear=\r\n to be so multi-layered /multi-\n&gt; dimensional that there is no &quot;logical&quot; wa=\r\ny to understand them \n(assuming \n&gt; of course, that imagination does not rel=\r\nate to logic)!\n&gt; \n&gt; But most important of all: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SA=\r\nCRIFICE IN \n&gt; EXISTENCE??? WHY THE SYMBOL OF ASHWA MEDHA?\n&gt; \n&gt; Does it have=\r\n something to do with movement from gross to the \nsubtle? \n&gt; Self purificat=\r\nion?\n&gt; \n&gt; Would love to hear the views of others.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;          \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; !
