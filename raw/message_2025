Also, he need not be talking about s=\r\nomebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineage=\r\ns, there are connections between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit =\r\nthe house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda an=\r\nd knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his pri=\r\nson cell of Swami Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, in which h=\r\ne imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in C=\r\nalcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wro=\r\nte the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramak=\r\nrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and ad=\r\nmired him. And so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming back to the main point, the supermind est=\r\nablished in the field of earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply=\r\n be a maharshi paying some attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorb=\r\ned in the divine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplis=\r\nh huge changes on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a div=\r\nine play to make some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part i=\r\nn the play, he may focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of ea=\r\nrth and direct a few important souls to do some key work. Some important so=\r\nuls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) =\r\nto be born on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.\n&gt; \n&gt; You ma=\r\ny then see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and r=\r\nealized beings born on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiri=\r\ntual knowledge. Each of them will get specific internal/external guidance f=\r\nrom the divine, based on what their part in the play is.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us. At the s=\r\nubtlest level, he manifests as false ego in pretty much everybody. At the g=\r\nrossest level, he manifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; One=\r\n should not tolerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should=\r\n not hate this Asura or those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we =\r\nshould fight and stand for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. Th=\r\nere is nothing that needs to be hated in this world. One should learn to do=\r\n the job assigned to one by Nature without attraction or repulsion to anyth=\r\ning or anybody and with unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a retur=\r\nn) to all.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasim=\r\nhaji\n&gt; &gt; says about changes coming in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know very little.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nea=\r\nr the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yo=\r\ngi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been express=\r\ned before. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come=\r\n for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to=\r\n manifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence i=\r\nnto Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Ear=\r\nth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her =\r\nmaterial body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aur=\r\nobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa,=\r\n who later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey =\r\nof intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal =\r\nuncertainties we face today.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the divin=\r\ne force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of =\r\nconsciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter=\r\n is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards=\r\n out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity ha=\r\ns reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and =\r\nin his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a desce=\r\nnt of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=\r\n=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Man=EF=BF=\r\n=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he mak=\r\nes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom activ=\r\ne in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstruct=\r\ned from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a =\r\ngreat divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems=\r\n to contradict it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going th=\r\nrough an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human m=\r\nind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly ina=\r\ndequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mothe=\r\nr testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human=\r\n rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been establi=\r\nshed in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to br=\r\ning it down into cellular consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evolution took a great leap f=\r\norward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We a=\r\nre now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we=\r\n prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about fou=\r\nr stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience c=\r\noncurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our cu=\r\nrrent species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but larg=\r\nely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Next is t=\r\nhe =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming =\r\nto birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a bein=\r\ng that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather tha=\r\nn mind-consciousness. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who w=\r\nill still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the M=\r\nind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge wi=\r\nth cellular consciousness. \n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is=\r\n the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within =\r\nthe subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=\r\n=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and =\r\nspirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; The great work of Sri Aurob=\r\nindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into the=\r\n cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consci=\r\nousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously b=\r\neing brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the momen=\r\nt when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.\n&gt; =\r\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resist=\r\nance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =\r\n=EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the wo=\r\nrld today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asur=\r\na of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so ou=\r\ntwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global events.=\r\n According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a tran=\r\nsformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and=\r\n so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly=\r\n, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through=\r\n Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in count=\r\nering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura m=\r\nay be influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n With the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete =\r\nhuman structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that=\r\n although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catast=\r\nrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world fo=\r\nr the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained,=\r\n carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by m=\r\neans other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually =\r\nbe absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Trut=\r\nh. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world t=\r\noday, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of ha=\r\nrmonization!\n&gt; \n&gt; When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother b=\r\nelieved that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it =\r\nwas quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transforma=\r\ntion was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of de=\r\nstruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD S=\r\nhe said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n&gt; \n&gt; This was a very i=\r\nnteresting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in t=\r\nhe world.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is B=\r\nhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Love Cricket?

Also, he need not be talking about somebody &quot;connec=\r\nted to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are co=\r\nnnections between all. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Si=\r\nster Nivedita, the foremost disciple of Swami\n Vivekananda and knew her wel=\r\nl when he still lived in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda, just a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aur=\r\nobindo some key knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and le=\r\narnt Sanskrit from M, who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel =\r\nof Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expa=\r\nnd his knowledge. Trilinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And=\r\n so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Coming back to the main point, the supermind estab=\r\nlished in the field of earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply b=\r\ne a maharshi paying some attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed=\r\n in the divine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish =\r\nhuge changes on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divin=\r\ne play to make some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in =\r\nthe play, he may focus a small part of\n his supermind on the affairs of ear=\r\nth and direct a few important souls to do some key work. Some important sou=\r\nls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) t=\r\no be born on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; You may then see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened b=\r\neings and realized beings born on earth to bring clarity in different aspec=\r\nts of spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get specific internal/external=\r\n guidance from the divine, based on what their part in the play is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that Aurobindo al=\r\nluded to is all around us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as false ego=\r\n in pretty much everybody. At the grossest level, he manifests as blatant l=\r\nies, wrong propaganda etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One should not tolerate this As=\r\nura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura or thos=\r\ne afflicted by him. When we\n encounter lies, we should fight and stand for =\r\ntruth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is nothing that needs t=\r\no be hated in this world. One should learn to do the job assigned to one by=\r\n Nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and with unc=\r\nonditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; says about changes coming in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I know very =\r\nlittle. But I was told that an age that is somewhat like the bygone ages wi=\r\nll be established on earth for a few hundred years in the coming decades. T=\r\nhe reason the Divine Mother appeared before Manish and asked him to spread =\r\nsimple homam procedures in the world was to prepare the grounds for that. M=\r\nanish also told me that all this is the play of a senior maharshi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ ---------\n --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Y=\r\nourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirit=\r\nuality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net=\r\n/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijaga=\r\nnnath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ---------\n --------- --------- --------- - =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Laxmi Narayan=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Sent: Sunday, June 21, 2009 6:50 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nDescent of the Supramenal Conscinousness&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hi, Some time bac=\r\nk I saw similar article and was intrigued by it.

I am posting it =\r\nhere for anyone interested.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Near the beginning of the 20th=\r\n century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, beg=\r\nan to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high stat=\r\nes of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evo=\r\nlution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Ear=\r\nth and that the time for this divine\n emergence into Earth life was now. He=\r\n spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown=\r\n due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this=\r\n =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Aurobindo was joi=\r\nned in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later bec=\r\name known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive c=\r\nellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties =\r\nwe face today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine =\r\nforce permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of co=\r\nnsciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into matter i=\r\ns called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards o=\r\nut of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has =\r\nreached a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in=\r\n his inner visions, he foresaw that we\n would soon be experiencing a descen=\r\nt of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=\r\n=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in=\r\n what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if =\r\nseldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even=\r\n if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality.=\r\n There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer =\r\nsenses seems to contradict it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized th=\r\nat humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reac=\r\nhed in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, bu=\r\nt is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species.=\r\n Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousne=\r\nss higher than the human rational mind, what\n may be termed the Supermind, =\r\nhas recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active the=\r\nre. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and l=\r\nater with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another lea=\r\np forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supe=\r\nrmind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we =\r\nwill soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =\r\n=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=\r\nssing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and me=\r\nrging with it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=\r\n=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influ=\r\nence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able t=\r\no merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than\n mind-consciousness. &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still i=\r\nnhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Ligh=\r\nt, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular=\r\n consciousness. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally, our ultimate goal as a species i=\r\ns the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within=\r\n the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=\r\n=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and =\r\nspirit would be fully realized upon Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The great work =\r\nof Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness d=\r\nown into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a un=\r\nified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simu=\r\nltaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiti=\r\nng the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation\n in collecti=\r\nve matter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is c=\r\norresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experi=\r\nence with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces=\r\n, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of =\r\nSuffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the fo=\r\nrces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of cur=\r\nrent global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has =\r\ngone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has retu=\r\nrned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on E=\r\narth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneli=\r\nng=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive =\r\ninner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see ho=\r\nw this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current\n po=\r\nlitical sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; With the descent of this new vibratory con=\r\nsciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. Howeve=\r\nr, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormous they=\r\n would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically er=\r\nases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet,=\r\n the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which cou=\r\nld overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and viole=\r\nnce. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations =\r\nof Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with=\r\n all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have experie=\r\nnced if not for this power of harmonization!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When does all=\r\n this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage wa=\r\ns set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent.\n The Mother=\r\n said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and =\r\nthat it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough t=\r\nhis minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 wou=\r\nld be a turning point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This was a very interesting read an=\r\nd matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of conscio=\r\nusness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Cricket on you=\r\nr mind?
