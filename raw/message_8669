What you are getting today is the frui=\r\nt of your actions in the past, from yesterday or from one year back or from=\r\n a decade back or from last life or from 10 lives back.\n=A0\nImagine a big p=\r\nipe containing many balls. You are throwing balls into the pipe and balls c=\r\nome out. Balls don&#39;t necessarily come out in the same order in which you th=\r\nrow them in. Also, when you throw a big and heavy enough ball into the pipe=\r\n, it may result in some re-arrangement of balls already in the pipeline. Si=\r\nmilarly, big karmas (good or bad) done now may result in re-arrangement of =\r\nthe karma pipeline.\n=A0\nIf the pipe has only good balls, only good balls co=\r\nme out. If the pipe has only bad balls, only bad balls come out. If it has =\r\nboth, any may come out. If a bad ball comes out as soon as you throw a good=\r\n ball in, it does not mean the ball you threw just now was a bad ball. It m=\r\neans the good ball you threw will take some time to come. Moreover, it was =\r\nYOU who threw the bad ball that just came out, in the past.\n=A0\nA ritual do=\r\nne with a negative attitude for bad purposes can be a bad karma. However, e=\r\nven if one did a good ritual, still that good karma need not give results i=\r\nmmediately. It depends on how dense one&#39;s karma pipeline is. If a pipe has =\r\nvery small balls and a big heavy ball is thrown into it very fast, it may p=\r\nush through previous existing balls and come out quickly. But, if a pipe ha=\r\ns a lot of heavy balls, your currently thrown ball will be stuck behind the=\r\nm.
