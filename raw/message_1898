Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I mentioned my guru Dr Manish P=\r\nandit and the command of the Divine Mother when she appeared before him in =\r\nMarch 2006 regarding teaching simple homam procedures to people. I want to =\r\nmention a small story about his past. This is an incident that had a profou=\r\nnd impact on his spiritual evolution in this life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Manish was young, he was not exactly spiritual. His mother was=\r\n highly spiritual and religious and he naturally knew some prayers, but did=\r\n not do much spiritual sadhana. He would race motor bikes outside Pune with=\r\n friends and lead a licentious lifestyle.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When in college, he got bad=\r\n marks in one subject in exams and wanted to go to college oneday to fight =\r\nand increase his marks. When he was about to leave house, a teenaged Brahmi=\r\nn in orange clothes and having good tejas in face came to his house. He ask=\r\ned Manish where he was going. He then said, &quot;do not go out today. Going out=\r\n today will ruin your life. Just stay home and think of god. I will make su=\r\nre that your marks with be increased. Leave it to me and don&#39;t worry about =\r\nit.&quot; He then strongly suggested to Manish that he should wear a diamond rin=\r\ng on his right hand index finger and it would change his life. Interestingl=\r\ny, Manish has Meena lagna and Venus is a malefic for him. Though Venus is i=\r\nn Thula (8th house) with 3 other planets, people would normally avoid diamo=\r\nnd in this case to be safe. Moreover, most people do not put diamond on ind=\r\nex finger, which is associated with Jupiter, an enemy of Venus. So nobody w=\r\nould normally recommend him diamond, that too on the index finger. This is =\r\nan unusual suggestion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That brahmin boy then asked Manish to give him=\r\n tea or sugar with his hand and said that this act would do him good. There=\r\n was no tea at their house and Manish fed him some sugar. He ate it and lef=\r\nt after saying, &quot;when you come to Shirdi next, come to so and so room in so=\r\n and so place. That is where I live. Also, I need to give a glass of water =\r\nto your mother. Please come to Shirdi with her.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Barely a minute after he left, Manish had a question and ran to the d=\r\noor of his compound wall. He found no person in orange clothes walking on t=\r\nhe road. He asked the persons standing outside whether they could tell him =\r\nin which direction a person who came out of the house in orange clothes had=\r\n gone. They said nobody went in or came out of the house in an hour. Manish=\r\n went around the area to check if anybody saw a young Brahmin in orange clo=\r\nthes. Nobody in that area saw anyone like that. So this seemed like a mirac=\r\nle. Manish was puzzled.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Later his marks in the exam were automaticall=\r\ny increased and his problem was solved by itself, without his doing anythin=\r\ng.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; A few months later, they went to Shirdi.=\r\n They wanted to meet that young Brahmin. They went to the place he mentione=\r\nd. Manish&#39;s mother was waiting downstairs and they went upstairs to the roo=\r\nm number mentioned by him to find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody in th=\r\nat room and there was a life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wall. Whe=\r\nn they asked, they were told that that room had always been empty and only =\r\nthe picture was there. Nobody ever lived in that room.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When they came=\r\n downstairs, Manish&#39;s mother told them that she suddenly became very thirst=\r\ny and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink some water from his=\r\n hands and left in a hurry.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; After this, Man=\r\nish did buy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine visitor and wore it o=\r\nn his right hand index finger. He still wears it. Perhaps wearing a strong =\r\nmoksha trikona lord&#39;s gem on the moksha finger (the four fingers represent =\r\nthe 4 purusharthas and thumb shows self) strengthens moksha trikona. Though=\r\n this was an unusual (and risky) suggestion, perhaps this is very appropria=\r\nte in this case for spiritual progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Soon after this, another mira=\r\nculous incident involving a deity happened, which I do not want to mention =\r\nnow. Then started his spiritual transformation. Manish became very serious =\r\nabout spiritual sadhana after that and started spending many hours everyday=\r\n in spiritual sadhana. He had visions - internal and external - of many dei=\r\nties and special beings, including Shirdi Sai Baba too, and had many experi=\r\nences. His life changed completely after this experience.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Today many people do not believe that miraculous and magical=\r\n things can happen. When they hear unbelievable stories about saints like S=\r\nai Baba, Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Mahava=\r\ntar Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds trained in rational th=\r\ninking assume that the stories are made up by someone. Healthy skepticism i=\r\ns justified because many fake people are there today, who abuse people&#39;s fa=\r\nith. However, absolute cynicism is wrong. Such things are possible.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nut one word on miracles and siddhis. Miracles and siddhis are secondary to =\r\nself-realization. The important thing is to do spiritual sadhana, realize s=\r\nelf, and live as a liberated person (jeevanmukta) continuing to discharge t=\r\nhe job assigned to one by Nature, with an equanimous mind and neither attra=\r\nction nor repulsion to anything. Nature assigns different jobs to different=\r\n persons. Personalities like Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi, Raghavendra Swami, =\r\nAurobindo, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Cha=\r\nitanya Mahaprabhu, Ramanujacharya, Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did diffe=\r\nrent jobs on this earth, but what is common between them is that they compl=\r\netely overcame their limited personalities, became realized and then went o=\r\nn to fulfill the tasks given to them by the Power that runs the universe, w=\r\nith an equanimous mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.com=\r\ncast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
