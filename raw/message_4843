With the\nvirtue of knowledge gained from your previous posts, which essentially said\nthat any sattvic material can be offered to gods in the homam fire, i took a\npiece of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.\n\nThis is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a great\nspritual experience. i felt that i gained a lot of positive energy from the\nhomam. i strongly felt that my offerings reached mahalakshmi devi directly\nthrough the homakunda. Such is the impact of your teaching about\nHomam-significance on me! Thank you, sir.\n\nHowever, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest&#39;s action during\nhomam. When the homam fire was weakened and about to extinguish, the priest\nhas blown air through his mouth directly into teh homa kundam to increase\nthe intensity of flames in it :(\ni have heard from my grandmother that blowing air through mouth into a\nflame/fire is equal to spitting on it and its a very unholy act. Since then\ni desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.\n\nI wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that my &#39;fire\nextinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledge may not be relevant\nfor the homam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed to\nbe well experienced in performing homams.\n\nPLease comment something about this and enlighten us with your knowledge so\nthat i will be careful from next time.
