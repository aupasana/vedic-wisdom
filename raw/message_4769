These writings are free-wheeling in nature and not well-organized.\n \nOn 2010 Guru Pournima, my Jyotish students in Boston gifted me a book they created out of some of those writings. They organized the writings topically in the form of a book.\n \nA lot of topics that may be of interest to spiritual seekers are addressed in one place, in a *somewhat* organized form. A lot of questions from members were answered in simple language and several subtle issues were addressed.\n \nThe book in PDF format is only 1.5 MB in size and is FREE to download. If you are interested, please go to:\n \nhttp://tinyurl.com/vedicwisdom (tinyurl dot com slash vedicwisdom)\n \nIf you want the full link, use the following:\n \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/articles/vedic_wisdom_1.pdf\n \nIf you find the book useful, please feel free to benefit from it and pass the word around. Otherwise, as I always say, kindly ignore.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
