It=\r\n includes offerings to Vedic deities \n&gt; such as Prajapati, Indra, Soma etc,=\r\n but explains it in a way that \n&gt; open-minded non-Hindus can rationalize an=\r\nd relate internally. It allows \n&gt; non-Hindus to incorporate their faith and=\r\n sacred chants of their faith \n&gt; into a fire ritual procedure that is essen=\r\ntially taken from Hinduism. \n&gt; Please go to:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/fire\n&gt; \n&gt; Please feel free to send suggestions and comments to me at =\r\n\n&gt; pvr108@... This is the first attempt and can evolve over time. \n&gt; The go=\r\nal is to enable as many people as possible to approach the divine \n&gt; via th=\r\ne sacred medium of fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; A few months back, M=\r\nanish sat next to an American lady in a flight. His \n&gt; intuition told him t=\r\no tell her a few things. He told her a few things \n&gt; that would happen in t=\r\nhe next few months. He told her she MUST do a fire \n&gt; ritual regularly to o=\r\nvercome some serious problems in her life. He also \n&gt; gave her his email ad=\r\ndress. She told me later that she thought he was \n&gt; &quot;insane&quot; to talk to a s=\r\ntranger like that. Later, when some specific \n&gt; things happened as told by =\r\nManish, some to the day, she developed trust \n&gt; in Manish (Manish told me h=\r\ne was just acting on his intuition withought \n&gt; knowing why). She emailed h=\r\nim and later talked to him. Manish \n&gt; re-iterated to her that she MUST do f=\r\nire ritual to overcome current and \n&gt; future problems and he put her in tou=\r\nch with me.\n&gt; \n&gt; I gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but it was Greek=\r\n and Latin to \n&gt; her. She is a practicing Christian and does not know much =\r\nabout \n&gt; Hinduism. She was totally lost in in the manual and could not put =\r\nit to \n&gt; use, though she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spent an hour=\r\n on \n&gt; phone with her and explained a simple procedure that she could relat=\r\ne \n&gt; to, remember and do. She did homam a few times and found it to have a =\r\n\n&gt; soothing and calming influence, though she was very nervous, afraid and =\r\n\n&gt; tense when she started out. Another friend of her, also a practicing \n&gt; =\r\nChristian with open-mindedness to other practices, was also interested \n&gt; i=\r\nn trying fire ritual and asked for info. This made me think of writing \n&gt; a=\r\n manual suitable for a group currenly left out.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Coincidentally, Manish, I and a few other friends had a discussion a \n&gt; =\r\nmonth back about non-Hindus performing fire ritual. Though some sincere \n&gt; =\r\nand learned friends had reservations, I opined: &quot;If one cannot relate to \n&gt;=\r\n a Sanskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin or Greek or Arabic chant, I \n=\r\n&gt; see no problem in offering that to god. I do not really think Agni will \n=\r\n&gt; say &quot;I do not know that god and cannot carry the offering to that god&quot;. \n=\r\n&gt; I do not see gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu gods and see all of them \n&gt;=\r\n as personifications of various natures and qualities inherent to us. I \n&gt; =\r\nreckon that Agni is capable of translating. Thus, I am not averse to \n&gt; ena=\r\nbling non-Hindus to do a fire ritual by essentially retaining the \n&gt; basic =\r\nhomam structure, but replacing the main mantra of pradhaana homam \n&gt; sectio=\r\nn with a non-Sanskrit sacred chant.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I had copied Sri Robert Svoboda (=\r\nauthor of Aghora series on Vimalananda) \n&gt; on that discussion. He put his v=\r\niew on record in a private email: &quot;Just \n&gt; for the record, my view is very =\r\nsimilar to yours =E2=80&quot; the important thing \n&gt; is to create a relationship=\r\n with fire, and via the fire, with Brahman, \n&gt; Nirguna or Saguna =E2=80&quot; Sa=\r\nguna being much easier. There are many devatas in \n&gt; the world, and I too d=\r\no not really think Agni will say &quot;I do not know \n&gt; that god and cannot carr=\r\ny the offering to that god&quot;. I too do not see \n&gt; gods as Hindu gods and non=\r\n-Hindu gods; if Agni can be purohit for one, \n&gt; he can be purohit for any.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If you know of some people who are not well-=\r\nversed in Hinduism but are \n&gt; open-minded to try new spiritual practices, p=\r\nlease feel free to point \n&gt; them to this document.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do=\r\n It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;          =\r\n          http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
