Posturing seems t=\r\no come with\n&gt; &gt; the territory to some extent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rishis were very open-mi=\r\nnded and had a perfectly integrated \nknowledge of all \n&gt; aspects of the Unl=\r\nimited (Brahman, non-dual Supreme Self) as well \nthe \n&gt; Limited (Maya, i.e.=\r\n manifestation of Brahman as the dual world). \nThey \n&gt; understood Brahman a=\r\ns well as Maya and had mastery over both \ndomains.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are now in Kali =\r\nYuga and it is inevitable that biases, narrow-\nmindedness \n&gt; and posturing =\r\nenter the mindsets of many learned.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as one is living the dual =\r\nreality, the duality enters all \nthings. \n&gt; Polarization is the very nature=\r\n of duality. Good and bad, \nbeautiful and \n&gt; ugly, powerful and weak, learn=\r\ned and ignorant - all these \nseemingly opposite \n&gt; polarities are a creatio=\r\nn of the duality. Even when it comes to \nspiritual \n&gt; progress and reaching=\r\n god, there are polarities. There are \nseemingly \n&gt; opposing paths. One scr=\r\nipture says one thing and another says the \nopposite. \n&gt; One may take one w=\r\nord of one scripture as the ultimate Truth and \nanother may \n&gt; take another=\r\n word of another scripture as the ultimate Truth. \nUnfortunately, \n&gt; all th=\r\ne knowledge we get from books, gurus etc is still in the \ndomain of \n&gt; dual=\r\nity and not free from the phenomenon of opposites.\n&gt; \n&gt; The only solution i=\r\ns to be firmly established in the non-dual \nSupreme Self \n&gt; at all times an=\r\nd see each thing in the dual world for what it \ntruly is, i.e. \n&gt; yet anoth=\r\ner manifestation of the very same non-dual Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such a state was achi=\r\neved by so many rishis in the past. In this \nage, \n&gt; however, such rishis a=\r\nre so rare. No wonder there is too much \nposturing and \n&gt; disagreement.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your passage on Kaali bhakta was interesting a=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; it points to a different outcome. Divine intoxication\n&gt; &gt; versus no e=\r\nxperience and no mind. Perhaps both\n&gt; &gt; are experienced at some point in th=\r\ne path?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, there were (and are) those who experienced both. However,=\r\n \nthere are \n&gt; some who reject one of the two in favor of the other. Actual=\r\nly, \none would be \n&gt; most fortunate to reach either state.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you look=\r\n at the &quot;star in the sky&quot; analogy I gave earlier, you \nwill see \n&gt; differen=\r\nt goals in Dwaita, Visishtadwaita and Adwaita paths. Some \npeople \n&gt; follow=\r\ning one approach do not entertain notions corresponding to \nanother \n&gt; appr=\r\noach. However, some take them as diferent stops in the same \njourney.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I just want to make one more comment that is not d=\r\nirectly relevant \nto the \n&gt; discussion, but touches it on the periphery. Ma=\r\ny those who find my \nviews and \n&gt; analogies silly kindly ignore me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ha=\r\nrd-core Adwaitis are essentially Vedantis and jnaana (gyaana) \nyogis. This =\r\n\n&gt; path is appropriate for someone who is already quite evolved. If \none is=\r\n too \n&gt; deeply sunk in the delusion of this dual world appearance, it is a =\r\n\ndifficult \n&gt; path. It is like telling someone who wants to reach the sky, =\r\n&quot;you \nare \n&gt; already in the sky. Just realize it and be done&quot;. The poor guy=\r\n is \nvery much \n&gt; on earth and can by no means &quot;realize&quot; that he is &quot;alread=\r\ny in the \nsky&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is rooted on earth and wants to reach the sky =\r\nneeds to \nengage in \n&gt; some actions that elevate one and prepare one for re=\r\naching the \nsky. Various \n&gt; tantras and rituals help in that. These are mor=\r\ne appropriate for \nmany people \n&gt; than the path of Adwaita, jnaana yoga and=\r\n contemplation.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, if one gets too involved in building tall str=\r\nuctures on \nearth, one \n&gt; may find it interesting and keep on building tall=\r\ner and taller \nstructures \n&gt; and forget the ultimate goal of finally reachi=\r\nng the sky. Building \ntall \n&gt; structures will help one rise from earth, but=\r\n not help one reach \nthe sky. \n&gt; However tall a building one builds, it wil=\r\nl still not take one to \nthe sky. \n&gt; Reaching the sky is not about building=\r\n tall buildings. Books and \ngurus can \n&gt; teach one how to build tall struct=\r\nures, but the final leap into \nthe sky is \n&gt; untaught.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the analogy =\r\nI am talking about here, Adwaitic self-realization \nis akin to \n&gt; reaching =\r\nthe sky. Normal state of a person is akin to being on \nearth. \n&gt; Building t=\r\nall structures on earth is akin to engaging in various \ntantras, \n&gt; rituals=\r\n and practices to progress spiritually.\n&gt; \n&gt; By engaging in more and more p=\r\nractices, one may experience more \nand more \n&gt; things and get some siddhis =\r\netc. This is akin to building tall \nstructures \n&gt; and climbing them. Even a=\r\ns one builds tall structures, the final \ngoal of \n&gt; reaching the sky should=\r\n be at the back of one&#39;s mind. Otherwise, \none can get \n&gt; lost in the pract=\r\nices and not reach the final goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no fool-proof approach to =\r\nhave an Adwaitic self-\nrealization. Even \n&gt; as one engages in various pract=\r\nices, one should keep the final \ngoal at the \n&gt; back of mind.

He was a \nprolific teacher\n&gt; &gt;&gt; who taught Adwaita. M=\r\nany scholars at that time did not like \nBuddha. At a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; time when Vedic s=\r\ncholars forgot the essence of Veda and hung on \nto words\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without an un=\r\nderstanding of their true meaning, Buddha taught \nthe essence\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nVeda. This was unpalatable to many Hindu scholars and they \ndismissed him.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When Adi Shankara taught similar things, they criticized Adi \nShankara=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; saying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that he was teaching &quot;concealed Buddhism&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ther=\r\ne are verses in &quot;Padma Purana&quot; (6.236.6-11) in which Shiva \ntells\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Parv=\r\nati\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that He will be born in Kali yuga as a Brahmin and teach the \nscie=\r\nnce of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; falsehood of the illusory appearance of this world. He=\r\n says \nthat he will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; explain the misunderstood words of scriptures and =\r\nteach the \nformless\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Brahman.

Whether a jnaani \nreaches it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; through contemplation or a Kaali bha=\r\nkta reaches it through \noneness with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kaali, the state is the same.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But some Hindu masters like oneness with a form  more than the \nabov=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; state\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of oneness with the Formless Reality. When one&#39;s ego comp=\r\nletely \nmelts and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; obtains oneness with a deity, mind is very much acti=\r\nve and \nexperiences\n&gt; &gt;&gt; diverse objects as extensions of that deity.

In fact, a scripture \nmentions Shiva\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ntelling Parvati that he will be born in Kali Yuga as Adi \nShankara to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; revive\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Advaitism and to refine the teachings of Buddha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I personally consider &quot;Yoga Vaa=\r\nsishtham&quot; to be the highest \ntreatise on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Advaitism. I have read man=\r\ny authors, but none matches the \nbrilliance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasishtha. A=\r\nfter all, he is a maharshi and one of the \nsaptarshis and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; show.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama (a=\r\nn incarnation of Lord \nVishnu)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; self-knowledge in grea=\r\nt detail, in the presence of many gods \nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rishis\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; includin=\r\ng Maharshi Vishwamitra. These teachings were later \ntaught by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahar=\r\nshi Vaalmiki (author of Ramayana) to Maharshi \nBharadwaja. Yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vaa=\r\nsishtham is thus a detailed account of Maharshi \nVasishtha&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachi=\r\nngs\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; captured by Maharshi Vaalmiki.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The commentary b=\r\ny Swami Venkatesananda is quite an inspired \none and I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n very strongly recommend it to everyone deeply interested in \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; h=\r\nighest\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu Advaitic philosophy. You can find it on amazon.com.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; men=\r\ntioned above, there is a beautiful \nnarrative\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maharsh=\r\ni Vasishtha describes to Lord Rama his meeting with \nLord Shiva.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Lo=\r\nrd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Shiva teaches Vasishtha how to worship Him. He says, &quot;there \nare=\r\n many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ways\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; worship me that are used by many fool=\r\nish people who desire \nvarious\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; They may even get va=\r\nrious things worshipping me in those ways\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prescribed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some scriptures. But those are inferior methods of worship. \nLet me\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tell\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the highest worship that is most dear to me.=\r\n It is how a \nself-realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; person worships me.&quot; He then describes =\r\nthe method so \nbeautifully.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is an absolutely beautiful a=\r\nccount. I can say that Shiva&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasisht=\r\nha on the best way to worship Him are the essence of \nVedas, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; es=\r\nsence of BhagavadGeetha and the essence of the highest \nHindu\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; philo=\r\nsophy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One interested in self-realization and moksha must read \nShi=\r\nva&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and keep them at the back of their mind alwa=\r\nys.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t mean to be disrespectful to various aagamas and=\r\n \nrituals\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prescribed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in various scriptures. They all serve =\r\na purpose. But, if one \nviews\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moksha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (complete self-realiza=\r\ntion and the liberation that comes \nwith it) as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; highest=\r\n goal, one cannot ignore the worship recommended by \nShiva\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Himself\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasishtha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hinduism is indeed a &quot;collection of philosophies&quot;. However, \nthat ma=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; misleading statement. It may suggest some inherent s=\r\nelf-\ncontradiction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; would be unfair.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; T=\r\nhough different ripples of an ocean look different, the \nunderlying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n ocean\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same. Similarly, the teachings of rishis form=\r\n a single \ncoherent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophy (ocean) that appears as many philoso=\r\nphies \n(ripples) on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; surface.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; After all, Rigveda=\r\n says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, \nwhich\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; means\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Tru=\r\nth is One, but the learned call differently&quot;. Though \nHinduism had\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nno\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; single founder&quot; or ANY founder for that matter, all =\r\nrishis \ntapped the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Single Source of Knowledge&quot; (the S=\r\nelf, known variously as \nBrahman,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Shiva,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narayana, Krishna,=\r\n Allah, Buddha etc) and hence there is a \nconsistency\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; th=\r\neir understanding.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, not everyone can dive dee=\r\np into the ocean of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; self-knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Some are more comfortab=\r\nle floating on the surface (which is \nfun too).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachin=\r\ngs of rishis have something for everyone. This gives \nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; appearanc=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that rishis taught different contradicting philosophies. In \nfact=\r\n, they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nLike the gentleman below mentioned, there are three main \nviews\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reg=\r\narding\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relationship between individual soul and the sup=\r\nreme soul. \nHowever,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; instead\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of viewing them as competing t=\r\nheories, one can also view \nthem as steps\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same path.=\r\n I want to share with all an *analogy* given \nby my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; master Dr Manish Pandit:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Imagine God to be a bright star=\r\n in the sky. When you see \nfrom a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; distance,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; star seems tiny=\r\n and you conclude that there is only one God. \nIf you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; start\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n moving towards God, you realize as you get closer that the \nstar is in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reality a huge diamond with 330 million faces. Each face is \nseveral\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; miles\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; long and wide and has various attributes (gunas). One =\r\nface \nmay be red\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hot and another may be blue and cold e=\r\ntc. So, as you get \ncloser to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diamond, you have to pick one fac=\r\ne to get close to.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, when you get too close to a face, t=\r\nhe whole world will \nseem to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attributes of=\r\n that face. For example, if you get too close \nto a face\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cold and blue, then the whole world will feel cold and blue \n=\r\nto you. In\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; words, the God you are getting close to is=\r\n the Supreme god \nof the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fills the entire=\r\n world as you experience it. You think that \nthe whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; is filled with his energy. One who gets close to a blue face \nsees the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world as blue. One who gets close to a yellow face sees=\r\n the \nwhole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yellow. Similarly, a worshippe=\r\nr of Shiva may get close to \nHim and see\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Shiva\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in all deiti=\r\nes and all beings. A worshipper of Narayana may \nget close\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and see Narayana in all beings.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No wonder on=\r\ne scripture says that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva etc \nall gods\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; came\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; from Narayana, while another scripture says the same about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maha=\r\nganapathi,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; while another scripture says the same thing about Shiva;=\r\n and \nso on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Reaching close to the deity is the ultimate go=\r\nal in sadhana \nfor one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; adhering\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to Dwaita siddhanta (dualit=\r\ny). For them, getting close to \nishta\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; devata,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; securing a pl=\r\nace near the feet and seeing the entire world as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; emanating\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nfrom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that deity is the highest goal. All gods and entire creation \n=\r\nare\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; extensions\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of that deity.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For some, the=\r\nre is a next stage: As you get closer and \ncloser to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; face\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; you picked, you finally merge with it! This is the ultimate \ngoal in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for one adhering to Visishtaadwaita. You create a vacc=\r\num \nwithin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; completing killing ego-consc=\r\niousness and the deity in \nquestion fills\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vacuum.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To Advaitis, this communion with a Saguna (&quot;with \nattributes&quot;) f=\r\norm of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; God\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not the final goal. The final goal is=\r\n to break through the \nface and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jump\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; into the inside of the=\r\n diamond. As you break through any \nface of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diamond\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and=\r\n jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer \nperceive the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n faces\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the diamond or the world outside. There are no longer any=\r\n \nobjects\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attributes. There is no I-ness or It-ness or e=\r\nxperience. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencer,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experienced and experience all =\r\nmerge into one. The same \nthing happens\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; irrespective of from which =\r\nface the person jumped into the \ninterior of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diamond. W=\r\nhether one enters a nirvikalpa samadhi through \noneness with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Naraya=\r\nna or through oneness with Sadashiva or through \noneness with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahag=\r\nanapathi, the state reached is identical. The path only \nis\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; differe=\r\nnt.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Some people can jump into the interior of this diamond =\r\n\nwithout first\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing oneness with a face. Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa&#39;s \nAdwaitic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Totapuri did not believe in any form=\r\n and worshipped only the \nFormless\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Reality. He would directly jump =\r\ninto the interior of the \ndiamond in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; analogy. However,=\r\n his disciple Ramakrishna Paramahamsa chose \nto first\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n oneness with Mother Kaali and then reach the interior of the \ndiamond\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jumping from the face of the diamond representing Kaali. \nBo=\r\nth are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; valid\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; paths.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have written too much tonight. Let me end here now.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n---\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): \nhttp:=\r\n//vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): \nhtt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \nht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n---\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
