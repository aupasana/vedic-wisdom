Anyone who has ever tried even a minutest fraction \nof \n&gt; sadhana not to gain a better happy life but to get that one small \n&gt; fraction of an inch closer to God will know the millions of \ntroubles \n&gt; and frustation that come in the path. It was on one such moment \nwhen \n&gt; I came across this writing and felt humbled. Ganapati Muni was \nknown \n&gt; as a siddha who had done terrific, i repeat terrific amount of \n&gt; penances, even before he met Sri Ramana Maharishi. If such a man \n&gt; could be troubled by doubts and frustation, what to speak of us \n&gt; ordinary men whos minds are overcrowded with multiple weaknessess. \n&gt; Also the followinf conversation shows how a real understanding of \n&gt; the shastra is possible ONLY for a man who is that spiritually \n&gt; elevated. Like Lahiri Mahasaya used to say to his disciples, only a \n&gt; true yogi will understand the spriptures. Others will only get a \n&gt; incomplete surface view of things. And based on our incomplete \n&gt; inefficient understand of shatras we keep fighting with others \n&gt; claiming our path our tradition our understading is the only true \n&gt; one.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ganapati Muni had met the yet-to-be-called Sri Ramana on the \n&gt; southern slopes of Arunachala. One day he was assailed by pains, \n&gt; troubles, doubts. He remembered that the young Swami was on the \n&gt; hill, and at midday, a little after noon, he climbed and found him \n&gt; sitting outside Virupaksha cave, alone. He prostrated and \nsaid, &quot;All \n&gt; the scriptures that have to be read, I have read. All the mantras \n&gt; and japa that have to be done, I have done. Still I have no peace. \n&gt; Please save me.&quot; The young Swami took a little time. For at least \n&gt; fifteen minutes he silently gazed at him. Then in Tamil, he spoke. \n&gt; The English translation is simple:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If one watches whence the notion &#39;I&#39; arises, the mind is absorbed \n&gt; in That; that is tapas. When you recite a mantra, watch where the \n&gt; sound is coming from, within you; when you sing a song or prayer, \n&gt; watch where it is emanating from: your Heart. Put your attention on \n&gt; That. That is tyaga, that is TAPASYA, that is all.&quot; \n&gt; All his doubts and delusions were washed away that day. &quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n                           \n\n\n  &quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n Share files, take polls, and make new friends - all under one roof.
