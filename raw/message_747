THE IMPORTANT \nthing here is that He only =\r\nindicated me his way of recitation, he \nNEVER asked me to do the same way o=\r\nr change the conventional way.\n\nI need to give one background. for many yea=\r\nrs i wonder about \n*Mahatmya* in many fo our spiriual books. take for insta=\r\nnce Gita. it \nis indicated that Gita Mahatmya must be recited whenever Gita=\r\n is \nrecited and without that it&#39;ll not be complete. Ganapati \nAtharvashirs=\r\nh also has added protion of the same.

If you don&#39;t do this then \nyour ef=\r\nforts are wasted but if you do this along with the main thing \nthen it&#39;ll b=\r\nring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoyment of Swarga and even \nliberation.\n\nI am=\r\n at loss to understand these extra things. it seems to me that \nit is a Anc=\r\nient days Marketing gimmick added NOT by the original \nauthor but some othe=\r\nrs at later stages. it is quite possible that it \nwas introduced everywhere=\r\n out of good intentions to make people \nrecite it and get benefited.

All h=\r\ne told me at that time was that Narayan really needed to \ndo homam everyday=\r\n and that I should teach a simple procedure to him.\n&gt; \n&gt; I experimented wit=\r\nh homam, started doing occasionally and liked \nit. I started doing a quick =\r\nprocedure everyday. After doing it daily \nfor a few months, I finally got d=\r\nown to the original task - teaching \nNarayan. I chose to write a detailed m=\r\nanual for that purpose. In \nhindsight, I made the correct choice, as many p=\r\neople in addition to \nNarayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I =\r\nand many other \npeople have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far a=\r\ns my mind \nconcerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time for \nN=\r\narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started \nwith him=\r\n. What a fortunate soul..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; It was probably for a reason that=\r\n Manish did not tell me at the \nonset itself what the Mother asked him to d=\r\no. My attitude and mental \nstate would&#39;ve been different while working on t=\r\nhe manual. I \nwould&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because th=\r\ne only \nthing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrive=\r\nd \nat the correct balance and also wrote it down without many \npretensions.=\r\n The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I \nreally benefited from=\r\n the exercise. If I had known the full story, \nit would have had more rajas=\r\n given my mental state then and I would \nnot have had made the same progres=\r\ns I made, while preparing myself \nto teach homam to Narayan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish to=\r\nld me the full story only when I was better prepared to \nhandle the informa=\r\ntion and, of course, I added it to the preface of \nthe manual as asked by h=\r\nim then.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary inf=\r\normation that \ncan wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole \nday=\r\n meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The \ninspiration=\r\n came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. \nWhen I told Manis=\r\nh, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I \nstarted before sunrise and w=\r\nent on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 \nbreaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noo=\r\nn for bath and a small lunch \nand another 10 min break for another bath at =\r\ndusk, I was basically \nsitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatr=\r\ni mantra. It was \na very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the=\r\n end of the \nday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed on the next day that the previous day was =\r\nAkshaya \nTriteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very \nauspi=\r\ncious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on that day \nis 1000 ti=\r\nmes more powerful than on other days. Though I had not \nnoticed it before, =\r\nI picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was \nexcited. When I mentioned th=\r\nis to Manish with excitement a few days \nlater, he said calmly &quot;I knew it e=\r\narlier itself. But I did not tell \nyou because knowing it would&#39;ve distract=\r\ned you. You would have been \nexcited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Tritee=\r\nya and that excitement \nwould&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more =\r\nrajas into the \nsadhana.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;pro=\r\nud&quot; of doing such a \nsadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited t=\r\nhe mental \nfocus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhan=\r\na on \na powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement, \nbrou=\r\nght in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. \nEgo is a ve=\r\nry dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent \nprogress, it can sudde=\r\nnly return and pull one down! After hearing \nManish&#39;s words, I introspected=\r\n and found that my ego was still alive \nand kicking and that he was wise no=\r\nt to feed it with more delicious \nfood!\n&gt; \n&gt; Lucky are those who have a gur=\r\nu who can succintly tell them what \nis useful rather than what sounds good.=\r\n Lucky are those who have a \nguru (or someone else) who can go to the heart=\r\n of their problem and \npoint it out, so that they can weed it out through f=\r\nurther \nintrospection and weaken it through conscious effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata chandi \nhomam in =\r\nearly 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha \n(a perfected/adv=\r\nanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the \nname of one of the sap=\r\ntarshis and said that I very close to him and \nthat I would do some importa=\r\nnt work in this birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned t=\r\nhis to him. He \nimmediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need=\r\n one more \nidentity? Your ego is already strong with the identity \nof &#39;Nara=\r\nsimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the \nastrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the=\r\n engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual \nseeker&#39; etc. It will take great effo=\r\nrt to overcome those identities \nand find True Self. As if that challenge i=\r\ns not sufficient, do you \nreally need yet another new identity to feed your=\r\n ego further? See, \nwhat he said may very well be correct. But it is not us=\r\neful for your \nprogress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; How t=\r\nrue and wise!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a l=\r\nean and weak dog and \nget all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego o=\r\nr the sense \nof &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets =\r\nall \nthe energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and \n=\r\nfeed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain \nego a=\r\nnd increase detachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish has a unique way of looking at things a=\r\nnd some simple \npoints he made brought so much clarity to my thinking and s=\r\nped up my \nspiritual evolution in this life. Even without giving any specif=\r\nic \nmantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of \nknowled=\r\nge in my heart. He would say the lamp and light were already \nthere and he =\r\nsimply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blocking the \nlight. That is wha=\r\nt a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick \nlayer of dirt (conditioning=\r\n by gunas) on the glass (ego) that \nencloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in=\r\n the heart. Sometimes, we may \nbe too caught up to notice that dirt ourselv=\r\nes..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpf=\r\nul. But one \nshould also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an=\r\n \nongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does \nnot ta=\r\nke just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a \nlong time. =\r\nAs Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the \npath and not worry a=\r\nbout the progress and the distance left. One who \nkeeps walking without dis=\r\ntractions will reach the goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point I want to emphasize is that t=\r\nhe external rituals (like \nhomam) and the internal introspection (to change=\r\n attitude) should go \nhand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy be=\r\ntween them and \nthey will start to work together very effectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntar=\r\npana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@=\r\n gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything similar to it), \nit\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n happens with all beginners and its only practice which makes one\n&gt; &gt; perfe=\r\nct.

In Kaliyuga, along \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Homa, surrende=\r\nring to ones chosen deity is the best path for \nmost. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me shar=\r\ne one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom \nI also\n&gt; &gt; consider m=\r\ny Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata \nChandi\n&gt; &gt; Homa) to le=\r\narn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really \njoking!\n&gt; &gt; When I got bac=\r\nk to the US, he called me again and reminded me. \nIt then\n&gt; &gt; occured to me=\r\n he was really being serious. So, I started \nsearching on\n&gt; &gt; the net and I=\r\n found a really flimsy document, but nevertheless I \ntook\n&gt; &gt; it up and per=\r\nformed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then\n&gt; &gt; reminded me of the b=\r\nook he gifted me, but even in that it was \nentirely\n&gt; &gt; in Samskrit and ill=\r\niterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish \nbetween\n&gt; &gt; an instruction and s=\r\nloka :). Around this time, Narasimha \noccasionally\n&gt; &gt; performed a longer v=\r\nersion of the homam and I particpated in it, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; never could grasp it.=\r\n I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which \nhe\n&gt; &gt; did, but still it did no=\r\nt get through my really dense brains :). \nI\n&gt; &gt; felt really helpless, but t=\r\nhe stars were such that I never gave \nup,\n&gt; &gt; instead I made a sincere pray=\r\ner to Lord Ganesha, that If he \nreally\n&gt; &gt; intends that I perform the homa,=\r\n then he should kindly show me \nthe\n&gt; &gt; way. In around two weeks time, Nara=\r\nsimha told me that he has \ndecided\n&gt; &gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddha=\r\nti of the homa. I just \ncouldnt\n&gt; &gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephan=\r\nt-headed omnipotent for \nhis\n&gt; &gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and =\r\nI am still at it taking\n&gt; &gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for \nhelping\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; me progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it n=\r\no matter what. \nWe\n&gt; &gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody go=\r\nt perfect \nthe very\n&gt; &gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his=\r\n previous \nlives.\n&gt; &gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have f=\r\nuture \nlives ...\n&gt; &gt; plenty of time. These things take their own sweet time=\r\n, doesnt \nhappen\n&gt; &gt; overnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday=\r\n, that \nshould be\n&gt; &gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver fro=\r\nm it, \nwhether you\n&gt; &gt; get or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in o=\r\nur Sadhana \nand\n&gt; &gt; move on to higher things. I wish all the best.

Should =\r\nhe abandon the \nproject \n&gt; &gt; &gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the d=\r\nestination?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire g=\r\noing away can signal the bhutagni \nbeing weak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is=\r\n better off ignoring those things and not \nthinking too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; much about t=\r\nhe significance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing =\r\nhomam without worrying about how well or \nbadly it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; went and what res=\r\nults it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your fav=\r\norite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servant. A servant simpl=\r\ny serves the master. Similarly, all \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your oth=\r\ner activities are your way to serve \nyour \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\n rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday=\r\n to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail \nothers. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he =\r\nmay need a servant to physically carry papers to the \nbank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do th=\r\ne needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in \nthis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; worl=\r\nd and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda \nin this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\norld. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; variou=\r\ns rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme =\r\ngod of this world operates through various physical \npersons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; present=\r\n on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify=\r\n ourselves \nand try \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just=\r\n as a servant \ncarries \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work =\r\nfor god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work te=\r\nnds to \npromote ego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carry=\r\ning a million \ndollar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superi=\r\nor to a servant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Bo=\r\nth are \nmerely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Bo=\r\nth are \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his agend=\r\na. \nSimilarly, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in this =\r\nworld and \none \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this wor=\r\nld are \nboth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in thi=\r\ns \nworld. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself \nsu=\r\nperior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by=\r\n the \nworld, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who consider=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something \nle=\r\nss \n&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of=\r\n god fully penetrates \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one i=\r\ns safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. O=\r\nne can remain \nhappy and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise an=\r\nd criticism and in \nlight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the sa=\r\nme attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It \nis a job \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are do=\r\ning for god. You do the best you can. But you own \nnothing. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You are =\r\ndoing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------\n- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \nhomam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. \nnet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jag=\r\nannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \nnath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------\n- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:=\r\n47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reading your response anoth=\r\ner question came into my mind. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is not =\r\ngood if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I mean =\r\nactyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; regularly, there can=\r\n be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is=\r\n still on..happened with me \ncouple of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knb=\r\now what to make of it but as one \nmember \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in this list had suggested =\r\nto me, i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRegarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 D=\r\necember, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors=\r\n) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand ba=\r\nse be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, =\r\nyou can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better =\r\nthan doing it in closed space. But realize \nthat a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can cause pr=\r\noblems. Keep an umbrella around to protect \nthe fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if it rains whi=\r\nle you are doing homam. It is not good if fire \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by r=\r\nain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a hom=\r\na kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped hum=\r\na kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audi=\r\no file, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with =\r\nthe audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while listening attenti=\r\nvely (not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all th=\r\ne \nattention \n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some munda=\r\nne matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening \nto it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with foc=\r\nus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the \nmantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may do=\r\n nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra.=\r\n The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. \nOne can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say a=\r\n mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; control =\r\nover the mind and keeping the mind focused on the \nmantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n However, there is a difference between meditation and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra=\r\n is submitted in the internal fire in meditation \nand it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitte=\r\nd in the external fire as well in a homam. So \nmaking some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; external =\r\nsound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to \nsilent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting=\r\n or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelor=\r\ns do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ye=\r\ns. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been perfor=\r\nmed can do it. Bachelor or married is \nirrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One sho=\r\nuld follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules o=\r\nne&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one=\r\n should eat only vegetarian food \non the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bat=\r\nh before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any=\r\n solid food 2 hours before \nhomam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one with=\r\nout a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am w=\r\nilling to take \nresponsibility and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a perso=\r\nn can think of me or my guru \nas guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willin=\r\ng to take on any karma incurred \nin the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; process until the person cro=\r\nsses some minimum threshhold of \npurity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; through homam and other spir=\r\nitual practices. Sacred thread or \nno \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or=\r\n no mantropadesa, it does not \nmatter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; after a while, when the person=\r\n crosses a threshhold of purity. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other m=\r\nantropadesa by guru is to speed \nthis up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and make the person cross t=\r\nhe threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one desires no specifi=\r\nc material benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and do=\r\nes homam for \nspiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it m=\r\neans some \nsuffering for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to s=\r\ntart the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahag=\r\nanapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But any day is fine=\r\n really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and roofto=\r\np homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I went t=\r\no India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; traveled together to sever=\r\nal places (on a specific project). \nWe ended \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the m=\r\norning in several places (wherever we \nwere). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my gu=\r\nru told me to carry an umbrella with me. \nAs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in J=\r\nune/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi=\r\n in mid-May.. We proceeded to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex =\r\nwe were in, to do a homam. \nManish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going =\r\nto rain heavily in this city \nafter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smil=\r\ned.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started \nraining \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small \ntowel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the \ntwo small \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth \ncover =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off \nand \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra \nlater =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a \nfew da=\r\nys \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we \ncover=\r\ned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we \nw=\r\nent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move \n=\r\non.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; home..comcast. =\r\nnet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@=\r\n gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am intereste=\r\nd in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof =\r\ntop of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ?

I told him that i &lt;BR&gt;try to follow conventional instructions give=\r\nn in the book i.e 13 &lt;BR&gt;chapters with Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi &amp; Ratr=\r\ni Sukta, Nyas, 3 &lt;BR&gt;rasyas and Kshma Prarthana at the end.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He told =\r\nme that he only reads Kavach, Nyasa etc... at the begining &lt;BR&gt;and then con=\r\ntinues reciting 13 chapters every day. THE IMPORTANT &lt;BR&gt;thing here is that=\r\n He only indicated me his way of recitation, he &lt;BR&gt;NEVER asked me to do th=\r\ne same way or change the conventional way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need to give one backgr=\r\nound. for many years i wonder about &lt;BR&gt;*Mahatmya* in many fo our spiriual =\r\nbooks. take for instance Gita. it &lt;BR&gt;is indicated that Gita Mahatmya must =\r\nbe recited whenever Gita is &lt;BR&gt;recited and without that it&#39;ll not be compl=\r\nete. Ganapati &lt;BR&gt;Atharvashirsh also has added protion of the same. Durga\n =\r\nSaptashati &lt;BR&gt;also says that if you don&#39;t recite this, this &amp; this the=\r\nn the whole &lt;BR&gt;chandi paath is like fruitless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i am not able to rec=\r\noncile with all these. IT gives a impression of &lt;BR&gt;injecting Fear. It is s=\r\nimply Dogmatic. If you don&#39;t do this then &lt;BR&gt;your efforts are wasted but i=\r\nf you do this along with the main thing &lt;BR&gt;then it&#39;ll bring Laddu, Peda, L=\r\nuxuries, enjoyment of Swarga and even &lt;BR&gt;liberation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am at loss t=\r\no understand these extra things. it seems to me that &lt;BR&gt;it is a Ancient da=\r\nys Marketing gimmick added NOT by the original &lt;BR&gt;author but some others a=\r\nt later stages. it is quite possible that it &lt;BR&gt;was introduced everywhere =\r\nout of good intentions to make people &lt;BR&gt;recite it and get benefited. BUT =\r\nthese things have a danger of &lt;BR&gt;creating religious Fanatics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Due t=\r\no the above written feelings, i welcomed the way of the head &lt;BR&gt;priest and=\r\n now i too recite the 13 chapters of Chandi Paath since &lt;BR&gt;last\n few recit=\r\nation. my intentions are to avoid all the added things &lt;BR&gt;which glorifies =\r\nthe Fruits (Tempts us with Great Fruits or &lt;BR&gt;Intimadate with bad results)=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i think it was off the track.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;before i finish, must say that=\r\n the sounds with which i do are Aim, &lt;BR&gt;Hreem, Kleem &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yours,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@ ...&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narsimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1.Since=C3=82&nbsp;I ha=\r\nve joined this group before some couple of months, &lt;BR&gt;some previous mails =\r\nI have not read.

However, Manish did not reveal that=\r\n incident to me until much &lt;BR&gt;later. All he told me at that time was that =\r\nNarayan really needed to &lt;BR&gt;do homam everyday and that I should teach a si=\r\nmple procedure to him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I experimented with homam, started =\r\ndoing occasionally and liked &lt;BR&gt;it. I started doing a quick procedure ever=\r\nyday. After doing it daily &lt;BR&gt;for a few months, I finally got down to the =\r\noriginal task - teaching &lt;BR&gt;Narayan. I chose to write a detailed manual fo=\r\nr that purpose. In &lt;BR&gt;hindsight, I made the correct choice, as\n many peopl=\r\ne in addition to &lt;BR&gt;Narayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I a=\r\nnd many other &lt;BR&gt;people have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far=\r\n as my mind &lt;BR&gt;concerned, all this started for Narayan! When it was time f=\r\nor &lt;BR&gt;Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the world started &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the &lt;BR&gt;onset=\r\n itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental &lt;BR&gt;state w=\r\nould&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I &lt;BR&gt;would&#39;ve been mor=\r\ne egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only &lt;BR&gt;thing I was told was=\r\n to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived &lt;BR&gt;at the correct balance=\r\n and also wrote it down without many &lt;BR&gt;pretensions. The whole effort ende=\r\nd up being more saattwik and I &lt;BR&gt;really benefited from the exercise. If I=\r\n had known the full story, &lt;BR&gt;it would have had more\n rajas given my menta=\r\nl state then and I would &lt;BR&gt;not have had made the same progress I made, wh=\r\nile preparing myself &lt;BR&gt;to teach homam to Narayan.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish=\r\n told me the full story only when I was better prepared to &lt;BR&gt;handle the i=\r\nnformation and, of course, I added it to the preface of &lt;BR&gt;the manual as a=\r\nsked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A good guru prote=\r\ncts a sishya from unnecessary information that &lt;BR&gt;can wreak havoc with the=\r\n ego. I remember another incident.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day in the spring o=\r\nf the same year, I decided to spend a whole &lt;BR&gt;day meditating with Gayatri=\r\n mantra during the coming weekend. The &lt;BR&gt;inspiration came out of nowhere =\r\nand I immediately latched on to it. &lt;BR&gt;When I told Manish, he only said &quot;g=\r\nood, go ahead and do it&quot;. I &lt;BR&gt;started before sunrise and went on till 9:3=\r\n0 pm. Except for 3-4 &lt;BR&gt;breaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath a=\r\nnd a small lunch &lt;BR&gt;and another 10 min break\n for another bath at dusk, I =\r\nwas basically &lt;BR&gt;sitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri man=\r\ntra. It was &lt;BR&gt;a very good experience. I was in a very nice state at the e=\r\nnd of the &lt;BR&gt;day.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I noticed on the next day that the prev=\r\nious day was Akshaya &lt;BR&gt;Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is consider=\r\ned a very &lt;BR&gt;auspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on t=\r\nhat day &lt;BR&gt;is 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had no=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;noticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nexcited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days &lt;BR&gt;lat=\r\ner, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell &lt;BR&gt;you be=\r\ncause knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been &lt;BR&gt;excited a=\r\nt doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement &lt;BR&gt;would&#39;ve ch=\r\nanged the mental focus and brought more rajas into the &lt;BR&gt;sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He was absolutely right. As\n such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental &lt;BR&gt;fo=\r\ncus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on &lt;BR&gt;a po=\r\nwerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement, &lt;BR&gt;brought in =\r\nrajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra further. &lt;BR&gt;Ego is a very d=\r\nangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent &lt;BR&gt;progress, it can sudden=\r\nly return and pull one down! After hearing &lt;BR&gt;Manish&#39;s words, I introspect=\r\ned and found that my ego was still alive &lt;BR&gt;and kicking and that he was wi=\r\nse not to feed it with more delicious &lt;BR&gt;food!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lucky are =\r\nthose who have a guru who can succintly tell them what &lt;BR&gt;is useful rather=\r\n than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a &lt;BR&gt;guru (or someone els=\r\ne) who can go to the heart of their problem and &lt;BR&gt;point it out, so that t=\r\nhey can weed it out through further &lt;BR&gt;introspection and weaken it through=\r\n conscious effort.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I remember one =\r\nmore similar incident. Before the shata chandi &lt;BR&gt;homam in early 2006, a p=\r\nriest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha &lt;BR&gt;(a perfected/advanced soul).=\r\n When he looked at me, he mentioned the &lt;BR&gt;name of one of the saptarshis a=\r\nnd said that I very close to him and &lt;BR&gt;that I would do some important wor=\r\nk in this birth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I saw Manish later that day, I menti=\r\noned this to him. He &lt;BR&gt;immediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do=\r\n you need one more &lt;BR&gt;identity? Your ego is already strong with the identi=\r\nty &lt;BR&gt;of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the &lt;BR&gt;astrologer=\r\n&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual &lt;BR&gt;seeker&#39; etc. It=\r\n will take great effort to overcome those identities &lt;BR&gt;and find True Self=\r\n. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you &lt;BR&gt;really need yet anothe=\r\nr new identity to feed your ego further? See, &lt;BR&gt;what he said may very wel=\r\nl be correct. But it\n is not useful for your &lt;BR&gt;progress. You have to rise=\r\n above all identities.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; How true and wise!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean a=\r\nnd weak dog and &lt;BR&gt;get all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or =\r\nthe sense &lt;BR&gt;of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets=\r\n all &lt;BR&gt;the energy possible. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog a=\r\nnd &lt;BR&gt;feed the lean dog specially, we too must consciously try to restrain=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;ego and increase detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish has a unique way =\r\nof looking at things and some simple &lt;BR&gt;points he made brought so much cla=\r\nrity to my thinking and sped up my &lt;BR&gt;spiritual evolution in this life. Ev=\r\nen without giving any specific &lt;BR&gt;mantra to me, like many spiritual gurus =\r\ndo, he lit the lamp of &lt;BR&gt;knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and=\r\n light were already &lt;BR&gt;there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that=\r\n was blocking\n the &lt;BR&gt;light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes o=\r\nff the thick &lt;BR&gt;layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) t=\r\nhat &lt;BR&gt;encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we ma=\r\ny &lt;BR&gt;be too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpfu=\r\nl. But one &lt;BR&gt;should also try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on =\r\nan &lt;BR&gt;ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For most people, this does &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;not take just a single moment or day or month or year. It CAN take a &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nlong time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking on the &lt;BR&gt;path a=\r\nnd not worry about the progress and the distance left. One who &lt;BR&gt;keeps wa=\r\nlking without distractions will reach the goal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The point =\r\nI want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like &lt;BR&gt;homam) and the i=\r\nnternal introspection (to change attitude) should go &lt;BR&gt;hand in hand. Afte=\r\nr a\n while, there will be synergy between them and &lt;BR&gt;they will start to w=\r\nork together very effectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Naras=\r\nimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ &lt;BR&gt;tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Wind=\r\nows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\n&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www=\r\n.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer=\r\n@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Some ramblings ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding fire getting =\r\nextinguished (or anything similar to it), &lt;BR&gt;it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; happens with =\r\nall beginners and its only practice which makes one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best pa=\r\nth for &lt;BR&gt;most. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me share one incident, whe=\r\nn Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom &lt;BR&gt;I also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; consider my Guru,=\r\n asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata &lt;BR&gt;Chandi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Homa) =\r\nto learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was really &lt;BR&gt;joking!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded me. &lt;BR&gt;It th=\r\nen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;searching on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, b=\r\nut nevertheless I &lt;BR&gt;took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it up and performed it.\n But, I was=\r\n not satisfied. Manishji then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reminded me of the book he gifte=\r\nd me, but even in that it was &lt;BR&gt;entirely&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in Samskrit and ill=\r\niterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish &lt;BR&gt;between&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; an instr=\r\nuction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha &lt;BR&gt;occasionally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated in it, &lt;BR&gt;bu=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, wh=\r\nich &lt;BR&gt;he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; did, but still it did not get through my really den=\r\nse brains :). &lt;BR&gt;I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were s=\r\nuch that I never gave &lt;BR&gt;up,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; instead I made a sincere prayer =\r\nto Lord Ganesha, that If he &lt;BR&gt;really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; intends that I perform =\r\nthe homa, then he should kindly show me &lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; way. In around=\r\n two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has &lt;BR&gt;decided&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to =\r\ndocument the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just\n &lt;BR&gt;couldnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for &lt;BR&gt;h=\r\nis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it =\r\ntaking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine forces for =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;helping&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; me progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My request=\r\n, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. &lt;BR&gt;We&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nare humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect &lt;BR&gt;the very&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have =\r\nfuture &lt;BR&gt;lives ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; plenty of time. These things take their o=\r\nwn sweet time, doesnt &lt;BR&gt;happen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; overnight. No matter what, co=\r\nmplete your homa everyday, that &lt;BR&gt;should be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the primary goal=\r\n ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it,\n &lt;BR&gt;whether you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ge=\r\nt or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana &lt;BR&gt;and&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; move on to higher things. I wish all the best. We should really &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthank&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our stars that people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are =\r\nhere &lt;BR&gt;guiding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; us ... what would be life without them!&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; -Narayan-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dolla=\r\nr check to the bank and &lt;BR&gt;cashing it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superi=\r\nor to a servant carrying a $100 check to the &lt;BR&gt;bank and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;cashing it.

A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to ser=\r\nve &lt;BR&gt;your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically car=\r\nry papers to the &lt;BR&gt;bank and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly,=\r\n god is capable of doing anything in &lt;BR&gt;this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world and =\r\nyet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda &lt;BR&gt;in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through vari=\r\nous physical &lt;BR&gt;persons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; present on\n earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana,=\r\n purify ourselves &lt;BR&gt;and try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to help others, because th=\r\nat is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant &lt;BR&gt;carries &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s=\r\n papers to the bank, we do such work for god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;promote ego &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servan=\r\nt carrying a million &lt;BR&gt;dollar &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; check to the bank and ca=\r\nshing it is NOT superior to a servant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 ch=\r\neck to the bank and cashing it. Both are &lt;BR&gt;merely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; doin=\r\ng their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are &lt;BR&gt;just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. &lt;BR&gt;Simi=\r\nlarly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in t=\r\nhis world and &lt;BR&gt;one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; who\n does what are considered meag=\r\nre deeds in this world are &lt;BR&gt;both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of god help=\r\ning god execute god&#39;s agenda in this &lt;BR&gt;world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither =\r\nreally owns anything. One may consider oneself &lt;BR&gt;superior to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\norld, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who con=\r\nsiders &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carry=\r\ning something &lt;BR&gt;less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully pe=\r\nnetrates &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one=\r\n is safe no matter what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas p=\r\nlace one in. One can remain &lt;BR&gt;happy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; blissful in pl=\r\neasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in &lt;BR&gt;light &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; and darkness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the sa=\r\nme attitude towards your sadhana like homam.

Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base b=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of\n a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper =\r\none?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a=\r\n rooftop. Doing it in the open is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than d=\r\noing it in closed space. But realize &lt;BR&gt;that a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can=\r\n cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect &lt;BR&gt;the fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kund=\r\nam with bricks and sand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shap=\r\ned huma kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While =\r\nperforming the Homam using the mp3 audio file, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; should on=\r\ne repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the au=\r\ndio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally=\r\n while listening attentively\n (not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, =\r\neven listening to mantras with all the &lt;BR&gt;attention &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; foc=\r\nused is as powerful as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;to it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its dei=\r\nty. Then the &lt;BR&gt;mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and =\r\nyet person Y may benefit from &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. The word m=\r\nantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. &lt;BR&gt;One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nay a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key &lt;BR&gt;is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the &lt;BR&gt;ma=\r\nntra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a di=\r\nfference between meditation and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitt=\r\ned in the internal\n fire in meditation &lt;BR&gt;and it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is sub=\r\nmitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So &lt;BR&gt;making some &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;silent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Ma=\r\nha Ganapati Homam? Any Other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain fo=\r\nod?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upana=\r\nyanam (sacred thread ceremony) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has been performed can do=\r\n it. Bachelor or married is &lt;BR&gt;irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian =\r\nfood &lt;BR&gt;on\n the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before hom=\r\nam. Another rule I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any=\r\n solid food 2 hours before &lt;BR&gt;homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take &lt;BR&gt;responsibil=\r\nity and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of =\r\nme or my guru &lt;BR&gt;as guru &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willin=\r\ng to take on any karma incurred &lt;BR&gt;in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; process until=\r\n the person crosses some minimum threshhold of &lt;BR&gt;purity &lt;B\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
