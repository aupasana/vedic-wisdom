Yoga \n&gt; &gt; Vasishtham (taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama) has many=\r\n specific \n&gt; &gt; examples.\n&gt; &gt; Rebirth is not just a matter of being able to =\r\nexperience some things. \n&gt; &gt; It is also a matter of giving back to those on=\r\ne has a rina with. \n&gt; &gt; Depending on which beings one has a rina with and w=\r\nhat kind of rinas \n&gt; &gt; (and how strong), one may have to be born along with=\r\n those beings.\n&gt; &gt; If one killed animals and ate them, the only way to pay =\r\nback may \n&gt; &gt; sometimes be to be reborn as an animal and be killed by those=\r\n animals \n&gt; &gt; (reborn as animals or human beings).\n&gt; &gt; Let me give a differ=\r\nent kind of example. Suppose one had a very very \n&gt; &gt; strong and deep desir=\r\ne to mate with a beautiful girl and could not do \n&gt; &gt; it in that life. Supp=\r\nose the girl&#39;s rinas give her rebirth as an \n&gt; &gt; animal. If one&#39;s punya all=\r\nows him to fulfil that strong desire in next \n&gt; &gt; birth, the strength of th=\r\nat desire may force him to be reborn as an \n&gt; &gt; animal and he may fulfil th=\r\ne desire in that life as an animal. [Moral: \n&gt; &gt; Be careful what you strong=\r\nly wish for!]\n&gt; &gt; The next birth is decided by one&#39;s karmas, debts, and the=\r\n karmas of \n&gt; &gt; people one has strong links to, one&#39;s deeply held desires a=\r\nnd level of \n&gt; &gt; good deeds to fulfil those desires.\n&gt; &gt; There are so many =\r\nsituations that can force one to be reborn as an \n&gt; &gt; animal. Animals rebor=\r\nn as human beings and human beings reborn as \n&gt; &gt; animals is very common.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; In fact, a good percentage of human beings on earth right now may be \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; first time and last time (for now) human beings!\n&gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasi=\r\nmha \n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------    Free=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: \n&gt; &gt; http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Films that make=\r\n a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;  =\r\n     Spirituality: \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt; &lt;ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;    Jyotish writings: \n&gt; &gt; http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108 \n&gt; &gt; --------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Nov 23, 2011 at 1:39 AM, r=\r\nadha4krsna wrote:\n&gt; &gt;     Respected Mr. PVR Narasimha Rao,\n&gt; &gt; May I reques=\r\nt YOUR view on the subject.
