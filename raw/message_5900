Remember, aim of sadhna is =\r\nto remove attachments and getting attached to your own sadhna is just contr=\r\nary. True sadhna will make you more and more child-like. Like a child you w=\r\nill become more and more carefree, joyful, easy going and passionate. If yo=\r\nur sadhna is not doing this to you, means you need to make some more change=\r\ns in your attitude&quot;\n\n2) &quot;First step toward God, first ever step in sadhna, =\r\neven before Yama and Niyama is to become honest. become honest to yourself.=\r\n Become honest enough to accept your own shortcomings and mistakes. If you =\r\nare not honest withyour self, many early years of your sadhna will make you=\r\n honest with yourself and after that only you will start experiencing resul=\r\nts of sadhna. So be honest enough to accept and courageous enough to change=\r\n.

Merely having a curious interest in spiritual topics has no meaning=\r\n unless one is also engaging in a dedicated\n&gt; spiritual practice designed t=\r\no bring spiritual realization to life. Sadhana, thus, represents the very b=\r\neginning of meaningful spiritual pursuit.\n&gt; \n&gt; The following is a collectio=\r\nn of practical, scripturally-based, guidelines from the teachings of Sanata=\r\nna Dharma that will help us to more fully develop our innate spiritual pote=\r\nntial. Sadhana, or spiritual practice, must be performed regularly with sin=\r\ncerity, humility, openness, and determination. Just as we all perform our d=\r\naily routines of eating, sleeping, and bathing without fail, similarly we s=\r\nhould practice our daily spiritual sadhana without fail to refine ourselves=\r\n and to advance in spiritual life. We should monitor our progress every day=\r\n by asking ourselves if today we have improved ourselves and come closer to=\r\n God.\n&gt; \n&gt; By following a daily spiritual practice under the guidance of Sr=\r\ni Guru, we can continuously deepen our experience and realization of the Di=\r\nvine....&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; VISIT HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS INFORMATIVE ARTICLE:\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.dharmacentral.com/forum/content.php?36-Daily-Sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Please forward this information to all sincere spiritual seekers.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Aum Shanti Shanti Shanti\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
