Traditionally, daily morning rituals of learned brahmanas=\r\n would consist of offering arghya to Sun, offering tarpana to devas, rishis=\r\n and pitris (ancestral manes), meditation and a fire ritual.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As for b=\r\nowing, one can bow to god present in every object before using an object. L=\r\nearned ones bow to food and express respect/gratitude to it before eating i=\r\nt. Some do pooja to homa kundam, to ghee bowl and to the wooden spoons used=\r\n for offering ghee, before the actual homam. Like this, one can bow (or men=\r\ntally bow) and have an attitude of reverence, respect and gratitude for any=\r\n object/person that one uses or interacts with. This is conducive to oneday=\r\n truly realizing the divinity in all. Of course, the key is not the physica=\r\nl act of bowing, but the mental act of feeling reverence and gratitude.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lesso=\r\nns, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short=\r\n Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt;        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;     =\r\n   Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- radha4krsn=\r\na &lt;maha.ishwardas@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji & Learned Members,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is the ideal/preferred timing for offering tarpana?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nReverently,\n&gt; &gt; Mahesh\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- radha4krsna &lt;maha.ishwardas@...&gt; wrote: \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha Ji & Learned Members,\n&gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the begin=\r\ning of the &quot;Pitri Tarpana&quot; section it say..\n&gt; &gt; &quot;First place the water pot =\r\nin front of you, bow to it and say the following.
