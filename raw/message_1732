From the following quote few question arises\n\n&quot;Karma is not just g=\r\nood and bad things we do to people. It is also the thoughts entertained by =\r\nthe mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think &quot;how I wish I had such a car=\r\n&quot;. Any action or thought that has some force behind it becomes a karma and =\r\ngets a reaction from Nature. When your punya balance is sufficient in a fut=\r\nure life, Nature will give you such a car, whether or not you want it in th=\r\nat life! You may not know why you got it, but you got it because you asked =\r\nfor it earlier.\n\nNature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish list =\r\nand your debt list. It automatically withdraws from your karma account to p=\r\nay back your debts and it automatically withdraws from your karma account t=\r\no pay for things on your wish list.&quot;\n\nWhen we are small child we have vario=\r\nus wish.... say unlimited some of which we remeber and some we may not.\n\nIn=\r\n the current life itself we find some wish fulfilled and some remain unfulf=\r\nilled and some have been forgetten by the end of this cycle of life.\n\nNow, =\r\nall those desire and thoughts which have force of our little childhood brai=\r\nn remain as our Karma to be carried by us? How to mitgate those? How the ba=\r\nlance in the bank of the Nature for our wish list be withdrawn and debts be=\r\n reduced in the present life cycle?\n\nKindly enlighten \nSincerely yours\nGane=\r\nsh Gulati\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
