One who learns vedas, upanishad and \nvedangas and is proud of one&#39;s knowledge and one who engages in rituals and \nis proud of one&#39;s rituals, are better than many people who are in utter \nignorance and yet proud of this or that. However, my point is that both are \nfar away from realization.\n\nTrue knowledge is one that makes one lose pride. True knowledge is one that \nincreases the surrender. True knowledge is one that does not bind further, \nbut liberates one.\n\nAs you correctly pointed out, recognizing the problem of pride is the first \nstep in improving. As you said, pride does not leave one even during \nspiritual sadhana! One may be proud of one&#39;s sadhana, even without fully \nrealizing it consciously. One does not have to dig deep. One needs to only \nscratch the surface of one&#39;s mind, thoughts and instincts to see the lion of \nego alive, kicking and roaring.\n\nAs long as one recognizes the problem and *consciously* tries to take the \n&quot;sarvam krishaarpanamastu&quot; statement at the end of rituals seriously and \nliterally, one is on the right path and one will eventually overcome.\n\nManish keeps telling me, &quot;Narasimha, do not underestimate anyone. Each being \nin this universe has a birth right to liberation. If She wishes, a split \nsecond is enough to liberate one. Do not have any bias. There is a divine \nspark in *everyone*. Try to light that spark in people. Leave the rest to \nHer.&quot; Every person has a potential. Just some conscious effort is needed to \nfulfil that potential.\n\nFirst recognize pride and ego in your actions, thoughts and instincts. Then \nmake a conscious effort to overcome it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, December 06, 2008 6:08 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam / Re-igniting Fire\n\n\n&gt; namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Bharati !!!\n&gt;\n&gt; I too thought about it the same way as you mentioned. but as you and\n&gt; Narasimha Garu Mentioned, God&#39;ll decide our worth and why should we\n&gt; bother about that. we should be doing just HER work without any sense\n&gt; of pride and It is Much much much more difficult to achieve than\n&gt; said.\n&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha has really made the difference with me and i am sure with\n&gt; many others as well. he has clarified some really nagging doubts. He\n&gt; has effectively convinced me that Pride is the one what needs to be\n&gt; controlled and finally annihilate. in my case, whenever i did some\n&gt; sadhana, i would feel some pride which used to go unnoticed by me\n&gt; most of the times. Now atleast i&#39;ve started acknowledging it and\n&gt; that, in my opinion is the first step. once you acknowledge some\n&gt; errors then only you can take a corrective steps.\n&gt;\n&gt; He has also blew away a big burden from my heart and that is the\n&gt; burden of Longing for subtle experiences.\n&gt;\n&gt; and there are some other things which was clarified very effectively\n&gt; which i would mention some other time.\n&gt;\n&gt; the following sentences of his would be really inspirational for many\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about mundane things like respect, disrespect,\n&gt;&gt;silliness, smartness, eloquence, disorganized writings etc. We are\n&gt;&gt;not here to impress anyone, including our gurus or sishyas. We are\n&gt;&gt;here to do sadhana, become pure, realize our mission, finish the\n&gt;&gt;mission and then give up the body.\n&gt;\n&gt; some ligther thought from me: During Havan, it is you and\n&gt; MahaGanapati (or some other deitiy). so even if some unwanted things\n&gt; happens, you can talk to the deity and say &quot;it is you who is\n&gt; performing through me so i need not worry. it is you who needs to\n&gt; worry about that afterall.

To another\n&gt;&gt; &gt; servant, he may just give a $100 check.

But,\n&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; does, don&#39;t worry.

Suppose a little\n&gt; milk\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; spilled on the way. What should he do? Should he abandon the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; project\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the destination?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutagni\n&gt; being\n&gt;&gt; &gt; weak.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignoring those things and not thinking\n&gt;&gt; &gt; too\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much about the significance.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or\n&gt; badly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; went and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail\n&gt; others.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the\n&gt; bank\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then.\n&gt; The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various physical\n&gt;&gt; &gt; persons\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; try\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant\n&gt;&gt; &gt; carries\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to\n&gt; promote\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ego\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dollar\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are\n&gt; merely\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are\n&gt; just\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Similarly,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in this world and\n&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are\n&gt; both\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; world,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something\n&gt;&gt; &gt; less\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain\n&gt; happy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; light\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; job\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own\n&gt;&gt; &gt; nothing.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Reading your response another question came into my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mind.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by\n&gt; rain,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing\n&gt; homa\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me\n&gt; couple\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; member\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me,  i relight the fire and keep\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         -Regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva\n&gt; Sutra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;         --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Namaste Phani,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a\n&gt; house\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (3-\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand\n&gt; base\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; copper one?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the\n&gt; open\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that\n&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fire\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sand\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio\n&gt;&gt; &gt; file,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           One can repeat mentally while listening attentively\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; attention\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;..\n&gt; One\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the\n&gt; mantra.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           However, there is a difference between meditation\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; silent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain\n&gt; food?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread\n&gt; ceremony)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by\n&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food\n&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before\n&gt; homam.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to\n&gt; do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take\n&gt; responsibility\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru\n&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; guru\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of\n&gt; purity\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or\n&gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not\n&gt; matter\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity.\n&gt; The\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed\n&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; &gt; up\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           As long as one desires no specific material\n&gt; benefits\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for\n&gt; spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day\n&gt; would\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; morning.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; India\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru\n&gt; Manish\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ended\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; were).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me.\n&gt; As\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam.\n&gt; Manish\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city\n&gt;&gt; &gt; after\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started\n&gt;&gt; &gt; raining\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket\n&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two\n&gt;&gt; &gt; small\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cover\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; later\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a\n&gt; few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; days\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we\n&gt; covered\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; went\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move\n&gt; on.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.SriJagan\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; daily,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a\n&gt; house\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (3-\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ?
