Finally, she had a mystic vision\nof Him and her mind merged into H=\r\nim. She thenceforth sang songs about the glory\nand bliss of the God-Realize=\r\nd state.

I am quoting just my comments. One should be able to=\r\n follow them despite the missing context.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;Writing 1:\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I have no aversion for Vedanta at all, but many Vedan=\r\ntins today only speak pseudo-Vedanta that is devoid of a respect for what b=\r\ninds us in the first place and a genuine appreciation of the difficulty of =\r\novercoming the bondage. Let us dissect this &quot;acceptance&quot; thing for example.=\r\n Yes, it is very easy to theoretically understand that &quot;acceptance of every=\r\nthing&quot; will liberate one. But what does it mean practically?\n&gt;\n&gt;For example=\r\n, I read your note and my instinct\n was to respond. Should I &quot;accept&quot; the i=\r\nnstinct and type this response? Or should I &quot;accept&quot; the other instinct to =\r\nnot waste time and continue with some Jyotish research work I was doing? Wh=\r\nich acceptance is better?\n&gt;\n&gt;We are constantly pulled in different directio=\r\nns by our dharma towards different beings/entities and it is not easy to pi=\r\nck the right thing to do.\n&gt;\n&gt;We can use an easy abstraction. Let us call ou=\r\nr actions towards the rest of the world as &quot;karma&quot; and the actions of the r=\r\nest of the world towards us as &quot;karmaphala&quot;. A simple thumb rule can be (1)=\r\n to accept all &quot;karmaphala&quot; and not analyze it much and (2) to stick to our=\r\n dharma in picking the &quot;karma&quot;. But there are 3 fundamental issues with thi=\r\ns:\n&gt;\n&gt;(1) It is not easy to know one&#39;s dharma. One is often pulled in diffe=\r\nrent directions by one&#39;s dharma towards different beings/entities. After al=\r\nl, we are suspended in this world by a complex web of rinas!\n&gt;(2) As we eva=\r\nluate various\n dharmas and pick current karma, some understanding of which =\r\nkarma is likely to result in which karmaphala is needed. Thus, feedback fro=\r\nm previous karmas, in the form of &quot;karmaphala&quot;, is of interest. But there i=\r\ns no certainty and we can only have a vague understanding.\n&gt;(3) Firmness in=\r\n doing one&#39;s karma in the interest of one&#39;s highest dharma (based on one&#39;s =\r\nbest understanding at the time - could be faulty) and detachment to the cor=\r\nresponding karmaphala when it finally arrives, is what we have to do. But t=\r\nhey are kind of opposite goals. Without some attachment, most people cannot=\r\n engage in firm actions.\n&gt;\n&gt;Many Vedantins make 2 mistakes - (1) they trivi=\r\nalize the field of duality as something that is delusional and can simply b=\r\ne wished away and (2) instead of seeing jnana and karma as two sides of the=\r\n coin, they see them as alternatives. They look down upon karma as somethin=\r\ng lowly and value bookish & intellectual understanding of jnana more.\n With=\r\nout firm & dharmik karmas, that intellectual understanding of jnana will no=\r\nt infuse one&#39;s thinking and instincts deep enough to liberate one eventuall=\r\ny.\n&gt;\n&gt;I can see that &quot;sun of knowledge is so powerful that we cant even gra=\r\nsp the edge of it&#39;s toes with our indriyas (sense-organs), hence you have t=\r\no use some other faculty and remember that you cant also express it to othe=\r\nrs with your sense organs.&quot; But it is very easy for one to delude oneself t=\r\nhat one is now grasping that Sun with &quot;some other faculty&quot;. The proof of th=\r\ne pudding is that theoretical understanding is accompanied by an internal t=\r\nransformation that expresses externally as firm dharmik karmas with detachm=\r\nent to karmaphala!!\n&gt;\n&gt;To anyone who lectures that all is Self/God, I just =\r\nhave one rude reply. Suppose one&#39;s hands and legs are cut off. Can one say =\r\nthat the cut off limbs and the stream of blood flowing are also Self/God an=\r\nd be in the same blissful state? I know the answer\n in my case. Any truthfu=\r\nl person will know the answer in one&#39;s own case. It is so easy to repeat Ve=\r\ndanta like a parrot, but Shakti is too powerful. Unless MANY deeply ingrain=\r\ned instincts are overcome through practice & grace, one cannot be liberated=\r\n. Until one overcomes ALL instincts, &quot;all is Self&quot; is just theory.\n&gt;\n&gt;Regar=\r\nding Rajarshi&#39;s comment on there being something higher than the upper bird=\r\n in Mundakpanishad story, I don&#39;t have much to say. It is quite possible. H=\r\nowever, whether or what is above that bird is not that interesting to me. W=\r\nhen my personality is represented by the lower bird, my goal is to first ma=\r\nke the lower bird climb and reach the upper bird. Whether it stays there th=\r\nen or flies away further up is an issue for future.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Writing 2:\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I do not want to &quot;put down&quot; Vedanta. I only =\r\nwant to put it in\n perspective. It is the &quot;anta&quot; (end) of &quot;veda&quot; (knowledge=\r\n). If one at the *beginning* or *middle* of the path ignores/puts down the =\r\nwhole path and talks excessively of the &quot;end&quot;, it does not necessarily take=\r\n him to the end. It takes a loooong time to travel the path. Vedanta is jus=\r\nt the end and not a path to the end. IMHO, Vedanta is not only useless but =\r\nquite misleading for 99.9999% of humanity, though it is the inevitable fina=\r\nl liberating reality for the rest who already travelled *a* path and reache=\r\nd *the* end.\n&gt;\n&gt;Take the simple notion of acceptance. Rama, after Self-real=\r\nization, killed Ravana and others. Of course, he had no &quot;dvesha&quot; for Ravana=\r\n. But would you normally label killing someone as &quot;acceptance&quot;? Understandi=\r\nng &quot;acceptance&quot; referred to in scriptures is no easy task!!!! In fact, peop=\r\nle talk about &quot;acceptance&quot; without even fully understanding what it actuall=\r\ny entails.\n&gt;\n&gt;We perceive everything through the lens of conditioning/vasan=\r\nas\n and rinas. For example, my words may make you think that I am agitated,=\r\n even if I am quite &quot;chilled&quot; in reality. Before talking about &quot;accepting&quot; =\r\nsomething, shouldn&#39;t we first improve one&#39;s perceptions? Can&#39;t questioning =\r\n& contemplating help in clarifying our perceptions?\n&gt;\n&gt;Is &quot;accepting&quot; fault=\r\ny/conditioned notions in our minds any useful? Isn&#39;t it better to resist, r=\r\neject and eject faulty/conditioned notions than to &quot;accept&quot; them? Wouldn&#39;t =\r\nprogress from a state of ignorance into that of wisdom naturally need a fin=\r\ne balance between friction/resistance and acceptance?\n&gt;\n&gt;A prematurely adop=\r\nted stretegy of &quot;accepting&quot; everything with no &quot;raaga&quot; or &quot;dvesha&quot; can lead=\r\n to a confused and indecisive person who shuns his dharma and gets *stuck* =\r\nin the middle of path despite speaking the language of someone who is at th=\r\ne end of the path. For someone who is still stuck in Maayaa, it is better t=\r\no do somewhat selfless dharma even with some raaga and\n dvesha.

I am quoting just my comments. One should be able =\r\nto follow them despite the missing context.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Writing 1:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I have no aversion for Vedanta at all, bu=\r\nt many Vedantins today only speak pseudo-Vedanta that is devoid of a respec=\r\nt for what binds us in the first place and a genuine appreciation of the di=\r\nfficulty of overcoming the bondage. Let us dissect this &quot;acceptance&quot; thing =\r\nfor example. Yes, it is very easy to theoretically understand that &quot;accepta=\r\nnce of everything&quot; will liberate one. But what does it mean practically?&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, I read your note and my instinct\n was to respond. Should =\r\nI &quot;accept&quot; the instinct and type this response? Or should I &quot;accept&quot; the ot=\r\nher instinct to not waste time and continue with some Jyotish research work=\r\n I was doing? Which acceptance is better?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are constantly pulled i=\r\nn different directions by our dharma towards different beings/entities and =\r\nit is not easy to pick the right thing to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We can use an easy abs=\r\ntraction. Let us call our actions towards the rest of the world as &quot;karma&quot; =\r\nand the actions of the rest of the world towards us as &quot;karmaphala&quot;. A simp=\r\nle thumb rule can be (1) to accept all &quot;karmaphala&quot; and not analyze it much=\r\n and (2) to stick to our dharma in picking the &quot;karma&quot;. But there are 3 fun=\r\ndamental issues with this:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) It is not easy to know one&#39;s dharma. =\r\nOne is often pulled in different directions by one&#39;s dharma towards differe=\r\nnt beings/entities. After all, we are suspended in this world by a complex =\r\nweb of rinas!&lt;br&gt;(2) As we evaluate various\n dharmas and pick current karma=\r\n, some understanding of which karma is likely to result in which karmaphala=\r\n is needed. Thus, feedback from previous karmas, in the form of &quot;karmaphala=\r\n&quot;, is of interest. But there is no certainty and we can only have a vague u=\r\nnderstanding.&lt;br&gt;(3) Firmness in doing one&#39;s karma in the interest of one&#39;s=\r\n highest dharma (based on one&#39;s best understanding at the time - could be f=\r\naulty) and detachment to the corresponding karmaphala when it finally arriv=\r\nes, is what we have to do. But they are kind of opposite goals. Without som=\r\ne attachment, most people cannot engage in firm actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many Vedant=\r\nins make 2 mistakes - (1) they trivialize the field of duality as something=\r\n that is delusional and can simply be wished away and (2) instead of seeing=\r\n jnana and karma as two sides of the coin, they see them as alternatives. T=\r\nhey look down upon karma as something lowly and value bookish &amp; intelle=\r\nctual understanding of jnana more.\n Without firm &amp; dharmik karmas, that=\r\n intellectual understanding of jnana will not infuse one&#39;s thinking and ins=\r\ntincts deep enough to liberate one eventually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I can see that &quot;sun o=\r\nf knowledge is so powerful that we cant even grasp the edge of it&#39;s toes wi=\r\nth our indriyas (sense-organs), hence you have to use some other faculty an=\r\nd remember that you cant also express it to others with your sense organs.&quot;=\r\n But it is very easy for one to delude oneself that one is now grasping tha=\r\nt Sun with &quot;some other faculty&quot;. The proof of the pudding is that theoretic=\r\nal understanding is accompanied by an internal transformation that expresse=\r\ns externally as firm dharmik karmas with detachment to karmaphala!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nTo anyone who lectures that all is Self/God, I just have one rude reply. Su=\r\nppose one&#39;s hands and legs are cut off. Can one say that the cut off limbs =\r\nand the stream of blood flowing are also Self/God and be in the same blissf=\r\nul state? I know the answer\n in my case. Any truthful person will know the =\r\nanswer in one&#39;s own case. It is so easy to repeat Vedanta like a parrot, bu=\r\nt Shakti is too powerful. Unless MANY deeply ingrained instincts are overco=\r\nme through practice &amp; grace, one cannot be liberated. Until one overcom=\r\nes ALL instincts, &quot;all is Self&quot; is just theory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding Rajarshi&#39;s=\r\n comment on there being something higher than the upper bird in Mundakpanis=\r\nhad story, I don&#39;t have much to say. It is quite possible. However, whether=\r\n or what is above that bird is not that interesting to me. When my personal=\r\nity is represented by the lower bird, my goal is to first make the lower bi=\r\nrd climb and reach the upper bird. Whether it stays there then or flies awa=\r\ny further up is an issue for future.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Writing 2:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I do not want to &quot;put down&quot; Vedanta. I only want=\r\n to put it in\n perspective. It is the &quot;anta&quot; (end) of &quot;veda&quot; (knowledge). I=\r\nf one at the *beginning* or *middle* of the path ignores/puts down the whol=\r\ne path and talks excessively of the &quot;end&quot;, it does not necessarily take him=\r\n to the end. It takes a loooong time to travel the path. Vedanta is just th=\r\ne end and not a path to the end. IMHO, Vedanta is not only useless but quit=\r\ne misleading for 99.9999% of humanity, though it is the inevitable final li=\r\nberating reality for the rest who already travelled *a* path and reached *t=\r\nhe* end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the simple notion of acceptance. Rama, after Self-real=\r\nization, killed Ravana and others. Of course, he had no &quot;dvesha&quot; for Ravana=\r\n. But would you normally label killing someone as &quot;acceptance&quot;? Understandi=\r\nng &quot;acceptance&quot; referred to in scriptures is no easy task!!!! In fact, peop=\r\nle talk about &quot;acceptance&quot; without even fully understanding what it actuall=\r\ny entails.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We perceive everything through the lens of conditioning/v=\r\nasanas\n and rinas. For example, my words may make you think that I am agita=\r\nted, even if I am quite &quot;chilled&quot; in reality. Before talking about &quot;accepti=\r\nng&quot; something, shouldn&#39;t we first improve one&#39;s perceptions? Can&#39;t question=\r\ning &amp; contemplating help in clarifying our perceptions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is &quot;acce=\r\npting&quot; faulty/conditioned notions in our minds any useful? Isn&#39;t it better =\r\nto resist, reject and eject faulty/conditioned notions than to &quot;accept&quot; the=\r\nm? Wouldn&#39;t progress from a state of ignorance into that of wisdom naturall=\r\ny need a fine balance between friction/resistance and acceptance?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A =\r\nprematurely adopted stretegy of &quot;accepting&quot; everything with no &quot;raaga&quot; or &quot;=\r\ndvesha&quot; can lead to a confused and indecisive person who shuns his dharma a=\r\nnd gets *stuck* in the middle of path despite speaking the language of some=\r\none who is at the end of the path. For someone who is still stuck in Maayaa=\r\n, it is better to do somewhat selfless dharma even with some raaga and\n dve=\r\nsha. Overcoming of raaga and dvesha naturally and organically occurs from w=\r\nithin, as one engages in more and more dharma and pays off more and more ri=\r\nnas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detachment (disappearance of raaga and dvesha) comes with the m=\r\naturing of jnana. Selfless dharmik actions that pay off outstanding debts o=\r\nccur with the maturing of karma. These two sides should mature together, as=\r\n they balance one. If one goes to an extreme, either towards karma or jnana=\r\n, without corresponding progress in the other, one will very likely get stu=\r\nck.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; =\r\nSpirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; =\r\n&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1123101620-2114509036-1366632962=:12881--\r\n\n"}}
