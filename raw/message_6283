My Karma has brought me like this&quot;. Exert. Exert.=\r\n Do Purushartha (deliberate and conscious action). Do Tapas (austerities). =\r\nConcentrate. Purify. Meditate. Don&#39;t become a fatalist. Don&#39;t yield to iner=\r\ntia. Don&#39;t bleat like a lamb. Roar Om Om Om like a lion of Vedanta. See how=\r\n Markandeya, who was destined to die at his sixteenth year, became a Chiran=\r\njeevi-an immortal boy of sixteen years on account of his Tapas. Also note h=\r\now Savitri by her Tapas brought back to life her dead husband; how Benjamin=\r\n Franklin and the late Sri T. Muthusami lyer of the Madras Bench, elevated =\r\nthemselves. Remember, my dear Niranjan, that man is master of his destiny. =\r\nViswamitra Rishi, who was a Kshatriya Raja (king), became a Brahma Rishi, l=\r\nike Vasishta and even created a third world for Trisanku by his power of Ta=\r\npas. Rogue Ratnakar became the sage Valmiki through Tapas. Rogues, Jagai an=\r\nd Madhai of Bengal, became highly developed saints. They became the discipl=\r\nes of Gouranga. What others have done, you can also do. There is no doubt o=\r\nf this. You can also do wonders and miracles if you apply yourself to spiri=\r\ntual Sadhana, Tapas and meditation.\n\n\n"}}
