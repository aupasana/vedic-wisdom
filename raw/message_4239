Physicists chased them further and broke them down to\nnuc=\r\nleus, electrons, quanta, waves, particles, and fields. Einstein said that\nt=\r\nhe universe of our experience consists of matter and energy in a\nspace-time=\r\n-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D mc2, where C is\na cons=\r\ntant representing the velocity of light. Matter and energy became\ninterchan=\r\ngeable.\nMax Planck, famous for his quantum theory, added a further dimensio=\r\nn to\nthis, stating that it is consciousness that is fundamental and that ma=\r\ntter\nis a derivative of consciousness. As a corollary even space and time a=\r\nre\nonly concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are veering round =\r\nto\nthe conclusion that since every object is a sum of its qualities and the=\r\nse\nqualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of matter an=\r\nd\nenergy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a construction of\nconsci=\r\nousness.\n\nYoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere are experie=\r\nnced by us;\nthere is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienced b=\r\ny us.&quot;\n\nBhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real.
