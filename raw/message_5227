Rama is no \ndifferent than parashurama - because on e=\r\narth, a great person is one who subdues \nhis enemies by force.\n\nregards,\nAr=\r\nyama\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Purity is not a &quot;0% or 100%&quot; state. It is a continuum.=\r\n As one becomes purer and \n&gt;increases self-control, one may get some result=\r\ns. Thus, a person still afflicted \n&gt;by undesirable conditioning may acquire=\r\n enough purity to get some results. But, \n&gt;people like Ravana, Hiranyakashi=\r\npu etc fell in the end!\n&gt; \n&gt; What I called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;sel=\r\nf-control&quot;. Both are not that \n&gt;different.\n&gt; \n&gt; Surrender of slaves is not =\r\nthe surrender I am talking about when I talk about \n&gt;surrender to god. The =\r\ninstinct of self-preservation is another aspect of ego. A \n&gt;person with ego=\r\n and pride may suppress pride and self-importance out of no \n&gt;choice, for s=\r\nelf-preservation. If one later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s pride \n&gt;without=\r\n sacrificing self-preservation, one may still do so. This is conditional \n&gt;=\r\nsurrender. In the case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is =\r\na \n&gt;mess and one is helpless may still be conditional surrender. But, when =\r\nthe \n&gt;surrender is unconditional and one sees god as the controller of all =\r\nwithout any \n&gt;conditions attached, irrespective of whether life is good or =\r\nbad, one becomes \n&gt;purer and purer and one&#39;s self-control become better and=\r\n better.\n&gt; \n&gt; A powerless person may also become angry. But, as you said, h=\r\nis anger is \n&gt;powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;s self-control increases, o=\r\nne&#39;s tendency to \n&gt;become angry comes down. That increases one&#39;s power. A p=\r\nerson who has a perfect \n&gt;self-control like Shiva is infinitely powerful. F=\r\nrom where we are to there, \n&gt;there is a continuum. Higher the self-control =\r\nand purity, higher the power.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritua=\r\nl manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\n&gt;        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      =\r\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silenta=\r\ndmirer_in@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt;    How did Ravana got success with=\r\n Mantras if success with Mantras comes only \n&gt;with loss of Ahamkara and pur=\r\nity of mind ?\n&gt; &gt;    Where is the liberation without shakti, even the slave=\r\ns were humble, \n&gt;devoted and with complete surrender to their masters, what=\r\n results did they ever \n&gt;get ?\n&gt; &gt;    There is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Ksham=\r\na shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas \n&gt;garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishra=\r\nhit vineet saral ho&quot;.

If one worries too much \n&gt;about the beauty and tech=\r\nnical details of the stick and ends up putting stress \n&gt;on the leg, the sti=\r\nck does not serve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if \n&gt;you conscious=\r\nly spare the leg from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not \n&gt;only w=\r\nalk but also run.

Mr. PVRji has li=\r\nsted some, but would be good to develop such \n&gt;list and make them available=\r\n in one place. I truly believe that would be more \n&gt;useful and powerful tha=\r\nn prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with \n&gt;possible high degre=\r\ne of error possibilities in the charts).

It is a continuum. As one becomes=\r\n purer and increases self-control, one may get some results.

But, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu etc fell in the en=\r\nd!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; What I called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;self-cont=\r\nrol&quot;. Both are not that different.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Surrender of slaves =\r\nis not the surrender I am talking about when I talk about surrender to god.=\r\n The instinct of self-preservation is another aspect of ego. A person with =\r\nego and pride may suppress pride and self-importance out of no choice, for =\r\nself-preservation. If one later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s pride without =\r\nsacrificing self-preservation, one may still do so. This is conditional sur=\r\nrender. In the case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is a m=\r\ness and one is helpless may still be conditional surrender. But, when the s=\r\nurrender is unconditional and one sees god as the controller of all without=\r\n any conditions attached, irrespective of whether life is good or bad, one =\r\nbecomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-control become better and better.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A powerless person may also become angry. But, as you sai=\r\nd, his anger is powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;s self-control increases,=\r\n one&#39;s tendency to become angry comes down. That increases one&#39;s power. A p=\r\nerson who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infinitely powerful. Fro=\r\nm where we are to there, there is a continuum.

I am a strong believer that prayers to the Almighty are the ultimate answ=\r\ners to things not in our control. Thank you for sharing this simple mantras=\r\n with the readers; literally hundreds would benefit from this as they seek =\r\ntheir solace. Bhakti is what makes people focus more on internal strengths =\r\n(of individuals) and become stronger to overcome difficulties.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; I am student/have been a student of Astrology for 20+ years, and continue=\r\n to use it for guidance for the future, but do not expect predictions would=\r\n come true as there are factorial 12! x 9! factorial permutations and combi=\r\nnations to deal with, virtually making it impossible to predict correctly. =\r\nBut for a trained eye and the learned gurus, and for those who have focused=\r\n more on the good lord to seek the knowledge (with total discipline and in =\r\nsubmitting to the Lord unconditionally), this art becomes a science as they=\r\n acquire &quot;vak-suddhi&quot;; AND they are able to guide the people. I see many in=\r\n this group following such discipline and thanks to them. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nile this wonderful help is available, I still think we need to give the mem=\r\nbers something to focus on the Lord in terms of mantras like you have done =\r\nMr. Jay-ji. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possible, Jay-ji, that we have a few simpl=\r\ne mantras listed for the benefit of the members to address the common issue=\r\ns people face, plus to appease the lords of the houses (like Ganesha for ke=\r\ntu, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn etc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but =\r\nwould be good to develop such list and make them available in one place. I =\r\ntruly believe that would be more useful and powerful than prescribing remed=\r\nies which may or may not work(with possible high degree of error possibilit=\r\nies in the charts).
