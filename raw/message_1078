Howe=\r\nver, I was recently\n&gt; speaking with someone who is somewhat well versed in =\r\nSanskrit and he\n&gt; told me that that the aforementioned two versions are bot=\r\nh incorrect,\n&gt; at least from a phonetic viewpoint. \n&gt; \n&gt; So my question the=\r\nn: How should one pronounce the Ganesha bija while\n&gt; doing Japa? I would re=\r\nally like to know the technically precise way,\n&gt; if at all possible to lear=\r\nn via this medium.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Many Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
