The goal is to have a reasonable target and meet it. Don&#39;t wo=\r\nrry if you are doing between 12 and 25 and don&#39;t know the exact count.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; (3) Yes. If you see the super-short version, only one mantra (om gam gaNa=\r\npataye namaH) is given. Offer any number of mantras, each any number of tim=\r\nes, as you wish.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (4) That&#39;s fine. Try to maintain around the same tim=\r\ne everyday (if you can).\n&gt;  \n&gt; (5) That is ok.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (6) No, it is not mand=\r\natory. If people always ate Jalebi with milk in old days, it does not mean =\r\nyou should not eat Jalebi if you don&#39;t have milk. Jalebi is tasty without d=\r\nipping in milk too!\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, people put too much emphasis on the exte=\r\nrnal ritual of sandhyavandanam and forget the essence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Once I went to a Maharudram (chanting of Rudra namakam 1331 tim=\r\nes by all participating ritviks together) conducted at a temple as a partic=\r\nipating ritvik. After chanting the whole morning, we were given a break at =\r\nnoon and we were all taken outside to do our sandhyavandanam. All the learn=\r\ned brahmins who came as ritviks sat down in the traditional pose on the gro=\r\nund and did ten minutes of an external ritual by touching various body part=\r\ns, sprinking water in various places etc. Clearly, they were learned in tra=\r\ndition and did it well. But, when they finished the ritual, they all got up=\r\n and went to have food.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the old days, people did ten minutes of ex=\r\nternal ritual and then did japam (meditation) with Gayatri mantra for an ho=\r\nur. If all you have is 5-10 minutes, it is more useful to skip sandhyavanda=\r\nna and do japam right away. Unfortunately, busy people of Kali yuga are mak=\r\ning a wrong tradeoff!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Don&#39;t get me wrong. I do not want to downplay t=\r\nhe importance of sandhyavandanam. However, spending 5-10 minutes in sandhya=\r\nvandanam and 0 minutes on actual Gayatri japam is a bad tradeoff IMHO.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Taking the dal (lentil soup) in your hand, looking at it intently for 2 m=\r\ninutes, transferring it from one hand to another, smelling it, touching it =\r\ngently with the tip of tongue may be a good ritual that makes your digestiv=\r\ne juices flow and helps you digest better. But, if you do that ritual and t=\r\nhen leave without eating the dal, what good is it and what strength are you=\r\n going to get from it? If you are in a hurry, you are better off eating the=\r\n soup without that ritual before it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In my =\r\nopinion, doing sadhyavandana is not mandatory for homam. It is not mandator=\r\ny for even doing japam with Gayatri mantra. If you have time, do sandhyavan=\r\ndanam and then 5-10 maalaas of Gayatri mantra, in addition to homam. If you=\r\n do not have such time, you are better off doing just homam and meditating =\r\nat the end.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am quite inspired to hear fro=\r\nm several people who never lit a lamp in their life before and are enjoying=\r\n homam by themselves now. Manish firmly belives that these are just the ear=\r\nly days and homam will become a very popular spiritual practice (again!) an=\r\nd hundreds of thousands of people will be doing homam regularly in coming y=\r\nears.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The main goal of religion is to take one to god and make one *e=\r\nxperience* god in some manner or the other. However, with deepening Kali, s=\r\neveral organized religions have become corrupted and dogmatic and deviating=\r\n from the main goal more and more. This is causing unneeded clashes between=\r\n people of &quot;faith&quot; and strife in the world and dissuading more and more int=\r\nelligent and educated people from the pursuit of god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As shrill and e=\r\nmpty rhetoric starts to afflict organized religions, what the world needs i=\r\ns not a new organized religion or a new prophet. World needs to rediscover =\r\nsanatana dharma (the path of perennial righteousness). What the world needs=\r\n is a sadhana of rishis, which uses the &quot;living god&quot; that everyone has acce=\r\nss to (i.e. fire) and which enables people to experience god eventually. Ma=\r\nnish belives thousands of people will make swift spiritual progress through=\r\n homam and restore some tolerable level of dharma in the world.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; (7) It may not mean anything and may not be connected =\r\nto homam.

Most often the attention is drawn towards the fir=\r\ne while\n&gt; &gt; meditating after pUrNaahuti, is it okay to meditate keeping the=\r\n eyes\n&gt; &gt; open and with some focus on fire?\n&gt; &gt;     2. Many of a time&#39;s i l=\r\nose track of how many beeja mantras/veda\n&gt; &gt; mantras i am offering and offe=\r\nr more than 12/less than 25, is that\n&gt; &gt; acceptable?\n&gt; &gt;     3. When runnin=\r\ng out of time I read atharvashIrShaM only once, will\n&gt; &gt; that be acceptable=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt;     4. I end up doing homaMs at night most of the times because of is=\r\nsues\n&gt; &gt; in getting up early in mornings as I stay late to take conference =\r\ncalls\n&gt; &gt; etc...\n&gt; &gt;     5. I reserved a room to do homaMs, I was doing hom=\r\naMs even when my\n&gt; &gt; wife was on her periods (she does not enter the homaM =\r\nroom during those\n&gt; &gt; times). Will that be okay or I need to give a break t=\r\no homaM during\n&gt; &gt; those times?\n&gt; &gt;     6. I am one of the guys who never d=\r\nid lit a lamp in my life time till\n&gt; &gt; month and a half back, I stopped doi=\r\nng sandhyavandanaM 23 years back, is\n&gt; &gt; it mandatory to perform sandhyavan=\r\ndanaM to do homaM&#39;s?\n&gt; &gt;     7. There were some rats at home (I think 5 of =\r\nthem, that are very\n&gt; &gt; large sized, but are not bandicoots), all of them d=\r\nied after I started\n&gt; &gt; homaM&#39;s [:(] , by the way I never wished that (but =\r\nkilled a couple of\n&gt; &gt; them long back, but did not try killing other&#39;s even=\r\n after getting a\n&gt; &gt; chance since an year), is that a bad sign of doing som=\r\nething wrong at\n&gt; &gt; homaM? Sometimes I feel the smoke has killed them (i do=\r\n homaM with dry\n&gt; &gt; coconut, but offered large fruits like apple etc... a c=\r\nouple of times in\n&gt; &gt; pUrNaahuti which generated a lot of smoke), but then =\r\nother creatures\n&gt; &gt; like lizards, spiders, ants are okay.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Thank =\r\nYou,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; sarma.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
