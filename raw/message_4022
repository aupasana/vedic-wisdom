Subrahmanian (1928-1998)\n\nDr. K. Subrahmanian&#39;s genuine love and de=\r\nvotion, insight, compassion and\nselflessness formed a vortex that drew hund=\r\nreds of devotees from Andhra\nPradesh into the shining presence of Sri Raman=\r\na Maharshi. In 1979, he\nfounded Sri Ramana Kendram in Hyderabad and continu=\r\ned to nurture it until\nhis final day in January of 1998.\n\nThe following is =\r\nan extract from &quot;Dr. K. Subrahmanian (1928-1998), A\nTribute&quot;, a book publis=\r\nh by the Hyderabad Kendram in his memory. Dr. K.\nSubrahmanian relates in hi=\r\ns own words about his early years and how he was\nnaturally drawn to the Mah=\r\narshi, and also some anecdotes from his uncle&#39;s\nlife.\n\nComing into the Rama=\r\nna Fold\n\nPresentation Convent, the school that my father worked for, used t=\r\no prepare\nchildren for taking the Cambridge University examination. The sch=\r\nool was run\nby Irish nuns and almost all the children were European girls. =\r\nMy father was\nthe only male teacher for a number of years. In the 50s, one =\r\nmore male\nteacher was appointed to teach Hindi.\n\nAs the winter vacation was=\r\n during Dec-Jan every year, my parents would go\nfrom Kodaikanal to Tiruvann=\r\namalai to attend the Jayanti function. My father\nused to take English veget=\r\nables grown in Kodaikanal to the Ashram for the\nJayanti celebrations. After=\r\n attending the Jayanti, my parents would go to my\nfather&#39;s village, Melvaya=\r\nlamoor, which is about 20 miles from\nTiruvannamalai. I was taken to Sri Bha=\r\ngavan when I was two years old. My two\nyounger sisters and I used to be tak=\r\nen almost every year to Sri Ramanasramam\nfor the Jayanti celebrations. In o=\r\nur case we could say we were seen by Sri\nBhagavan first. We were conscious =\r\nof seeing him much later.\n\nMy uncle, who looked after our lands in Melva-ya=\r\nlamoor, was also a great\ndevotee of Sri Bhagavan and Nayana [Kavyakanta Gan=\r\napati Muni]. Both in my\nhouse and in my uncle&#39;s house there was always a pi=\r\ncture of Sri Bhagavan in\nthe puja room. If not every day, almost every week=\r\n, there used to be some\ndiscussion or the other about the life and teaching=\r\ns of Sri Bhagavan. From\nchildhood I was brought up in a Bhagavan-charged at=\r\nmosphere.\n\nViswanatha Swami visited our house and stayed with us for severa=\r\nl days\ntogether on numerous occasions. Later, when I was teaching at Madras=\r\n\nChristian College, he stayed with me a couple of times. He used to spend\nm=\r\nuch of his time talking about the glory and grandeur of Sri Bhagavan and\nNa=\r\nyana. He taught us a number of devotional songs. He had a melodious voice\na=\r\nnd could sing beautifully.\n\nHearing from my father, uncle and Viswanatha Sw=\r\nami that Sri Bhagavan used to\nread the letters written by devotees to him, =\r\nas a boy I used to write to him\noccasionally, seeking his blessings. As the=\r\nre was no high school in\nKodaikanal, my father sent me to study at Sir P.S.=\r\nSivaswami Iyer High\nSchool, Tirukattupally. I studied there for four years =\r\nbetween 1941-45, from\nIII Form to VI Form, and stayed in the hostel attache=\r\nd to it.\n\n\n\nTalking to Sri Bhagavan\n\nIn 1941, I was taken by my uncle to Sr=\r\ni Ramanasramam. We had bought some\nmangoes and my uncle said that I should =\r\nput them on the small stool near Sri\nBhagavan&#39;s sofa. I went into the old m=\r\neditation hall along with my uncle and\nput the mangoes on the floor and pro=\r\nstrated before Sri Bhagavan and sat near\nthe window that now overlooks Sri =\r\nBhagavan&#39;s samadhi. My uncle sat next to\nme. When I was looking at Sri Bhag=\r\navan, Sri Bhagavan asked my uncle, &quot;Who is\nthis?&quot; My uncle said, &quot;He is my =\r\nbrother&#39;s son. He is studying in III Form.&quot;\nThen Sri Bhagavan said, turning=\r\n to me, &quot; So you are the person writing\nletters to me.&quot; I had a strange fee=\r\nling of awe, coupled with great joy. I\nsaid in a low voice, &quot;Yes.&quot; Sri Bhag=\r\navan said, &quot;Does your father send money\nto you so that you can write letter=\r\ns to me?&quot; and laughed. I wasn&#39;t quite\nsure whether Sri Bhagavan was being s=\r\narcastic or made the remark in a light\nvein. I sweated for a while, continu=\r\ning to look at him. As it was early in\nthe morning, there were only two or =\r\nthree devotees in the hall. When we came\nout of the hall after some time, m=\r\ny uncle, who had been a frequent visitor\nto the Ashram for several years, s=\r\naid, &quot;You must consider yourself very\nlucky. Sri Bhagavan usually does not =\r\nask `Who is he?&#39; It is a rare thing.&quot;\n\n\n\nObserving Sri Bhagavan\n\nTill 1950,=\r\n I used to visit the Ashram a couple of times every year; the\nfrequency how=\r\never increased between 1948 and 1950. I attended the\nKumbhabhishekam of the=\r\n Mathrubhuteswara Temple. It was an elaborate, solemn\naffair. After the Kum=\r\nbhabhishekam was performed, in the evening arati was\noffered to the deity i=\r\nn the temple and was brought to Sri Bhagavan by\nChinnaswami, Viswanatha Swa=\r\nmi and President Venkataraman. I was sitting very\nclose to Sri Bhagavan in =\r\nthe meditation hall attached to the temple. It was\na moving sight when Sri =\r\nBhagavan extended his hands and touched the arati\nwith great reverence, clo=\r\nsing his eyes.\n\nSoon after each operation was performed on Sri Bhagavan&#39;s c=\r\nancer, I used to\nvisit him. Sometimes I used to cry uncontrollably looking =\r\nat Sri Bhagavan\nfrom a distance. As far as Sri Bhagavan was concerned, he w=\r\nas ever the same\nserene, blissful Self. He behaved as if the cancer belonge=\r\nd to somebody\nelse.\n\nThe last time I saw Sri Bhagavan was on 7th April, 195=\r\n0, exactly one week\nbefore his nirvana. When I heard the news of Sri Bhagav=\r\nan&#39;s nirvana at\nKodaikanal, on 14th April, 1950, I did not break down, nor =\r\ndid I feel\ndepressed. I felt a peace=E2=80=94a peace that was totally unexp=\r\nected. Viswanatha\nSwami, whom I met a month later, also said that he enjoye=\r\nd an indescribable\npeace at the time of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s nirvana. He was one =\r\nof the few who were\ninside the room at the time Sri Bhagavan merged with Ar=\r\nunachala.\n\nI was taken to Sri Bhagavan as a small boy and I visited him man=\r\ny times\nlater on, but I never put even a single question to him. I listened=\r\n to\nothers asking questions and Sri Bhagavan&#39;s replies to them, but I never=\r\n felt\ninclined to ask a question even once. The only thing I used to do was=\r\n to sit\nclose to him and take leave of him after prostrating to him. Most o=\r\nften he\nwould nod his head or say in Tamil, &quot;sari, sari&quot; (O.K, O.K.).\n\nOcca=\r\nsionally I used to think that it would be good to read Sri Bhagavan&#39;s\nworks=\r\n in his presence. I tried a couple of times but I could not read\nanything i=\r\nn his presence. I was either looking at him or meditating.\n\nClose Encounter=\r\ns with Sri Bhagavan\n\nSometime in 1949, when Sri Bhagavan was still in the m=\r\neditation hall, I sat\nat the entrance looking at Sri Bhagavan from outside.=\r\n His shoulder was\nbandaged because of cancer. I thought to myself: &quot;I have =\r\nbeen coming to the\nAshram so often. But I have had no experience of real me=\r\nditation. Sri\nBhagavan has not granted me this experience.&quot; Thinking along =\r\nthese lines, I\nkept looking at Sri Bhagavan for a considerable time and the=\r\nn closed my\neyes. I do not know how long I was in that state. When I opened=\r\n my eyes I\nfound that the meditation hall was empty. Sri Bhagavan was not t=\r\nhere on the\nstone couch in the meditation hall. Sri Bhagavan and the devote=\r\nes must have\ngone past me as I was sitting at the entrance. When I realised=\r\n that I had\nbeen sitting when Sri Bhagavan went past me, I was horrified. I=\r\n felt how\ndisrespectful I was. But suddenly, I realised that Sri Bhagavan, =\r\nout of his\nunbounded grace, granted me an experience whereby I was complete=\r\nly oblivious\nof my surroundings.\n\nEven today, I am unhappy that I did not g=\r\net up when Sri Bhagavan and his\ndevotees went past me. Sri Bhagavan gives u=\r\ns rare experiences when we least\nexpect them.\n\nOn another occasion, when I =\r\nwas an 18-year-old student, around noon or so, I\nwas walking towards the me=\r\nditation hall. The new meditation hall was not\nthere then; the whole place =\r\nwas an open ground. I was thinking of something\nand walking with my head do=\r\nwn. When I neared the well, I looked up and saw\nSri Bhagavan standing at a =\r\nshort distance and talking to a devotee. I was\ntaken unawares as I did not =\r\nexpect Sri Bhagavan to be there. Sri Bhagavan\nwho was talking to the other =\r\nperson, looked at me sideways. I stood still,\nas I did not want to disturb =\r\nSri Bhagavan in any way. When he looked at me\nthat way, I felt a powerful l=\r\night penetrate me and engulf me. I experienced\na bliss that I had not exper=\r\nienced before. I was in that state for about\ntwenty days.\n\nMy uncle, V. S. =\r\nSrinivas Iyer, did his Intermediate at Voorhese College,\nVellore and became=\r\n village Munsiff of Vailamoor village and worked in that\ncapacity for over =\r\nforty years. He saw Sri Bhagavan even as a student. In the\nearly days, ther=\r\ne used to be very few visitors to the Ashram, which was then\njust a thatche=\r\nd shed. Before he met Sri Bhagavan, my uncle had come under\nthe influence o=\r\nf Kavyakanta and had taken upadesa from him. This fact is\nmentioned in the =\r\nSanskrit biography of Kavyakanta, Vasishta Vaibhavam,\nwritten by Kapali Sas=\r\ntry.\n\nThe first question that my uncle put to Sri Bhagavan as a young man w=\r\nas, &quot;Is\nit true that Ravana had ten heads.&quot; Sri Bhagavan replied, &quot;How does=\r\n it help\nyou to know whether he had ten heads or not?&quot; My uncle said, &quot;Naya=\r\nna says it\nis all false.&quot; Sri Bhagavan replied, &quot;Nayana has studied a lot a=\r\nnd has come\nto certain conclusions. What do I know?&quot; On another occasion my=\r\n uncle asked\nSri Bhagavan when he was going round the Hill, &quot;Bhagavan, Naya=\r\nna did tapas\nfor the freedom of this country. Do you think we will get free=\r\ndom?&quot; Sri\nBhagavan said, &quot;Why do you ask me? Am I an astrologer?&quot; After som=\r\ne time, Sri\nBhagavan turned to my uncle and said, &quot; Why do you worry? There=\r\n is a Supreme\nPower which carries the whole burden. Our job is to do our wo=\r\nrk and submit\nto it.&quot;\n\nOnce an Ashram deer was attacked by some animal and =\r\nthe wounds turned from\nbad to worse. Sri Bhagavan sat near the deer and hel=\r\nd its face in his hands,\nlooking at its tearful eyes. Sri Bhagavan sat like=\r\n that for a couple of\nhours. Chinnaswami asked my uncle who was standing cl=\r\nose to look after the\ndeer and relieve Sri Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan heard thi=\r\ns but did not make any\nresponse. Sri Bhagavan sat there till the deer breat=\r\nhed its last. That was\nthe compassion that Sri Bhagavan had for that deer. =\r\nSoon after, Sri Bhagavan\nwent to the hall. There is a Samadhi for the deer =\r\nin the Ashram.\n\nWhen the Mathrubhuteswara Temple was being constructed, Sri=\r\n Bhagavan used to\nhelp the construction workers by lifting the bricks and o=\r\nffering them to the\nmason. When my uncle saw Sri Bhagavan doing this type o=\r\nf work he was\nastonished. Sri Bhagavan said to my uncle, &quot;I am doing constr=\r\nuction work.&quot;\n\nHe Said, &quot;It is not for the sake of the husband, my dear, th=\r\nat he is loved,\nbut for one&#39;s own sake that he is loved. It is not for the =\r\nsake of the wife,\nmy dear, that she is loved, but for one&#39;s own sake that s=\r\nhe is loved. It is\nnot for the sake of the sons, my dear, that they are lov=\r\ned, but for one&#39;s\nown sake that they are loved.... It is not for the sake o=\r\nf all, my dear,\nthat all is loved, but for one&#39;s own sake that it is loved.=\r\n The Self, my\ndear Maitrey, should be realized, should be heard of, reflect=\r\ned on and\nmeditated upon. When the Self, my dear, is realized by being hear=\r\nd of,\nreflected on and meditated upon, all this is known.&quot; =E2=80=94 Brhada=\r\nranyaka\nUpanishad, Chapt.

Subrahm=\r\nanian (1928-1998), A Tribute&quot;, a book publish by the Hyderabad Kendram=\r\n in his memory. Dr. K. Subrahmanian relates in his own words about his earl=\r\ny years and how he was naturally drawn to the Maharshi, and also some anecd=\r\notes from his uncle&#39;s life.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;C=\r\noming into the Ramana Fold&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presentation Convent, the school t=\r\nhat my father worked for, used to prepare children for taking the Cambridge=\r\n University examination. The school was run by Irish nuns and almost all th=\r\ne children were European girls. My father was the only male teacher for a n=\r\number of years. In the 50s, one more male teacher was appointed to teach Hi=\r\nndi.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As the winter vacation was during Dec-Jan every year, my pare=\r\nnts would go from Kodaikanal to Tiruvannamalai to attend the Jayanti functi=\r\non. My father used to take English vegetables grown in Kodaikanal to the As=\r\nhram for the Jayanti celebrations. After attending the Jayanti, my parents =\r\nwould go to my father&#39;s village, Melvayalamoor, which is about 20 miles=\r\n from Tiruvannamalai. I was taken to Sri Bhagavan when I was two years old.=\r\n My two younger sisters and I used to be taken almost every year to Sri Ram=\r\nanasramam for the Jayanti celebrations. In our case we could say we were se=\r\nen by Sri Bhagavan first. We were conscious of seeing him much later.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;My uncle, who looked after our lands i=\r\nn Melva-yalamoor, was also a great devotee of Sri Bhagavan and Nayana [Kavy=\r\nakanta Ganapati Muni]. Both in my house and in my uncle&#39;s house there w=\r\nas always a picture of Sri Bhagavan in the puja room. If not every day, alm=\r\nost every week, there used to be some discussion or the other about the lif=\r\ne and teachings of Sri Bhagavan. From childhood I was brought up in a Bhaga=\r\nvan-charged atmosphere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Viswanatha Swami visited our house =\r\nand stayed with us for several days together on numerous occasions. Later, =\r\nwhen I was teaching at Madras Christian College, he stayed with me a couple=\r\n of times. He used to spend much of his time talking about the glory and gr=\r\nandeur of Sri Bhagavan and Nayana. He taught us a number of devotional song=\r\ns. He had a melodious voice and could sing beautifully.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Hearing fr=\r\nom my father, uncle and Viswanatha Swami that Sri Bhagavan used to read the=\r\n letters written by devotees to him, as a boy I used to write to him occasi=\r\nonally, seeking his blessings. As there was no high school in Kodaikanal, m=\r\ny father sent me to study at Sir P.S.Sivaswami Iyer High School, Tirukattup=\r\nally. I studied there for four years between 1941-45, from III Form to VI F=\r\norm, and stayed in the hostel attached to it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Talking to Sri Bhagavan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1941, I was =\r\ntaken by my uncle to Sri Ramanasramam. We had bought some mangoes and my un=\r\ncle said that I should put them on the small stool near Sri Bhagavan&#39;s =\r\nsofa. I went into the old meditation hall along with my uncle and put the m=\r\nangoes on the floor and prostrated before Sri Bhagavan and sat near the win=\r\ndow that now overlooks Sri Bhagavan&#39;s samadhi. My uncle sat next to me.=\r\n When I was looking at Sri Bhagavan, Sri Bhagavan asked my uncle, &quot;Who=\r\n is this?&quot; My uncle said, &quot;He is my brother&#39;s son. He is stud=\r\nying in III Form.&quot; Then Sri Bhagavan said, turning to me, &quot; So yo=\r\nu are the person writing letters to me.&quot; I had a strange feeling of aw=\r\ne, coupled with great joy. I said in a low voice, &quot;Yes.&quot; Sri Bhag=\r\navan said, &quot;Does your father send money to you so that you can write l=\r\netters to me?&quot; and laughed. I wasn&#39;t quite sure whether Sri Bhagav=\r\nan was being sarcastic or made the remark in a light vein. I sweated for a =\r\nwhile, continuing to look at him. As it was early in the morning, there wer=\r\ne only two or three devotees in the hall. When we came out of the hall afte=\r\nr some time, my uncle, who had been a frequent visitor to the Ashram for se=\r\nveral years, said, &quot;You must consider yourself very lucky. Sri Bhagava=\r\nn usually does not ask `Who is he?&#39; It is a rare thing.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Observing Sri Bhagavan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Till 1950, I used to visit the Ashram a couple of times every year; the =\r\nfrequency however increased between 1948 and 1950. I attended the Kumbhabhi=\r\nshekam of the Mathrubhuteswara Temple. It was an elaborate, solemn affair. =\r\nAfter the Kumbhabhishekam was performed, in the evening arati was offered t=\r\no the deity in the temple and was brought to Sri Bhagavan by Chinnaswami, V=\r\niswanatha Swami and President Venkataraman. I was sitting very close to Sri=\r\n Bhagavan in the meditation hall attached to the temple. It was a moving si=\r\nght when Sri Bhagavan extended his hands and touched the arati with great r=\r\neverence, closing his eyes.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Soon =\r\nafter each operation was performed on Sri Bhagavan&#39;s cancer, I used to =\r\nvisit him. Sometimes I used to cry uncontrollably looking at Sri Bhagavan f=\r\nrom a distance. As far as Sri Bhagavan was concerned, he was ever the same =\r\nserene, blissful Self. He behaved as if the cancer belonged to somebody els=\r\ne.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The last time I saw Sri Bhagavan was on 7th April, 1950,=\r\n exactly one week before his nirvana.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic=\r\n&quot;&gt;When I heard the news of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s nirvana at Kodaikanal, on 14t=\r\nh April, 1950, I did not break down, nor did I feel depressed. I felt a pea=\r\nce=E2=80=94a peace that was totally unexpected. Viswanatha Swami, whom I me=\r\nt a month later, also said that he enjoyed an indescribable peace at the ti=\r\nme of Sri Bhagavan&#39;s nirvana. He was one of the few who were inside the=\r\n room at the time Sri Bhagavan merged with Arunachala.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I wa=\r\ns taken to Sri Bhagavan as a small boy and I visited him many times later o=\r\nn, but I never put even a single question to him. I listened to others aski=\r\nng questions and Sri Bhagavan&#39;s replies to them, but I never felt incli=\r\nned to ask a question even once. The only thing I used to do was to sit clo=\r\nse to him and take leave of him after prostrating to him. Most often he wou=\r\nld nod his head or say in Tamil, &quot;sari, sari&quot; (O.K, O.K.).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Occasionally I used to think that it would be good to read Sri Bhagavan&=\r\n#39;s works in his presence. I tried a couple of times but I could not read=\r\n anything in his presence. I was either looking at him or meditating.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Close Encounters with Sri Bhagavan&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sometime in 1949, when Sri Bhagavan was still in the meditation =\r\nhall, I sat at the entrance looking at Sri Bhagavan from outside. His shoul=\r\nder was bandaged because of cancer. I thought to myself: &quot;I have been =\r\ncoming to the Ashram so often. But I have had no experience of real meditat=\r\nion. Sri Bhagavan has not granted me this experience.&quot; Thinking along =\r\nthese lines, I kept looking at Sri Bhagavan for a considerable time and the=\r\nn closed my eyes. I do not know how long I was in that state. When I opened=\r\n my eyes I found that the meditation hall was empty. Sri Bhagavan was not t=\r\nhere on the stone couch in the meditation hall. Sri Bhagavan and the devote=\r\nes must have gone past me as I was sitting at the entrance. When I realised=\r\n that I had been sitting when Sri Bhagavan went past me, I was horrified. I=\r\n felt how disrespectful I was. But suddenly, I realised that Sri Bhagavan, =\r\nout of his unbounded grace, granted me an experience whereby I was complete=\r\nly oblivious of my surroundings.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even today, I am unhappy that I d=\r\nid not get up when Sri Bhagavan and his devotees went past me. Sri Bhagavan=\r\n gives us rare experiences when we least expect them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On another occ=\r\nasion, when I was an 18-year-old student, around noon or so, I was walking =\r\ntowards the meditation hall. The new meditation hall was not there then; th=\r\ne whole place was an open ground. I was thinking of something and walking w=\r\nith my head down. When I neared the well, I looked up and saw Sri Bhagavan =\r\nstanding at a short distance and talking to a devotee. I was taken unawares=\r\n as I did not expect Sri Bhagavan to be there. Sri Bhagavan who was talking=\r\n to the other person, looked at me sideways. I stood still, as I did not wa=\r\nnt to disturb Sri Bhagavan in any way. When he looked at me that way, I fel=\r\nt a powerful light penetrate me and engulf me. I experienced a bliss that I=\r\n had not experienced before. I was in that state for about twenty days.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;My uncle, V. S. Srinivas Iyer, did his Intermediate at Voorhese Colle=\r\nge, Vellore and became village Munsiff of Vailamoor village and worked in t=\r\nhat capacity for over forty years. He saw Sri Bhagavan even as a student. I=\r\nn the early days, there used to be very few visitors to the Ashram, which w=\r\nas then just a thatched shed. Before he met Sri Bhagavan, my uncle had come=\r\n under the influence of Kavyakanta and had taken upadesa from him. This fac=\r\nt is mentioned in the Sanskrit biography of Kavyakanta, Vasishta Vaibhavam,=\r\n written by Kapali Sastry.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The first question that my uncle put to=\r\n Sri Bhagavan as a young man was, &quot;Is it true that Ravana had ten head=\r\ns.&quot; Sri Bhagavan replied, &quot;How does it help you to know whether h=\r\ne had ten heads or not?&quot; My uncle said, &quot;Nayana says it is all fa=\r\nlse.&quot; Sri Bhagavan replied, &quot;Nayana has studied a lot and has com=\r\ne to certain conclusions. What do I know?&quot; On another occasion my uncl=\r\ne asked Sri Bhagavan when he was going round the Hill, &quot;Bhagavan, Naya=\r\nna did tapas for the freedom of this country. Do you think we will get free=\r\ndom?&quot; Sri Bhagavan said, &quot;Why do you ask me? Am I an astrologer?&=\r\nquot; After some time,=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sri Bhagavan t=\r\nurned to my uncle and said, &quot; Why do you worry? There is a Supreme Pow=\r\ner which carries the whole burden. Our job is to do our work and submit to =\r\nit.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once an Ashram d=\r\neer was attacked by some animal and the wounds turned from bad to worse. Sr=\r\ni Bhagavan sat near the deer and held its face in his hands, looking at its=\r\n tearful eyes. Sri Bhagavan sat like that for a couple of hours. Chinnaswam=\r\ni asked my uncle who was standing close to look after the deer and relieve =\r\nSri Bhagavan. Sri Bhagavan heard this but did not make any response. Sri Bh=\r\nagavan sat there till the deer breathed its last. That was the compassion t=\r\nhat Sri Bhagavan had for that deer.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;Soon after, Sri Bhagavan we=\r\nnt to the hall. There is a Samadhi for the deer in the Ashram.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When the Mathrubhuteswara Temple was being co=\r\nnstructed, Sri Bhagavan used to help the construction workers by lifting th=\r\ne bricks and offering them to the mason.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0When my uncle saw Sri =\r\nBhagavan doing this type of work he was astonished. Sri Bhagavan said to my=\r\n uncle, &quot;I am doing construction work.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He Said, &quot;I=\r\nt is not for the sake of the husband, my dear, that he is loved, but for on=\r\ne&#39;s own sake that he is loved. It is not for the sake of the wife, my d=\r\near, that she is loved, but for one&#39;s own sake that she is loved. It is=\r\n not for the sake of the sons, my dear, that they are loved, but for one&#3=\r\n9;s own sake that they are loved.... It is not for the sake of all, my dear=\r\n, that all is loved, but for one&#39;s own sake that it is loved. The Self,=\r\n my dear Maitrey, should be realized, should be heard of, reflected on and =\r\nmeditated upon. When the Self, my dear, is realized by being heard of, refl=\r\nected on and meditated upon, all this is known.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=E2=80=94 Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, Chapt.
