See the mid section=\r\n highlighted which directly answer your questions.\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\nI do not remember the exact source of this m=\r\nessage but had in my hard disk so doing a reproduction from there.\n\nDear Na=\r\nrasimha, Sanjay and others\n\nGanesha. Why should one worship Ganesha or Rudr=\r\na or Chandika or Mahakala.\nIn fact can anybody actually worship any deity.\n=\r\n\n1. The fact of the matter is that one&#39;s mind will be drawn to the worship =\r\nof deities which one has worshipped in past lives.\n2. But, whether one will=\r\n achive or not with that aspect of the divine is based on\na. What is the re=\r\nsidue of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera basically is responsibl=\r\ne for this.One in a million\nindividuals will achieve the burning of the Kar=\r\nana Shareera. But when this is being done, then every karma done to that pe=\r\nrson\nto his body or mind, good or bad must have an almost hundred times mor=\r\ne intensity result, like for like.\n\nb. What is the intensity of the desire =\r\nof that person for the Divine Beloved?\nWhich again boils down to the amount=\r\n of karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thicker the overlay of karmas,=\r\n the lesser the desire to actually perform any kind of worship.\n\nPeople tal=\r\nk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.\nI find that it simply does not =\r\nmatter.\nEvery mantra is a name (nam), every nam has a form (rupa).\nSo, when=\r\n the mantra is chanted, the rupa is forming.\nWhere is the rupa forming?\nIn =\r\nthe physical body, mind, koshas and everywhere.\nSo the deity will actually =\r\noccupy the person.\nBut when can this happen?\nOnly when the body is dead. No=\r\nt dead physically, but in a different sense.\nie. ASANA: the mind forgets th=\r\ne body exists after a few hours of sitting really still for a few hours a d=\r\nay.\nPranayana: the mind reflects on the breath and feels it is alive, it tr=\r\nies to still the breath.\nDhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the mind, r=\r\nemember the body is dead for the mind at this stage.\nDharana: The mind perc=\r\nieves that form of God which is the object of the consciousness, but dualit=\r\ny exists.\nPratyahara: a phenomenon where the eyes do not see, the ears do n=\r\not hear.\nSamadhi: the rupa is so well established, that the ultimate form o=\r\nf that rupa, that mantra, the Nirguna manifests.\n\nSo the emptiness must com=\r\ne about in the mind and body about one&#39;s own identity before God fills it u=\r\np with His form.\nSo, mantra is simply a tool to make us realise God. Anybod=\r\ny can do mantras, but most people&#39;s internal fire or Agni is\nnot really cha=\r\nrged up to digest these.\nJapa is no doubt great, but it is involved with th=\r\ne purification of air, whereas fire is involved in the purification of inte=\r\nrnal fire.\nWhen internal fire is purified, then the ability to visualise yo=\r\nur deity becomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is easy and moreover, Ag=\r\nni is a living God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen by your physical eyes=\r\n.\nIt moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally when it dies, it conti=\r\nnues to live on within the sadhaka.\nIn Kali Yuga, this ability to call a li=\r\nving God into the house is so powerful and so exhalting that later on japa =\r\nafter homam\nbrings very fast results.\n*******************************\nWhy G=\r\nanesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in any case are not desti=\r\nned to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way they will pursue some=\r\n sadhana is if they are given some material result quite quickly by their s=\r\nadhana.\nThose who have problems in career, litigation, problems with marria=\r\nge or in finding life partner, problems with education or speech can really=\r\n advance their mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.\nI have seen this nu=\r\nmerous times myself with people who are in this movement and outside.\nThat =\r\nis not to say that Ganapati can&#39;t give Mukti. The ultimate form of Ganapati=\r\n is the word of God.\nAnd He is sakshama in giving Mukti as well.\n**********=\r\n**************************\nThe mahamantras are many and I agree that some m=\r\nay say that lets do this(mahamantras) first.\nBUT,\nThe Vedic mahamantras req=\r\nuire the kind of intonation so perfect with visualisation at different bits=\r\n of the body with various syllables, that for most people this is not feasi=\r\nble, especially since their Sanskrit itself is somewhat imperfect.(remember=\r\n name is form, if name is not repeated properly then how will the form be?)=\r\n(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati for rakshati in Pune many years=\r\n ago).\nAnd then there are mahamantras which are ok with almost any intonati=\r\non. If someone wants to follow this that is also ok.\nBut, with any mantra s=\r\nadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya. Because, the entrance to Shakti at Sus=\r\nhumna is guarded by Him.\n\nAgain some doubt comes into people&#39;s heads about =\r\nsome mantras harming them when recited:\nIf somebody experiences bad things =\r\nwhen a mantra of a certain deity is recited then all it means is that the k=\r\narmas of the Karana shareera are being dealt with(by the deity) quite fast,=\r\n so they have to be experienced. It actually means that the Devata is close=\r\n and more intense sadhana is needed.\n\nActually, all this business about man=\r\ntra and mahamantra is immaterial, Allah malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.\nUs pa=\r\nrvardigar se prarthana kar, woh sab raste khol deta hai.\n------------------=\r\n-------------------\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\n=C2=A0\nRavi Gollapalli.\n=C2=A0\n\n\n-=\r\n-- On Tue, 2/16/10, biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: biswa108 =\r\n&lt;biswa1975@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] About Ganapati Homam...Can it=\r\n bring prosperity and peace?\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday=\r\n, February 16, 2010, 10:57 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nNAMASKAR\n\nDear Gurujis,\n\nI have =\r\nstarted MAHAGANAPATI HOMAM, though started with super-short procedure, now =\r\nI am including more rituals and sanskrit verse from the short procedure eve=\r\nntually.. .\n\nNow I am asking some bare minimum questions...\n\n1.
