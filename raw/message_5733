Yet they had to do whatever was possible in a \nspirit of detachmen=\r\nt leaving the result to the Lord. As long as she was \nconscious, Bhagavan g=\r\nave her spiritual instructions. When she lost consciousness \nGanapati Muni\n=\r\nand others commenced vedic chants, some others chanted the Rama-nama.\n\nAfte=\r\nr the violent gasps (urdhva-swasa) began, Bhagavan placed his right hand on=\r\n \nher heaving heart and the left one on her head. He looked at her intently=\r\n. The \nday passed that way. Subsequently Bhagavan himself narrated what had=\r\n happened \nthus:\n\nThe latent tendencies and thoughts which are the cause of=\r\n future births flared \nup. She had just then lost consciousness of the exte=\r\nrnal world. Hence in the \nsubtle world her subtle body was witnessing scene=\r\n after scene of what was to \nhappen. By this sequence of experiences, the s=\r\noul went through the future births \nand travelled towards the highest.\n\nHow=\r\n could she experience this? It was because of the current of Bhagavan&#39;s \nsp=\r\niritual power transmitted by touch that she experienced all within herself,=\r\n \nwithout having to be born over and over again. There was a battle between=\r\n her \nsoul forces and Bhagavan&#39;s spiritual power in which her latent tenden=\r\ncies \ngradually weakened and ultimately got vanquished. Bhagavan actually d=\r\nescribed \nthe scenes she witnessed in the subtle state including their inte=\r\nnsity.\n\nThe end came peacefully by eight in the night. Among those present,=\r\n Ganapati and \nNiranjanananda Swami heard a sound indicative of the mother&#39;=\r\ns death.\n\nIn this manner, the mother&#39;s individuality submerged in Atma, God=\r\n. She attained \nmahanirvana. She had no more births. Due to her son, who wa=\r\ns Arunachala in human \nform, she attained mukti or became established in th=\r\ne Atma.\n\nMother&#39;s body acquired a new brilliance which persisted till the a=\r\nbhisheka on \nthe following day As the mother&#39;s end was nearing nobody in th=\r\ne ashram ate \nanything that day. After her end, the Maharshi got up, and wi=\r\nth no trace of \ngrief said, &quot;We may now eat. There is no pollution.&quot; How co=\r\nuld there be any \npollution when they were in the presence of the Lord in w=\r\nhom the holy lady \nmerged? Such a body was a holy shrine in itself. The ash=\r\nramites had a quiet \nmeal.\n\n\nThe entire night passed in the singing of devo=\r\ntional songs. According to \nManavasi Ramaswamy Iyer, &quot;Bhagavan had no grief=\r\n whatever. On the other hand, he \nappeared to be relieved like a bird relea=\r\nsed from a cage.&quot; These words were \nrecorded in his diary. True, why did he=\r\n have to grieve?\n\nThe mother attained the supreme state. Some days after th=\r\ne event somebody \nremarked to the Maharshi, &quot;Mother has passed away.&quot; Immed=\r\niately Bhagavan \ncorrected him saying &quot;No, mother has merged, she has becom=\r\ne one.&quot;\n\nOn another occasion, when the matter of his according mukti to the=\r\n mother came \nup, Bhagavan said, &quot;Yes my attempt in her case was successful=\r\n. Earlier, in the \ncase of Palaniswami I attempted the same. Thinking that =\r\nhe had attained the \nultimate I removed my hand, thereupon he opened his ey=\r\nes. The prana passed \nthrough the eyes. That is how my attempt at that time=\r\n failed.&quot; On still another \noccasion, Bhagavan said, &quot;Where has mother gone=\r\n? She is here.&quot; Hence there need \nbe no doubt as to where Alagammal had dep=\r\narted. The Maharashi meant that she \nmerged in Easwara and was with him (as=\r\n he also was abiding in the atma).\n\nMother has not passed away. She has mer=\r\nged. She has become one.\n\nThe question as to whether the body was to be cre=\r\nmated or buried came up on the \nvery night of mother&#39;s expiry.\n\nBhagavan po=\r\ninted out that according to chapter 13 of Ramana Gita the body of one \nwho =\r\nattained mukti was to be buried and not cremated. The disciples decided to =\r\n\nbury the body. Early next dawn, they carried the body from Skandasramam do=\r\nwn the \nhill to a spot near Paliteertham.\n\nMeanwhile, some relatives from o=\r\nther places came and though they argued in \nfavour of a cremation, they wer=\r\ne overruled. The news of the mother&#39;s death \npassed round the town, in spit=\r\ne of every effort to keep it private. As a result, \nnumerous people turned =\r\nup at the burial ground.Your text goes here.\n\nA pit was dug below an aswath=\r\na tree. The body was lowered into it. The pit was \nfilled with camphor, vib=\r\nhuti, salt and other aromatic materials and later \ncovered. The disciples e=\r\nrected a brick samadhi and by some coincidence, a Siva \nlinga from Kasi arr=\r\nived just then. It was placed atop the samadhi and named, \nMatrubhuteswara =\r\n(Mother who was Easwara).\n\nThe Swami was watching the proceedings as a mere=\r\n witness.With the samadhi of the \nmother the son&#39;s filial duty ended.\n\nAs S=\r\nwami had entreated Arunachala in 1914, the mother was consumed not by the \n=\r\nfire of cremation but by the fire of Jnana .\n\nFor the Mahapooja day, Ganapa=\r\nti Muni wrote six verses entitled Soundaryamba \nshatkam (Six verses on Soun=\r\ndaryamba) ? (Soundaryamba has the same meaning as \nAlagamma). This is the s=\r\nubstance of the verses:\n\n1. In the first quarter of the night of Friday, th=\r\ne ninth day of the dark \nfortnight of Vaisakha month, Dundubhi year\n\n2. Wif=\r\ne of Sundaram born in the exalted lineage of Bharadwaja, Parasara and \nmoth=\r\ner of Ramana Maharshi born as an avatara of Guruguha (Subrahmanya) , the \nb=\r\nlessed lady,\n\n3. One devoid of any attachment, one cleansed by bhakti to Si=\r\nva, one whose prana \nwas arrested by the touch of Guha (Ramana Maharshi), o=\r\nne whose tendencies were \nall destroyed that very moment\n\n4. She, Soundarya=\r\nmba, became that Light which can be known only by the Vedantic \nVakyas, whi=\r\nch is all-pervasive, and which was known by her son.\n\n5. At that samadhi of=\r\n Soundaryamba the stream which poured out of the lotus \npalms of Ramana Mah=\r\narshi became a new teertha, the Aghasamana teertha (the \nteertha which remo=\r\nves all sins).\n\n6. Glory to the holy mother of sacred Ramana!\nGlory to the =\r\nsamadhi!\nGlory to the linga consecrated by the Maharshi!\nGlory to the new A=\r\nghasamana teertha!\n\nThe Maharshi later said something interesting. After he=\r\nr passing away, \nAlagammal&#39;s body acquired a new brilliance which persisted=\r\n till the abhisheka on \nthe following\nday at the time of samadhi; it disapp=\r\neared soon after water was poured. Further, \nat the last breath in all case=\r\ns a faint sound emanates. In the mother&#39;s case, \nBhagavan did not notice it=\r\n but others present did.\n\nEvery year, to commemorate the anniversary, pooja=\r\n is performed to \nMatrubhuteswara. Thousands of devotees from various parts=\r\n of the world assemble \nto join the observance.\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF   \n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=82 \n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81  \n\n\n  \n\n=\r\n\n      \r\n--0-1524875046-1296449723=:18823\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:14pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: =\r\n12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;swami Vivekananda wanted his body to be cremated and not buried=\r\n&lt;br&gt;are yogis in north cremated instead of being buried?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;padding-left: 5px; margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; border-lef=\r\nt: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); font-family: times new roman,new york,times,=\r\nserif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram &l=\r\nt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Sat, April 17, 2010 11:17:20 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Incidents Related To Ramana Ma=\r\nharshi&#39;s Mother Alagammal&#39;s MahaNirvana&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n    =\r\n  \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;\nMay 19, 1922 (Dundubhi year and Vaisakha month) was her last day; ever=\r\nyone could sense the impending end that day.

Glory to the hol=\r\ny mother of sacred Ramana!&lt;br&gt;Glory to the samadhi!&lt;br&gt;Glory to the linga c=\r\nonsecrated by the Maharshi!&lt;br&gt;Glory to the new Aghasamana teertha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe Maharshi later said something interesting. After her passing away, Alag=\r\nammal&#39;s body acquired a new brilliance which persisted till the abhisheka o=\r\nn the following&lt;br&gt;\n\nday at the time of samadhi; it disappeared soon after =\r\nwater was poured. Further, at the last breath in all cases a faint sound em=\r\nanates. In the mother&#39;s case, Bhagavan did not notice it but others present=\r\n did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nEvery year, to commemorate the anniversary, pooja is perform=\r\ned to Matrubhuteswara. Thousands of devotees from various parts of the worl=\r\nd assemble to join the&nbsp;observance.&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;col=\r\nor: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 87%;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82 &nbsp;=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B &nbsp;=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 &nbsp;=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 &nbsp;=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF &nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D &nbsp;=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=\r\n=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; c=\r\nontent=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1524875046-1296449723=:18823--\r\n\n"}}
