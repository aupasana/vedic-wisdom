I have just now finished typing a long post on another \nthread. However I=\r\n will address both your questions in another post hopefully \nwithin a week =\r\nor so at the earliest that I can. I will also elaborate a little \nmore on t=\r\nhe role of intiation in mantramarga. Except for mantra sadhana, \ninitiation=\r\n is not a mandatory requirement in any other form of sadhana. It is a \ndiff=\r\nerent matter though that the idea has been appropriated by practitioners \ns=\r\ntudying even predominantly secular disciplines such as music, dance, astrol=\r\nogy \netc, causing a lot of unwanted and unhealthy confusion. No doubt, spir=\r\nitualising \nthese secular subjects makes them more wonderful and inspiring.=\r\n It is the false \npretense of certain unscrupulous self-proclaimed gurus of=\r\n material vidyas that I \nam cautioning against. It is mantra sadhana alone =\r\nas enjoined by the Tantras \nthat requires initiation. Nowhere else is it a =\r\nrequirement. I will deal with the \nrest in my next post.\n\nRegards,\nSatya Pr=\r\nakash \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Satya Prakash ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your beautiful=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0analysis of Sri Sri Chandi. I read it and \n&gt;reflected \n&gt;\n&gt; on it, and=\r\n in my limited understand I agree to most of what you have said. \n&gt; Special=\r\nly your explanation pertaining to=C3=82=C2=A0Chand-munda and=C3=82=C2=A0Sum=\r\nbha-Nishumbh were \n&gt;\n&gt; awesome!\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a question about your following=\r\n paragraph:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and d=\r\no the sadhana as per \n\n&gt; the mantra marga. It is this particular approach t=\r\nhat needs initiation as per \n&gt; its own principles. Initiation is not mandat=\r\nory if one adopts the Vedantic path \n&gt;\n&gt; of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogi=\r\nc path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the \n&gt; Pauranic approach of reading=\r\n the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam \n&gt; too is not required if=\r\n one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice \n&gt;\n&gt; of Ritual/Ya=\r\ngnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri \n&gt;Sri \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Chandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing \n&gt;tr=\r\naditions \n&gt;\n&gt; of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally i=\r\nn various parts of \n&gt;\n&gt; the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tan=\r\ntra marga and hence the \n&gt; importance of initiation for those paths, be it =\r\nSri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) I had talked to a few people who =\r\nadhere to different paramparas within the \n&gt; broader subset of Kalikula. Th=\r\ney said that the initiation in Chandi sadhana in \n\n&gt; required for not only =\r\nthe parayana but also (mostly?) because of the main \n&gt; mantra. Normally we =\r\nare accustomed with only the navarna mantra, but there are \n\n&gt; various othe=\r\nr mantras of the different aspects of the Universal Chandi, of \n&gt;which \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n the navarna we know of, is probably the mildest. To chant one of these man=\r\ntras \n\n&gt; and awaken the same needs initiation. This, they said, is a part o=\r\nf the entire \n\n&gt; Chandi sadhana.=C3=82=C2=A0What=C3=82=C2=A0is your opinion=\r\n on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) As a corollary to your above paragraph, one can therefore=\r\n read the text of \n&gt; the Chandi in a pouranik approach, as a sacred myth? T=\r\nhere are people, \n&gt;specially \n&gt;\n&gt; in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on their o=\r\nwn without having undergone any formal \n&gt;\n&gt; initiation.

Since the last \n&gt;4-5 \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;years I have pref=\r\nerred to stay away from internet forums due to various \n&gt;reasons. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;It =\r\nhas been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However \n&gt;a=\r\nfter \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my wri=\r\nte up to my \n&gt; &gt;inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through som=\r\ne posts. I am happy \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to note that the general atmosphere here is far b=\r\netter and more sincere than a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;lot of other forums. Having quickly bro=\r\nwsed through this particular thread, I \n\n&gt; &gt;thought that I might reply to U=\r\ntpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question rega=\r\nrding the necessity of \n&gt; &gt;initiation. I will address it after summarizing =\r\nthe big picture that needs to \n&gt;be \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;invoked in order to understand the=\r\n ONE question and the MANY answers possible. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Firstly is the question =\r\na general or specific one? Generally speaking if the \n&gt; &gt;question is whethe=\r\nr initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life \n&gt;or \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;sadha=\r\nna, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the =\r\nanswer \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;YES.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric a=\r\ndage goes; thereby the necessity \n&gt;for \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;multiple approaches and multip=\r\nle paths. Thus arises the inevitability of \n&gt; &gt;multiple perspectives. In th=\r\ne pan-Indian context there are many paths for \n&gt; &gt;sadhana. But in the curre=\r\nnt context of this question I will restrict myself to \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;only the five t=\r\nhat are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedan=\r\ntic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path an=\r\nd/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practical=\r\nisation of the great abstract \n&gt;Truths \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;of the Cosmos. Each of the abo=\r\nve paths EMPHASISES particular methods and \n&gt; &gt;techniques in its attempt to=\r\n practicalise the abstract truths at an \n&gt;experiential \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;level. Let us =\r\nbriefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by \n\n&gt; &gt;each o=\r\nf these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advait=\r\na, strictly speaking \n\n&gt; &gt;even the external guru is not necessary, though o=\r\nne can greatly benefit from \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;wisdom and experience of a genuine =\r\nteacher. The direct path of Advaita \n&gt; &gt;emphasises the methods of Viveka (D=\r\niscernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). \n\n&gt; &gt;Advaita being essentially a=\r\n culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;vaidik practi=\r\nce of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an \n&gt;important \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a \n&gt;=\r\nmarginal \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises =\r\nAbhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and \n&gt; &gt;Vairagya (Non-reacti=\r\nvity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga \n&gt;additionally \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;emphasi=\r\nse &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) \n&gt;too =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first =\r\ntwo as \n&gt;they \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Lov=\r\ne/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s \n\n&gt; &gt;will throu=\r\ngh total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in \n&gt; &gt;Karm=\r\na marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in \n&gt;actio=\r\nns \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga o=\r\nf the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadh=\r\nana where alone the \n&gt; &gt;inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the =\r\nnecessity of a Guru arises. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Mantra sadhana involves the practicalizat=\r\nion of certain occult truths via the \n\n&gt; &gt;energetics of Sabda through the e=\r\nmployment of Vak. It presupposes certain \n&gt; &gt;dangers inherent to any lab ex=\r\nperiment and thereby certain regulations and \n&gt;safe \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;practices. It sho=\r\nuld be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke \n\n&gt; &gt;Fire or A=\r\ngni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the \n&gt; &gt;ref=\r\nerence here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another th=\r\ne fire of \n\n&gt; &gt;speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the p=\r\nhysical fire of \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of i=\r\nnvoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the \n&gt; &gt;lab-like practical =\r\nmantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful \n&gt;techniques \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;that =\r\nbring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara \n&gt;i=\r\ns \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a=\r\n child to \n&gt; &gt;experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the superv=\r\nisor need \n&gt; &gt;experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment=\r\n proper training \n\n&gt; &gt;and experience are part of the procedure apart from c=\r\nertain safety measures, \n&gt;in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the Tantric lab experiment too. However =\r\nthe lab is one&#39;s own consciousness \n&gt; &gt;whilst the experiment is awakening t=\r\nhe Sakti within the individual \n&gt;consciousness \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;(also referred to as K=\r\nundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere \n&gt; &gt;intellectualisation, I=\r\n will refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. \n\n&gt; &gt;Without going =\r\ninto other needless details here, I will just elaborate on \n&gt; &gt;initiation a=\r\nnd Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one =\r\nhas to contextualise it within \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the larger Tantric context too. Sakti =\r\nsadhana is one major river within the \n&gt; &gt;Tantric context. The Dasha Maha V=\r\nidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas \n&gt; &gt;comprehensively. However there ar=\r\ne actually three major schools that are \n&gt; &gt;full-fledged living traditions =\r\namong the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tarakula. Sri Sri =\r\nChandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana \n\n&gt; &gt;belongs to=\r\n Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas \n&gt;among \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with=\r\n \n&gt;Tibetan \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri =\r\nTara Devi. Vajrayana \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the =\r\nSakta sadhanas in its approach \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predom=\r\ninantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) \n\n&gt; &gt;while Sri =\r\nkula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nthe internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are a=\r\nll \n\n&gt; &gt;consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for e=\r\nach of \n&gt;these \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry o=\r\nf the practitioner into \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;particular spiritual lineage of that path=\r\n (kula). The Guru parampara can be \n&gt; &gt;compared to an INVERTED TREE with SI=\r\nVA himself at the root from where the \n&gt;trunk \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;arises. Each branch and=\r\n sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively \n&gt;downward \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;till the =\r\nindividual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise \n&gt;it. \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is=\r\n held by \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the =\r\ncircuit necessary \n\n&gt; &gt;for the conduit of electricity but also prevents sho=\r\nrt circuit. Imagine many \n&gt; &gt;beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this i=\r\nnverted tree of live wires, \n&gt;where \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;there is a long series of sadhaka=\r\ns sitting in silent practice all the way up \n&gt; &gt;till Siva himself. It is a =\r\ndynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Now back to Sri S=\r\nri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti w=\r\nithin the individual \n&gt; &gt;consciousness through an integrated approach that =\r\ncombines the practices of \n&gt; &gt;Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both K=\r\nalikula and Srikula have evolved \n\n&gt; &gt;into highly comprehensive and integra=\r\nted approaches that can simultaneously \n&gt;hold \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the many in the One. Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic \n&gt;approach. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However i=\r\nt is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. \n&gt;It \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. T=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt;question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantr=\r\namarga and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those w=\r\nho explore the text \n&gt;as \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more r=\r\nelevant which I have covered \n&gt; &gt;extensively in my write-up. For those who =\r\nare already inclined to the Advaitic \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;path, Sri Sri Chandi provides th=\r\ne context for immensely powerful reflections \n&gt; &gt;through its central messag=\r\ne of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the text is the =\r\nMahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged \n&gt; &gt;Upanishadi=\r\nc fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nthis universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the \n=\r\n&gt;other \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central truth =\r\nof Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in Engli=\r\nsh or any other \n&gt;regional \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;language is because understanding the mean=\r\ning and constant reflection are \n&gt; &gt;possible only when one repeatedly reads=\r\n the text in a language that they can \n&gt; &gt;fully follow. The main idea of th=\r\ne writeup is to explore the text as an \n&gt;Advaitic \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and Yogic text too =\r\napart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri \n&gt;Sri \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Chand=\r\ni is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially \n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or t=\r\nhe \n&gt;Veda \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence =\r\nthe practice of \n&gt; &gt;Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the origi=\r\nnal Vedic method will \n&gt; &gt;straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central =\r\nVedic practice. In fact even \n\n&gt; &gt;the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu t=\r\nemple is fully based on and DERIVED \n&gt; &gt;from a one on one mapping of the Ve=\r\ndic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do =\r\nthe Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;sadhana in accordance=\r\n with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Tantric=\r\n approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this \n&gt; &gt;partic=\r\nular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. \n&gt;Initiation=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vicha=\r\nra, or the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic a=\r\npproach of reading \n&gt;the \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam=\r\n too is not required if one is not \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;inclined to the predominantly Vaid=\r\nik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may \n&gt;benefit \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;from any or all of th=\r\nese approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;in mind tha=\r\nt the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as \n&gt; &gt;Sriku=\r\nla as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent \n&gt;originall=\r\ny \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initia=\r\ntion for \n&gt; &gt;those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In su=\r\nmmary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the \n&gt; &gt;merthods/prac=\r\ntices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, \n&gt; &gt;Iswarapranidhan=\r\na, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;all e=\r\nffective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., \n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practiti=\r\noners. \n&gt;One \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;may progress through a combination of any of these metho=\r\nds in spiritual life. \n\n&gt; &gt;However the *full-fledged* integrated approach o=\r\nf KALIKULA involves Mantra \n&gt; &gt;diksha too. It is this big picture against w=\r\nhich the answer to the question \n&gt;has \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFinally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is reg=\r\nular \n&gt; &gt;self-study of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded=\r\n in the \n&gt;texts. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;This is best done in a language that one is fully co=\r\nnversant with. As for \n&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among a=\r\nll methods. Swadhyaya is the \n\n&gt; &gt;alternate method (though not as powerful)=\r\n where Satsangha is not possible. It \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Satsangha and satsangha alo=\r\nne that enables one to make rapid progress in \n&gt; &gt;spiritual life. Sri Ramak=\r\nrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of \n&gt; &gt;serving, listening =\r\nto and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in \n\n&gt; &gt;his younger=\r\n days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap \n&gt;in \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who com=\r\nplain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just \n\n&gt; &gt;quote Swam=\r\ni Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays th=\r\nat there are no \n&gt;good \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company o=\r\nf Sadhus is a question of supply \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and demand. If there is a sincere de=\r\nmand, the supply will come at once. This \n&gt;is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;the inexorable law of n=\r\nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find your \n&gt; &gt;Master at your thr=\r\neshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;passion =\r\nand unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nwaste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become =\r\na \n&gt; &gt;hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you comp=\r\nlain: `I \n\n&gt; &gt;cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhik=\r\nari first. Then \n&gt; &gt;come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of bless=\r\ned souls who will put \n&gt;you \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;in the right path, guide you and elevate =\r\nyou to sublime heights. These \n&gt; &gt;&quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to =\r\nget hold of the right type of \n&gt; &gt;aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real s=\r\neekers are few. If you bring a \n&gt;charge, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&quot;There are no good Mahatmas.=\r\n&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;no real seekers af=\r\nter Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an =\r\nopportunity for Satsangha. \n&gt;Conducted \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;with the appropriate bhavana, =\r\nthis group too is a potential Satsangha though \n&gt;not \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;comparable to th=\r\ne actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Chandi=\r\n as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the upli=\r\nfting \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and =\r\nreflection, by \n\n&gt; &gt;discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere dis=\r\ncussions on a group \n&gt;such \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;as this, one makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least for a while. However I mig=\r\nht \n&gt; &gt;participate in some discussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Sa=\r\ntya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this=\r\n message of respected Narasimha Garu few times. Frankly, i found \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;it r=\r\noutine because i found that i know all these already as he has so many \n&gt;ti=\r\nmes \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;mentioned these things and then it suddenly occoured to me that h=\r\ne has given \n&gt; &gt;answer to a very very crucial query which keep on haunting =\r\nmany people and \n&gt; &gt;confuse people a lot. I am obviously talking about &quot;Ini=\r\ntiation&quot; and he has \n&gt; &gt;really given an answer to this greatly confusing ph=\r\nenomina. I am reproducing \n&gt; &gt;this again below. for me i am completely sati=\r\nsfied with simple but very \n&gt; &gt;effective defination. i would draw attention=\r\n of members to following paragraph \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;again:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If =\r\nyou want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, \n&gt;do \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not =\r\nknow \n&gt;how \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any m=\r\naterial results or \n&gt; &gt;spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desi=\r\nres. I will accept \n&gt;whatever \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;god gives. I want to increase my devoti=\r\non and surrender and make spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initi=\r\nation is not required.

However, one without a rich father is still better off=\r\n opening a \n&gt;bank \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;account with a zero balance and building it up slow=\r\nly with one&#39;s own hard \n&gt;work. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Similarly, one not finding a guru can =\r\nstill do sadhana with famous mantras and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;build one&#39;s own spiritual ac=\r\ncount. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as \n&gt;a \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;formality, but =\r\ntruly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;do=\r\n it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (=\r\ni) for getting \n&gt; &gt;specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasin=\r\ng surrender and making \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initi=\r\nation is not that important. \n&gt;But, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;in the case of (i), there are pit=\r\nfalls and a guru can prepare one \n&gt;sufficiently. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;One can get in troub=\r\nle otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are v=\r\nery few people who can do \n&gt;(i) \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;now-a-days. Nature has destabilized t=\r\nhe whole system, for a reason, as Kali \n&gt; &gt;progressed. I suggest doing mant=\r\nras and rituals only for increasing surrender, \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;getting whatever mater=\r\nial results god wants to give and making spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress. If one is =\r\nmeant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material \n&gt; &gt;results (for ones=\r\nelf or others or society/universe in general), Nature will \n&gt;make \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;arr=\r\nangements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If=\r\n you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any \n&gt;homam, \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not=\r\n know \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any ma=\r\nterial results \n&gt;or \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my d=\r\nesires. I will accept \n&gt;whatever \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;god gives. I want to increase my dev=\r\notion and surrender and make spiritual \n&gt; &gt;progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. In=\r\nitiation is not required. That attitude itself \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewe=\r\nr hiccups. \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hi=\r\nccups. I gave this \n&gt; &gt;analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is takin=\r\ng rotten fruits from a \n&gt;fruit \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;basket and throwing them in garbage an=\r\nd trying to retrieve one good fruit from \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;under them. If the person is=\r\n gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of \n\n&gt; &gt;rotten fruits on the=\r\n floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one \n&gt;may \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;do it =\r\nfast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But \n&gt;th=\r\ne \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. =\r\nSimilarly, \n\n&gt; &gt;phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to=\r\n take bad fruits \n&gt;and \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;throw them in garbage and give you a good frui=\r\nt to eat. There may be some \n&gt; &gt;spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vi=\r\nshnu or Lakshmi may take more time \n&gt;to \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;get out the good fruit, but t=\r\nhe spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like \n\n&gt; &gt;Chandi or Bhairava or=\r\n Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good \n&gt; &gt;fruit comes out=\r\n faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not dei=\r\nty&#39;s creations, but \n&gt; &gt;fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you wo=\r\nuld&#39;ve had to eat each of \n&gt; &gt;those rotten fruits before eating the good fr=\r\nuits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage=\r\n of rotten fruits is \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chand=\r\ni and staying with gentler \n&gt; &gt;deities. If initiation if made mandatory, on=\r\ne can be assessed by a guru before \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;starting a practice. If you realiz=\r\ne the above, you can start mantras without \n&gt; &gt;initiation. If some bad resu=\r\nlts occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit \n&gt;of \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;your own actio=\r\nns and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you \n&gt;are \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;w=\r\neak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who =\r\nnever lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of \n&gt; &gt;rituals, are doing =\r\ndaily homam now. Some people who took several hours to read \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Saptashat=\r\ni for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam \n&gt; &gt;wit=\r\nh entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a \n=\r\n&gt;lot \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they have done =\r\nsadhana with \n&gt; &gt;fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in=\r\n some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank mat=\r\nerialism, if someone has even a \n\n&gt; &gt;faint idea that spiritual progress is =\r\nimportant, is looking for god and is \n&gt; &gt;attracted to a specific advanced s=\r\nadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person \n&gt; &gt;obviously has some good karmas an=\r\nd good vasanas. That person has done that \n&gt; &gt;sadhana in the past. Previous=\r\n life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a=\r\n good understanding of what is what, how things work, \n&gt;why \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;one shoul=\r\nd do something, how to do it, what is more important and what is less \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;important, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish =\r\nWritings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal opinion th=\r\nat Strong and long standing urge should be \n\n&gt; &gt;considered as Initiation at=\r\n least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi p=\r\naatha regularly but was \n&gt;not \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;able to almost for a year.

I w=\r\nill also elaborate a little more on the role of intiation in mantramarga. E=\r\nxcept for mantra sadhana, initiation is not a mandatory requirement in any =\r\nother form of sadhana. It is a different matter though that the idea has be=\r\nen appropriated by practitioners studying even predominantly secular discip=\r\nlines such as music, dance, astrology etc, causing a lot of unwanted and un=\r\nhealthy confusion. No doubt, spiritualising these secular subjects makes th=\r\nem more wonderful and inspiring. It is the false pretense of certain unscru=\r\npulous self-proclaimed gurus of material vidyas that I am cautioning agains=\r\nt. It is mantra sadhana alone as enjoined by the Tantras that requires init=\r\niation. Nowhere else is it a requirement. I will deal with the\n rest in my =\r\nnext post.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;Satya Prakash &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, r=\r\najarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Satya Prak=\r\nash ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you for your beautiful=C3=82&nbsp;analysis o=\r\nf Sri Sri Chandi. I read it and reflected &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on it, and in my limited=\r\n understand I agree to most of what you have said. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Specially your =\r\nexplanation pertaining to=C3=82&nbsp;Chand-munda and=C3=82&nbsp;Sumbha-Nish=\r\numbh were &lt;BR&gt;&gt; awesome!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have a question about your f=\r\nollowing paragraph:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;there are those who adhere to =\r\nthe Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the mantra marga. I=\r\nt is this particular approach that needs initiation as per &lt;BR&gt;&gt; its own=\r\n principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path\n &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, o=\r\nr even the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacre=\r\nd Myth. Likewise Homam &lt;BR&gt;&gt; too is not required if one is not inclined =\r\nto the predominantly Vaidik practice &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Ritual/Yagnya. One may ben=\r\nefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Chandi. Howeve=\r\nr one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various par=\r\nts of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga=\r\n and hence the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri=\r\n Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) I had talked=\r\n to a few people who adhere to different paramparas within the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bro=\r\nader subset of Kalikula. They said that the initiation in Chandi sadhana in=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; required for not only the parayana but also (mostly?)\n because of=\r\n the main &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mantra. Normally we are accustomed with only the navarna=\r\n mantra, but there are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; various other mantras of the different aspe=\r\ncts of the Universal Chandi, of which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the navarna we know of, is p=\r\nrobably the mildest. To chant one of these mantras &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and awaken the =\r\nsame needs initiation. This, they said, is a part of the entire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ch=\r\nandi sadhana.=C3=82&nbsp;What=C3=82&nbsp;is your opinion on this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; 2) As a corollary to your above paragraph, one can therefore read t=\r\nhe text of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Chandi in a pouranik approach, as a sacred myth? Th=\r\nere are people, specially &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in Bengal, who do a Chandipath on their =\r\nown without having undergone any formal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; initiation. How good or ba=\r\nd is this practise?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ________________________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Cc: mindcareclinic@...&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Mon, 18 October, 2010 8:54:40 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Fwd: Initiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Meaning)&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am forwarding a reply sent by Dr S=\r\natya Prakash Choudhary.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:10:=\r\n31 -0000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;mindcareclinic@...&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom-owner%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom-owner%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom-owner@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Initi=\r\nation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Meaning)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All Glories to the Godde=\r\nss!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I am Satya Prakash, the author of the write-=\r\nup posted here. Since the last 4-5 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;years I have preferred to s=\r\ntay away from internet forums due to various reasons. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;It has b=\r\neen nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However after &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my wri=\r\nte up to my &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed th=\r\nrough some posts. I am happy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;to note that the general atmosphe=\r\nre here is far better and more sincere than a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;lot of other for=\r\nums. Having quickly browsed through this particular thread, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nthought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessity of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big\n picture =\r\nthat needs to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;invoked in order to understand the ONE questi=\r\non and the MANY answers possible. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Firstly is the question a ge=\r\nneral or specific one? Generally speaking if the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;question is w=\r\nhether initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the nece=\r\nssity of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Ta=\r\nntra marga*, the answer is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;YES.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;Mu=\r\nnde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity fo=\r\nr &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inev=\r\nitability of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context =\r\nthere are many paths for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;sadhana. But in the current context o=\r\nf this question I will restrict myself to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;only the five that a=\r\nre relevant to the discussion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n a. Gnana marga (=\r\nAdvaitic/Vedantic)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation=\r\n of the great abstract Truths &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;of the Cosmos. Each of the above=\r\n paths EMPHASISES particular methods and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;techniques in its att=\r\nempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;le=\r\nvel. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;each of these paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For those who are predomina=\r\nntly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;even the ext=\r\nernal guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advai=\r\nta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;emphasises the methods of Viveka\n (Discernment) and Vichara=\r\n (self-reflection). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Advaita being essentially a culmination of=\r\n the Vaidik system it has retained the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;vaidik practice of &#39;Swa=\r\ndhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;prac=\r\ntice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a margina=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;role for external practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yoga=\r\n marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga a=\r\ndditionally &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself to=\r\nwards the Supreme Iswara) too &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;while Bauddha and Jina schools o=\r\nf Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as they &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;subscribe to =\r\nnirishwaravada.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emp=\r\nhasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;will through tota=\r\nl surrender to the Supreme. On the\n contrary the emphasis in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;K=\r\narma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in acti=\r\nons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma=\r\n marga of the Gita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the T=\r\nantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;inevitable neces=\r\nsity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths via =\r\nthe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It pres=\r\nupposes certain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;dangers inherent to any lab experiment and the=\r\nreby certain regulations and safe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;practices. It should be reme=\r\nmbered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Fire or Agni=\r\n at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that =\r\ninvoke &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Agni,\n one path invokes/employs the fire of the intelle=\r\nct, another the fire of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;speech, another the fire of austerity,=\r\n and yet another the physical fire of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Yagnya and so on.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fi=\r\nre of Vak through the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since T=\r\nantra employs highly powerful techniques &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;that bring results mo=\r\nre quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;not=\r\n about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervis=\r\nor need &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;experience and training or not? Like any other lab exp=\r\neriment proper training &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;and experience are part of the procedu=\r\nre apart from certain safety measures, in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the Tantric lab expe=\r\nriment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;whilst =\r\nthe experiment is\n awakening the Sakti within the individual consciousness =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic =\r\nfor mere &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;intellectualisation, I will refrain from further disc=\r\nussion on the Kundalini. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Without going into other needless det=\r\nails here, I will just elaborate on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;initiation and Guru paramp=\r\nara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, =\r\none has to contextualise it within &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the larger Tantric context =\r\ntoo. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Tantric conte=\r\nxt. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;comp=\r\nrehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, =\r\nSrikula and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kaliku=\r\nla whilst Sri Vidya sadhana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;belongs to Srikula. Just to make t=\r\nhe picture\n more complete the Vajrayanas among &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the Buddhists (=\r\n!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Va=\r\njrayana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta =\r\nsadhanas in its approach &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;to sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at a=\r\nll) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the=\r\n major milestones in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the internal spiritual journey. The yantr=\r\na, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;consistently of a particu=\r\nlar set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;three l=\r\nineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru param=\r\npara can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at =\r\nthe\n root from where the trunk &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;arises. Each branch and sub-bra=\r\nnches and twigs spread out progressively downward &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;till the ind=\r\nividual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It =\r\nis held by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the Tantric advocate that initiation not only compl=\r\netes the circuit necessary &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;for the conduit of electricity but =\r\nalso prevents short circuit. Imagine many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;beautiful bulbs/ligh=\r\nts at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;th=\r\nere is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) an=\r\nd Sound (Sabda). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the =\r\nindividual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;consciousness through an integrated approach\n that =\r\ncombines the practices of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantr=\r\na. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;into highly comprehe=\r\nnsive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;t=\r\nhe many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic appro=\r\nach. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text =\r\nlike the Upanishads. It &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;is also simultaneously a text on Yogas=\r\nastra as well as Mantrasastra. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;question of initiation is r=\r\nelevant only to those following the Tantramarga and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;thus emplo=\r\nying the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have c=\r\novered &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;extensively in my write-up. For those who are already i=\r\nnclined to the Advaitic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the cont=\r\next for immensely powerful reflections &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;through\n its central me=\r\nssage of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the t=\r\next is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I a=\r\nlone exist in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (1=\r\n0.5). Compare it with the other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Mahavakyas of the Upanishads a=\r\nnd reflect on the central truth of Advaita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The =\r\nreason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;language is because understanding the meaning and constant ref=\r\nlection are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;possible only when one repeatedly reads the text i=\r\nn a language that they can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;fully follow. The main idea of the =\r\nwriteup is to explore the text as an Advaitic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;and Yogic text t=\r\noo apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as\n the Veda Samhita, espe=\r\ncially &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of =\r\nVeda mantras or the Veda &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Samhita are equally possible with Sri=\r\n Sri Chandi and hence the practice of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone w=\r\nho is acquainted with the original Vedic method will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;straighta=\r\nway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and=\r\n DERIVED &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with =\r\nthe Hindu temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do =\r\nthe Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;sadhana in acc=\r\nordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is thi=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;particular approach that needs initiation as per its own pri=\r\nnciples. Initiation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;is not\n mandatory if one adopts the Vedant=\r\nic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Yogic path of Abhyasa an=\r\nd Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;text =\r\ndevoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya.=\r\n One may benefit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sr=\r\ni Chandi. However one has to bear &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;in mind that the living and =\r\nbreathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Srikula as pr=\r\nacticed originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiatio=\r\nn for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any =\r\nof the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viv=\r\neka, Vichara, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bh=\r\nava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;all effective. However dependi=\r\nng on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;some of these=\r\n methods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. One &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spiritu=\r\nal life. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KAL=\r\nIKULA involves Mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;diksha too. It is this big picture again=\r\nst which the answer to the question has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;to be contextualised.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the metho=\r\nd and path, SWADHYAYA and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;SATSANGHA are the most effective met=\r\nhods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;self-study of texts f=\r\nollowed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Th=\r\nis is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n &gt;SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swa=\r\ndhyaya is the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;alternate method (though not as powerful) where =\r\nSatsangha is not possible. It is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Satsangha and satsangha alone=\r\n that enables one to make rapid progress in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;spiritual life. Sr=\r\ni Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;ser=\r\nving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made =\r\na quantum leap in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;their spiritual lives after they attended th=\r\ne Satsangha of Ramakrishna, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath re=\r\nspectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; For those who complain about the sca=\r\nrcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;quote Swami Sivananda=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that=\r\n there are no good &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The\n compa=\r\nny of Sadhus is a question of supply &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;and demand. If there is a=\r\n sincere demand, the supply will come at once. This is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;the ine=\r\nxorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find your &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind =\r\nis full of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit f=\r\nor higher divine life. You &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;waste your time in idle gossiping a=\r\nnd vain, worldly talks. You have become a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;hopeless slave of pa=\r\nssion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;cann=\r\not get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls =\r\nwho will put you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;in the right path, guide you and elevate you =\r\nto sublime heights. These &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waitin=\r\ng to get hold of the right type of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;aspirants.\n Mahatmas are in=\r\n plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;There a=\r\nre no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Con=\r\nducted &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a poten=\r\ntial Satsangha though not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;comparable to the actual company of =\r\nthe great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Chandi as a yoga-ve=\r\ndantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;suc=\r\nh as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance an=\r\nd reflection, by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and s=\r\nincere discussions on a group such &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;as this, one makes progress=\r\n truly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I may not\n interact regularly or reply a=\r\nt least for a while.
