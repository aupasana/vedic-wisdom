I want to mention a small story abo=\r\nut his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; past. This is an incident that had a profound impact on his spi=\r\nritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; evolution in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When Manish w=\r\nas young, he was not exactly spiritual. His mother was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; highly spiritua=\r\nl and religious and he naturally knew some prayers, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; did not do muc=\r\nh spiritual sadhana. He would race motor bikes outside Pune\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with frien=\r\nds and lead a licentious lifestyle.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When in college, he got bad m=\r\narks in one subject in exams and wanted to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; go to college oneday to fig=\r\nht and increase his marks. When he was about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to leave house, a teenage=\r\nd Brahmin in orange clothes and having good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tejas in face came to his =\r\nhouse. He asked Manish where he was going. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then said, &quot;do not go ou=\r\nt today. Going out today will ruin your life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Just stay home and think=\r\n of god. I will make sure that your marks with be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; increased. Leave it =\r\nto me and don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He then strongly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suggested to Manish =\r\nthat he should wear a diamond ring on his right hand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; index finger and =\r\nit would change his life. Interestingly, Manish has\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Meena lagna and Ve=\r\nnus is a malefic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; house) with 3 =\r\nother planets, people would normally avoid diamond in this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; case to be =\r\nsafe. Moreover, most people do not put diamond on index\n&gt; &gt;&gt; finger, which =\r\nis associated with Jupiter, an enemy of Venus. So nobody\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would normall=\r\ny recommend him diamond, that too on the index finger. This\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is an unus=\r\nual suggestion.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; That brahmin boy then asked Manish to give him te=\r\na or sugar with his hand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and said that this act would do him good. The=\r\nre was no tea at their house\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and Manish fed him some sugar. He ate it =\r\nand left after saying, &quot;when you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; come to Shirdi next, come to so and s=\r\no room in so and so place. That is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; where I live. Also, I need to give =\r\na glass of water to your mother.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Please come to Shirdi with her.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Barely a minute after he left, Manish had a question =\r\nand ran to the door\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of his compound wall. He found no person in orange=\r\n clothes walking on the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; road. He asked the persons standing outside wh=\r\nether they could tell him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in which direction a person who came out of =\r\nthe house in orange clothes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; had gone. They said nobody went in or came=\r\n out of the house in an hour.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Manish went around the area to check if =\r\nanybody saw a young Brahmin in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; orange clothes. Nobody in that area saw=\r\n anyone like that. So this seemed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like a miracle. Manish was puzzled.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Later his marks in the exam were automatically increased and his =\r\nproblem\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was solved by itself, without his doing anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A few months later, they went to Shirdi. They wanted to meet =\r\nthat young\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Brahmin. They went to the place he mentioned. Manish&#39;s moth=\r\ner was waiting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; downstairs and they went upstairs to the room number me=\r\nntioned by him to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody in that roo=\r\nm and there was a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wall. When=\r\n they asked, they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; were told that that room had always been empty and o=\r\nnly the picture was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there. Nobody ever lived in that room.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; W=\r\nhen they came downstairs, Manish&#39;s mother told them that she suddenly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nbecame very thirsty and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; some water from his hands and left in a hurry.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; After this, Manish did buy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n visitor and wore it on his right hand index finger. He still wears it.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Perhaps wearing a strong moksha trikona lord&#39;s gem on the moksha finger\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; (the four fingers represent the 4 purusharthas and thumb shows self)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; strengthens moksha trikona. Though this was an unusual (and risky)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nsuggestion, perhaps this is very appropriate in this case for spiritual\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; progress.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Soon after this, another miraculous incident involvin=\r\ng a deity happened,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which I do not want to mention now. Then started h=\r\nis spiritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; transformation. Manish became very serious about spiritua=\r\nl sadhana after\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that and started spending many hours everyday in spiri=\r\ntual sadhana. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; had visions - internal and external - of many deities=\r\n and special beings,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; including Shirdi Sai Baba too, and had many exper=\r\niences. His life changed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; completely after this experience.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Today many people do not believe that miraculous and magical=\r\n things can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; happen. When they hear unbelievable stories about saints l=\r\nike Sai Baba,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swa=\r\nmi, Mahavatar\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Babaji, Jnaneshwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds trained=\r\n in rational\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thinking assume that the stories are made up by someone. =\r\nHealthy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; skepticism is justified because many fake people are there tod=\r\nay, who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; abuse people&#39;s faith. However, absolute cynicism is wrong. Suc=\r\nh things\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are possible.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But one word on miracles and siddhis.=\r\n Miracles and siddhis are secondary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to self-realization. The important=\r\n thing is to do spiritual sadhana,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; realize self, and live as a liberat=\r\ned person (jeevanmukta) continuing to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discharge the job assigned to on=\r\ne by Nature, with an equanimous mind and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; neither attraction nor repuls=\r\nion to anything. Nature assigns different\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jobs to different persons. P=\r\nersonalities like Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Raghavendra Swami, Aurobi=\r\nndo, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Chai=\r\ntanya Mahaprabhu, Ramanujacharya,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did d=\r\nifferent jobs on this earth, but what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is common between them is that t=\r\nhey completely overcame their limited\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personalities, became realized a=\r\nnd then went on to fulfill the tasks\n&gt; &gt;&gt; given to them by the Power that r=\r\nuns the universe, with an equanimous\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
