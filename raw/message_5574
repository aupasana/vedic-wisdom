People belonged to different varnas based on their aptitude and serv=\r\ned different purposes in society. It wasn&#39;t a rigid system, but a flexible =\r\nand mobile system based on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a=\r\n child may get exposed to what father does and may have a good chance of de=\r\nveloping aptitude for such work, one would by default get father&#39;s varna at=\r\n birth. But, as one grows up and one&#39;s vasanas (conditioning from past live=\r\ns) develop, one may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a varn=\r\na different from father&#39;s.\n \nFor example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatri=\r\nya, but became a braahmana and became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born =\r\nas a shoodra and lived by hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a=\r\n maharshi later.\n \nNo matter where one is born and how one was brought up, =\r\nanyone who is interested in knowledge and liberation and not interested in =\r\nmoney or power over others, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an ortho=\r\ndox brahmin family, if one is deeply interested in money or power and autho=\r\nrity over others, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not sup=\r\nerior and another varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve d=\r\nifferent purposes. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mistr=\r\nust, fights and killings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate conseque=\r\nnce of deepening Kali.\n \nWhat I am saying is not accepted in mainstream soc=\r\niety today because we are deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother decid=\r\nes, social notions can change quickly. In fact, we are going through a phas=\r\ne of huge global transformation. Political, economoic, social and religious=\r\n structures of the world will be redefined during the coming decades and wi=\r\nll remain valid for many centuries. \n \nBTW, when the divine Mother appeared=\r\n before my guru in March 2006 and gave a command to spread a simple homam r=\r\nitual in the world for the coming times, her clear directive was to not dif=\r\nferentiate based on caste, creed, class and race. We encourage anybody who =\r\ndesires to worship any god in fire for spiritual progress to perform homam =\r\non a regular basis using the homam manuals at the homam website (see below)=\r\n.\n \n&gt; Also if a person born in low cast is that mean he will receive less g=\r\nrace of\n&gt; GOD & a pesron who belongs to high cast has abundance of it. \n \nR=\r\nather than caste, environment in which one grows up does have a role (and c=\r\naste does sometimes influence the family environment in India). One born in=\r\n a family (brahmana or otherwise) that worships god everyday is exposed to =\r\nthat notion. One brought up in a family that cares a little about god or mo=\r\nrality and pursues money or power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that no=\r\ntion. So the religious/spiritual aspects of the environment in which one gr=\r\nows up do play a role. However, if one has strong vasanas, they will eventu=\r\nally take hold. One will meet people who make those vasanas flourish and th=\r\nose vasanas take control.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free =\r\nJyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for shor=\r\nt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n \n---- sudhir junonikar &lt;sudhirjunonikar@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Namaste all gurujanas\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Since childho=\r\nod i am wandering to have answers to my question, they seems to be foolish =\r\nto scholars like you but as lay man I am carrying it with me.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ou=\r\nr society is discriminated in to various cast, does our veda support this c=\r\nast system?\n&gt; =C2=A0If we consider that doshas/papam=C2=A0is associated=C2=\r\n=A0if we make such =C2=A0discrimination then why it is not taken in to acco=\r\nunt.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Since thousand&#39;s of years=C2=A0 people are treated badly=C2=\r\n=A0even animals=C2=A0were treated well.
