If you perform a homam just t=\r\no\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; show your love to god, cleanse yourself spiritually and make yours=\r\nelf worthy of divine\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; communion, then there are no risks.

Now i am sure that =\r\nwhen one starts struggle for truth, it will be a real fierce struggle which=\r\n will test one to the core. one might cry, feel frustrated, agitated, helpl=\r\ness, fallen, ruined, elated during this period. to fight selfishness and ac=\r\nhieve desirelessness is NO easy thing. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI am very happy that you h=\r\nave now started doing Homa every day. please forget about the feelings duri=\r\nng Homam and after that. let it come and go. the other day you called me fr=\r\nom Mumbai. i could feel your hapiness from you voice.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nthanks to ou=\r\nr dear Guruji Shri PVR Narasimha Rao Garu for the begining of bringing this=\r\n change for us.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegardlessly Yours,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In=\r\n &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@ ...&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I would not deny =\r\nthis fact that i asked the question of performing homam from everyside keep=\r\ning in mind the statement made by vijayji..I am a normal humanbeing.. and d=\r\nesires are thre in me.. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Honestly i do homam everyday ..=\r\n and&nbsp; each day i find different experience.. . i have been doing this =\r\nhomam since past few months.. and since past few days i am doing everyday..=\r\n i keep it a point .. to not to miss a single day... and see the magic.. in=\r\nspite of my busy schedules i can devote atleast 40 to 45 minutes each day f=\r\nor this homam and that had made difference to my life.. sometimes after doi=\r\nng homam my feelings are so great.. sometimes average.. sometimes it is not=\r\n good also... why? i think it all depends on your state of mind at the time=\r\n of homam.. right? whatever may be the case, i do it everyday and i will do=\r\n it in future also..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But,&nbsp; worldly pleasures&nbsp; =\r\nlike fame, power, materialistic welfare attracts me still.. and i tend to t=\r\nhink that way.. it seems that still i have not reached to that stage where =\r\nnothing would atttract me.. but i am sure most of us would be having simila=\r\nr kind of feelings..sometimes i am worried.. if i am doing homam, then this=\r\n kind of desires should not come to my mind.. but it comes.. then i feel th=\r\nat i am not giving my 100% to it.. or i am lacking sadhna.. i am lacking de=\r\ndication... .What could be the reason? what should i do to come out of this=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rajesh&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- On Fri, 6/3/09, utpal pathak &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@ ...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Which is a big sin/kar=\r\nma&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Date: Friday, 6 Marc=\r\nh, 2009, 2:33 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n            Dear Raju,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;As for ba=\r\nli... i normally use any fruit.. and after offering six &gt;pieces, balance=\r\n part of fruit is not consumed by me .. it is &gt;thrown..but for example..=\r\n i purchase one killo grapes.. and each &gt;day i use six grapes out of ful=\r\nl bunch for balli.. and next day &gt;another six grapes out of that bunch..=\r\n. will that be ok? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Why are you aski=\r\nng such difficult questions?:?

Vijay gave this details =\r\nas an answer to clarify some query but see it has created a kind of motives=\r\n other than spiritual progress, in many of us. now this thing will keep on =\r\nlingering in our mind for long unless we mercilessly remove it. even Narasi=\r\nmha mentioned few days back that Mamara is for Money, White til for Spiritu=\r\nal progress etc.. and that was also sufficient for creating ripples.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narsimha, in his mnual, has categorically =\r\nmentioned this (I don&#39;t know if he wish to revisit and change that)-&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; [&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, you have t=\r\no be careful if you perform a homam for certain material goals (such as&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; getting money, attracting someone, destroying someone etc).=\r\n If you perform a homam just to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; show your love to god, c=\r\nleanse yourself spiritually and make yourself worthy of divine&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; communion, then there are no risks. The procedure taught in this doc=\r\nument is based on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; teachings of rishis and it is safe=\r\n for anybody to use. Small mistakes will not result in any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; punishment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In fact, it is expected that everybody wh=\r\no uses this document is interested in only the second&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ki=\r\nnd of goal, i.e. spiritual cleansing and upliftment&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ]&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; BUT important thing is that, the knowl=\r\nedge provided by Narasimha and vijay about Different materials for Aahuti a=\r\nnd Direction respectively, can be used for *other Jan Hitaay*. i mean don&#39;t=\r\n use it for ourself but can be used for a person who is dire difficulty of =\r\nFinance/Health etc... for example, if you know somebody who is in a trouble=\r\n due to financial crisis, you can suggest him to do some japa facing North =\r\nDirection. for health matters, south direction can be suggested and finally=\r\n thinking &#39;Neki kar aur dariya me dal&#39; or &#39;Krishnarpana&#39; or &#39;Shivarpana&#39; :)=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I asked the same question to my gur=\r\nu initially. he told me that when i perform atleast 10 homa myself and beco=\r\nme proficient in the ritual then i may think of performing it at other&#39;s ho=\r\nme. You can ask your friends to join you and sit while you are performing t=\r\nhe homam at you house. if they are really intrested they will come and then=\r\n leave it to Mahaganapati. if he wishes, they will also start taking seriou=\r\ns intrest.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lastly, Narasimha can ans=\r\nwer you better for all the questions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; Warm Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajesh rajg=\r\nor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji / Utpal,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Can we do mahaganapathi homam by sitting in different directio=\r\nns?. .
