My focus is on spiritual growth.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I have a per=\r\nsonal temple or altar in my home where e,very thing that is cooked in our k=\r\nitchen\n&gt; is offered with devotion and also cooked food that comes from outs=\r\nide. I remember once I was \n&gt; talking to Utpal on yahoo and I said I have j=\r\nust made tea and I am offering to Deities. I thought\n&gt; he was a bit surpris=\r\ned that I am offering tea.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Anyway, everyday food is very normal ind=\r\nian sattvic=A0vegetarian food.but on Eakadasi day only\n&gt; potato or sweet po=\r\ntato=A0cooked in ghee or butter=A0 are offered and fruits and then I take t=\r\nhat as \n&gt; prasad.
