The moon has a po=\r\nwerful relationship to our lives. The moon&#39;s influence can be seen by its c=\r\nonnection to the Earth&#39;s tides. There is a connection to the moon and the i=\r\nntuitive aspect of one&#39;s nature. The phases of the moon relate to seasons, =\r\ncolor, menstrual cycles, life cycles and along withthe sun, the moon&#39;s ener=\r\ngy is a higher conductor and amplifier of our moods and emotions.The Full S=\r\nnow Moon - February - Since the heaviest snow usually falls during this mon=\r\nth, native tribes of the north and east most often called February&#39;s Storm =\r\nMoon or Full Snow Moon. Some tribes also referred to this Moon as the Full =\r\nHunger Moon, since harsh weather conditions in their areas made hunting ver=\r\ny difficult. Also known to the Celts as the Moon of Ice and the Chinese as =\r\nthe Budding Moon. February 1 is the\n Imbolc, or fire festival celebrating m=\r\nid point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. A day also ded=\r\nicated to the Celtic goddess, Brigid. Imbolic means &quot;in the belly&quot; and is a=\r\n time honoring creativity, fertility and receptive, feminine energy. Candle=\r\ns are often tools used to celebrate this Celtic holiday. It is also a time =\r\nwe celebrate love! The reflective light of the full moon gives a wonderful =\r\nand magical sense of harmony and peacefulness. Meditating in its light give=\r\ns an etheric and positively enchanting feeling of oneness and unity with na=\r\nture and sky. Meditating With A CrystalWhen you sitin your meditation pose,=\r\ncross your legs and place your hands on your knees. You can sit with your p=\r\nalms open and place a crystal in both of them.Consider these stones:Moonsto=\r\nne:Honors the Goddess in all women, Dieting, Gardening, PsychicAwareness, M=\r\neditation. Soothes stress, anxiety, women&#39;s hormones/menstrual imbalance, l=\r\nymph. Enhances intuitive\n sensitivity via feelings and less overwhelmed by =\r\npersonal feelings.

Helps all be mo=\r\nre comfortable with our gentler feminine/yin receiving side. Especially for=\r\n water signs. Used for protection against the perils of travel.Known to be =\r\nof ancient spiritual significance in their connection to the moon and the i=\r\nntuitive aspect of one&#39;s nature. Helps cool, soothe, and calm over-reaction=\r\ns to emotional and personal situations. Makes one conscious of the fact tha=\r\nt all things are part of a cycle of constant change. They open us up to the=\r\n feminine and are associated with sensitivity, intuition, and clairvoyance.=\r\n Beneficial for those involved in agriculture. Snowflake Obsidian: This obs=\r\nidian stone, which has inclusions of phynocryst, gives it the snowflake pat=\r\ntern on it&#39;s surface, and allows us to recognize unnecessary patterns in ou=\r\nr lives. Promotes\n self-esteem and confidence. Clairaudience and owning our=\r\n lower aspects for growth; Healthy balance. Allows us to be more sensitive =\r\nand aware of the beauty and love that is around us. Selenite: This is the m=\r\nineral gypsum. Its white/clear striated crystaline body is a sheer source o=\r\nf calming, spiritual light. It works with the higher spiritual Chakra in ac=\r\ncessing our higer consciousness, spirit guides and the angelic realm. Beacu=\r\nse of its striations, like tourmaline, it works along the spinal column gro=\r\nunding and anchoring our Earth vibration and utilizing kundalini to rise fr=\r\neely up our light body stimulating each center as it vibrates. This stone i=\r\ns highly recommended for meditation and working on the sacred spiritual in =\r\nyour life. Through meditation with selenite, growth and mental focus is att=\r\nainable. People find selenite to be a luck stone. Considered a centuries-ol=\r\nd recordkeeper of events/information, its information is gained through tel=\r\nepathic\n means. Pearl:In tune with emotions, water, and women, especially p=\r\nregnant women, pearls are a symbol of pure heart and mind; innocence and fa=\r\nith. Because it is from the sea, it has watery and lunar elements, therefor=\r\ne it is used for balancing emotions, especially for water signs. Absorbing =\r\nby nature, this mineral absorbs thoughts and emotions and because of this, =\r\nmust be used with caution. If you feel excessively negative while wearing a=\r\n pearl, it will hold that energy until it is cleansed. Remember, Pearl is t=\r\nhe result of layer uponlayer of substance produced to combat irritation. Pe=\r\narl can cool and soothe. It is very nurturing. Snow River Quartz, Seer Quar=\r\ntz or Gazing Quartz:These stones have been used for seeing into the future =\r\nand discovering our congenital past. These clear quartz balls are amazing i=\r\nn their clarity on the inside and covered with a beautiful white frost on t=\r\nhe outside. The ends are sliced off so that you can see into it&#39;s deep\n tra=\r\nnslucent center. These &quot;picture window&quot; crystals are originally from the ri=\r\nverbeds of Brazil. The crystals are washed down out of the mountains and tu=\r\nmbled over and over by violent surging waters. This natural process gives t=\r\nhe crystals their frosted look. They are the &quot;gazing&quot; stone. Also found in =\r\nquartz points, even though each crystal has the basic six-sided crystal sha=\r\npe and may be terminated, there is an additional flat plane or window, usua=\r\nlly diamond-shaped, that gives a view of the inner chamber of the crystal p=\r\noint. It teaches the importance of looking within ourselves, even if the vi=\r\new into our own soul is clouded and imperfect. MeditationSlowly take three =\r\ndeep breaths. With each one consciously release the mental, emotional and p=\r\nhysical tensions. Visualize our radiant light reaching out and connecting w=\r\nith every other focus under the light of the full moon. Know that we are co=\r\nnnected with individuals and groups everywhere throughout the\n world who ar=\r\ne contemplating on the unity of all life and who are working, each in their=\r\n own way, for the expansion of love and awareness on our planet. Visualize =\r\nour radiant light reaching out even further as we realize that we are also =\r\nconnected to the great fellowship of enlightened teachers who have been wit=\r\nh us through the ages guiding us to awaken and live by the law of love. Sit=\r\n quietly with your mind receptive, and open to receive spiritual energies. =\r\nDo all that you can to feel the light of the full moon upon you. Feel how y=\r\nour crystals vibrate in your hands.Make mental notations on thoughts or ide=\r\nas that come to you. These can appear as knowledge, wisdom, understanding, =\r\nor inspiration. Even if you think nothing happened, you may find that in a =\r\nfew days new ideas will appear to you. Assume that some kind of impression =\r\nhas been received in your higher mind and it is circling overhead waiting f=\r\nor a place to land. Develop the ability to listen\n within as you go about y=\r\nour expansive meditation. This is a similar process as remembering an impor=\r\ntant dream. The frequencies of dream realities are different than the ratio=\r\nnal concrete mind. This transference process requires stillness and patienc=\r\ne, along with an optimistic attitude. Once your conscious brain can align w=\r\nith the higher mind and soul the stream of light can reach you as words and=\r\n picture symbols. Feel the light bathe your physical body as you allow it t=\r\no penetrate deeper inside, reaching In this meditation you can become part =\r\nof the Universal Flow that brings Peace, Compassion, Love, Humility, and Gr=\r\natitude into our human consciousness. As you become more spiritually ground=\r\ned, you can become more of your true self. The blessings of the Earth surro=\r\nund you. The magnificent energy of Life unfolds all around you. You are a p=\r\nart of this. Strive to bring honor to your place in this Miracle of Light i=\r\nn all that you do.
