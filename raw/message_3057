I do this ev=\r\neryday around 10-15 minutes after sunrise time (with a lot of sincerity and=\r\n involving my thoughts/mind - but unfortunately not(yet!) with the proper m=\r\nantras etc). And I admit, I DO feel more at peace (and blessed) than I felt=\r\n before.\n\nI stand in the balcony, facing south, and pour the water(+the bla=\r\nck sesame seeds) in a small structure filled with mud/sand, and has a plant=\r\n growing in it. Few minutes after I am done (sometimes immediately), a pair=\r\n of doves(not white, but grey like pigeons) land on that spot and start eat=\r\ning the black sesame seeds. I have a feeling that only one of the two doves=\r\n is eating the black sesame seeds regularly, while the other one is a silen=\r\nt companion at most times. However, my question is that sometimes I begin t=\r\no wonder if this &#39;bird-eating-the-offering&#39; is the &#39;right&#39; phenomenon? What=\r\n could it possibly symbolise? \n\nI do not wish to discuss astrology, but som=\r\nehow my second query is associated with it. My sincere apologies if this is=\r\n inapt. Someone recently told me that because I have a gandanta moola(kumbh=\r\na rasi) dosha in my chart - homam/tarpana etc would not yield ANY results -=\r\n even though a proper shanti homam was performed 27 days after my birth. I =\r\ndont think I am discouraged and would stop the homam/tarpana - but if you c=\r\nould help remove this &#39;very-slightly-disturbing-thought&#39; that I have in my =\r\nmind, I would really really be obliged. \n\nThanking you for your guidance an=\r\nd support !\n\nKind regards\nSharad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
