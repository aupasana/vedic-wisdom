Nature has created a \nsituation where it can be paid back. In o=\r\nther words, Nature has placed that \nperson in a position to cheat or hurt y=\r\nou and tempted him to do so.\n\n(2) That person has succumbed to the temptati=\r\non, i.e. he has used the \nopportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurt=\r\ns you. As he engages in the \naction while identifying with the action (&quot;I a=\r\nm doing it&quot;), he now gets a \nnew karma. He will be paid back later.\n\nBoth a=\r\nre correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identification \nand h=\r\ne is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being paid \nback=\r\n for what you did before.\n\n* * *\n\nIn order to break out of this cycle, acce=\r\npt it when somebody does something \nto you. Do not hate the person or pity =\r\nyourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it \nhave to happen to me&quot;. Think only about=\r\n your current action (&quot;what is the \nbest thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) and do N=\r\nOT think about what happened, why it \nhappened, who did it and how things h=\r\nappening to you are unfair.\n\nThe tricky thing is when Nature places you in =\r\na position to pay back \nsomebody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong temp=\r\ntation for you to do so. \nYou may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a ba=\r\nd thing to someone! But \nremember one thing. Any thought or action with a s=\r\nense of doership (&quot;I am \ndoing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the other=\r\n person brought it on \nhimself with a previous action.\n\nIf you can engage i=\r\nn an action without a sense of doership and surrendering \nthe action to the=\r\n Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that is \nvery very difficul=\r\nt - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can also \npostpone the payba=\r\nck through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the \ntemptation and not=\r\n do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we live \nin a body, some =\r\nkarmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion, \nself-control and str=\r\nong will power will enable one to postpone the most \ntroublesome karmas to =\r\na later time.\n\nWhen the reactions to your previous karmas are paid back and=\r\n through who is \nnot in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others d=\r\necide that. So you \ncan do nothing except accept what comes. But what you D=\r\nO NOW is to a large \nextent under your control. Use your will power to do t=\r\nhe right things.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyo=\r\ntish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: =\r\n&quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@grouply. com&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent:=\r\n Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:19 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works=\r\n\n\n&gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:\n&gt;\n&gt; is it that =\r\neverything that is happening to us in this life is all reaction \n&gt; to some =\r\nof our past actions?it is difficult for me to understand this.\n&gt; To me, it =\r\ncan also be that someone is pushing this suffering onto us as \n&gt; his action=\r\n than a reaction of our old karmas.\n&gt; In any case, if we are getting cheate=\r\nd and we know it clearly why should \n&gt; we sit back and just let things happ=\r\nen against us, why should we not fight \n&gt; back?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Before I answer it, I want to say =\r\nthat I am impressed \n&gt;&gt; with the decription of your friend. My pranaams to =\r\nhim. Does he live in \n&gt;&gt; the greater Boston area too?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kar=\r\nma and karmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nbeing pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object =\r\nwith some force and that object pushes \n&gt;&gt; you back karmically with the sam=\r\ne force at a later point of time, it is \n&gt;&gt; not necessary that you resist i=\r\nt and apply some more force to push again. \n&gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. That =\r\nis action. You are being pushed now. That is \n&gt;&gt; reaction. How you take thi=\r\ns push and whether you resist or not has \n&gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old act=\r\nion and reaction balance. IF you resist and \n&gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it be=\r\ncomes a new action which will get its reaction \n&gt;&gt; later.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Even a person of a high level of mental equanimity and stability does \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nhave an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nhim to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like \n&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhis, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wants so \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of \n&gt;&gt; Sr=\r\niharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound from \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and ge=\r\nts \n&gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and \n&gt;&gt; =\r\nenvironment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature \n&gt;&gt; tra=\r\ncks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to \n&gt;&gt; you=\r\nr old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature \n&gt;&gt; d=\r\nelivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of \n&gt;&gt; I-ne=\r\nss in this life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness=\r\n, Nature will \n&gt;&gt; continue to deliver the reactions to various previous act=\r\nions from that \n&gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar aw=\r\nard, losing an \n&gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people, being hit=\r\n by wife, being \n&gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being che=\r\nated by a friend \n&gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions.=\r\n As long as one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will conti=\r\nnue to deliver \n&gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar awar=\r\nd as a result of \n&gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessary that one shou=\r\nld be happy or \n&gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nat=\r\nure to one&#39;s good \n&gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one h=\r\nappy. How one feels \n&gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not nec=\r\nessary that one should \n&gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction =\r\nfrom Nature to one&#39;s bad \n&gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction disa=\r\nppoints him. You cheated \n&gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that that pe=\r\nrson cheats you now. How \n&gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relevant as far a=\r\ns the old action-reaction \n&gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous=\r\n, equal-minded and calm does \n&gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nIn fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it becomes a new karma for tha=\r\nt \n&gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly a=\r\nnd \n&gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, su=\r\nppose \n&gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop the person from cheating you. Then your=\r\n current \n&gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its=\r\n reaction \n&gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new=\r\n ones, you \n&gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you described below. Accept w=\r\nhatever comes \n&gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a c=\r\nalm and relaxed \n&gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the righ=\r\nt thing to do at \n&gt;&gt; the moment, with as little self-identification (sense =\r\nof &quot;I am doing \n&gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your i=\r\nnstincts and \n&gt;&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you the right acti=\r\non.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic=\r\n- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. ne=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Origin=\r\nal Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Kar=\r\nma\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if the=\r\ny are able to be in a neutral \n&gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected =\r\nby what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours=\r\n lost his wife in a road accident a few \n&gt;&gt; &gt; years\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ago.

But g=\r\nood discretion, &lt;BR&gt;self-control and strong will power will enable one to p=\r\nostpone the most &lt;BR&gt;troublesome karmas to a later time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the re=\r\nactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through who is &lt;BR&gt;not in=\r\n YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So you &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ncan do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;extent under your control. Use your will power to do the right things.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;=\r\nkritels&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dkrite=\r\nls%40grouply.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:kritels%=\r\n40grouply.com&quot;&gt;kritels@grouply. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://i=\r\nn.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:1=\r\n9 PM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Narasim=\r\nha Garu,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is it that everything that is happening to us in this life is all=\r\n reaction &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to some of our past actions?it is difficult for me to un=\r\nderstand this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To me, it can also be that someone is pushing this s=\r\nuffering onto us as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his action than a reaction of our old karmas.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; In any case, if we are getting cheated and we know it clearly why s=\r\nhould &lt;BR&gt;&gt; we sit back and just let things happen against us, why shoul=\r\nd we not fight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; back?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n KK&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic=\r\n-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Naras=\r\nimha P.V.R.

Before I answer it, I wa=\r\nnt to say that I am impressed &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; with the decription of your frie=\r\nnd. My pranaams to him. Does he live in &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the greater Boston are=\r\na too?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Karma and karm=\r\naphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; be=\r\ning pushing back as a reaction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When you karmically=\r\n push an object with some force and that object pushes &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you bac=\r\nk karmically with the same force at a later point of time, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to\n push agai=\r\nn. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed=\r\n now. That is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and whether you=\r\n resist or not has &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old action and react=\r\nion balance. IF you resist and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it become=\r\ns a new action which will get its reaction &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of =\r\nmental equanimity and stability does &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living =\r\nperson has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; him to a body an=\r\nd an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; this, wh=\r\no knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wants so &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc et=\r\nc). If &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the binding is completely removed and\n one becomes comp=\r\nletely unbound from &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no =\r\nlonger remain in the body. So &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a l=\r\nimited ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (se=\r\nnse of I-ness) is cut off from one body and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; environment and re=\r\n-attached to another body and environment. Nature &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; tracks this =\r\nchange. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you=\r\nr old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; As long as one i=\r\ns embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; continue to =\r\ndeliver the reactions to various previous actions from that &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; be=\r\ning. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand\n people, being hit by wife, b=\r\neing &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheat=\r\ned by a friend &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to previous a=\r\nctions. As long as one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a body, N=\r\nature will continue to deliver &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. =\r\nIf one gets an Oscar award as a result of &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; previous good karma,=\r\n it is not necessary that one should be happy or &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; excited or el=\r\nated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; k=\r\narma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that on=\r\ne should &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from =\r\nNature to one&#39;s bad &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction =\r\ndisappoints him. You cheated &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such=\r\n that that person cheats you now. How\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you feel about it now i=\r\ns not relevant as far as the old action-reaction &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; equation is c=\r\noncerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; n=\r\not stop Nature from doing its job.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; In fact, it is b=\r\netter that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; one =\r\nis preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if h=\r\ne does it &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it becomes=\r\n a new karma for that &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you).=\r\n If you just face it calmly and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; without doing anything, you fi=\r\nnish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you fight and try =\r\nto stop the person from cheating you. Then your current &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; action=\r\ns would become a NEW karma and\n you will have to face its reaction &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, yo=\r\nu &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you described below. Accept w=\r\nhatever comes &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but=\r\n with a calm and relaxed &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what s=\r\neems like the right thing to do at &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the moment, with as little =\r\nself-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. =\r\nAs you become better at this, your instincts and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; judgment will=\r\n guide you better and show you the right action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpan=\r\nas Yourself: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.hom=\r\ne.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comc=\r\nast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www=\r\n.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message --=\r\n--- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject=\r\n: Karma&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Dear Narsimhaji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to be in a ne=\r\nutral &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; frame&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected =\r\nby what is percieved as misfortune?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A clo=\r\nse family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; years&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pulp right b=\r\nefore his eyes. He very&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to =\r\nthe hospital and took care of all of &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; his&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n duties towards her and the family. His wife was a very spiritual person&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident, his wife told him o=\r\nf her &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; recent&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation experience and t=\r\nhat she would probably be leaving her body&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husba=\r\nnd never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; cheerf=\r\nul frame of mind even during\n the funeral process. Some folks felt &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated prof=\r\nessor with a stable mind. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; His&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; wife and h=\r\ne shared a very high spiritual and mental bond and they have &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; two&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I have the utmost reverance towards =\r\nhim and also in awe &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; his spiritual lev=\r\nel. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; nev=\r\ner feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n      &lt;!--3--&gt;&lt;hr size=\r\n=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Now surf faster and smarter !
