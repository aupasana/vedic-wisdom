Thought of mailing them to =\r\nyou. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Jumping on conclusion without properly studying/thinking=\r\n about Thakur&#39;s life, just on literal meaning of those 2 words would be a s=\r\nure blasphemy.\n=C2=A0\nYou are right. But since this is a debate and just a =\r\ndebate, =C2=A0let me put forth some logical points.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n1) Two wr=\r\nongs never make a right. This is one mistake we Indians do when we try to d=\r\nebate over something. When we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matte=\r\nr whether Ramakrishna - who lived in a different century - was right or now=\r\n. That would be a different debate. \n=C2=A0\n2) Ramakrishna did not write an=\r\nything -:). He only=C2=A0woke up=C2=A0people to what ever degree was necess=\r\nary and gave general talks on spirituality. So, one can always contend that=\r\n a mistake maybe the biographers mistake. M or Saradananda=C2=A0could very =\r\nwell have been mistaken in what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is di=\r\nfferent from creating a composition. When one writes, one has more time and=\r\n energy to indulge in thinking, and checking up possibilities of different =\r\nshades of meanings for the simple reason that the audience is large, unknow=\r\nn and spread out=C2=A0over huge spans of time.=C2=A0When one talks, and tha=\r\nt too talking to friends, or close people, one does not need to be careful =\r\nof every word or sentence one speaks. \n=C2=A0\nTo understand this better,=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0we have to think - scientifically speaking - how communication hap=\r\npens in three levels. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the=\r\n words, 64 percent through body language and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39;=\r\n or sub conscious communication. This last three percent is the most powerf=\r\nul. When a person can use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - h=\r\ne can move masses of people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also d=\r\no so (IMO). If you listen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may f=\r\nind it uninspiring. But if you were to be present in a live rock concert, y=\r\nou will definitely feel an energy and get swayed.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\nThen comes =\r\nbody language which is so important.=C2=A0For example,=C2=A0if you enter a =\r\nGovt office in India, you may find that the babus there will be sitting rel=\r\naxed in their chair with their spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardl=\r\ny make any impact on them. That is why the files in Govt. of India offices =\r\nmove at a=C2=A0snail&#39;s pace.=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are tal=\r\nking to=C2=A0is sitting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the=\r\n right, even if the person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, kno=\r\nw it for the sure that there is a strong change he is listening through one=\r\n ear and throwing out the words through the other. In short, pretending to =\r\nlisten. In effect, once you leave his presence he probably=C2=A0won&#39;t bothe=\r\nr about what you said.\n=C2=A0\nAnd last is spoken word. When two people spea=\r\nk with each other, both words and body language come into picture. Sometime=\r\ns sub conscious communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of t=\r\nhe energy exchanged/communication not through words but through other means=\r\n. \n=C2=A0\nWhen you write down something, body languages gets negated. There=\r\nfore, one needs to be extra cautious while writing something in order to co=\r\nnvey the correct sense. That is why there are so many more rules to be foll=\r\nowed=C2=A0for writing anything.\n=C2=A0\nSo therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;tal=\r\nking&quot; to someone he is probably communicating using all means possible. But=\r\n if he were to write a book and mention &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without furthe=\r\nr explanation of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to ques=\r\ntion. But he never wrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they=\r\n explained the sense. \n=C2=A0\nContrast this to that line from Ramacharit Ma=\r\nnas, without any qualifications, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are=\r\n worthy of &quot;tadan&quot;.=C2=A0 If I were a woman, I would take offense=C2=A0to t=\r\nhat line.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious lite=\r\nrature, I keep the Koran as a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am judgi=\r\nng a book of religious nature, I follow the same parameters of judgement th=\r\nat I use when I judge the Koran as a book.\n=C2=A0\nThe Koran contains a vers=\r\ne, translated correctly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translations, which r=\r\necommend husbands to beat their wives if the wives are disobedient. \n=C2=A0=\r\n\n\n&quot;Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to =\r\nexcel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women a=\r\nre therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to=\r\n) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alo=\r\nne in their sleeping places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not se=\r\nek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great. (Shakir&#39;s version of th=\r\ne Koran, Quran, 4:34) \n=C2=A0\nA lot of muslims I have talked to, defend the=\r\n above=C2=A0giving various reasons one of which is &#39;misunderstanding contex=\r\nt&#39;. I find it inexcusable. Same way a line in a religious book bracketing &quot;=\r\nnari&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot; together, I find=C2=A0to be equally inexcusable. Th=\r\nat is the sense that comes out from a normal reading of that line. I am not=\r\n commenting on the whole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one vital line.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n[Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur=C2=A0Par-stri Matusamaan|\nInase agar p=\r\nrabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||\n(I have given=C2=A0this doha =C2=A0o=\r\nut of memory and its quite possible that first two=C2=A0wrods are wrong in =\r\nthe doha )=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nInteresting doha. Maybe you are right, maybe you ar=\r\ne not. But that line (pashu/naari etc)=C2=A0definitely conveys a simple mea=\r\nning. If=C2=A0Tulasidasji ment what you are saying, he should have used som=\r\ne appropiate punctuation marks. Since he did not, I have to reject your exp=\r\nlanation. Or I can say, Tulasidasji respects women a lot, but that line is =\r\nsimply a bad composition. One way or the other, I cannot absolve the compos=\r\ner of that specific line.\n=C2=A0\nBTW,=C2=A0 were you refering to the Gita v=\r\nerse 1.41 where Arjuna talks about women of the family getting corrupted?\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nYou and I&#39;ve notably common Astrological factors in our chart.

I normally become=C2=A0strong frien=\r\nds with people with whom I &quot;discuss&quot; things.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nOnce, long back w=\r\nhen I was furiously debating over something, my vastly more patient and exp=\r\nerienced opponent gave me some invaluable advices which I stick by even tod=\r\nay. Thought of sharing it in here.=C2=A0He said:\n=C2=A0\n&quot;=C2=A0I find it=C2=\r\n=A0is always best to debate online if one is keen on finding the correct re=\r\nsolution.

The highlighting is done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pa=\r\nshu-nari he should have used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He did=\r\n not.

Le=\r\nt me try again. He is not really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realiz=\r\ned man. Infact he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he =\r\nsays is that, (his opinion)=C3=82=C2=A0God did not descend as Sri Rama in o=\r\nrder to be worshipped. He descended in order to lead by example. That is wh=\r\ny the text is called Rama+ayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should=\r\n follow. One of principles.=C3=82=C2=A0 Compare this to the name of the oth=\r\ner great epic, Mahabharata, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One canno=\r\nt follow Krishna&#39;s path. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Whenever, according to him, we a=\r\nttribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a =\r\ndivide between the worshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossibl=\r\ne to lead a life like Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story =\r\nof a great king, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chanc=\r\ne of following such a life.\n&gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God=\r\n but he can follow the life of a great man.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, eve=\r\nn today lot of people advise that one should try to become like Vivekananda=\r\n, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh future=\r\n. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C3=82=C2=A0saint of h=\r\nighest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C3=82=C2=A0one who=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nlived like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C3=82=C2=A0men, fearless and unco=\r\nmpromising and principled. If every=C3=82=C2=A0person would constantly thin=\r\nk that Vivekanada was a saint=C3=82=C2=A0who worked by the pwoer of a deity=\r\n or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nemulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nthe image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can =\r\ninspire people. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0On the other hand=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nyou will never hear anyone advising that one should try to lead a life like=\r\n Ramarkishna.=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0That is impossible.

It =\r\nis understandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that =\r\nsuch a great person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really =\r\nis the definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nome months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate wit=\r\nh him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritica=\r\nl/ theological debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he=\r\n stopped the debate because I was getting agitated and it would have affect=\r\ned our friendship. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Whenever his opinio=\r\nn is asked on anything, he will only mention that what he can support using=\r\n logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spirituality with anyone per=\r\n se. He will discuss and debate scriptures using exact quotations etc, (the=\r\nology)=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0but not about mysticism or sadhana or anyt=\r\nhing which=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0needs a belief system. That is why mos=\r\nt people know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and unco=\r\nrruptable=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0human being.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0They have no clue about his meditations or anyth=\r\ning. He never projects himself as spiritual and generally would not discuss=\r\n God in public.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Therefore our discussio=\r\nn was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved theologically=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 1) To the first question, he believes th=\r\ne answer is &quot;no&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 2) To the second que=\r\nstion he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is right or=\r\n wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0- but his personal opinion is that one sho=\r\nuld try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping=\r\n him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have de=\r\nstroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the plac=\r\ne where he was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0located when he first heard the ne=\r\nws of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead chose the hard w=\r\nay of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend, it is more im=\r\nportant to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle=\r\n, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An=\r\n author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a=\r\n critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with=\r\n animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text =\r\nbecause Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he end=\r\ned up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if =\r\nSri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes wast=\r\ne. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be =\r\nworshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothin=\r\ng can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to d=\r\nisagree. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; One request, if you can =\r\nspeak to him about his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, b=\r\neen busy myself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will res=\r\npond. Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything fr=\r\nom a purely spiritual angle. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; It was on=\r\nly by chance that I found out one day about his meditations etc and then he=\r\n confirmed them when asked.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I have seen=\r\n him debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific point of view - about =\r\nwhy there is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat (not red meat). \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; But I say, as Narasimha said, this perso=\r\nn should not be taken as an ideal regarding food=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n habits.

I met him about two=\r\n years back. What first attracted me to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 towards =\r\nhim was his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0when it comes to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0honestly.=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just=\r\n say a simple, harmless=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in th=\r\ne west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He h=\r\nas actually never ever=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0spoken even a single lie i=\r\nn his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teacher=\r\n told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his te=\r\nacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive language a=\r\nnd the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought =\r\nhimself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten\n yea=\r\nrs every day he spend one hour reading the\n&gt; English dictionary and\n&gt; &gt; one=\r\n hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one day he=\r\n can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompr=\r\nomising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By =\r\neducation, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, f=\r\nrom banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in most pl=\r\naces. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskri=\r\nt, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in=\r\n all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself an =\r\natheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for religio=\r\nn as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms\n saw that bla=\r\nnk space,\n&gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk =\r\nwrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and =\r\ntore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writi=\r\nng Hindu in the form would have been a lie. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his fri=\r\nends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent me=\r\neting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by i=\r\nn=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to=\r\n go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the =\r\ntemple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees=\r\n his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the ti=\r\nme went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the te=\r\nmple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any move=\r\nment. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no i=\r\ndea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Then he started meditating at home, and =\r\nit was there=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0that he got visions etc of Krishna. =\r\nHe does not say much about these, infact most people who know him also do n=\r\not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving f=\r\nrom his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same position for 3 da=\r\nys continuously.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 Only his wife and close relativ=\r\nes know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for medit=\r\nation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he f=\r\nelt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginate=\r\ns from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men=\r\n, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom an=\r\nd bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramachari=\r\nt Manas because he\n thinks it elevated\n&gt; Sri=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Rama=\r\n to the\n&gt; &gt; level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana =\r\nwas to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0not a God.T=\r\nhe difference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated,=\r\n an ordinary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God can=\r\nnot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with=\r\n him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a G=\r\nuru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus the=\r\nse days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Later he had once=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0mentioned h=\r\ne knew the relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives=\r\n. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he sp=\r\nends a lot of time on different internet forums interacting with people, sp=\r\necially=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0with those in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0t=\r\nhe age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and everything with them, fro=\r\nm Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impa=\r\nrt right knowledge to young people who will be the future of this country.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; He is am omnivorous person.

T=\r\nhis is one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When=\r\n we are discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - wh=\r\no lived in a different century - was right or now. That would be a differen=\r\nt debate. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;2) Ramakrishna did not write anything -:). He only&nbs=\r\np;woke up&nbsp;people to what ever degree was necessary and gave general ta=\r\nlks on spirituality. So, one can always contend that a mistake maybe the bi=\r\nographers mistake. M or Saradananda&nbsp;could very well have been mistaken=\r\n in what he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a=\r\n composition. When one writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in t=\r\nhinking, and checking up possibilities of different shades of meanings for =\r\nthe simple reason that the audience is large, unknown and spread out&nbsp;o=\r\nver huge spans of time.&nbsp;When one talks, and that too talking to friend=\r\ns, or close people, one does not need to be careful of every word or senten=\r\nce one speaks. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;To understand this better,&nbsp;&nbsp;we have to =\r\nthink - scientifically speaking - how communication happens in three levels=\r\n. Around 33 percent of the communication is through the words, 64 percent t=\r\nhrough body language and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or sub conscious co=\r\nmmunication. This last three percent is the most powerful. When a person ca=\r\nn use this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of=\r\n people. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you l=\r\nisten to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. =\r\nBut if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you will definitely f=\r\neel an energy and get swayed.&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia=\r\n&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;Then comes body language whi=\r\nch is so important.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;if you enter a Govt office in In=\r\ndia, you may find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their cha=\r\nir with their spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact=\r\n on them. That is why the files in Govt. of India offices move at a&nbsp;sn=\r\nail&#39;s pace.&nbsp;If you find that someone whom you are talking to&nbsp;is s=\r\nitting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if t=\r\nhe person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure=\r\n that there is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing=\r\n out the words through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect=\r\n, once you leave his presence he probably&nbsp;won&#39;t bother about what you =\r\nsaid.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DGeorgia&gt;And last is spoken word. When two people speak with each ot=\r\nher, both words and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub consciou=\r\ns communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy exch=\r\nanged/communication not through words but through other means. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;W=\r\nhen you write down something, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one n=\r\needs to be extra cautious while writing something in order to convey the co=\r\nrrect sense. That is why there are so many more rules to be followed&nbsp;f=\r\nor writing anything.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;So therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; to=\r\n someone he is probably communicating using all means possible. But if he w=\r\nere to write a book and mention &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without further explan=\r\nation of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. Bu=\r\nt he never wrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they explain=\r\ned the sense. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;Contrast this to that line from Ramacharit Manas, =\r\nwithout any qualifications, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are wort=\r\nhy of &quot;tadan&quot;.&nbsp; If I were a woman, I would take offense&nbsp;to that l=\r\nine.&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DGeorgia&gt;3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious litera=\r\nture, I keep the Koran as a standard.

(Shakir&#39;s version of the =\r\nKoran, Quran, 4:34) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A lot of muslims I ha=\r\nve talked to, defend the above&nbsp;giving various reasons one of which is =\r\n&#39;misunderstanding context&#39;.

That is the sense that comes out from a normal readin=\r\ng of that line.

The highlighting is done by you, not in=\r\n the actual text. If he ment pashu-nari he should have used some basic gram=\r\nmer to remove confusion. He did not.

Let me try again. He is not=\r\n really saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite a=\r\ngrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinio=\r\nn)=C3=82&nbsp;God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He=\r\n descended in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama=\r\n+ayana. A path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principle=\r\ns.=C3=82&nbsp; Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharat=\r\na, which was not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow\n Krishna&#39;s path.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute God=\r\nhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide betwe=\r\nen the worshipper and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a =\r\nlife like Rama did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great k=\r\ning, a nobel man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of followi=\r\nng such a life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but h=\r\ne can follow the life of a great man.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarl=\r\ny, even today lot of people advise that one should try to become like Vivek=\r\nananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like Vivekanadas in teh =\r\nfuture. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self realized=C3=82&nbsp;sain=\r\nt of highest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C3=82&nbsp;one who=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;lived like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C3=82&nbsp;men, fearless an=\r\nd uncompromising and principled. If every=C3=82&nbsp;person would constantl=\r\ny\n think that Vivekanada was a saint=C3=82&nbsp;who worked by the pwoer of =\r\na deity or due to his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;no one will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;emulate his way of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;the image he projected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THA=\r\nT can inspire people. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;On the othe=\r\nr hand=C3=82&nbsp;you will never hear anyone advising that one should try t=\r\no lead a life like Ramarkishna.=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;That is impossible. =\r\nHe=C3=82&nbsp; was God incarnate leading a charmed life.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;Ramachandra incomparison to Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actio=\r\nns but one can never=C3=82&nbsp;become Krishna. Therefore, my friend believ=\r\nes, one should not consider Rama as a God to be worshipped, but as a model =\r\nto be followed.
