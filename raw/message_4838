An unhealthy body may not be able to focus on god. One with an empty stomach may not be able to focus on god.\n \nOf course, the *final* goal of spiritual sadhana is to be able to focus on god even when one is unhealthy and in material troubles. But, until one makes sufficient progress, one will be troubled by physical and material problems. Pretending that one is not troubled does not solve the problem or improve one&#39;s self-control. One should do enough to take care of physical and material well-being, even to do sadhana and make spiritual progress.\n \nDetachment and rejectiona are different. Trying for something while being prepared for not getting it is detached action. Running away from something is rejection. Trying for something and getting so disappointed when one does not get it that one wastes a lot of time and energy worrying about it is attached action. Detached action is what enables one to make further spiritual progress.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;Dr. A.

Because of curiosity I read Shri Narayan kavacham today. I was amazed to read that In the verses we request Narayana&#39;s incarnations to protect us from enemies. And these enemies include both our external enemies and our internal enemies like anger, ignorance, laziness, lust etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir I am curious that can this kavacham be used by a sadhaka seeking spiritual upliftment for overcoming his internal enemies?\n&gt; \n&gt; Can it be used to accelerate one&#39;s travel on spiritual path? \n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; Atul\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Fire in homam is a symbol of Sun on earth. External Sun shining brightly and destroying external darkness is akin to the inner light shining brightly and destroying inner darkness. Burning homam fire is meant for stimulating and making the inner light shine brighter. So, normally, homam is performed during the daytime. When Sun is just rising and destroying darkness is a great time for homam.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; External rituals are meant to cause internal modification through resonance. Rules and conventions followed in rituals are meant for maximizing the internal result of a ritual. They are not meant for scaring one away from the ritual!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Doing homam in the evening or night is not a &quot;wrong deed&quot; at all. Unlike some deities who may manifest in different forms during morning or afternoon or evening, Krishna is Krishna always. He can be worshipped anytime. In fact, he was born around midnight!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; My 2 cents is that you should feel free to do Krishna homam in the evening, after your work. If you like Krishna, go for Krishna homam.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

Some times I have to attend emergencies in early morning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I used to perform Homam during winters regularly in early morning. but after summers started we usually get high incidence of Emergencies in early morning due to harvesting season, then paddy sowing season and now a days it is time to pour insecticides and pesticides in fields.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Due to all these reasons I had to quit my routine of doing homam in early morning. And sometimes it also cause disturbance in my Japam schedule. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I seriously want to resume my routine of Homam. And as Shri Krishna Homam is done in morning I am hesitant to do it in evening with a fear of doing a wrong deed. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  In winters I will be able to do the homam in early morning as Emergency turnout it very less at that time. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But Till then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your book &quot;Vedic Wisdom&quot; Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I switch to Ganapati homam to be performed at night?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I want to stick to Shri Krishna homam as I feel myself attached to Him. But Doing Maha Ganapati Homam will also have same importance for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hope to find a suitable answer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atul\n\n\n"}}
