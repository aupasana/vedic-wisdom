Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I felt a papable and far stronger effect when I\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; did the homa at night. The meditation too\n&gt; &gt; happened in a more focused =\r\nand better way.\n&gt; \n&gt; There may be a couple of factors behind this.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n energy of some deities is more active during night than the day. After \n&gt; =\r\nall, night is symbolic of the primordial state of the universe. Deities \n&gt; =\r\npersonifying the energies and state of the universe in the initial \n&gt; primo=\r\nrdial stages are easier to identify with during the night. Thus, if you \n&gt; =\r\ndo homam for Mahaakaala, Kaali, Bhairava etc, night time is more apt.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMore importantly, some people doing homam in the morning before going to \n&gt;=\r\n work feel some kind of time pressure in the mind (atleast sub-consciously)=\r\n. \n&gt; When you know that you have to finish and go to work in another 30 min=\r\n or \n&gt; hour or whatever, that pressure may be at the back of the mind. Wher=\r\neas if \n&gt; one does at the end of the day, when there is no pressure of any =\r\nkind, the \n&gt; mind may be more relaxed and one may be able to focus better.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, I suggest not worrying about all these things and startin=\r\ng the \n&gt; practice with some time or the other. If morning is convenient, do=\r\n in the \n&gt; morning. If evening is convenient, do in the evening. If night i=\r\ns \n&gt; convenient, do in the night. Pick a time and do it at that time everyd=\r\nay or \n&gt; every week or at whatever frequency you have chosen. After you do =\r\nit for a \n&gt; while, then you may think of experimenting with a different tim=\r\ne and see \n&gt; which time is working better. In the beginning, it pays to jus=\r\nt get started \n&gt; with some time or the other.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also feel some sort =\r\nof activity/squeeze ai the solar\n&gt; &gt; plexus....sort of ,what one feels at t=\r\nhe heart when\n&gt; &gt; one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\n&gt; \n&gt; When one fo=\r\ncuses mind on a mantra, one MAY feel activity in various parts of \n&gt; the bo=\r\ndy, like a tingling sensation or pressure or heat or coldness or \n&gt; crawlin=\r\ng of ants etc. Such activity may be felt in various parts of the \n&gt; body, l=\r\nike the crown of the head or forehead or throat or heart or solar \n&gt; plexus=\r\n etc. It merely shows the movement of praana vaayu in various chakras \n&gt; an=\r\nd nadis that are in need of praana (life force). For example, Manipoora \n&gt; =\r\nchakra in the solar plexus area is the seat of fire element, which is the \n=\r\n&gt; center of one&#39;s sense of control and pride. Any personality traits relate=\r\nd \n&gt; to short temper, pride, anger etc will be linked to some deficiencies =\r\nin the \n&gt; Manipoora chakra. When one is able to focus in meditation well, s=\r\nome praana \n&gt; may be moving in the Manipoora chakra area and trying to impr=\r\nove the \n&gt; deficiency.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, if a considerable amount of praana m=\r\noves in particular nadis, one \n&gt; may even get a sensation of moving up ot t=\r\nilting to a side or back etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the important thing is to ignore all=\r\n these and not be distracted by any \n&gt; of these sensations. Awareness and a=\r\nnalysis of the sensation distracts the \n&gt; mind from its focus on the mantra=\r\n. As praana moves everywhere and clears all \n&gt; deficiencies, one becomes re=\r\nady for realization.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidh=\r\ni.Can i\n&gt; &gt; meditate even after the fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n does not last very long after the aahutis are done.And i\n&gt; &gt; would like to=\r\n stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can meditate even after the fire goes off=\r\n. Homam burns some \n&gt; internal impurities and internal purity is at a maxim=\r\num (local maximum) \n&gt; immediately following homam. Just sit and meditate as=\r\n long as you can. After \n&gt; that, as the day progresses and we start thinkin=\r\ng of various things, newer \n&gt; impurities may accumulate again. So meditatin=\r\ng immediately after homam is \n&gt; helpful to maximize the effect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/h=\r\nomam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;=\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;sunita=\r\n_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, M=\r\nay 25, 2009 7:42 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Can I perform homam any t=\r\nime?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; I too do havan in the evening,but before sunset.I d=\r\no it around 6 pm.\n&gt; It always feels great.\n&gt; I also feel some sort of activ=\r\nity/squeeze ai the solar plexus....sort of \n&gt; ,what one feels at the heart =\r\nwhen one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\n&gt; I am at presnt doing the ba=\r\nre minimum homa vidhi.Can i meditate even after \n&gt; the fire has gone out.I =\r\nuse ghee, so it does not last very long after the \n&gt; aahutis are done.And i=\r\n would like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sunita.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namast=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a little experience to share in this regard.
