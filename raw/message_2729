Here there is no=\r\n ego principle &gt;(I-ness or ahamkara) and no objectification..........\n\nI am=\r\n thankful for this perticular message. you may ignore my previous question.=\r\n i am writing down my understandings as under.\n\n1. Mulaadhaar Chakra - Eart=\r\nh element, Swaadhishthaan - Water, Manipur - Fire, Anaahat - Air, Vishudhdh=\r\ni - Ether, Agna - Super Ether (Cosmic space & time) and Sahasraar - Brahman=\r\n (Non Dual, undifferentiated Brahman). Chakras have peculiar characteristic=\r\ns associated which regulates some qualities/emotions. some are binding and =\r\nsome are liberating to next chakra.\n\n2. In between each chakra, there are s=\r\nome more chakras which may represents mysterious principle of evolvement fr=\r\nom one element to the other. Like There are chakras between Sahsraar and Ag=\r\nna which hold the mystry which can explain how Undifferentiated brahman pro=\r\njected Cosmic space and time stage by stage. Same way, Chakraas between say=\r\n Swaadhishthaan and Mulaadhaar hold the principle and explain evolution of =\r\nEarth element from water element and so on and so forth.\n\n3. Kundalini rise=\r\n experience does not depend upon which chakra one is mediatating (actually =\r\nit does not require that one should meditate on those imaginery chakras). w=\r\nhatever chakra one is meditating on, the order of kundalini travel will alw=\r\nays be from Muladhaar to Sahsraar.\nKundalini rise is relevent only to the *=\r\nconcentration of mind*. focus of mind on ANY one perticular object/thought/=\r\naction.\n\n4. Self awarness (Popularly known as Kundalini Shakti) reaching Sa=\r\nhasraar ONCE means the soul is practically free from all the bondages. The =\r\nsoul may need to then only wait for the present body to drop away. The soul=\r\n may merge in to Brahman or may remain one step below participate in nature=\r\ns play for helping other souls.\n\n5. All these mapping of Brahman, Cosmic sp=\r\nace, Ehter, Air, Fire, water, Earth to the imaginery chakraas in body is th=\r\nough wonderful to know, does not help a person to actaully experience anyth=\r\ning higher. \n\nThat is it. as you know i am not much intrested in technicali=\r\nties but it is good if that is also properly understood in a simpler way. w=\r\nhy i say simpler way because different authors have used different terminol=\r\nogies to discribe the same framework (As nitish has written) but that has c=\r\nreated bias and resultant debates, misunderstandings and confusions.\n\nfinal=\r\nly as you mentioned, after all his superhuman knowledge, Shankara gives the=\r\n message of &quot;Bhaj Govindam.....nahi nahi rakshati Dukrung Karane&quot; !!! let&#39;s=\r\n engage in Homam/Japa/Dhyaan/Bhajan/Service/vichaara/... - one/more/all of =\r\nthem and findout ourselves if that is the desire.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; \n&gt; Heavens no, I wasn&#39;t suggesting meditatin=\r\ng on any chakra at all. It is \n&gt; neither necessary not sufficient to focus =\r\non ANY chakra for Kundalini to \n&gt; rise. For example, a true Kundalini awake=\r\nning experience was described in \n&gt; the following mail. That person was not=\r\n meditating/focusing on ANY chakra \n&gt; and he actually never thinks in terms=\r\n of chakras. He just meditated with a \n&gt; Veda mantra and focused the mind o=\r\nn the mantra and a deity that he is \n&gt; attached to.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Kundalini (Re: =\r\nRe: Urdhwa-Retas) - message 1476\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom/message/1476\n&gt; \n&gt; Irrespective of what one is focusing on, Kundalini goe=\r\ns from Moolaadhaara to \n&gt; Swaadhishthaana to Manipoora to Anaahata and so o=\r\nn. That order if fixed. \n&gt; Kundalini will leave a chakra and go to the next=\r\n chakra if and only if one&#39;s \n&gt; notion of &quot;I&quot; is free from certain things a=\r\nt that time. Leaving each chakra \n&gt; has different requirements and has do w=\r\nith the corresponding element and \n&gt; limitations represented by it. As long=\r\n as your self-awareness is \n&gt; characterized by the qualities represented by=\r\n Moolaadhaara , Kundalini \n&gt; cannot advance from Moolaadhaara.\n&gt; \n&gt; Intense=\r\n focus on something (e.g. a mantra or a deity) may free one \n&gt; temporarily =\r\nfrom the limitations represented by a chakra, enabling Kundalini \n&gt; to leav=\r\ne the chakra. If Kundalini left Moolaadhaara chakra, it does not mean \n&gt; th=\r\ne person was (or should be) meditating on Moolaadhaara chakra or \n&gt; Swaadhi=\r\nshthaana chakra. THAT is irrelevant. What is relevant instead is \n&gt; whether=\r\n the person overcame the limitations represented by Moolaadhaara \n&gt; chakra.=\r\n Same with other chakras.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us go back to t=\r\nhe order of elements:\n&gt; \n&gt; Apart from Upanishads, Vasishtha clearly mention=\r\ns in Yoga Vaasishtham that \n&gt; creation order is ether, air, fire, water and=\r\n earth and dissolution order is \n&gt; the reverse. When earth, water, fire, ai=\r\nr and finally ether are dissolved, \n&gt; Vasishtha says that cosmic space rema=\r\nins. This is the same thing that Nitish \n&gt; was quoting as &quot;super ether&quot;, bu=\r\nt it is not considered as an &quot;element&quot; by \n&gt; Vasishtha. When that too is di=\r\nssolved, one merges in Brahman. From Brahman \n&gt; comes the cosmic space and =\r\nfrom it come the five elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sahasrara chakra represents Brahman. H=\r\nere there is no ego principle (I-ness \n&gt; or ahamkara) and no objectificatio=\r\nn. Aajnaa chakra represents the cosmic \n&gt; space which is accompanied by the=\r\n concept of Time. The ego principle \n&gt; (I-ness) is active here and there is=\r\n a sense of I, but it is very subtle and \n&gt; has not yet expanded. When this=\r\n ego principle expands, element of ether is \n&gt; created from it and later ai=\r\nr, fire, water and earth are created. Chakras \n&gt; from Visuddhi to Moolaadha=\r\nara represent ether to earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; The creation of five elements from the c=\r\nosmic space is explained by \n&gt; shastras, but how Brahman gave rise to cosmi=\r\nc space and Time (where there is \n&gt; objectification and I-ness) is mysterio=\r\nus. Cosmic space and Time represent \n&gt; the early stages of the field of dua=\r\nlity, while Brahman represents \n&gt; non-duality. The transition between the t=\r\nwo involves several stages that are \n&gt; mysterious.\n&gt; \n&gt; Correspondingly, th=\r\nere are several secretive chakras in between Sahasraara \n&gt; chakra and Aajna=\r\na chakra. They are at the top of the forehead and at the top \n&gt; of the head=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether it makes sense to you or not, some great yogis consider some=\r\n of \n&gt; those chakras to be better than Sahasraara. In Sahasraara, there is =\r\nno \n&gt; I-ness, no objects and no experience. In the secretive chakras just u=\r\nnder \n&gt; it, there is a very subtle I-ness, there are objects and very subtl=\r\ne \n&gt; experiences. There is some &quot;rasa&quot; (juice/experience) to be had by I-ne=\r\nss \n&gt; here.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot recommend any text on Ku=\r\nndalini as definitive. &quot;The Serpent Power: \n&gt; Shat chakra Nirupana&quot; by Arth=\r\nur Avalon (Sir John Woodruff - sp?) is \n&gt; considered a good text, but I hon=\r\nestly did not find it valuable. It is just \n&gt; theoretical. Manish values Vi=\r\nmalananda very highly and asked me to buy \n&gt; &quot;Kundalini&quot; by Robert Svoboda.=\r\n He told me, &quot;though not perfect, this is the \n&gt; best book you can find the=\r\nse days on the subject. Whether you read it or \n&gt; not, buy it so that you c=\r\nan later compare notes with what you experience.&quot; \n&gt; Whatever I have learnt=\r\n experientially so far is quite consistent with the \n&gt; simple and lucid ide=\r\nas represented in that book.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, various upanishads and works o=\r\nf Shankaracharya will give you a \n&gt; clearer perspective on some issues and =\r\nenhance your internal understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Shankara=\r\ncharya said in &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; composition: &quot;O fool, pray to \n&gt; Govinda ti=\r\nrelessly. When your time&#39;s up, all this knowledge and these \n&gt; technicaliti=\r\nes aren&#39;t going to save you.&quot; Moreover, different people \n&gt; sometimes think=\r\n in different terms and misunderstand others. It is like a \n&gt; Pascal langua=\r\nge programmer reading C language software, guessing what it \n&gt; means and re=\r\nporting bugs based on wrong understanding of the language.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is with =\r\na sense of discomfort and amusement that I write about these \n&gt; technical m=\r\natters these days. I suppose I have to deal with these \n&gt; technicalities be=\r\ncause some important people that I care about are \n&gt; interested in these te=\r\nchnicalities at this point of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; If people just do homam or japam o=\r\nr whatever sadhana they chose and focus \n&gt; all of their mental energy on th=\r\neir chosen deity, it will be more useful...\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org=\r\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostude=\r\nnt@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 02, 20=\r\n09 2:24 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creation, Physics & Reali=\r\nty\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What exactly is your proof that effa=\r\ncing of tattwas/chakras must be \n&gt; &gt; pursued in serial order? The well know=\r\nn Pt. Gopi Krishna, who only \n&gt; &gt; meditated on Sahasrara (crown of his head=\r\n) had the experience appended \n&gt; &gt; below, please read if you havent seen it=\r\n earlier. Also what is your proof \n&gt; &gt; that meditating on a chakra effaces =\r\nit - this is not obvious - why might \n&gt; &gt; it not intensify it while purifyi=\r\nng it? Is there any definitive text on \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini (Sat cakra nirupana i=\r\ns just too broad and symbolic for me)..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gopi Krishna:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Over a period of years, he developed the ability t=\r\no sit for a period of \n&gt; &gt; hours in concentration without any discomfort. T=\r\nhe following account which \n&gt; &gt; took place in 1937 describes his first Kund=\r\nalini experience which occurred \n&gt; &gt; while he was visualizing &quot;an imaginary=\r\n Lotus in full bloom, radiating \n&gt; &gt; light&quot; at the crown of his head.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;    Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; liquid light entering my brain through the spinal cord.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Entir=\r\nely unprepared for such a development, I was completely taken by \n&gt; &gt; surpr=\r\nise; but regaining my self-control, keeping my mind on the point of \n&gt; &gt; co=\r\nncentration. The illumination grew brighter and brighter, the roaring \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlouder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light. It is impossible t=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; describe the experience accurately. I felt the point of consciousnes=\r\ns that \n&gt; &gt; was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light. It grew =\r\nwider and \n&gt; &gt; wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the immedi=\r\nate object of \n&gt; &gt; its perception, appeared to have receded into the distan=\r\nce until I became \n&gt; &gt; entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousn=\r\ness without any \n&gt; &gt; outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, with=\r\nout any feeling or \n&gt; &gt; sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea=\r\n of light \n&gt; &gt; simultaneously conscious and aware at every point, spread ou=\r\nt, as it were, \n&gt; &gt; in all directions without any barrier or material obstr=\r\nuction. I was no \n&gt; &gt; longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I=\r\n knew myself to be, a \n&gt; &gt; small point of awareness confined to a body, but=\r\n instead was a vast circle \n&gt; &gt; of consciousness in which the body was but =\r\na point, bathed in light and in \n&gt; &gt; a state of exultation and happiness im=\r\npossible to describe.\n&gt; &gt;    Krishna, Pandit Gopi, Kundalini: Path to Highe=\r\nr Consciousness (New \n&gt; &gt; Delhi: Orient Paperbacks, 1992), pps. 6-7 &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that look=\r\ns and feels \n&gt; &gt;&gt; in a particular way physically. Apart from the physical a=\r\nspect, one may \n&gt; &gt;&gt; think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, cer=\r\ntain needs, certain \n&gt; &gt;&gt; belongings etc. All those concepts one has about =\r\nwho one is, form one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-awareness and Kundalini represents that s=\r\nelf-awareness. Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anythi=\r\nng* that is *solid* in nature \n&gt; &gt;&gt; within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one=\r\n is is still remaining. Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra=\r\n, if *anything* that is *solid* or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cum=\r\nulative idea of who one is is still \n&gt; &gt;&gt; remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; M=\r\nany people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakr=\r\nas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaa=\r\nra, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of =\r\nowning \n&gt; &gt;&gt; anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each e=\r\nlement is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the phys=\r\nical as well \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface e=\r\nven one element \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a s=\r\nhort duration of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The order in whi=\r\nch elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is - earth,=\r\n water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; effaced e=\r\nlements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; water=\r\n and earth.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
