Since narsimha has alrea=\r\ndy indicated that all the gods are part of your own consciousness i subsitu=\r\nted the external water offering part with some internal visulalization. I w=\r\nas doubtful initially if this is the right way but now i can say for sure i=\r\nt works :) I am nearing the completion of 40 days. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Please suggest =\r\nme mantras for Laxmi-Narayan and their source as now i am keen on some mant=\r\nra for them. Any beej mantra/ moola mantra will be perfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Shreem =\r\nis beej mantra for narayan. Is there any beej mantra for Narayan.\n&gt; \n&gt; rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; Saurabh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
