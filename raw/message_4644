Bhagav=\r\nan replied: &quot;You always\nhave freedom not to identify yourself with the body=\r\n and the pleasures and\npains that come to it as its prarabdha.&quot;\n\nOne summer=\r\n afternoon I was sitting opposite Sri Bhagavan in the Old Hall\nwith a fan i=\r\nn my hand and said to him: &quot;I can understand that the\noutstanding events in=\r\n a man&#39;s life, such as his country, nationality,\nfamily, career or professi=\r\non, marriage, death, etc., are all predestined by\nhis karma, but can it be =\r\nthat all the details of his life, down to the\nminutest, have already been d=\r\netermined? Now, for instance, I put this fan\nthat is in my hand down on the=\r\n floor here. Can it be that it was already\ndecided that on such and such a =\r\nday, at such and such an hour, I would move\nthe fan like this and put it do=\r\nwn here?&quot;\n\nBhagavan replied: &quot;Certainly.&quot; He continued: &quot;Whatever this body=\r\n is to do\nand whatever experiences it is to pass through was already decide=\r\nd when it\ncame into existence.&quot;\n\nThereupon I naturally exclaimed: &quot;What bec=\r\nomes then of man&#39;s freedom and\nresponsibility for his actions?&quot;\n\nBhagavan e=\r\nxplained: &quot;The only freedom one has is to strive for and acquire\nthe Jnana =\r\nwhich will enable him not to identify himself with the body. The\nbody will =\r\ngo through the actions rendered inevitable by prarabdha (destiny)\nbased on =\r\nthe balance sheet of past lives, and a man is free either to\nidentify himse=\r\nlf with the body and be attached to the fruits of its actions\nor to be deta=\r\nched from it and be a mere witness of its activities.&quot;\n\nFrom various other =\r\ntalks that I had with him, I am convinced that this was\nBhagavan&#39;s teaching=\r\n. I will only refer here to the classic reply he gave to\nhis mother when, a=\r\ns a young Sage, he rejected her tearful request to go back\nhome with her. &quot;=\r\nThe Ordainer controls the fate of man according to his\nprarabdha. What is d=\r\nestined not to happen will not happen, try as you may.\nWhat is destined to =\r\nhappen will happen, try as one may to prevent it. This\nis certain. So the b=\r\nest course is to remain silent.&quot;\n\nHowever, if the law of karma as pure caus=\r\ne and effect is so supreme as to be\nabsolutely inviolable and inexorable, o=\r\nne may ask of what use is religion,\nGod or prayer. There seems to have been=\r\n no time when man did not turn to an\nall-powerful and all-loving God who co=\r\nuld save him from his sins and\nsuffering and give him peace and bliss. Star=\r\nting from the Vedic times and\npassing through the period of the great bhakt=\r\nas, both Saivite and\nVaishnavite, and down to comparatively recent times, t=\r\nhere is a great mass\nof religious literature which states quite clearly tha=\r\nt whatever sins a man\nmay have committed, God in His mercy can save him. Th=\r\ney have also stated\nthat all karma, including prarabdha, can be destroyed b=\r\ny the Grace of God,\nlike cotton by fire. Western saints and mystics have sa=\r\nid the same thing and\nhave ridiculed the idea that because God is just, imp=\r\nartial and righteous He\ncannot save the sinner but must punish him first fo=\r\nr his transgressions. For\nif that were so, what would become of the other a=\r\nttributes of God such as\nMercy, Love, Fatherhood and Motherhood? The Vaishn=\r\navites stress the quality\nof Vatsalya or loving-kindness in God and illustr=\r\nate it by the vatsalya of a\ncow which, as soon as its calf is born, begins =\r\nto lick it all over,\noblivious to the fact that it is unclean. They say God=\r\n does not wait for the\nsinner to become pure before He can save him, but sa=\r\nves him just as He finds\nhim if only the man desires, cries out for and sup=\r\nplicates salvation. If a\nman who is suffering turns to God for help and rel=\r\nief in full faith that God\ncan save him he is sure to be saved. That is wha=\r\nt the scriptures say and\nwhat countless saints have declared. Christ said: =\r\n&quot;Come unto me all ye that\nare weary and heavy laden and I will give you res=\r\nt. Fear not.&quot; Lord Krishna\nsaid almost the same thing. When Arjuna, after h=\r\nearing what Krishna had to\nsay about all the different kinds of yoga which =\r\ncould secure Liberation,\ncomplained that he was confused by all these instr=\r\nuctions and felt that he\ncould not follow them, Krishna said: &quot;Then give up=\r\n all dharmas and take\nrefuge only in Me. Grieve not. I will save you from a=\r\nll your sins.\n\nWhat is demanded here is total surrender to God by throwing =\r\noneself\ncompletely on God&#39;s Mercy and not desiring anything for oneself. Le=\r\naving\neverything to God the all-loving and all-knowing is not so easy as it=\r\n may\nsound. However, the point I want to make here is that Grace is all-pow=\r\nerful\nand that even the law of karma by which, they say, a man must reap wh=\r\nat he\nhas sown, with no exception whatsoever, can be overcome. I am strongl=\r\ny\ninclined by temperament to believe this, and I believe that Bhagavan has\n=\r\nconfirmed it for me. I will quote here what I wrote on the subject on pages=\r\n\n100 and 101 of my little book My Recollections of Bhagavan Sri Ramana\n\n&quot;An=\r\nother point on which I more than once argued with Bhagavan is the extent\nto=\r\n which Grace can override prarabdha or destiny. My main line of argument\nth=\r\nroughout was (and my conviction now as ever is) that God is all-powerful\nan=\r\nd that nothing is impossible for Him, and that if one got and could get\nonl=\r\ny what one had worked for and merited, there would be no place at all for\nG=\r\nrace. Most often Bhagavan remained silent when I indulged in such arguments=\r\n\neither by myself or with others, some of whom took my side and others the\n=\r\nopposite side; but from various remarks and observations that he made on\ndi=\r\nfferent occasions I have come to the conclusion that the following is his\na=\r\nttitude in the matter: &#39;Of course, nothing is impossible to God, but\neveryt=\r\nhing happens according to the order established by God&#39;s will or plan\nand e=\r\nxceptions are very few. How many Markandeyas, are there in our\nPuranas?&#39;\n\n&quot;=\r\nOn the other hand, many authoritative books have clearly said (and Bhagavan=\r\n\nhas quoted them with approval) that one look from a Jnani can save us from=\r\n\nthe effects of all our karmas, past or present, prarabdha included. And Sr=\r\ni\nJanaki Matha has published in her Tamil journal that when she discussed t=\r\nhis\nquestion once with Bhagavan, maintaining that His Grace can help one ev=\r\nen to\novercome prarabdha, he told her: &#39;If you have such faith it will be s=\r\no.&#39; &quot;\n\nI find that I cannot usefully add anything to this quotation, but I =\r\nshould\nperhaps explain the reference to Markandeya. It is said in the Puran=\r\nas that\nMarkandeya was destined to live for only sixteen years and that he =\r\nprayed to\nSiva and received the boon that he would be perpetually sixteen. =\r\nBhagavan\nmentioned it to stress his point that the obvious and spectacular\n=\r\nintervention of Divine Grace is very exceptional.\n\nIt is said in the Upanis=\r\nhads that one cannot say when or why or to whom\nGrace will come. It is said=\r\n that it will fall only on him whom it chooses. A\nhundred might make the ef=\r\nfort and yet only one or two of them might be\nchosen. No one can predict an=\r\nything about Grace except that it is\nunpredictable.\n\nIt will be interesting=\r\n here to turn to the following quotations from Paul\nBrunton given in my boo=\r\nk Day by Day with Bhagavan.\n\n&quot;Divine Grace is a manifestation of the cosmic=\r\n free will in operation. It\ncan alter the course of events in a mysterious =\r\nmanner through its own\nunknown laws, which are superior to all natural laws=\r\n, and can modify the\nlatter by interaction. It is the most powerful force i=\r\nn the universe.\n\n&quot;It descends and acts only when it is invoked by total sel=\r\nf-surrender. It\nacts from within, because God resides in the heart of all b=\r\neings. Its\nwhisper can be heard only in a mind purified by self-surrender a=\r\nnd prayer.&quot;\n\nThe above two quotations were contained in a book called Divin=\r\ne Grace\nThrough Total Self-Surrender by one D. C. Desai, and Bhagavan himse=\r\nlf, on\ngoing through the book, read them out to us.\n\nMy saying that God&#39;s G=\r\nrace is unpredictable and has power to remit sins and\nerase karma should no=\r\nt be taken to mean that this Grace can be obtained\nwithout effort. On the c=\r\nontrary, great effort is necessary. A man,\nrecognising that he cannot raise=\r\n himself by himself, must fall at the feet\nof God and cry: &quot;Lord, I am weak=\r\n and powerless. You alone can save me. I\ntake refuge in You. Do what You wi=\r\nll with me.&quot; This is the effort that must\nbe made: an effort towards attain=\r\nment of effortlessness after realizing the\nuselessness of our own puny effo=\r\nrts.\n\nBhagavan has strongly commended the path of total self-surrender as a=\r\n sure\nway to salvation and has called devotion the &#39;Mother of Jnana&#39;. That\n=\r\nwell-known early devotee of Bhagavan, Sivaprakasam Pillai, for whom Who am\n=\r\nI? was written, says in one of his poems: &quot;To everyone you give only this\ni=\r\nnstruction: &#39;Find out who you are.&#39; If, after that, they humbly ask for\nmor=\r\ne guidance, you tell them as your final word: &#39;There is a power which\nmoves=\r\n you and me and all others. Lay your ego at the feet of that Mother.&#39; &quot;\n\nFr=\r\nom various actions and remarks of Bhagavan I have not the slightest doubt\nt=\r\nhat he regards the path of surrender as the best way for me. It is true\ntha=\r\nt he maintained quite definitely that final Liberation is only possible\nthr=\r\nough Knowledge of the Self, which is being the Self, because Knowing is\nBei=\r\nng; but that comes inevitably to one who has completely surrendered.\n\nSourc=\r\ne: -- The Mountain Path, 1967, Vol. 4, No. 2\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd6f0ce13983a048aef5f45\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nForwarded by a kind reader:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;Referring to Sri Krishna&#39;s telling Arjuna: &quot;Deluded by Maya yo=\r\nu refuse to fight, but your own nature will force you to fight;&quot; a dev=\r\notee asked Bhagavan whether we have no free will at all.

Do what You will wit=\r\nh me.&quot; This is the effort that must be made: an effort towards attainm=\r\nent of effortlessness after realizing the uselessness of our own puny effor=\r\nts.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan has strongly commend=\r\ned the path of total self-surrender as a sure way to salvation and has call=\r\ned devotion the &#39;Mother of Jnana&#39;.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0That well-known earl=\r\ny devotee of Bhagavan, Sivaprakasam Pillai, for whom Who am I? was written,=\r\n says in one of his poems: &quot;To everyone you give only this instruction=\r\n: &#39;Find out who you are.&#39; If, after that, they humbly ask for more =\r\nguidance, you tell them as your final word: &#39;There is a power which mov=\r\nes you and me and all others. Lay your ego at the feet of that Mother.&#39;=\r\n &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;From various actions and remarks of Bhagavan I have not th=\r\ne slightest doubt that he regards the path of surrender as the best way for=\r\n me. It is true that he maintained quite definitely that final Liberation i=\r\ns only possible through Knowledge of the Self, which is being the Self, bec=\r\nause Knowing is Being; but that comes inevitably to one who has completely =\r\nsurrendered.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: -- Th=\r\ne Mountain Path, 1967, Vol. 4, No. 2&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px=\r\n;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0p=\r\nx;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd6f0ce13983a048aef5f45--\r\n\n"}}
