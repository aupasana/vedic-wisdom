On=\r\nly very advanced sadhakas will be able to identify\n&gt; &gt; rnas / karmic debts =\r\nand know how/where/why they are to be paid off. The rest\n&gt; &gt; of us have to =\r\nfollow dharma, which includes standing up for what is right\n&gt; &gt; and righteo=\r\nus and not being defeatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; have =\r\nwritten off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Krishna urged him to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate and complex and delicate to =\r\nbe\n&gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has reached certain very very high levels of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partial vision.=\r\n Only\n&gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of=\r\n karma and\n&gt; &gt; knows best how to dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nDear Aditiji and others,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Arjun was a great sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. =\r\nHe did so much sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him d=\r\nay and night. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the=\r\n rarest of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; the time of the battl=\r\ne, because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; one who knows how =\r\nto worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; yourself can you wo=\r\nrship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was=\r\n beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happ=\r\nened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even b=\r\nefore, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s li=\r\nla or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as=\r\n a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but=\r\n the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ok, now once Ar=\r\njun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; Krishna i=\r\nn his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; who de=\r\nstroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the battle when all the=\r\n Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; person who had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s =\r\nSudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... ab=\r\nout who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory.........\n&gt; &gt; All that=\r\n man said was that at the beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; Sudarsh=\r\nana start out from one end of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt destruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n And the blood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at His side, others may not b=\r\ne quite\n&gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a docto=\r\nr&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thriving surgical career when I =\r\nread this a few\n&gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; He said something similar about the mon=\r\ney earned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that=\r\n time).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrend=\r\ner to God. I\n&gt; &gt; freely admitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I=\r\n was a complete\n&gt; &gt; fool and knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know =\r\nbecause of this.\n&gt; &gt; Whatever you ever do in life, just try and be straight=\r\n in every dealing\n&gt; &gt; that you have with anybody, give whatever you can, tu=\r\nrn away nobody from\n&gt; &gt; your door, who knows when God will come to test you=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This does not mean that one is fatalistic and does nothing, but =\r\nit means\n&gt; &gt; that terrific sadhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSadhana and a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; cha Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being), are essential. Before =\r\nI met\n&gt; &gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas th=\r\nemselves, I\n&gt; &gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, how=\r\n will you lead\n&gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God yourself=\r\n face to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (becaus=\r\ne a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousands of y=\r\nears which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with patience, then=\r\n where will God go? God has to come, He\n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lov=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 27, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR R=\r\nao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you see the old mail=\r\n quoted by Hemanth below, it will answer your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; J=\r\nust because a group of people think something is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; does not free them from karma. That may not even really be their dharma.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing one&#39;s dharma, as explained below, is very difficult. As one =\r\nbecomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s dharma becomes clearer to one. The sense of dhar=\r\nma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, even doing one&#39;s true dharma does not mean one does no=\r\nt incur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karma. If Nature selects someone, because of one&#39;s prior cond=\r\nitioning and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; debts, to kill thousand bad people, and one fulfils dhar=\r\nma by killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thousand bad people, that person WILL incur new karma f=\r\nor it. Dharma (duty)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (liberation) are two different purush=\r\narthas and not one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfilling dharma is helpful for liberation, but =\r\nnot sufficient.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to doing dharma, one needs to overc=\r\nome ego (I-ness) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense of doership goes =\r\ndown, the speed at which new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. Dharma be=\r\ncomes clearer. For liberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and the sense o=\r\nf doership and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) without attachme=\r\nnt and doership.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key =\r\nconcepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;=\r\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Films that make a difference: ht=\r\ntp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard =\r\nthat Muslims used to behead meditating sages head when they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; medi=\r\ntating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma is to kill other religious people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nso will Muslims attact bad karma or sin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Hemanth Srin=\r\nivas &lt;hemanthks@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Yes, even I think one has to follow Dharma.

Krishna =\r\nclearly says in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dange=\r\nrous to follow someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Following th=\r\ne path of dharma basically means engaging in the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action/duty.=\r\n Right action varies from person to person, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and f=\r\nrom place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affecte=\r\nd in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified =\r\nwith, what debts you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tenden=\r\ncies you accumulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s =\r\nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to =\r\nkill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ment=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the=\r\n message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s d=\r\nharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts,=\r\n nature wants a person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world, =\r\nthat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendenci=\r\nes and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\noney and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to anothe=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma t=\r\no kill his gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that=\r\n there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth t=\r\no be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to t=\r\nake place and civilization destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to we=\r\nlcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill=\r\n them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th cent=\r\nury as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda ha=\r\nd been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his d=\r\nharma was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born t=\r\no renounce material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and li=\r\nve the simple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a s=\r\nimple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is b=\r\norn again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dhar=\r\nma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s =\r\ndharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying=\r\n &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in th=\r\ne light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has b=\r\neen there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste m=\r\nobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kill=\r\ning birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a ma=\r\nharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off =\r\nwith the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed=\r\n to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna=\r\n based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Kri=\r\nshna&#39;s words which tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your ca=\r\nste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the w=\r\norld. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s=\r\n dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one =\r\nwill *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, =\r\nwe get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment c=\r\nombining discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our =\r\ndharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nbest we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dhar=\r\nma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without id=\r\nentification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new=\r\n karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\no much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identif=\r\nication with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, w=\r\ne should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did =\r\nit&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of =\r\nnishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simpl=\r\nify our ego and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become=\r\n purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sen=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engag=\r\nes in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inp=\r\nuts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned =\r\nmen. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place i=\r\ns given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spi=\r\nritual master, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determ=\r\nine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was c=\r\nonfused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded p=\r\nlace to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevail=\r\ned upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of =\r\nMother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does=\r\n not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature ex=\r\npects from one can err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma i=\r\ns. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a se=\r\nt of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes =\r\nfrom person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to pl=\r\nace. Also, there are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dhar=\r\nma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understandi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so=\r\n long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. c=\r\nom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

Alt=\r\nhough he shows to his family and friends that he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concern=\r\ned and it was foolish act etc...

One of=\r\n the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=82 Aghora (aghori) does=\r\n not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as imperm=\r\nanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mi=\r\nnd on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifest=\r\nations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ca=\r\nrrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind one=\r\nself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the L=\r\nord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of t=\r\nhis ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone praises us fo=\r\nr a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are about to feel prou=\r\nd and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thin=\r\ng we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is re=\r\nal. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attr=\r\nacted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell oursel=\r\nves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other =\r\nthings that seem not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the L=\r\nord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we =\r\nare about to feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam s=\r\natya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real=\r\n.

His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestat=\r\nions* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifying them as p=\r\nure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attract=\r\nion/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permanent.

The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An =\r\naghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual wher=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=82 But, please remember that eating feces is not=\r\n the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not p=\r\nerceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is=\r\n the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no pur=\r\npose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifes=\r\ntation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be =\r\neating feces, but the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he i=\r\ns eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind o=\r\nf disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a ve=\r\ndantin also has the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when =\r\neating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Sel=\r\nf&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be ful=\r\nly absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nimpermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinja=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. =\r\nBut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure r=\r\nesults in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an inc=\r\nentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of a person w=\r\nho chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;=\r\n and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing=\r\n to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind =\r\ndwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other fo=\r\nod, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to abs=\r\norb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgustin=\r\ng. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience =\r\nmay act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily =\r\nbe accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not every=\r\none trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82=\r\n =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone =\r\nis doing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a wea=\r\nkness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexua=\r\nl thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and blo=\r\ncking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\naway from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Eve=\r\nn if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the =\r\nfascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, =\r\nhow to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it t=\r\no an extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascinatio=\r\nn from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different =\r\nactivities (one pure and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into =\r\none without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora si=\r\nts naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his =\r\njapam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to d=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure.=\r\n He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind betwe=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physic=\r\nally or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoug=\r\nhts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly ri=\r\nse in the head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadh=\r\nana, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spendin=\r\ng so much time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attr=\r\naction and thrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be brok=\r\nen down. Overall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may b=\r\ne gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nMind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tho=\r\nughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible =\r\nthat the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nthinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/since=\r\nre/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nn and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is=\r\n Vedanta and what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to und=\r\nerstand and absorb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a =\r\nhigh stakes war plan. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is certainly not suitable for all a=\r\nnd many may feel aversion. More\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dangerously, some people may feel att=\r\nraction for it based on a wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding and the thrill such an =\r\nunderstanding brings.=C3=82 Aghora stands\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for neither thrills nor per=\r\nversion, though it *may* attract some people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pursuing thrills and/or =\r\nperversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta/Upanishads are the=\r\n same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into=\r\n one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good ana=\r\nlogy for various spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paths and explains the basic reality.

As Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in one place r=\r\nather than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; water.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; One possibility is to do=\r\n a homam and then meditate at the end after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; poornaahuti with various =\r\nmantras one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not that knowl=\r\nedgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little I have been expose=\r\nd to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the layers of dualit=\r\ny surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; layer of dual=\r\nity and realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; L=\r\nalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a=\r\n mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the strictness). Both are valid paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil&lt;http://saraswatifil=\r\n/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj=\r\n_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; From: nagraj@sbcgl=\r\nobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am very much in awe after I learnt that=\r\n you do chandi homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.2=\r\n5 hours to 1.5 hours to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your chandi homam. How can you accomplish =\r\nthat feat with 700 ahutis in such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a short time? Also, in my case, I d=\r\no sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes)+ganapathi mantra japa=\r\nm 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abhishekam with pachakshari, a=\r\n deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 35 - 40 minutes =\r\ndaily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; several times a wee=\r\nk, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integrate these alo=\r\nng with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam? Could =\r\nyou please explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learnt? I am=\r\n very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I =\r\nalso have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recent=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
