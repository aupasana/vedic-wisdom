He did not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThis boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n \nI asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n \nHe said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.\n \nI helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n \nHe exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n \nThough he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n \nTime seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n \nI had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n \nInterestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n \n*        *        *\n \nThis boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.\n \nRituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n \nKeep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOvercoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.\n \nRealize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n \nDeveloping the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n\n"}}
