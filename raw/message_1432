Again the thought of accru=\r\ning \n&gt; &gt; unnecessary karma..is stopping me. Can you plese clarify which is =\r\na big \n&gt; &gt; sin / karma of these two. (karma of not giving alms to those beg=\r\ngars vs \n&gt; &gt; getting karma of their misuse).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; Krishna Kan=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; P.S: I totally agree with your point of the bad karma becuase of=\r\n misuse of \n&gt; &gt; the money we donate, but this is putting in a fix with the =\r\nthought that \n&gt; &gt; probably i&#39;m not able to help the really needy guys (i ty=\r\npically only use \n&gt; &gt; to give money to very disabled and elderly people).\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
