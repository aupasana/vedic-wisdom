I am impressed with this work.\n&gt; \n&gt; The book is called &quot;Invading the =\r\nSacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in America&quot; (editors: Krishnan Rama=\r\nswamy, Auntonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). It has 29 scholarly article=\r\ns organized in 4 sections.\n&gt; \n&gt; Perverted scholars with perverted anti-Hind=\r\nu agendas that look down upon India and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint =\r\nhave conducted perverted researches in the name of academic freedom at the =\r\nreligious studies departments of western universities, published them and g=\r\nained name and fame, trampling the sacred in the process.

[Warning: Those who are sensiti=\r\nve to offensive writings should skip the next three paragraphs.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeffr=\r\ney Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal a=\r\nnd did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there enthusiast=\r\nically helped him in the researches. In the end, what he produced is utterl=\r\ny nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation witho=\r\nut showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for factual or linguis=\r\ntic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he produc=\r\ned only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based on the PhD dissert=\r\nation won great acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal Academ=\r\ny of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was sadly=\r\n mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for le=\r\narning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a s=\r\nexually perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Ben=\r\ngali or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help from any Bengali peopl=\r\ne at the Mission for this work. He used his own faulty translations, willfu=\r\nl distortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (and dam=\r\nning) conclusions. For example, he translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;g=\r\nenitals&quot;, in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna=\r\n and a young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word t=\r\nhat means &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the p=\r\nenises of boys&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even in places where there was no material to mis-tra=\r\nnslate, he simply speculated! For example, he speculated on the meeting of =\r\nTotapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri=\r\n taught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali a=\r\nnd experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakris=\r\nhna, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut w=\r\nith another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s=\r\n nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s=\r\n attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he is not referring to any =\r\nsource and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based on his perverte=\r\nd agenda!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; If you see the book, you will see many examples o=\r\nf such pseudo-scholarship driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many=\r\n perverted people under asuric influences make their livelihood, money and =\r\nfame lying and spreading falsehoods about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu=\r\n saints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against t=\r\nhis may ignore this and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough peo=\r\nple do sadhana to strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will auto=\r\nmatically weaken.
