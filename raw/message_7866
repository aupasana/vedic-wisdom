Case in point Ramakrishna paramhans, Ramana Mahari=\r\nshi and Ranchoddasji Maharaj and many more ...\n\nI also read that a jeevanmu=\r\nkta may have  cleared up everything on his plate but there may be others ar=\r\nound him, may be accumulated many things like serving the jeevanmukta or ta=\r\nking good care of him etc.\nThis sanskars a jeevanmukta needs help clear up =\r\nfor those people\nas once the jeevanmukta merges what would have to those sa=\r\nnskars of other people?\n\nI also read recently a very interesting book that =\r\ndescribed about this jeevanmukta and a great saint suggested that  everyone=\r\n born\nin this world as human being has a lifespan allocated to him or her.\n=\r\nBut before that lifespan is over and the person accomplishes jeevanmukti, a=\r\nt that point that person can take any form etc.\nSome of these jeevanmuktas =\r\ndiscard the body and negotiate the balance of there lifespan in sukshma sar=\r\neer (body) and they present themselves at there will and help any sadhaks i=\r\nn spiritual journey.\nThey do this till there allocated lifespan is over.\n\nB=\r\nest Regards\nMitesh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; As twitter is too restrictive a medium, =\r\nI want to answer a question that \n&gt; came up in an exchange between my guru =\r\nManish and me on Twitter, here. \n&gt; Some portions of the Twitter exchange ar=\r\ne quoted at the end, in \n&gt; chronological order, in case someone is interest=\r\ned in the background.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will answer the following question posed by Ma=\r\nnish based on my \n&gt; understanding:\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this:=\r\n was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If \n&gt; so, Why did he suffer with throat can=\r\ncer if he was not identifying with \n&gt; his actions? (according to your inter=\r\npretation of Vasistha&#39;s \n&gt; definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; L=\r\net me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish loosely (in \n&gt; m=\r\ny view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and a jeevanmukta \n&gt; c=\r\nontinues to fulfil those rinas.\n&gt; \n&gt; But body is an insentient object. It h=\r\nas no rinas. The rinas are not of \n&gt; the body, but of the mind that identif=\r\nies with it. It is the \n&gt; antahkaranas of mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chit=\r\nta \n&gt; (memory/conditioning) - that are the source of various rinas, \n&gt; part=\r\nicularly chitta. As mind identifies with a body, it projects its \n&gt; rinas o=\r\nn the body and makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in \n&gt; accordanc=\r\ne with those rinas/conditioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the conditioning in chitta is comp=\r\nletely wiped out and ahamkara \n&gt; merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if =\r\nthe conditioning in chitta is \n&gt; completely wiped out and yet ahamkara cont=\r\ninues to exist with no \n&gt; limiting notions (it is basically the conditionin=\r\ng in chitta that is \n&gt; limiting), then one becomes jeevanmukta (liberated w=\r\nhile living).\n&gt; \n&gt; Unlike in the case of one who leaves body and gets mukti=\r\n, a jeevanmukta \n&gt; continues to have an I-ness (but which is not limited by=\r\n any notions or \n&gt; conditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does project in=\r\nto a body. But \n&gt; it does not say &quot;I am this body and hence this body shoul=\r\nd be kept \n&gt; healthy or strong&quot; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, whic=\r\nh is wiped \n&gt; out now!). On the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this bo=\r\ndy should \n&gt; be ignored and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, =\r\nbody keeps \n&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in =\r\nmotion \n&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experien=\r\nces and \n&gt; actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the electr=\r\nicity \n&gt; has been stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working as =\r\nthey did before. If one has \n&gt; throat cancer, indriyas may sense pain. Mana=\r\ns (sensory/motor mind) may \n&gt; process that input and register pain. Buddhi =\r\nmay analyze various \n&gt; observations and draw various conclusions (e.g. &quot;whe=\r\nn I gulp or try to \n&gt; swallow food, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when I take so an=\r\nd so herbal liquid, \n&gt; it feels better&quot; etc). A normal person whose conditi=\r\noned mind (chitta) \n&gt; says &quot;I should overcome and not have this pain&quot; may t=\r\nhink of various \n&gt; things to do and struggle with them. But an unconditione=\r\nd being has no \n&gt; such considerations. Though one may feel and express the =\r\npain and other \n&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a key point:\n&gt; \n&gt; Manas and buddhi are go=\r\nod at making objective observations and rational \n&gt; deductions, but, by the=\r\nmselves, they do not have ANY agenda. They \n&gt; neither like something nor di=\r\nslike something. THAT comes from the \n&gt; conditioning in chitta! The hallmar=\r\nk of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is \n&gt; absent!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better way \n&gt; =\r\nto express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer and \n&gt; fee=\r\nl pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas left?\n&gt; \n&gt; I hav=\r\ne already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly again. Body, \n&gt; variou=\r\ns body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and buddhi of a \n&gt; jeevanmuk=\r\nta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness is intact and \n&gt; does projec=\r\nt itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor those things \n&gt; carry any rinas=\r\n or karmas. Chitta - the repository of conditioning and \n&gt; rinas - is clean=\r\n. There are no limiting notions. One&#39;s body, indriyas, \n&gt; manas & buddhi ke=\r\nep experiencing and doing things (good or bad!) based \n&gt; on the previous mo=\r\nmentum set by the play of rnas and karmas while some \n&gt; conditioning was le=\r\nft in chitta.\n&gt; \n&gt; Body, various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma an=\r\nd manas are all \n&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness=\r\n) infuses \n&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness into them. The con=\r\nditioning \n&gt; in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and used. In=\r\nstead of \n&gt; looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or Mitra, one vi=\r\news it as \n&gt; &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to conditioning in chitta. Tha=\r\nt is what \n&gt; creates karmas and rinas. When that conditioning is *completel=\r\ny* \n&gt; overcome, ahamkara can still project awareness into those objects, bu=\r\nt \n&gt; it sees them for what they are. It does not have false and limiting \n&gt;=\r\n notions like &quot;this throat is mine and MUST feel nice and not feel \n&gt; painf=\r\nul&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Most people who may claim to be (or thin=\r\nk they are) jeevanmuktas are not \n&gt; really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; If one wants to understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham i=\r\ns \n&gt; the best book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama=\r\n \n&gt; is a detailed and elaborate definition and characterization of a \n&gt; jee=\r\nvanmukta.\n&gt; \n&gt; There may be other books that explain better how to do vario=\r\nus sadhanas \n&gt; to progress spiritually and get closer to being liberated on=\r\neday. But, \n&gt; when it comes elaborating what liberation while living actual=\r\nly is, \n&gt; there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. Of course, one can sa=\r\ny that \n&gt; this is merely an intellectual exercise as far as *we* are concer=\r\nned. It \n&gt; perhaps is, as none of may ever become a jeevanmukta..\n&gt; \n&gt; One =\r\nword of caution: I write with a very confident tone when I have \n&gt; strong c=\r\nonviction in what I write. That is how I am. But I can \n&gt; definitely be wro=\r\nng.

Nothing really, fulfilling \n&gt; al=\r\nl rnas, wait for rnas to be over.\n&gt; Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in =\r\n&quot;fulfilling all rnas&quot;, will he b \n&gt; bound again? If no, y r they called rna=\r\ns? If yes, y call him mukta?\n&gt; Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves, s=\r\nlowly or fast as may be the \n&gt; case. The rnas are of the body he or she occ=\r\nupies. He is mukta because \n&gt; he experiences, actually sees the rnas to be =\r\nthe body&#39;s only. Rnas apply \n&gt; to the body, not to you. You are that &quot;speck=\r\n of effulgent light&quot;, call \n&gt; it what you want, Atma, etc.\n&gt; Narasimha: Wel=\r\nl, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, who \n&gt; exactly bcame =\r\n&quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas of \n&gt; body&quot; r somehow n=\r\not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what happens \n&gt; to one? :-)\n&gt; Ma=\r\nnish: You are right. The mind thought, that, it was the body, instead \n&gt; of=\r\n this light. That is the original problem. Which every being is born \n&gt; wit=\r\nh. Rnas arise from this identification which creates karma. U r not \n&gt; that=\r\n, so u r not bound, when the mind realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is \n&gt; also =\r\nnot quite true, since u r that &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning\n&gt; Narasimha: Then, r=\r\n the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as u said r of the mind? When \n&gt; a mind identifies =\r\nwith light & bcomes mukta, does it hv rnas left?\n&gt; Manish: Ok, karmas proje=\r\ncted into mind, are acted on and may be \n&gt; experienced by body. So, why is =\r\na jeevanmukta subject to this? because, \n&gt; that person although aware of th=\r\ne light at all times, and of the causal \n&gt; n subtle bodies, has not yet dir=\r\nected d mind to identify as that light \n&gt; at all times, key word being &quot;all=\r\n&quot;. This gives karmas time to work. Next \n&gt; stage is 24/7 id with light\n&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \n&gt; jeeva=\r\nnmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) yet.\n&gt; Manish=\r\n: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, no \n&gt; problem in =\r\ndisagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most likely \n&gt; body should no=\r\nt exist, no?\n&gt; Narasimha: Id with light forever with body dropping off is j=\r\nust mukti, \n&gt; not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is where body stays. Is body reall=\r\ny different \n&gt; from light? In fact, is there anything other than light? Jiv=\r\nanmukti is \n&gt; seeing the play of objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & r=\r\nna are \n&gt; contradictory concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay ba=\r\nck what \n&gt; u owe. And that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly=\r\n free. \n&gt; Words like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused.\n&gt; Manish=\r\n: Will explain a bit in detail sometime.\n&gt; Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far a=\r\ns &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha \n&gt; explained as clearly & elaboratel=\r\ny as any human being can ever hope 2.\n&gt; Manish: The question to my mind is =\r\nthis: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? \n&gt; If so, Why did he suffer with throa=\r\nt cancer if he was not identifying \n&gt; with his actions? (according to your =\r\ninterpretation of Vasistha&#39;s \n&gt; definition??)\n&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt =\r\ngive a single definition. His entire \n&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition of=\r\n jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn \n&gt; later.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
