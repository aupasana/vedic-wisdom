It is a metabolic disorder. Gout occurs more frequently in males, usually in middle life.\n   \n  Gout tends to run in families. In all cases there is too much uric acid in the blood. This excess uric acid is deposited in some of the soft tissues of the body and also around certain joints. This results in painful swellings, known as tophi, which are most likely to develop in cartilage, such as in the outer ear. They also occur in the synovial membranes of such joints as the knees and ankles and particularly the big toe and also in various tendons and bursae. Even the ends of some bones may be invaded by these tophi.\n   \n  This may be the result of wearing ill-fitting shoes or tight gloves. It may also follow a heavy meal, or overindulgence in rich foods or alcohol. It sometimes comes on after a surgical operation, or after an acute infection of the nose or throat. Severe pain may develop at the base of the big toe, usually in the middle of the night. Several joints, such as the ankle or knee, may also be affected at the same time.\n   \n  The pain becomes more severe as fluid collects in the joint space and in the surrounding soft tissues. The skin is tense, hot, and shining, and is of a red or purplish color. The patient is likely to have chills and fever, a rapid pulse, and feelings of general weakness. Severe attacks may continue for several weeks, milder attacks usually last only a few days. Repeated attacks may occur each year, gradually becoming more severe and prolonged.\n   \n  Any person suffering from acute joint pain who is otherwise healthy should be tested for gout. There are times when gout may stimulate rheumatic fever, but this disease is more likely to attack larger joints, while gout tends to involve the smaller joints.\n  Gout Symptoms  Acute pain in the toe, swelling  The most common Gout symptom is acute pain in the big toe, which becomes tender, hot, and swollen in a few hours. It may also similarly affect other joints such as the knees and wrists, and sometimes more than one joint may be affected at a time. The attack, usually occurs at midnight or in the early hours of the morning when the patient is suddenly awakened. The acute attack generally lasts for a week or so. During this period, the patient may run a slight fever, and feel disinclined to eat. A serious complication of gout is the presence of kidney stones containing uric acid. In some cases the kidneys get damaged and do not function properly. \n  Causes of Gout  Gout caused due to Uric Acid Crystals  One of main causes of gout is the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints, skin, and kidneys. Uric acid is an end product of the body&#39;s chemical processes. Those affected by gout have a higher level of uric acid in the blood than the normal, due either to formation of increased amounts or reduced amounts of acid being passed out by the kidneys in the urine. This uric acid usually remains dissolved in the blood. But when the blood becomes too full of it, the uric acid forms needle-shaped crystals in the joints which bring about attacks of gout.\n  Excessive alcohol, heredity, rich foods, lack of exercise also causes gout  Other causes of gout are heredity, alcoholic drinks, regular eating of foods rich in protein and carbohydrate, lack of proper exercise, and stress.\n  HOME REMEDIES FOR GOUT   Treating gout using Cherry  The cherry, sweet or sour, is considered in effective treating gout. To start with, the patient should consume about fifteen to twenty five cherries a day. Thereafter, about ten cherries a day will keep the ailment under control. While fresh cherries are best, canned cherries can also be used occasionally.\n  Gout treatment using Vegetable Juices  Raw vegetable juices are used for gout treatment. Carrot juice, in combination with the juices of beet and cucumber, is especially valuable. Beet juice - 100 ml and cucumber juice - 100 ml should be mixed with 300 ml of carrot juice to make 500 ml of combined juice and taken daily\n  Treating Gout using French Beans  The juice of French or string beans has also proved effective in treating gout. About 150 ml of this juice should be taken daily by the patient suffering from this disease.\n  Cure for Gout using Apple  Apples are regarded as an excellent source for curing gout. The malic acid contained in them is believed to neutralise the uric acid and afford relief to gout sufferers. The patient is advised to take one apple after each meal.\n  Gout relief using Banana  Bananas have been found beneficial in the treatment of gout. A diet of bananas only for three or four days is advised for providing some relief from gout. A patient can take eight or nine bananas daily during this period and nothing else.\n  Treating gout using Lime  Lime is also used as a source in treating gout. Vitamin C is known to prevent and cure sore joints by strengthening the connective tissues of the body. The citric acid found in lime is a solvent of the uric acid which is the primary cause of this disease. The juice of half a lime, squeezed into a glass of water, should be taken twice daily.\n    \n   Avoid alcohol , protein , heavy foods , coffee and soft drinks in your diet. These foods cause uric acid levels to rise.   \n   Simple sugars, simple carbohydrates and saturated fats - they increase your body&#39;s production of uric acid and impair your kidneys&#39; ability to get rid of it. Eliminate fructose (found in food and drinks, like sodas).   \n   For natural gout treatment, eat foods high in potassium   \n   Lemon juice prevents gout attacks by stimulating the formation of calcium carbonate in the body.   \n   Taking � teaspoon of baking soda with meals will prevent gout attacks. This will help alkalize the body.   \n   Press and massage between the ball of the foot and the bottom of the big toe on each foot; then on the left foot only, stimulate a point halfway between the base of the little toe and the heel pad.   \n   Alfalfa is a good source of minerals and other nutrients that help reduce serum uric acid.   \n   For natural gout treatment, add some rose hips to vinegar and boil; apply on affected area.   \n   Prepare a mixture by adding two teaspoons each of apple cider vinegar and raw honey in a glass of water and drink at mealtime.   \n   Soak the foot in a mixture of � cup of apple cider vinegar and three cups of hot water.   \n   Get some natural, concentrated black cherry juice and drink several tablespoons of the concentrate daily.   \n   Blueberries are high in anti-inflammatory compounds called anthocyanins, which help to relieve the pain of gout.   \n   Buchu tea helps dissolve and flush out uric acid crystals.   \n   Soak a piece of white flannel in warm castor oil, wring it out and place over the affected area; cover with plastic wrap and apply a heating pad. Do this for one hour twice daily.   \n   Boil one tablespoon of pepper in 1 cup of vinegar and 1 cup of water and apply on the painful joint.   \n   Cook a tablespoon of celery seeds in two cups of water until they are soft; strain and drink 1/2 cup four times a day.   \n   Take �-1 teaspoon of activated charcoal daily. This is very effective home remedy for gout.   \n   Prepare a poultice using � cup of activated charcoal, 3 tablespoons of ground flaxseed and warm water to excrete toxins from the body.   \n   Eat several cloves of raw garlic daily.   \n   Put 1/3 cup of ground ginger in a bathtub of water and soak for 30 minutes. This will cause you to sweat, which will help eliminate the uric acid from your tissues.   \n   Grapes are high in alkalines, which lessen the acidity of uric acid and helps in its elimination from the body.   \n   Apply an ice pack for ten minutes, and then alternate with a moist hot-towel compress, to soothe and numb the pain.   \n   Soak mullein leaves in a hot vinegar/water mixture. Pack the leaves on the affected area.   \n   Prepare a poultice of spearmint leaves and wrap the affected area. This is also very effective home remedy for gout.   \n   Eating a cup of strawberries with each meal should bring quick relief. They neutralize uric acid.   \n   Prepare a tea by using equal parts of yarrow and stinging nettles; strain, cool and drink several cups a day.   \n   Eat an apple after every meal. This is very helpful in natural cure for gout.   \n   Take the juice of � a lime in 1 glass of water. Drink this morning, noon and night.   \n   Extract � a cup of juice of French beans (String beans). Drink this juice everyday for a month.   \n   Apply a frozen cabbage leaf to the area and cover with a dry towel. Leave in place until the leaf thaws out and repeat.   \n   Drinking lots of water will help kidneys flush out the excess uric acid.   \n   Meats having high protein content, such as fish (herrings, salmons and sardines), sweet bread, liver, kidney, milk extracts and meat soup should be avoided. \n  Gout Diet\n  Fast of Orange juice and water  For an acute attack, there is no better remedy than a fast of orange juice and water. In severe cases, it is advisable to undertake a series of short fasts for three days or so rather than one long fast.\n  All fruit diet  After the acute symptoms subside, the patient may adopt an all fruit diet for another three or four days.\n  Natural food diet  Thereafter, he may gradually embark upon a well-balanced diet of natural foods, with emphasis on fresh fruits, raw vegetables, and sprouts.\n  Avoid purine and acid producing foods  The patient should avoid all purine and uric acid-producing foods such as all meats, eggs, and fish; tea, coffee, sugar, white flour and its products; and all canned, processed, and fried foods.\n  Other Gout Treatment  Warm water enema  A warm-water enema should be used daily during the period of fasting to cleanse the bowels.\n  Epsom salt bath  Epsom salts foot baths are advised twice daily. About 250 gm - 500gm of these salts may be added to tolerably hot water for this purpose. Full Epsom salt baths should also be taken three times a week. The baths may be reduced to two per week later.\n  Cold packs, fresh air, exercise, reduced stress  Cold packs, applied to the affected joints at night, will be beneficial. Fresh air and outdoor exercise are also essential. The patient should eliminate as much stress from his life as possible\n  Regds.\n  K.V.Vighnesh\n  Chennai-India\n  mbl: 9444961820\n  yahoo id: kvvighnesh@... \n\n\n\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n Did you know?
