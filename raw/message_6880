Krishnaswamy Iyer\n&gt;\n&gt; A touring Educati=\r\nonal Officer once met His Holiness and said,\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;I have occasions of being=\r\n in constant touch with young boys, mostly\n&gt; Brahmanas, studying in schools=\r\n which I have to inspect. I have found that\n&gt; even the boys who perform the=\r\nir sandhya do so more as a form than as real\n&gt; worship. I shall be very gra=\r\nteful if Your Holiness would give me some\n&gt; valuable hints which I could co=\r\nnvey to them&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *I am very glad to see that you are not content=\r\n with mere\n&gt; official routine of inspection but desire to utilise the occas=\r\nion for the\n&gt; betterment of the boys. It will be well if all educationists,=\r\n inspecting\n&gt; officers or teachers, realise that they have been entrusted w=\r\nith the very\n&gt; grave responsibility of training up young men in the most im=\r\npressionable\n&gt; period of their lives. In my opinion they are really to blam=\r\ne if they\n&gt; confine their attention only to the prescribed text books and n=\r\neglect the\n&gt; spiritual side of the young generation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I always keep that=\r\n end before me and I don&#39;t miss any opportunity of\n&gt; talking to the boys an=\r\nd giving them some useful advice. It is mainly with a\n&gt; view to do that wor=\r\nk better that i request Your Holiness to give some\n&gt; practical suggestions.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Even if the boys to whom you propose to convey such suggest=\r\nions\n&gt; may not benefit by them, you will certainly be benefited.\n&gt;\n&gt; Certai=\r\nnly.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *You may therefore, for the present, ignore the boys and=\r\n ask\n&gt; such questions the answers to which are likely to be useful to you.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; The first question which suggests itself to me is with reference to the=\r\n\n&gt; sandhya worship. What is the deity or upasya devata in the sandhya Worsh=\r\nip?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Before we consider that, please tell me what you underst=\r\nand\n&gt; ordinarily by the sandhya worship?\n&gt;\n&gt; By sandhya worship we mean the=\r\n worship of the rising Sun, the setting Sun\n&gt; or Sun in the mid heavens.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so. Comprehensively speaking, you mean worship of the\n&gt; =\r\nSun?\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *You tell me that sandhya is the worship of the=\r\n Sun and yet you\n&gt; ask me what is worshipped in the sandhya. Don&#39;t you thin=\r\nk it is an\n&gt; unnecessary question?\n&gt;\n&gt;  Put so, it may seem an unnecessary =\r\nquestion, but my real question is,\n&gt; what is the Sun that is worshipped?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; *Acharya: *What do you understand ordinarily by the Sun?\n&gt;\n&gt; We mean the =\r\nbright celestial orb in the sky.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Then it is that bright cele=\r\nstial orb that is worshipped.\n&gt;\n&gt; But that orb is, according to science, me=\r\nre inert matter in a state of high\n&gt; combustion and is certainly not worthy=\r\n of being worshipped by intelligent\n&gt; beings like ourselves. It can neither=\r\n hear our prayers nor respond to them.\n&gt; I cannot believe that our ancestor=\r\ns were so ignorant as to address their\n&gt; prayers to a mere burning mass of =\r\nmatter\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *I quite agree with you. They could never have been so=\r\n foolish.\n&gt;\n&gt; What then did they see in the Sun to justify their prayers be=\r\ning addressed\n&gt; to it?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *You said just now that addressing of =\r\nprayers to inert matter\n&gt; cannot be justified by reason.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acha=\r\nrya: *What then must be the nature of the entity to which a prayer is\n&gt; add=\r\nressed?\n&gt;\n&gt; The primary condition is that it must not be mere inert matter,=\r\n but must be\n&gt; endowed with intelligence.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *And the second con=\r\ndition?\n&gt;\n&gt; That it must be able to hear our prayers and be powerful enough=\r\n to answer\n&gt; them.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so. If our ancients were not fools =\r\nand yet addressed\n&gt; their prayers to the Sun, their conception of the Sun m=\r\nust have been quite\n&gt; different from that of mere inert matter, in a state =\r\nof high combustion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, they must have also postulated of it intellige=\r\nnce, the capacity to\n&gt; hear us and the ability to help us.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *T=\r\nhe &#39;us&#39; including not only all those who are now living to\n&gt; raise their ha=\r\nnds in prayer to the Sun, but also the generations, past and\n&gt; future, infi=\r\nnite in number though they may be?\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *The entity=\r\n that is worshipped as the Sun is therefore one whose\n&gt; intelligence or abi=\r\nlity knows no limitation of space or time.\n&gt;\n&gt; It must be so.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya:=\r\n *You have now got your answer to the question as to who is\n&gt; worshipped in=\r\n the sandhya? It is an intelligent Being, omniscient and\n&gt; omnipotent in th=\r\ne matter of hearing and responding to its votaries.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your Holiness then =\r\nmeans that it is a deva who has his habitation in the\n&gt; solar orb?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Ach=\r\narya: *Quite so. He has not only his habitation there, but the solar\n&gt; orb =\r\nitself is his physical body.\n&gt;\n&gt; Your Holiness means that the deva enlivens=\r\n the solar orb, just as we do our\n&gt; physical bodies?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Just so=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; If then he is embodied just like us, how does he happen to have such =\r\nhigh\n&gt; intelligence or power as to merit our obeisance?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *He a=\r\nttained that status by virtue of the appropriate karma and\n&gt; upasana done b=\r\ny him in a previous life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does Your Holiness mean that he was at one ti=\r\nme just like ourselves and\n&gt; that he attained that status by his endeavour?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then he is no more than a jiva, which I aIso am. W=\r\nhy should a Jiva make\n&gt; prostration before another Jiva, howsoever superior=\r\n?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Why should your son or pupil respect you and why should yo=\r\nu\n&gt; show respect to your superior officers? Are not both of you jivas?\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nNo doubt we are. But we respect our superiors as it is in their power to\n&gt; =\r\nhelp us or injure us, if they so desire.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *That is a very low =\r\nkind of respect. Anyhow, taking even that\n&gt; kind of respect, we must respec=\r\nt Surya devata if it is in his power to help\n&gt; us or injure us, if he so de=\r\nsires.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Being a jiva as much as your superior =\r\nofficers, he will help\n&gt; you if you appeal to him for help or injure you if=\r\n you ignore or despise\n&gt; him. In your own interest then, you are bound to w=\r\norship him and secure his\n&gt; goodwill.\n&gt;\n&gt; But 1 need not court the favour n=\r\nor fear the displeasure of my superior\n&gt; officer, if I carry out the duties=\r\n of my office faithfully.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so.\n&gt;\n&gt; If I preserve that a=\r\nttitude, there is no reason why I should propitiate my\n&gt; superior officer\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; *Acharya: *Certainly not.\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, if l carry out strictly the dut=\r\nies enjoined on me by the\n&gt; sastras, I need not propitiate any other jiva, =\r\nbe he the highest devil.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, should I not gi=\r\nve up the worship of Surya devata?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Certainly you may, unless=\r\n of course such a worship is part of\n&gt; the duties enjoined on you by the Sa=\r\nstras.\n&gt;\n&gt; How can that be?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *It is true that an honest and st=\r\nrict officer in performing the\n&gt; duties of his office need not mind the ple=\r\nasure or the displeasure of his\n&gt; immediate superior. But the mere fact tha=\r\nt he thinks it necessary or\n&gt; obligatory to perform those duties properly, =\r\nshows that he has as the\n&gt; ultimate end the pleasure, or avoidance of the d=\r\nispleasure of a still higher\n&gt; officer who is superior to him as well as to=\r\n his immediate superior. Even if\n&gt; he has no personal acquaintance with tha=\r\nt higher officer, he always has in\n&gt; the background of his mind an undefine=\r\nd power, call it the King or the\n&gt; Government, when he performs the duties =\r\nof his office. And that power has\n&gt; the ability to benefit him by a recogni=\r\ntion of his services or to punish him\n&gt; by taking note of his delinquencies=\r\n. Further, that power rules both him and\n&gt; his immediate superior officer. =\r\nIf therefore that power requires him to\n&gt; behave in a particular manner tow=\r\nards his superior officer, he cannot afford\n&gt; to disobey that injunction, f=\r\nor if he disobeys, not only does he incur the\n&gt; displeasure of that officer=\r\n but also of the higher power.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is so.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Similarly, if=\r\n a power which rules both you as well as Surya\n&gt; devata requires you to con=\r\nduct yourself in a particular manner towards that\n&gt; deva, you cannot afford=\r\n to neglect that injunction, but must conform to it\n&gt; or take the risk of i=\r\nncurring the displeasure of that deva as also of the\n&gt; higher power.\n&gt;\n&gt; It=\r\n is no doubt so. But in that case, in prostrating myself before Surya\n&gt; dev=\r\nata, I shall be really worshipping the higher power even when my worship\n&gt; =\r\nmay seem addressed to the Surya.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *What of that?\n&gt;\n&gt; If I am a=\r\nble to conceive of such a higher power who rules even the Surya,\n&gt; that pow=\r\ner is really the worshipped entity although to all appearances the\n&gt; worshi=\r\np is addressed to the Surya only.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so.\n&gt;\n&gt; But Your Hol=\r\niness said that it, was Surya devata who was worshipped?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Yes=\r\n. It is correct so far as persons who are not able to\n&gt; conceive of a highe=\r\nr power are concerned. To those however who can conceive\n&gt; of that power, H=\r\ne is the real upasya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He\n&gt; enlivens and=\r\n ensouls not only the Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and\n&gt; inhabits not=\r\n only the solar orb but all things. He is the cosmic personality\n&gt; who is t=\r\nhe soul of all things.\n&gt;\n&gt; I suppose just as we have the sense of I &#39;in our=\r\n physical bodies, so does\n&gt; that cosmic personality has the sense of &quot;I&quot; in=\r\n the entire cosmos.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *He has.\n&gt;\n&gt; If so, the difference betwee=\r\nn Him and me lies not in the presence or the\n&gt; absence of the sense of &#39;I&#39; =\r\nbut only in the degree, the range or the\n&gt; magnitude of that sense. Mine is=\r\n restricted, His is extended.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *It is so.\n&gt;\n&gt; if it is the sen=\r\nse of &quot;I&quot; that is responsible for the concept of a Jiva, he\n&gt; must be as mu=\r\nch a jiva as myself\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so. In fact He is called the First=\r\n Born.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, even if this higher power happens to belong to the categor=\r\ny of Jivas,\n&gt; just like myself, the same objection which I mentioned agains=\r\nt the worship\n&gt; of Surya devata holds good in his case also.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: =\r\n*What then would you like to worship?\n&gt;\n&gt; A transcendent power which is not=\r\n a jiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Have it then that it is such a transcendent power t=\r\nhat is\n&gt; worshipped in the sandhya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lor=\r\nd, or the\n&gt; antaryami, the inner ruler.\n&gt;\n&gt; But I have heard it mentioned t=\r\nhat the terms Lord&#39; and Ruler&#39; are only\n&gt; relative terms which are used in =\r\nregard to Him when we want to describe Him\n&gt; in relation to the universe, w=\r\nhich is &#39;lorded over &#39;or &#39;ruled&#39; by Him.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Yes, it is so.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIt cannot be that we can have no conception of him apart from his\n&gt; relatio=\r\nnship of some sort to the universe. His relationship to the universe\n&gt; can =\r\nat best be only an extraneous circumstance. In His essence, He must have\n&gt; =\r\nan independent existence quite unrelated to anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Y=\r\nou are right. We call that unrelated essential existence\n&gt; Brahman.\n&gt;\n&gt; If =\r\nit is so, that must be the real object of worship rather than the\n&gt; relativ=\r\ne aspect called lshwara.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *It is even as you say. It is really=\r\n the unqualified Brahman\n&gt; that is worshipped in the sandhya.\n&gt;\n&gt; I cannot =\r\nreally understand Your Holiness. You first said that it was the\n&gt; solar orb=\r\n that was the objector worship, but when I pointed out that it was\n&gt; only i=\r\nnert matter, you said that it was Surya devata that was the object of\n&gt; wor=\r\nship; when again I pointed out that he was only a limited jiva like\n&gt; mysel=\r\nf, you said it was Hiranyagarbha, the cosmic soul, that was the object\n&gt; of=\r\n worship: when once again I pointed out that he was after all a jiva,\n&gt; how=\r\never cosmic his sense of &#39;I&#39; may be, you said that lswara the Lord and\n&gt; Ru=\r\nler of the universe was really the object of worship; and lastly when I\n&gt; s=\r\naid that even he is but a relative aspect of Brahman, you said that the\n&gt; o=\r\nbject of worship was Brahman itself\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *I did say so.\n&gt;\n&gt; But I =\r\nfail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Wher=\r\ne is the difficulty?\n&gt;\n&gt; The object in a particular worship can be only one=\r\n. How can it be the solar\n&gt; orb or the deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha =\r\nor Iswara or Brahman at the\n&gt; same time?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *I never said that i=\r\nt was the solar orb or the devil and so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Does Your Holiness mean to =\r\nsay then that the object of worship is the solar\n&gt; orb and the devil and Hi=\r\nranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Nor did=\r\n I say anything of that sort.\n&gt;\n&gt; How then am I to understand Your Holiness=\r\n&#39; statements?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *When did I tell you that the upasya was Surya?=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; When I mentioned that the physical mass of burning matter cannot be th=\r\ne\n&gt; object of worship.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Before you mentioned it, I said that =\r\nit was even that mass that\n&gt; was the upasya.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *I neve=\r\nr mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an\n&gt; alternative. To =\r\none who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is\n&gt; the physical=\r\n mass; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as\n&gt; an object =\r\nof worship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever\n&gt; one, b=\r\nut its exact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping\n&gt; aspiran=\r\nt. The upasya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil\n&gt; does =\r\nnot satisfy the enquiring devotee. We say then that it is\n&gt; Hiranyagarbha. =\r\nWhen even such a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we\n&gt; tell the devo=\r\ntee that he is really worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When\n&gt; he begins=\r\n to feel that even the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential\n&gt; nature,=\r\n we tell him that it is the infinite Brahman itself that is really\n&gt; worshi=\r\npped. Where is the difficulty?\n&gt;\n&gt; Does Your Holiness then mean that it is =\r\nnot possible to definitely say what\n&gt; the object of worship in the sandhya =\r\nis except with reference to the mental\n&gt; equipment or intellectual advancem=\r\nent of the worshipper?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *How can there be an object of worship=\r\n if we ignore the\n&gt; worshipper? The nature of the worshipped necessarily de=\r\npends upon the nature\n&gt; of the worshipper.\n&gt;\n&gt; How?\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Take me =\r\nfor example. All of you show me respect. But the object\n&gt; of respect, thoug=\r\nh it is, roughly speaking, myself, does differ with each\n&gt; one of you. Ordi=\r\nnary people respect me and like to see me surrounded by\n&gt; glittering paraph=\r\nernalia; their attention and respect are claimed by those\n&gt; articles rather=\r\n than by my personality. Such people will show the same\n&gt; respect to others=\r\n who have similar paraphernalia. Their homage is not\n&gt; therefore really pai=\r\nd to me but only to the paraphernalia. Some others\n&gt; respect me for the pos=\r\nition that I hold or for the Asrama in which I am.\n&gt; Such people will equal=\r\nly respect others who are or may come to be in such a\n&gt; position or in such=\r\n an Asrama, their homage is therefore not paid to me but\n&gt; to my position o=\r\nr to the Asrama. And some others may not care what position\n&gt; I hold or in =\r\nwhat Asrama I am, but give me homage wherever I go and however\n&gt; I may be; =\r\ntheir object of respect is my physical body. A few others will not\n&gt; mind i=\r\nf my body is dark or ugly or even diseased, but will nevertheless give\n&gt; me=\r\n homage if by purity of mind and character or by the power of my intellect\n=\r\n&gt; and learning or by any spiritual merit that I may possess I command their=\r\n\n&gt; respect. Very few indeed will respect me for the spark of divine\n&gt; intel=\r\nligence which inheres in me, as it does in all of you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course it is =\r\nnot possible to say that all the devotees that approach\n&gt; Your Holiness are=\r\n of the same mental equipment.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *Quite so. But, ordinarily all=\r\n these people, whether they really\n&gt; tender homage to the paraphernalia or =\r\nto my status and Asrama or to my body\n&gt; or to my mind or to my intellect or=\r\n to the divine spark in me, prostrate\n&gt; before me to show their respect. Ca=\r\nn you tell me, apart from any reference\n&gt; to the several devotees, to whom =\r\nor to what they prostrate?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is no doubt very difficult to answer\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n*Acharya: *Similarly, with every kind of worship. Externally viewed, there\n=\r\n&gt; will be no appreciable difference between the one who respects me for the=\r\n\n&gt; paraphernalia and another who respects me for the divine spark in me.\n&gt; =\r\nExternally viewed, there will similarly be no appreciable difference betwee=\r\nn\n&gt; the devotee who in his blind faith is content to address his prayers to=\r\n the\n&gt; luminous Sun and another who turns to it as a visible symbol of the =\r\ninfinite\n&gt; Brahman. The question as to what is the upasya in the sandhya wo=\r\nrship can\n&gt; therefore be answered only in this way.\n&gt;\n&gt; I now understand ho=\r\nw in the simple worship of the Sun all possible stages\n&gt; in spiritual perce=\r\nption have been provided for\n&gt;\n&gt; *Acharya: *It is not only this, for you wi=\r\nll find if you consider the\n&gt; matter still further, that all the three ways=\r\n known as karma, bhakti and\n&gt; Gyana have been given places in the daily wor=\r\nship, but that is a different\n&gt; matter. Simple as the sandhya worship seems=\r\n to be, it is sufficient to help\n&gt; us on to the highest stages. It is as us=\r\neful to the highest aspirant as it\n&gt; is to the beginner. It is a folly, the=\r\nrefore, to belittle its value or to\n&gt; neglect it in practice.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; O=\r\nn Sat, Jul 16, 2011 at 11:00 PM, Ananda Kishora Dadi &lt;\n&gt; varaha_2000@yahoo.=\r\ncom&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;      Who is the deity for Gayatri ma=\r\nntra, if we use it in Homa?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     How to use this great mantra in Homam=\r\n, if it is correct to use it in\n&gt;&gt; homam?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     Who is deity for all mi=\r\nghty SUN?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thank youu,\n&gt;&gt; Ananda\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--20cf303637e5c9d22104a84361ac\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Ajit ji,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Very nice article/conversation.

Krishnaswamy Iyer&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p=\r\n&gt;A touring Educational Officer once met His Holiness and said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;=\r\nI have occasions of being in constant touch with young boys, mostly Brahman=\r\nas, studying in schools which I have to inspect. I have found that even the=\r\n boys who perform their sandhya do so more as a form than as real worship. =\r\nI shall be very grateful if Your Holiness would give me some valuable hints=\r\n which I could convey to them&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;I am very glad to see that you are not content with mere official routine=\r\n of inspection but desire to utilise the occasion for the betterment of the=\r\n boys. It will be well if all educationists, inspecting officers or teacher=\r\ns, realise that they have been entrusted with the very grave responsibility=\r\n of training up young men in the most impressionable period of their lives.=\r\n In my opinion they are really to blame if they confine their attention onl=\r\ny to the prescribed text books and neglect the spiritual side of the young =\r\ngeneration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I always keep that end before me and I d=\r\non&#39;t miss any opportunity of talking to the boys and giving them some u=\r\nseful advice. It is mainly with a view to do that work better that i reques=\r\nt Your Holiness to give some practical suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=\r\n&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Even if the boys to whom you propose to convey such sugge=\r\nstions may not benefit by them, you will certainly be benefited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certainly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;You may therefor=\r\ne, for the present, ignore the boys and ask such questions the answers to w=\r\nhich are likely to be useful to you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first quest=\r\nion which suggests itself to me is with reference to the sandhya worship. W=\r\nhat is the deity or upasya devata in the sandhya Worship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Before we consider that, please tell me what you under=\r\nstand ordinarily by the sandhya worship?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By sandhya =\r\nworship we mean the worship of the rising Sun, the setting Sun or Sun in th=\r\ne mid heavens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. Comprehensiv=\r\nely speaking, you mean worship of the Sun?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;You tell me that sandhya is the worship o=\r\nf the Sun and yet you ask me what is worshipped in the sandhya. Don&#39;t y=\r\nou think it is an unnecessary question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put so, it m=\r\nay seem an unnecessary question, but my real question is, what is the Sun t=\r\nhat is worshipped?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;What do you unders=\r\ntand ordinarily by the Sun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We mean the bright celestial orb in the s=\r\nky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Then it is that bright celesti=\r\nal orb that is worshipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that orb is, according t=\r\no science, mere inert matter in a state of high combustion and is certainly=\r\n not worthy of being worshipped by intelligent beings like ourselves. It ca=\r\nn neither hear our prayers nor respond to them. I cannot believe that our a=\r\nncestors were so ignorant as to address their prayers to a mere burning mas=\r\ns of matter&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;I quite agree with you=\r\n. They could never have been so foolish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What then did =\r\nthey see in the Sun to justify their prayers being addressed to it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;You said just now that addressing of prayers=\r\n to inert matter cannot be justified by reason.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;What then must be the nature of the =\r\nentity to which a prayer is addressed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary cond=\r\nition is that it must not be mere inert matter, but must be endowed with in=\r\ntelligence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;And the second conditi=\r\non?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That it must be able to hear our prayers and be pow=\r\nerful enough to answer them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so=\r\n. If our ancients were not fools and yet addressed their prayers to the Sun=\r\n, their conception of the Sun must have been quite different from that of m=\r\nere inert matter, in a state of high combustion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes=\r\n, they must have also postulated of it intelligence, the capacity to hear u=\r\ns and the ability to help us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;The &#3=\r\n9;us&#39; including not only all those who are now living to raise their ha=\r\nnds in prayer to the Sun, but also the generations, past and future, infini=\r\nte in number though they may be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;The entity that is worshipped as the Sun is t=\r\nherefore one whose intelligence or ability knows no limitation of space or =\r\ntime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It must be so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=\r\n=A0&lt;/i&gt;You have now got your answer to the question as to who is worshipped=\r\n in the sandhya? It is an intelligent Being, omniscient and omnipotent in t=\r\nhe matter of hearing and responding to its votaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;Your Holiness then means that it is a deva who has his habitation in the s=\r\nolar orb?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. He has not only h=\r\nis habitation there, but the solar orb itself is his physical body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Holiness means that the deva enlivens the solar orb, j=\r\nust as we do our physical bodies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Jus=\r\nt so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If then he is embodied just like us, how does he =\r\nhappen to have such high intelligence or power as to merit our obeisance?&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;He attained that status by virtue o=\r\nf the appropriate karma and upasana done by him in a previous life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Your Holiness mean that he was at one time just like ours=\r\nelves and that he attained that status by his endeavour?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he is no more than a j=\r\niva, which I aIso am. Why should a Jiva make prostration before another Jiv=\r\na, howsoever superior?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Why should you=\r\nr son or pupil respect you and why should you show respect to your superior=\r\n officers? Are not both of you jivas?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No doubt we ar=\r\ne. But we respect our superiors as it is in their power to help us or injur=\r\ne us, if they so desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;That is a ve=\r\nry low kind of respect. Anyhow, taking even that kind of respect, we must r=\r\nespect Surya devata if it is in his power to help us or injure us, if he so=\r\n desires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=\r\n=A0&lt;/i&gt;Being a jiva as much as your superior officers, he will help you if =\r\nyou appeal to him for help or injure you if you ignore or despise him. In y=\r\nour own interest then, you are bound to worship him and secure his goodwill=\r\n.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But 1 need not court the favour nor fear the displ=\r\neasure of my superior officer, if I carry out the duties of my office faith=\r\nfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=\r\nIf I preserve that attitude, there is no reason why I should propitiate my =\r\nsuperior officer&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Certainly not.&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if l carry out strictly the duties enjoined on=\r\n me by the sastras, I need not propitiate any other jiva, be he the highest=\r\n devil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, should I not give up the worship of Surya devata?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Certainly you may, unless of course such a worship i=\r\ns part of the duties enjoined on you by the Sastras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;How can that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is true that an =\r\nhonest and strict officer in performing the duties of his office need not m=\r\nind the pleasure or the displeasure of his immediate superior. But the mere=\r\n fact that he thinks it necessary or obligatory to perform those duties pro=\r\nperly, shows that he has as the ultimate end the pleasure, or avoidance of =\r\nthe displeasure of a still higher officer who is superior to him as well as=\r\n to his immediate superior. Even if he has no personal acquaintance with th=\r\nat higher officer, he always has in the background of his mind an undefined=\r\n power, call it the King or the Government, when he performs the duties of =\r\nhis office. And that power has the ability to benefit him by a recognition =\r\nof his services or to punish him by taking note of his delinquencies. Furth=\r\ner, that power rules both him and his immediate superior officer. If theref=\r\nore that power requires him to behave in a particular manner towards his su=\r\nperior officer, he cannot afford to disobey that injunction, for if he diso=\r\nbeys, not only does he incur the displeasure of that officer but also of th=\r\ne higher power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A=\r\ncharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Similarly, if a power which rules both you as well as Surya d=\r\nevata requires you to conduct yourself in a particular manner towards that =\r\ndeva, you cannot afford to neglect that injunction, but must conform to it =\r\nor take the risk of incurring the displeasure of that deva as also of the h=\r\nigher power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no doubt so. But in that case, in=\r\n prostrating myself before Surya devata, I shall be really worshipping the =\r\nhigher power even when my worship may seem addressed to the Surya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;What of that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I am =\r\nable to conceive of such a higher power who rules even the Surya, that powe=\r\nr is really the worshipped entity although to all appearances the worship i=\r\ns addressed to the Surya only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Qui=\r\nte so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Your Holiness said that it, was Surya devata=\r\n who was worshipped?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Yes. It is corre=\r\nct so far as persons who are not able to conceive of a higher power are con=\r\ncerned. To those however who can conceive of that power, He is the real upa=\r\nsya. That power is called Hiranyagarbha. He enlivens and ensouls not only t=\r\nhe Surya, but all devils. He enlivens and inhabits not only the solar orb b=\r\nut all things. He is the cosmic personality who is the soul of all things.&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suppose just as we have the sense of I &#39;in our=\r\n physical bodies, so does that cosmic personality has the sense of &quot;I&=\r\nquot; in the entire cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;He has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n\nIf so, the difference between Him and me lies not in the presence o=\r\nr the absence of the sense of &#39;I&#39; but only in the degree, the range=\r\n or the magnitude of that sense. Mine is restricted, His is extended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if it is =\r\nthe sense of &quot;I&quot; that is responsible for the concept of a Jiva, h=\r\ne must be as much a jiva as myself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Qu=\r\nite so. In fact He is called the First Born.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, e=\r\nven if this higher power happens to belong to the category of Jivas, just l=\r\nike myself, the same objection which I mentioned against the worship of Sur=\r\nya devata holds good in his case also.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=\r\n=A0&lt;/i&gt;What then would you like to worship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A transcend=\r\nent power which is not a jiva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Have i=\r\nt then that it is such a transcendent power that is worshipped in the sandh=\r\nya. We give Him the name of lswara, the Lord, or the antaryami, the inner r=\r\nuler.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I have heard it mentioned that the terms L=\r\nord&#39; and Ruler&#39; are only relative terms which are used in regard to=\r\n Him when we want to describe Him in relation to the universe, which is &#3=\r\n9;lorded over &#39;or &#39;ruled&#39; by Him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ach=\r\narya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Yes, it is so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It cannot be that we can hav=\r\ne no conception of him apart from his relationship of some sort to the univ=\r\nerse. His relationship to the universe can at best be only an extraneous ci=\r\nrcumstance. In His essence, He must have an independent existence quite unr=\r\nelated to anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;You are r=\r\night. We call that unrelated essential existence Brahman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;If it is so, that must be the real object of worship rather than the rel=\r\native aspect called lshwara.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is=\r\n even as you say. It is really the unqualified Brahman that is worshipped i=\r\nn the sandhya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot really understand Your Holiness=\r\n. You first said that it was the solar orb that was the objector worship, b=\r\nut when I pointed out that it was only inert matter, you said that it was S=\r\nurya devata that was the object of worship; when again I pointed out that h=\r\ne was only a limited jiva like myself, you said it was Hiranyagarbha, the c=\r\nosmic soul, that was the object of worship: when once again I pointed out t=\r\nhat he was after all a jiva, however cosmic his sense of &#39;I&#39; may be=\r\n, you said that lswara the Lord and Ruler of the universe was really the ob=\r\nject of worship; and lastly when I said that even he is but a relative aspe=\r\nct of Brahman, you said that the object of worship was Brahman itself&lt;/p&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;I did say so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I=\r\n fail to see how all these statements can be reconciled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Where is the difficulty?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The object=\r\n in a particular worship can be only one. How can it be the solar orb or th=\r\ne deva enlivening it or Hiranyagarbha or Iswara or Brahman at the same time=\r\n?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;I never said that it was the sol=\r\nar orb or the devil and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Your Holiness mean =\r\nto say then that the object of worship is the solar orb and the devil and H=\r\niranyagarbha and Iswara and Brahman all put together?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Nor did I say anything of that sort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;How then am I to understand Your Holiness&#39; statements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;When did I tell you that the upasya was Surya?&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I mentioned that the physical mass of burning matte=\r\nr cannot be the object of worship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Be=\r\nfore you mentioned it, I said that it was even that mass that was the upasy=\r\na.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;I neve=\r\nr mentioned that it was the solar body or the deva as an alternative. To on=\r\ne who cannot conceive of an enlivening soul, the upasya is the physical mas=\r\ns; to one, however, who declines to accept inert matter as an object of wor=\r\nship, I said the upasya was Surya devata. The upasya is ever one, but its e=\r\nxact nature varies with the competence of the worshipping aspirant. The upa=\r\nsya gets further refined when even the concept of a devil does not satisfy =\r\nthe enquiring devotee. We say then that it is Hiranyagarbha. When even such=\r\n a concept seems meagre or unsatisfactory, we tell the devotee that he is r=\r\neally worshipping the Supreme Lord himself When he begins to feel that even=\r\n the Lord-ness is a limitation of His essential nature, we tell him that it=\r\n is the infinite Brahman itself that is really worshipped. Where is the dif=\r\nficulty?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Your Holiness then mean that it is not=\r\n possible to definitely say what the object of worship in the sandhya is ex=\r\ncept with reference to the mental equipment or intellectual advancement of =\r\nthe worshipper?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;How can there be a=\r\nn object of worship if we ignore the worshipper? The nature of the worshipp=\r\ned necessarily depends upon the nature of the worshipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n&lt;p&gt;How?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Take me for example. All o=\r\nf you show me respect. But the object of respect, though it is, roughly spe=\r\naking, myself, does differ with each one of you. Ordinary people respect me=\r\n and like to see me surrounded by glittering paraphernalia; their attention=\r\n and respect are claimed by those articles rather than by my personality. S=\r\nuch people will show the same respect to others who have similar parapherna=\r\nlia. Their homage is not therefore really paid to me but only to the paraph=\r\nernalia. Some others respect me for the position that I hold or for the Asr=\r\nama in which I am. Such people will equally respect others who are or may c=\r\nome to be in such a position or in such an Asrama, their homage is therefor=\r\ne not paid to me but to my position or to the Asrama. And some others may n=\r\not care what position I hold or in what Asrama I am, but give me homage whe=\r\nrever I go and however I may be; their object of respect is my physical bod=\r\ny. A few others will not mind if my body is dark or ugly or even diseased, =\r\nbut will nevertheless give me homage if by purity of mind and character or =\r\nby the power of my intellect and learning or by any spiritual merit that I =\r\nmay possess I command their respect. Very few indeed will respect me for th=\r\ne spark of divine intelligence which inheres in me, as it does in all of yo=\r\nu.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course it is not possible to say that all the =\r\ndevotees that approach Your Holiness are of the same mental equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Quite so. But, ordinarily all these peopl=\r\ne, whether they really tender homage to the paraphernalia or to my status a=\r\nnd Asrama or to my body or to my mind or to my intellect or to the divine s=\r\npark in me, prostrate before me to show their respect. Can you tell me, apa=\r\nrt from any reference to the several devotees, to whom or to what they pros=\r\ntrate?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no doubt very difficult to answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;Similarly, with every kind of worship. Ext=\r\nernally viewed, there will be no appreciable difference between the one who=\r\n respects me for the paraphernalia and another who respects me for the divi=\r\nne spark in me. Externally viewed, there will similarly be no appreciable d=\r\nifference between the devotee who in his blind faith is content to address =\r\nhis prayers to the luminous Sun and another who turns to it as a visible sy=\r\nmbol of the infinite Brahman. The question as to what is the upasya in the =\r\nsandhya worship can therefore be answered only in this way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now understand how in the simple worship of the Sun all possible =\r\nstages in spiritual perception have been provided for&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\ni&gt;Acharya:=A0&lt;/i&gt;It is not only this, for you will find if you consider the=\r\n matter still further, that all the three ways known as karma, bhakti and G=\r\nyana have been given places in the daily worship, but that is a different m=\r\natter. Simple as the sandhya worship seems to be, it is sufficient to help =\r\nus on to the highest stages. It is as useful to the highest aspirant as it =\r\nis to the beginner. It is a folly, therefore, to belittle its value or to n=\r\neglect it in practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat,=\r\n Jul 16, 2011 at 11:00 PM, Ananda Kishora Dadi &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;mailto:varaha_2000@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;varaha_2000@...&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-=\r\nleft: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204);&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Who is=\r\n the deity for Gayatri mantra, if we use it in=A0Homa?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0=A0=A0 How to use this great mantra in Homam, if it is=A0correct t=\r\no use it in homam?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0=A0=A0 Who is deity for all=\r\n mighty SUN?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank youu,=A0&lt;/div&gt;Ananda \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255); min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--20cf303637e5c9d22104a84361ac--\r\n\n"}}
