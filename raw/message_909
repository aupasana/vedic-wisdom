Good luck for future.\n\n(1) Yes.\n\n(2) Yes. If you say atharva seersham 8 times, you are putting 8x10 aahutis. \nFirst 79 aahutis are with swaaha and the final aahuti in the 8th time \nchanting (80th aahuti) is with vaushat.\n\n(3) Yes, flower petals and fruits or fruit slices can be offered. But make \nsure that your fire is big enough to burn them. I am not sure the what they \nsignify.\n\n(4) Yes, you can. You can give give different items as aahuti in each \nswaahaa.\n\n(5) Vishnu sahasra naamam (1000 names of Vishnu) is a very powerful prayer. \nIt was revealed to the world bu Dharmaraja and Bhishma just before Kali yuga \ncame, because it was to play an important role in Kali yuga. My guru asked \nme to spread Vishnu sahasra naama homam. That will come soon. I will give \none for Shiva also.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;ray.siya1&quot; &lt;ray.siya1@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 11, 2009 5:36 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] (unknown)\n\n\n&gt; Hi Narsimha Ji\n&gt;\n&gt; I have just tried mahaganpati homam and krishna homam and could feel\n&gt; the differance ! Its quick !\n&gt; I have some questions though:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) I see that mahaganpati homam has tarpanam (offering water towards\n&gt; the end of homa) but in krishna and laxmi homam manual I could not\n&gt; find that. Is it supposed to be like this ?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Is vaushat is necessary only if we are switching mantra ? If we\n&gt; chant ganapati atharva shirsha 8 times at last of all the ganesh\n&gt; mantra, so at the 8rth time do we have to say vaushat instead of\n&gt; swaha at the end of every verse ?\n&gt;\n&gt; 3) I do homa with ghee mainly. Can we offer flower petal (single\n&gt; petal) when we say svaha. what does offering of flower signify like\n&gt; u said murmura for finance amd white sesame for spirituality. Can we\n&gt; offer fruits also as offering in main mantra ?\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) if i say a particular mantra 10 times can i do 2-2 offering like\n&gt; 2 with ghee, 2 with flower etc ?\n&gt;\n&gt; 4) I use small homa kund, only 4.5 &quot; to 4.5 &quot;. Is it fine ?\n&gt;\n&gt; 5) Please post homam for Vishnu and Shiva also.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks very much for these homam procedures.\n&gt; Reagards.\n\n\n"}}
