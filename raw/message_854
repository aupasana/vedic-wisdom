For instance in one=\r\n \nrendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes \ntwo s=\r\nyllables instead of one. simarly, in the same \nrendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is st=\r\nretched to 3 syllables instead of 2.\n\nso i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; re=\r\nndition.\n\ni recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had posted his rendit=\r\nion \nof the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not been able to find \n=\r\nit again. but i wish he or someone could guide me about this.\n\ni would also=\r\n like to know the importance of the number of syllables \nin each mantra and=\r\n how this is suitable for different persons \ndepending on their &quot;karmic str=\r\nuctures&quot; which are sometimes / always \n(?) reflected in the astrological ch=\r\nart. maybe a guru by just \nlooking at a person can know intuitively what is=\r\n the &quot;right&quot; mantra \nfor the person. maybe a good astrologer can also do th=\r\ne same. \n\ni know this is not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking \ngu=\r\nidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro \nsaturn in =\r\n6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. These \nplanets aspect all the=\r\n other planets (jupiter, sun and mercury in \n2nd house and venus moon in th=\r\nird house).\n\nthankyou!\n\nlove and best wishes,&#39;\nvinita\n\n\n\n\n"}}
