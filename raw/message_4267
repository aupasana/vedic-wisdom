Oak (Historian)\n&gt; \n&gt; Glancing through some=\r\n research material recently, I was pleasantly surprised\n&gt; to come across a =\r\nreference to a *king Vikramaditya* inscription found in the\n&gt; Kaaba in Mecc=\r\na proving beyond doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed a part\n&gt; of his In=\r\ndian Empire.\n&gt; \n&gt; The text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscription, found i=\r\nnscribed on a gold\n&gt; dish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca, is found r=\r\necorded on page 315 of\n&gt; a volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 =\r\ntreasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania\n&gt; library in Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered=\r\n in free English the inscription says:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Fortunate are those who were b=\r\norn (and lived) during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign.\n&gt; He was a noble, gener=\r\nous dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his\n&gt; subjects. But at that ti=\r\nme we Arabs, oblivious of God, were lost in sensual\n&gt; pleasures. Plotting a=\r\nnd torture were rampant. The darkness of ignorance had\n&gt; enveloped our coun=\r\ntry. Like the lamb struggling for her life in the cruel\n&gt; paws of a wolf we=\r\n Arabs were caught up in ignorance. The entire country was\n&gt; enveloped in a=\r\n darkness so intense as on a new moon night. But the present\n&gt; dawn and ple=\r\nasant sunshine of education is the result of the favour of the\n&gt; noble king=\r\n Vikramaditya whose benevolent supervision did not lose sight of\n&gt; us- fore=\r\nigners as we were. He spread his sacred religion amongst us and sent\n&gt; scho=\r\nlars whose brilliance shone like that of the sun from his country to\n&gt; ours=\r\n. These scholars and preceptors through whose benevolence we were once\n&gt; ag=\r\nain made cognisant of the presence of God, introduced to His sacred\n&gt; exist=\r\nence and put on the road of Truth, had come to our country to preach\n&gt; thei=\r\nr religion and impart education at king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s behest.&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; For those who would like to read the Arabic wording I reproduce it hereun=\r\nder\n&gt; in Roman script:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Itrashaphai Santu Ibikramatul Phahalameen Kari=\r\nmun Yartapheeha Wayosassaru\n&gt; Bihillahaya Samaini Ela Motakabberen Sihillah=\r\na Yuhee Quid min howa Yapakhara\n&gt; phajjal asari nahone osirom bayjayhalem. =\r\nYundan blabin Kajan blnaya\n&gt; khtoryaha sadunya kanateph netephi bejehalin A=\r\ntadari bilamasa- rateen phakef\n&gt; tasabuhu kaunnieja majekaralhada walador. =\r\nAs hmiman burukankad toluho\n&gt; watastaru hihila Yakajibaymana balay kulk ama=\r\nrena phaneya jaunabilamary\n&gt; Bikramatum&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Page 315 Sayar-ul-okul).\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; [Note: The title =E2=80=98Saya-ul-okul=E2=80=99 signifies memorable word=\r\ns.]\n&gt; \n&gt; A careful analysis of the above inscription enables us to draw the=\r\n following\n&gt; conclusions:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.      That the ancient Indian empires may =\r\nhave extended up to the eastern\n&gt; boundaries of Arabia until Vikramaditya a=\r\nnd that it was he who for the first\n&gt; time conquered Arabia. Because the in=\r\nscription says that king Vikram who\n&gt; dispelled the darkness of ignorance f=\r\nrom Arabia.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.      That, whatever their earlier faith, King Vikrama=\r\n=E2=80=99s preachers had\n&gt; succeeded in spreading the Vedic (based on the V=\r\nedas, the Hindu sacred\n&gt; scriptures)) way of life in Arabia.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.      T=\r\nhat the knowledge of Indian arts and sciences was imparted by\n&gt; Indians to =\r\nthe Arabs directly by founding schools, academies and cultural\n&gt; centres. T=\r\nhe belief, therefore, that visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge\n&gt; to thei=\r\nr own lands through their own indefatigable efforts and scholarship\n&gt; is un=\r\nfounded.\n&gt; \n&gt; An ancillary conclusion could be that the so-called Kutub Min=\r\nar (in Delhi,\n&gt; India) could well be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower comme=\r\nmorating his conquest of\n&gt; Arabia. This conclusion is strengthened by two p=\r\nointers. Firstly, the\n&gt; inscription on the iron pillar near the so-called K=\r\nutub Minar refers to the\n&gt; marriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to =\r\nthe princess of Balhika.\n&gt; This Balhika is none other than the Balkh region=\r\n in West Asia. It could be\n&gt; that Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya =\r\nfrom the ruler of Balkh who\n&gt; concluded a treaty by giving his daughter in =\r\nmarriage to the victor.\n&gt; Secondly, the township adjoining the so called Ku=\r\ntub Minar is named Mehrauli\n&gt; after Mihira who was the renowned astronomer-=\r\nmathematician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s\n&gt; court. Mehrauli is the corrupt for=\r\nm of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 signifying a\n&gt; row of houses r=\r\naised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants working on\n&gt; astronomical o=\r\nbservations made from the tower.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having seen the far reaching and hist=\r\nory shaking implications of the Arabic\n&gt; inscription concerning king Vikram=\r\na, we shall now piece together the story\n&gt; of its find. How it came to be r=\r\necorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What\n&gt; are the other proofs reinfor=\r\ncing the belief that Arabs were once followers\n&gt; of the Indian Vedic way of=\r\n life and that tranquillity and education were\n&gt; ushered into Arabia by kin=\r\ng Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an\n&gt; uneasy period of=\r\n &quot;ignorance and turmoil&quot; mentioned in the inscription.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Istanbul, Tu=\r\nrkey, there is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania,\n&gt; which is repu=\r\nted to have the largest collection of ancient West Asian\n&gt; literature. In t=\r\nhe Arabic section of that library is an anthology of ancient\n&gt; Arabic poetr=\r\ny. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742\n&gt; under th=\r\ne orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pages of that volume a=\r\nre of Hareer =E2=80&quot; a kind of silk used for writing on.\n&gt; Each page has a =\r\ndecorative gilded border. That anthology is known as\n&gt; Sayar-ul-Okul. It is=\r\n divided into three parts. The first part contains\n&gt; biographic details and=\r\n the poetic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets.\n&gt; The second part em=\r\nbodies accounts and verses of poets of the period\n&gt; beginning just after pr=\r\nophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the\n&gt; Banee-Um-Mayya dynas=\r\nty. The third part deals with later poets up to the end\n&gt; of Khalif Harun-a=\r\nl-Rashid=E2=80=99s times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Abu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the=\r\n poet Laureate of\n&gt; Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edite=\r\nd the anthology.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=\r\n=80=99 was printed and published in\n&gt; Berlin in 1864. A subsequent edition =\r\nis the one published in Beirut in 1932.\n&gt; \n&gt; The collection is regarded as =\r\nthe most important and authoritative anthology\n&gt; of ancient Arabic poetry. =\r\nIt throws considerable light on the social life,\n&gt; customs, manners and ent=\r\nertainment modes of ancient Arabia. The book also\n&gt; contains an elaborate d=\r\nescription of the ancient shrine of Mecca, the town\n&gt; and the annual fair k=\r\nnown as OKAJ which used to be held every year around\n&gt; the Kaaba temple in =\r\nMecca. This should convince readers that the annual haj\n&gt; of the Muslims to=\r\n the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic congregation.\n&gt; \n&gt; But the OKAJ fair w=\r\nas far from a carnival. It provided a forum for the elite\n&gt; and the learned=\r\n to discuss the social, religious, political, literary and\n&gt; other aspects =\r\nof the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99=\r\n\n&gt; asserts that the conclusion reached at those discussions were widely\n&gt; r=\r\nespected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, followed the Varanasi\n&gt; tradi=\r\ntion (of India) of providing a venue for important discussions among\n&gt; the =\r\nlearned while the masses congregated there for spiritual bliss. The\n&gt; princ=\r\nipal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Arvasthan\n&gt; (Arabia)=\r\n were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva) emblems\n&gt; can b=\r\ne seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgrims reverently\n&gt; t=\r\nouch and kiss in the Kaaba.\n&gt; \n&gt; Arabic tradition has lost trace of the fou=\r\nnding of the Kaaba temple. The\n&gt; discovery of the Vikramaditya inscription =\r\naffords a clue. King Vikramaditya\n&gt; is known for his great devotion to Lord=\r\n Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India),\n&gt; the capital of Vikramaditya, exists t=\r\nhe famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of\n&gt; Lord Shankara (Siva) associated wi=\r\nth Vikramaditya. Since according to the\n&gt; Vikramaditya inscription he sprea=\r\nd the Vedic religion, who else but he could\n&gt; have founded the Kaaba temple=\r\n in Mecca?\n&gt; \n&gt; A few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars t=\r\nhe entry of any\n&gt; non-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days =\r\nwhen the Kaaba was\n&gt; stormed and captured solely for the newly established =\r\nfaith of Islam. The\n&gt; object in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously =\r\nto prevent its\n&gt; recapture.\n&gt; \n&gt; As the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he i=\r\ns asked to shave his head and\n&gt; beard and to don special sacred attire that=\r\n consists of two seamless sheets\n&gt; of white cloth. One is to be worn round =\r\nthe waist and the other over the\n&gt; shoulders. Both these rites are remnants=\r\n of the old Vedic practice of\n&gt; entering Hindu temples clean- and with holy=\r\n seamless white sheets.\n&gt; \n&gt; The main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siv=\r\na emblem, is known as the\n&gt; Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. That cu=\r\nstom also originates from the\n&gt; days when it was thought necessary to disco=\r\nurage its recapture by\n&gt; camouflaging it.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to the Encyclopaed=\r\nia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 images.\n&gt; Traditional accounts mention tha=\r\nt one of the deities among the 360 destroyed\n&gt; when the place was stormed, =\r\nwas that of Saturn; another was of the Moon and\n&gt; yet another was one calle=\r\nd Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the Arabs\n&gt; worshipped the nine plane=\r\nts in pre-Islamic days. In India the practice of\n&gt; =E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=\r\n=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is still in vogue.\n&gt; Two of =\r\nthese nine are Saturn and Moon.\n&gt; \n&gt; In India the crescent moon is always p=\r\nainted across the forehead of the Siva\n&gt; symbol. Since that symbol was asso=\r\nciated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it\n&gt; came to be grafted on the flag of=\r\n Islam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another Hindu tradition associated with the Kaaba is that of t=\r\nhe sacred\n&gt; stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). According to =\r\nthe Hindu\n&gt; tradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva emblem as th=\r\ne crescent\n&gt; moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-exist. Tr=\r\nue to that\n&gt; association a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its water is=\r\n held sacred\n&gt; because it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga since pr=\r\ne-Islamic times\n&gt; (Zam-Zam water).\n&gt; \n&gt; [Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims =\r\nwho go to the Kaaba for Haj regard this\n&gt; Zam-Zam water with reverence and =\r\ntake some bottled water with them as sacred\n&gt; water.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Muslim pilgrims =\r\nvisiting the Kaaba temple go around it seven times. In no\n&gt; other mosque do=\r\nes the circumambulation prevail. Hindus invariably\n&gt; circumambulate around =\r\ntheir deities. This is yet another proof that the\n&gt; Kaaba shrine is a pre-I=\r\nslamic Indian Shiva temple where the Hindu practice\n&gt; of circumambulation i=\r\ns still meticulously observed.\n&gt; \n&gt; The practice of taking seven steps- kno=\r\nwn as Saptapadi in Sanskrit- is\n&gt; associated with Hindu marriage ceremony a=\r\nnd fire worship. The culminating\n&gt; rite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon th=\r\ne bride and groom to go round the\n&gt; sacred fire four times (but misundersto=\r\nod by many as seven times). Since\n&gt; &quot;Makha&quot; means fire, the seven circumamb=\r\nulations also prove that Mecca was\n&gt; the seat of Indian fire-worship in the=\r\n West Asia.\n&gt; \n&gt; It might come as a stunning revelation to many that the wo=\r\nrd =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself\n&gt; is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit language Allah=\r\n, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They\n&gt; signify a goddess or mother. The term =\r\n=E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskrit chants\n&gt; invoking goddess Du=\r\nrga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahishasurmardini.\n&gt; The Islamic wor=\r\nd for God is., therefore, not an innovation but the ancient\n&gt; Sanskrit appe=\r\nllation retained and continued by Islam. Allah means mother or\n&gt; goddess an=\r\nd mother goddess.\n&gt; \n&gt; One Koranic verse is an exact translation of a stanz=\r\na in the Yajurveda. This\n&gt; was pointed out by the great research scholar Pa=\r\nndit Satavlekar of Pardi in\n&gt; one of his articles.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Note: Another scho=\r\nlar points out that the following teaching from the Koran\n&gt; is exactly simi=\r\nlar to the teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7).\n&gt; \n&gt; The Koran:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sigh=\r\nt perceives Him not. But He perceives men&#39;s sights; for He is the\n&gt; knower =\r\nof secrets, the Aware.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Kena Upanishad:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;That which cannot be see=\r\nn by the eye but through which the eye itself sees,\n&gt; know That to be Brahm=\r\nan (God) and not what people worship here (in the\n&gt; manifested world).&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; A simplified meaning of both the above verses reads:\n&gt; \n&gt; God is one and =\r\nthat He is beyond man&#39;s sensory experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; The identity of Unani and =\r\nAyurvedic systems shows that Unani is just the\n&gt; Arabic term for the Ayurve=\r\ndic system of healing taught to them and\n&gt; administered in Arabia when Arab=\r\nia formed part of the Indian empire.\n&gt; \n&gt; It will now be easy to comprehend=\r\n the various Hindu customs still prevailing\n&gt; in West Asian countries even =\r\nafter the existence of Islam during the last\n&gt; 1300 years. Let us review so=\r\nme Hindu traditions which exist as the core of\n&gt; Islamic practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Minor too worshipped\n&gt; 3=\r\n3 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar was introduced in\n&gt; W=\r\nest Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=98Safar=E2=80=99 s=\r\nignifying the\n&gt; =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas) in the Hindu cal=\r\nendar. The Muslim month Rabi is\n&gt; the corrupt form of Ravi meaning the sun =\r\nbecause Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into\n&gt; Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=\r\n=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language). The\n&gt; Musl=\r\nim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi (Gyrah\n&gt; =\r\n=3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Islamic pra=\r\nctice of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh\n&gt; Yagnas or sac=\r\nrifices of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The\n&gt; Islamic word E=\r\ned for festive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore\n&gt; a pure Sans=\r\nkrit word. The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb.\n&gt; Since in a=\r\nncient times the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in\n&gt; Aries, t=\r\nhe occasion was celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin\n&gt; of th=\r\ne Bakari Eed festival.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language wo=\r\nrd for a goat.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Since Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=\r\n=E2=80=99, the Islamic word Idgah\n&gt; signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=\r\n=E2=80=99 which is the exact Sanskrit connotation of\n&gt; the term. Similarly =\r\nthe word =E2=80=98Namaz=E2=80=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98N=\r\nama=E2=80=99\n&gt; and =E2=80=98Yajna=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and =\r\nworshipping.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vedic descriptions about the moon, the different stellar =\r\nconstellations and\n&gt; the creation of the universe have been incorporated fr=\r\nom the Vedas in Koran\n&gt; part 1 chapter 2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 18=\r\n9, chapter 9, stanza 37\n&gt; and chapter 10, stanzas 4 to 7.\n&gt; \n&gt; Recital of t=\r\nhe Namaz five times a day owes its origin to the Vedic\n&gt; injunction of Panc=\r\nhmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-Yagna) which is\n&gt; part of the da=\r\nily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; Muslims are enjoined =\r\ncleanliness of five parts of the body before commencing\n&gt; prayers. This der=\r\nives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydhyartham\n&gt; Panchanga Nya=\r\nsah=E2=80=99.\n&gt; \n&gt; Four months of the year are regarded as very sacred in I=\r\nslamic custom. The\n&gt; devout are enjoined to abstain from plunder and other =\r\nevil deeds during that\n&gt; period. This originates in the Chaturmasa i.e., th=\r\ne four-month period of\n&gt; special vows and austerities in Hindu tradition. S=\r\nhabibarat is the corrupt\n&gt; form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Since the Ka=\r\naba has been an important\n&gt; centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times immem=\r\norial, the Shivaratri\n&gt; festival used to be celebrated there with great gus=\r\nto. It is that festival\n&gt; which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibarat=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Encyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of th=\r\ne Kaaba\n&gt; walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, accordin=\r\ng to the\n&gt; correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But acc=\r\nording to\n&gt; hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, an=\r\nd some of\n&gt; them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; \n&gt; According to exta=\r\nnt Islamic records, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia,\n&gt; particularly =\r\nin Yemen, and their life and manners deeply influenced those\n&gt; who came in =\r\ntouch with them. At Ubla there was a large number of Indian\n&gt; settlements. =\r\nThis shows that Indians were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient\n&gt; strength a=\r\nnd commanding position to be able to influence the local people.\n&gt; This cou=\r\nld not be possible unless they belonged to the ruling class.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is men=\r\ntioned in the Abadis i.e., the authentic traditions of Prophet\n&gt; Mohammad c=\r\nompiled by Imam Bukhari that the Indian tribe of Jats had settled\n&gt; in Arab=\r\nia before Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife o=\r\nf\n&gt; the Prophet, was taken ill, her nephew sent for a Jat physician for her=\r\n\n&gt; treatment. This proves that Indians enjoyed a high and esteemed status i=\r\nn\n&gt; Arabia. Such a status could not be theirs unless they were the rulers.\n=\r\n&gt; Bukhari also tells us that an Indian Raja (king) sent a jar of ginger\n&gt; p=\r\nickles to the Prophet. This shows that the Indian Jat Raja ruled an\n&gt; adjac=\r\nent area so as to be in a position to send such an insignificant\n&gt; present =\r\nas ginger pickles. The Prophet is said to have so highly relished it\n&gt; as t=\r\no have told his colleagues also to partake of it. These references show\n&gt; t=\r\nhat even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s times Indians retained their inf=\r\nluential\n&gt; role in Arabia, which was a dwindling legacy from Vikramaditya=\r\n=E2=80=99s times.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Islamic term =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=99 deriv=\r\nes from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that is\n&gt; worship of forefather=\r\ns in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorate\n&gt; their ancestors dur=\r\ning the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for\n&gt; their remembrance.=\r\n The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=99\n&gt; (wors=\r\nhip of forefathers).\n&gt; \n&gt; The Islamic practice of observing the moon rise b=\r\nefore deciding on\n&gt; celebrating the occasion derives from the Hindu custom =\r\nof breaking fast on\n&gt; Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only after sighting =\r\nthe moon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Barah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating those dea=\r\nd in battle or\n&gt; by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradition beca=\r\nuse in Sanskrit\n&gt; =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99. Hi=\r\nndus observe Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those\n&gt; who have died in battl=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; The word Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The =\r\noriginal\n&gt; word is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=\r\n=E2=80=99 is Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original\n&gt; Sanskrit name of t=\r\nhe land is =E2=80=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit =\r\nmeans a horse.\n&gt; Arvasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all kno=\r\nw, Arabia is\n&gt; famous for its horses.\n&gt; \n&gt; This discovery changes the entir=\r\ne complexion of the history of ancient\n&gt; India. Firstly we may have to revi=\r\nse our concepts about the king who had the\n&gt; largest empire in history. It =\r\ncould be that the expanse of king\n&gt; Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was great=\r\ner than that of all others. Secondly, the\n&gt; idea that the Indian empire spr=\r\nead only to the east and not in the west\n&gt; beyond say, Afghanisthan may hav=\r\ne to be abandoned. Thirdly the effeminate\n&gt; and pathetic belief that India,=\r\n unlike any other country in the world could\n&gt; by some age spread her benig=\r\nn and beatific cultural influence, language,\n&gt; customs, manners and educati=\r\non over distant lands without militarily\n&gt; conquering them is baseless. Ind=\r\nia did conquer all those countries\n&gt; physically wherever traces of its cult=\r\nure and language are still extant and\n&gt; the region extended from Bali islan=\r\nd in the south Pacific to the Baltic in\n&gt; Northern Europe and from Korea to=\r\n Kaaba. The only difference was that while\n&gt; Indian rulers identified thems=\r\nelves with the local population and\n&gt; established welfare states, Moghuls a=\r\nnd others who ruled conquered lands\n&gt; perpetuated untold atrocities over th=\r\ne vanquished.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 tells us that a pan-Arab=\r\nic poetic symposium used to be held\n&gt; in Mecca at the annual Okaj fair in p=\r\nre-Islamic times. All leading poets\n&gt; used to participate in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Poems=\r\n considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved on gold plate\n&gt; wer=\r\ne hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goatskin were hung\n&gt; ou=\r\ntside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasure house of the\n=\r\n&gt; best Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThat tradition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic compositions were\n=\r\n&gt; engraved and hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. But most =\r\nof\n&gt; the poems got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaaba by P=\r\nrophet\n&gt; Mohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, Hassa=\r\nn-bin-Sawik, who was among\n&gt; the invaders, captured some of the treasured p=\r\noems and dumped the gold plate\n&gt; on which they were inscribed in his own ho=\r\nme. Sawik=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to\n&gt; earn a reward carried those gold =\r\nplates to Khalif=E2=80=99s court where he met the\n&gt; well-known Arab scholar=\r\n Abu Amir Asamai. The latter received from the bearer\n&gt; five gold plates an=\r\nd 16 leather sheets with the prize-winning poems engraved\n&gt; on them. The be=\r\narer was sent away happy bestowed with a good reward.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the five gold=\r\n plates were inscribed verses by ancient Arab poets like\n&gt; Labi Baynay, Akh=\r\natab-bin-Turfa and Jarrham Bintoi. That discovery made\n&gt; Harun-al-Rashid or=\r\nder Abu Amir to compile a collection of all earlier\n&gt; compositions. One of =\r\nthe compositions in the collection is a tribute in\n&gt; verse paid by Jarrham =\r\nBintoi, a renowned Arab poet, to king Vikramaditya.\n&gt; Bintoi who lived 165 =\r\nyears before Prophet Mohammad had received the highest\n&gt; award for the best=\r\n poetic compositions for three years in succession in the\n&gt; pan-Arabic symp=\r\nosiums held in Mecca every year. All those three poems of\n&gt; Bintoi adjudged=\r\n best were hung inside the Kaaba temple, inscribed on gold\n&gt; plates. One of=\r\n these constituted an unreserved tribute to King Vikramaditya\n&gt; for his pat=\r\nernal and filial rule over Arabia. That has already been quoted\n&gt; above.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Pre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s tribute to king Vikramaditya i=\r\ns a decisive\n&gt; evidence that it was king Vikramaditya who first conquered t=\r\nhe Arabian\n&gt; Peninsula and made it a part of the Indian Empire. This explai=\r\nns why\n&gt; starting from India towards the west we have all Sanskrit names li=\r\nke\n&gt; Afghanisthan (now Afghanistan), Baluchisthan, Kurdisthan, Tajikiathan,=\r\n\n&gt; Uzbekisthan,  Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan, Turkesthan (Turkmenistha=\r\nn)\n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Historians have blundered in not giving due weight to the ev=\r\nidence provided\n&gt; by Sanskrit names pervading over the entire west Asian re=\r\ngion. Let us take a\n&gt; contemporary instance. Why did a part of India get na=\r\nmed Nagaland even after\n&gt; the end of British rule over India? After all his=\r\ntorical traces are wiped\n&gt; out of human memory, will a future age historian=\r\n be wrong if he concludes\n&gt; from the name Nagaland that the British or some=\r\n English speaking power must\n&gt; have ruled over India? Why is Portuguese spo=\r\nken in Goa (part of India), and\n&gt; French in Pondichery (part of India), and=\r\n both French and English in Canada?\n&gt; Is it not because those people ruled =\r\nover the territories where their\n&gt; languages are spoken? Can we not then ju=\r\nstly conclude that wherever traces\n&gt; of Sanskrit names and traditions exist=\r\n Indians once held sway? It is\n&gt; unfortunate that this important piece of d=\r\necisive evidence has been ignored\n&gt; all these centuries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another quest=\r\nion which should have presented itself to historians for\n&gt; consideration is=\r\n how could it be that Indian empires could extend in the\n&gt; east as far as K=\r\norea and Japan, while not being able to make headway beyond\n&gt; Afghanisthan?=\r\n In fact land campaigns are much easier to conduct than by sea.\n&gt; It was th=\r\ne Indians who ruled the entire West Asian region from Karachi to\n&gt; Hedjaz a=\r\nnd who gave Sanskrit names to those lands and the towns therein,\n&gt; introduc=\r\ne their pantheon of the fire-worship, imparted education and\n&gt; established =\r\nlaw and order.\n&gt; \n&gt; It may be that Arabia itself was not part of the Indian=\r\n empire until king\n&gt; Vikrama , since Bintoi says that it was king Vikrama w=\r\nho for the first time\n&gt; brought about a radical change in the social, cultu=\r\nral and political life of\n&gt; Arabia. It may be that the whole of West Asia e=\r\nxcept Arabia was under Indian\n&gt; rule before Vikrama. The latter added Arabi=\r\na too to the Indian Empire. Or as\n&gt; a remote possibility it could be that k=\r\ning Vikramaditya himself conducted a\n&gt; series of brilliant campaigns annexi=\r\nng to his empire the vast region between\n&gt; Afghanisthan and Hedjaz.\n&gt; \n&gt; In=\r\ncidentally this also explains why king Vikramaditya is so famous in\n&gt; histo=\r\nry. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness of heart and his impartial\n&gt; f=\r\nilial affection for all his subjects, whether Indian or Arab, as testified\n=\r\n&gt; by Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanently enshrined in the pages =\r\nof\n&gt; history because he was the world=E2=80=99s greatest ruler having the l=\r\nargest empire.\n&gt; It should be remembered that only a monarch with a vast em=\r\npire gets famous\n&gt; in world history. Vikram Samvat (calendar still widely i=\r\nn use in India\n&gt; today) which he initiated over 2000 years ago may well mar=\r\nk his victory over\n&gt; Arabia, and the so called Kutub Minar (Kutub Tower in =\r\nDelhi), a pillar\n&gt; commemorating that victory and the consequential marriag=\r\ne with the Vaihika\n&gt; (Balkh) princess as testified by the nearby iron pilla=\r\nr inscription.\n&gt; \n&gt; A great many puzzles of ancient world history get autom=\r\natically solved by a\n&gt; proper understanding of these great conquests of kin=\r\ng Vikramaditya. As\n&gt; recorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, pre=\r\nachers and social\n&gt; workers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached the =\r\nVedic way of life,\n&gt; manned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, tr=\r\nained the local people\n&gt; in irrigation and agriculture and established in t=\r\nhose regions a democratic,\n&gt; orderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious w=\r\nay of life. That was of\n&gt; course, a Vedic Hindu way of life.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is fro=\r\nm such ancient times that Indian Kshtriya royal families, like the\n&gt; Pahalv=\r\nis and Barmaks, have held sway over Iran and Iraq. It is those\n&gt; conquests,=\r\n which made the Parsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshippers. It is\n&gt; therefor=\r\ne that we find the Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sanskritised\n&gt; dialect, f=\r\nire temples existing thousands of miles away from India, and\n&gt; scores of si=\r\ntes of ancient Indian cultural centres like Navbahar in West\n&gt; Asia and the=\r\n numerous viharas in Soviet Russia spread throughout the world.\n&gt; Ever sinc=\r\ne so many viharas are often dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient Indian\n&gt; sculp=\r\ntures are also found in excavations in Central Asia. The same goes for\n&gt; We=\r\nst Asia.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Note: Ancient Indian sculptures include metal statues of the=\r\n Hindu deity\n&gt; Ganesh (the elephant headed god); the most recent find being=\r\n in Kuwait].\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately these chapters of world history have been a=\r\nlmost obliterated\n&gt; from public memory. They need to be carefully deciphere=\r\nd and rewritten. When\n&gt; these chapters are rewritten they might change the =\r\nentire concept and\n&gt; orientation of ancient history.\n&gt; \n&gt; In view of the ov=\r\nerwhelming evidence led above, historians, scholars,\n&gt; students of history =\r\nand lay men alike should take note that they had better\n&gt; revise their text=\r\n books of ancient world history. The existence of Hindu\n&gt; customs, shrines,=\r\n Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns and\n&gt; the Vikramadity=\r\na inscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumping\n&gt; proof that Indi=\r\nan Kshatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali to\n&gt; Baltic and Kor=\r\nea to Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
