I totally a=\r\ngree with your examples and explanations.\n\nGenerally speaking, whatever you=\r\n said is very right in case of the children that when we teach them they do=\r\n not understand it ans will only understand them as they grow, here, the te=\r\nacher knows it very well what he is teaching to the kid.\n\nUnfortunately in =\r\ncase of rituals, not everyone is fortunate to find such a guru who can teac=\r\nh those rituals to us (with the techer being fully aware of what is being t=\r\naught). Most often we just tend to observe what others or doing and just fo=\r\n things blindly not knowing weather we are doing it properly or not (in the=\r\n process there could be some mistakes that must have got creeped up in our =\r\nprocess).Since there is not guru available for us to correct these, we cont=\r\ninue to do the wrong process and eventually wonder if thesse rituals are an=\r\ny beneficial (since the desired results are obtained).\nHence i believe is t=\r\nhe confusion why prople wonder about the rituals.\n\nSO to me, key is to find=\r\n such a guru whom you can rely/trust on and follow his/her words blindly.\n\n=\r\nThanks\nKK\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some intelligent and rational people wonder=\r\n why we need to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I wa=\r\nnt to explain this basic point with an analogy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We teach some phrases=\r\n and manners to small children. For example, we tell small children to say =\r\n&quot;thank you&quot; when someone helps or say &quot;I am sorry&quot; when they do something w=\r\nrong. A really small child does not even understand what those words mean, =\r\nbut repeats them out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to underst=\r\nand the true meaning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding=\r\n of what they truly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are a=\r\nctually understood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or th=\r\ne picture of a mango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred w=\r\nords. As a child accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions =\r\nof the external world through senses), the child&#39;s thinking expands and one=\r\n gets more clarity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When =\r\none says sorry, one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even=\r\n feel a certain emotion (sadness and compassion).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, one may =\r\nbe doing rituals like homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, wi=\r\nthout fully understanding or appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual=\r\n for many years without fully understanding its real meaning may slowly sta=\r\nrt to understand and even experience some things that the rituals symbolize=\r\n. Many mantras and spiritual truths are actually understood from experience=\r\n alone. One can never fully understand what one has never experienced. As w=\r\ne accumulate more experiences (stored perceptions of the external and inter=\r\nnal world through external senses and the inward directed mind), one&#39;s thin=\r\nking expands and one gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual truths=\r\n one has been exposed to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rituals in various religions are designed t=\r\no symblize some truths that gives bliss when experienced by one. A mere exp=\r\nlanation of the symbolism is often useless to give one that state of bliss.=\r\n Even if you explain to a one year old child what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means in=\r\n detail, the child will not understand. The best thing to do is to just get=\r\n the child into the habit of saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; in approapriate situations=\r\n. Slowly, the meaning will become clearer and clearer with experience and t=\r\nhe correct emotions will come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mant=\r\nra everyday - possibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and vi=\r\nsualization in the mind - will slowly understand it and experience it.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Some religions have done the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emphas=\r\nizing philosophy and the final truths. While the latter is undeniably the e=\r\nnd goal, the former helps one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs t=\r\no set foot at the base of hill before reaching its top, one often needs to =\r\nengage in some external practices in order to realize internal truths. Of c=\r\nourse, it is good to remind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest one=\r\n should get stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one cannot completely =\r\neliminate the first steps. Just saying &quot;you are That. Just realize that you=\r\n are That&quot; is not an action plan. It does not work for most. One has to tak=\r\ne some baby steps.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If we don&#39;t teach a toddler to say various words b=\r\necause the toddler does not anyway understand them, one will never learn an=\r\nything. Correct knowledge evolves from half knowledge and habits that may b=\r\ne devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Similarly, =\r\ncorrect spiritual knowledge evolves from half knowledge and ritualalistic p=\r\nractices that may be devoid of knowledge, as one experiments and experience=\r\ns more. Most of us, when it comes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers.=\r\n So it is useful to get into the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sinc=\r\nerely.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
