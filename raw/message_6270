These miracle-working=\r\n powers are called siddhis.\nThe word literally means =E2=80=98gain=E2=80=99=\r\n of something. The sages make a difference\nbetween these so-called siddhis =\r\nand the real siddhi, whereby the whole of\nsamsara is transcended, and the h=\r\nighest state, egolessness, is reached.\n\n596 Our Guru, Sri Ramana, tells us =\r\nthat the real siddhi [to be striven for]\nis to be firmly established in the=\r\n natural state of the real Self, which is\never-present in the Heart; nothin=\r\ng else.\n\nAnd since it is in the Heart, the only thing needed is to seek it =\r\nthere and\nenjoy its bliss.\n\n597 The notion that the Self has to be won is u=\r\nntrue, because really, from\nthe point of view of truth, it was never lost. =\r\nThe sages therefore say that\nthe real Self is ever-present.\n\nThis fact is i=\r\nllustrated by the simile of the forgotten necklace, which was\ndiligently so=\r\nught while all the time it was on the neck of the seeker.\nThose that go aft=\r\ner the vanities of the world are enamoured of the false\nsiddhis because the=\r\ny do not know that the Self is the summum bonum, the\ngreatest good.\n\n598 Re=\r\nvelation teaches this truth by saying that the Self is infinite, and\nall el=\r\nse finite and trivial. He that buys the whole world by selling the\nreal Sel=\r\nf is just a pauper, and is to be pitied.\n\nThe so-called siddhis are of no v=\r\nalue because they are in samsara and are\ntherefore mere vanities, unreal, l=\r\nike the world. A saying of the same import\nis attributed to Jesus, who was =\r\na sage.\n\n599 Therefore, says the revelation, that supreme state is freedom =\r\nfrom\npoverty, and all else is only poverty. Like an emperor, the sage is ab=\r\nove\nall wants [in a different way].\n\nEven when going about begging [his dai=\r\nly meal] he is not cast down.\n\n600 It is the deluded men with outward-turne=\r\nd minds, hankering for worldly\nenjoyments, who talk of these siddhis, namel=\r\ny becoming minute, etc.\nRevelation\nmentions these siddhis for attracting th=\r\ne dull-witted ones also to the path\nfor deliverance.\n\n601 Since these are i=\r\nn the realm of ignorance, and therefore unreal like\ndream-gains, no discrim=\r\ninating person will be deluded by them. [Of course,]\nthe sage is not delude=\r\nd by these unrealities, as he has attained the supreme\nstate, which is the =\r\nstate of reality.\n\n602 Though thus it has been made clear that there is no =\r\ngain equal to the\ngain of the Self, undiscriminating ones are afraid of the=\r\n supreme state,\nbelieving that in it the Self will be lost.\n\nThat the Self =\r\nis not lost there is next demonstrated by a summary of a verse\nfrom Yoga Va=\r\nsishtam.\n\n603 =E2=80=98Just as, by the oncoming of spring, great qualities =\r\nsuch as beauty and\nso on come to trees, so to the sage who abides in the su=\r\npreme state, come\nlustre, keen intelligence and strength [of all kinds].\n\nE=\r\nven a common man, without education, if he becomes somehow aware of the\nrea=\r\nl Self, becomes a centre of attraction for others and is worshipped as a\npe=\r\nrfected one.\n\nAlso, other perfections are seen in the sage.\n\n604 Peace of m=\r\nind and other good qualities, which aspirants to deliverance\nhave to acquir=\r\ne and retain with effort, are natural to the sage. He is\nbeyond the [three]=\r\n qualities [sattva, rajas and tamas] and at the same time\nis the abode of a=\r\nll good qualities.\n\nSo the conclusion is as follows.\n\n605 So, when the ego =\r\nis lost, there is no real loss. The supreme state\n[attained on by the loss =\r\nof the ego] is not one in which the Self is lost.\nBut the Self is as good a=\r\ns lost due to the ego sense, and when this [ego\nsense] is lost, there is a =\r\nloss of this loss.\n\nIt is like a creditor unexpectedly receiving payment of=\r\n a debt, which he had\nwritten off as irrecoverable.\n\nThis loss of the ego i=\r\ns indeed an enormous gain, as shown below.\n\n606 This complete and final los=\r\ns of the ego is itself all these things [and\nmore]: righteousness, wealth, =\r\nenjoyment [of all pleasures at once],\ntruthfulness, true renunciation, sile=\r\nnce, tapas, union with God and true\nsurrender of oneself to Him.\n\nInnumerab=\r\nle gains and all manner of goodness are comprised in egolessness.\n\nThe thin=\r\ngs that have the same names as the items on this list are next shown\nto be =\r\nworthless because they are usually associated with the ego.\n\n607 Those havi=\r\nng the same names [which are prized greatly] are tainted and\nof little wort=\r\nh, because of association with the ego. But these are natural\nto the sage, =\r\nwho [always] dwells in the supreme state.\n\nAnother unique feature of the sa=\r\nge is next dealt with.\n\n608 Two excellent qualities are stated as belonging=\r\n to the sage, freedom\nfrom obligation to perform prescribed actions and at =\r\nthe same time being\ncontented and happy. For the common man the absence of =\r\nthese is due to his\nignorance.\n\nThe latter is bound by duties and never rea=\r\nches the goal of action. In the\nsage these two rare good features are unite=\r\nd and inseparable. Bhagavat Pada\nSankaracharya has given prominence to thes=\r\ne two unique features of the sage\nat the end of a long discourse that estab=\r\nlishes the truth that illumination,\nunaided, confers deliverance.\n\n609 The =\r\nsage is not bound to perform actions because for him there is\nnothing to be=\r\n gained by means of action. He for whom there is an obligation\nto perform a=\r\nctions is not free, but is bound by the fetters of delusion.\n\nThis shows up=\r\n well the vast difference there is between the bound and the\nfree.\n\nInciden=\r\ntally, a question is dealt with next that shows the ignorance of the\nquesti=\r\noners.\n\n610 Some, not knowing the truth [about sages] ask whether the sage =\r\ndoes not\nneed to practise meditation. By others the question is raised: =E2=\r\n=80=98Should not\nthe sage go to foreign countries and teach the people ther=\r\ne?=E2=80=997\n\n611 He that practises the meditation, =E2=80=98I am That=E2=\r\n=80=99 is not a sage, but only a\nsadhaka. If the sage meditates =E2=80=98I =\r\nam That=E2=80=99, it would be like a man\nmeditating =E2=80=98I am a man=E2=\r\n=80=99.\n\n612 It is proper for one to remember something he has forgotten. I=\r\nn the\nworld, remembrance of something not forgotten cannot occur. Since the=\r\n truth\nof the Self is never once forgotten by the sage, how can he meditate=\r\n on it?\n\n613 The true meditation on the supreme reality [the Self] is only =\r\nto remain\nas the Self in the thought-free state. This =E2=80=98meditation=\r\n=E2=80=99 can neither be\ngiven up, nor taken up by the sage.\n\nThis is the s=\r\nense of the latter half of the first benedictory verse in\nBhagavan=E2=80=99=\r\ns =E2=80=98Forty Verses on the Real=E2=80=99. The experience of the Self by=\r\n the\nsage in his natural state is not knowing, but being the Self. From thi=\r\ns\nstate of Being there can never be a relapse to the thought =E2=80=98I am =\r\nthe body=E2=80=99.\n\nThe answer to the question about going about lecturing =\r\nor teaching the\npeople all over the world is as follows.\n\n614 Even though a=\r\npparently dwelling in some corner of the world, he is\nreally like the sky. =\r\nWhile remaining always [uninterruptedly] in his own\nnatural state [samadhi]=\r\n, by his power he pervades the whole world.\n\nThis power of the sage is =E2=\r\n=80=98grace=E2=80=99, the power to bless.\n\n615 The sage, remaining all the =\r\ntime continuously in the natural state, with\nhis mind utterly stilled, prot=\r\nects his own people even from a very great\ndistance by his unthinkable powe=\r\nr of grace.\n\nBut this protection is automatic, without effort, or even cons=\r\ncious\nknowledge of doing this work of grace.\n\n616 Does anyone worry, after =\r\nawakening, about men seen in a dream? So too,\nthe sage who has awakened fro=\r\nm the sleep of ignorance is not anxious about\nthose who are still in ignora=\r\nnce.\n\nFrom his point of view no one is really ignorant.\n\nThe actions of a s=\r\nage ought not to be judged from the ordinary, human\nstandpoint.\n\n617 Since =\r\nthe sage has transcended the three grades of character, there can\nbe no fau=\r\nlts in him. Whatever he does in the world is surely blameless.\n\n618 For thi=\r\ns reason the sage transcends the sacred books that deal with\nhuman conduct,=\r\n because the mind-free one is not bound by them. Those books\nare concerned =\r\nwith ignorant ones; they are subject to regulation by them\nbecause they hav=\r\ne the sense of being performers of activities.\n\nThe conventions of samsara =\r\nhave no place in the state of the sage.\n\n619 By revelation the sage=E2=80=\r\n=99s state is described as one in which the Vedas\nare not Vedas, and the de=\r\nvas [the gods] are not devas.\n\nIncidentally, a warning is given to disciple=\r\ns and sadhakas.\n\n620 Though one should act upon the teachings of the sages,=\r\n one must not\nimitate any act done by a sage.\n\nThe teachings of a sage are =\r\nthe highest authority, not their actions.\n\nA noteworthy passage in the Gita=\r\n in this context is the following: =E2=80=98Even if\nhe kills all these peop=\r\nle, he is not a killer, nor is he bound.=E2=80=99\n\nNor is the sage bound to=\r\n conform to any particular mode of life.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.or=\r\ng/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016367f97649c608f04a257bf5c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n595 The first Guru [Dakshinamurti], who taught those great munis=\r\n by silence the truth of his own supreme state, and who afterwards appeared=\r\n as the great Guru, Sri Sankaracharya, is himself our Guru, Sri Ramana [Bha=\r\ngavan].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This should be self-evident.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A notion prevails amon=\r\ng the people that a sage or a perfected man must be able to perform miracle=\r\ns. These miracle-working powers are called siddhis. The word literally mean=\r\ns =E2=80=98gain=E2=80=99 of something. The sages make a difference between =\r\nthese so-called siddhis and the real siddhi, whereby the whole of samsara i=\r\ns transcended, and the highest state, egolessness, is reached.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;596=\r\n Our Guru, Sri Ramana, tells us that the real siddhi [to be striven for] is=\r\n to be firmly established in the natural state of the real Self, which is e=\r\nver-present in the Heart; nothing else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And since it is in the Heart=\r\n, the only thing needed is to seek it there and enjoy its bliss.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;5=\r\n97 The notion that the Self has to be won is untrue, because really, from t=\r\nhe point of view of truth, it was never lost. The sages therefore say that =\r\nthe real Self is ever-present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This fact is illustrated by the simil=\r\ne of the forgotten necklace, which was diligently sought while all the time=\r\n it was on the neck of the seeker.&lt;br&gt;\n\nThose that go after the vanities of=\r\n the world are enamoured of the false siddhis because they do not know that=\r\n the Self is the summum bonum, the greatest good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;598 Revelation tea=\r\nches this truth by saying that the Self is infinite, and all else finite an=\r\nd trivial. He that buys the whole world by selling the real Self is just a =\r\npauper, and is to be pitied.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The so-called siddhis are of no value=\r\n because they are in samsara and are therefore mere vanities, unreal, like =\r\nthe world. A saying of the same import is attributed to Jesus, who was a sa=\r\nge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;599 Therefore, says the revelation, that supreme state is freedo=\r\nm from poverty, and all else is only poverty. Like an emperor, the sage is =\r\nabove all wants [in a different way].=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even when going about =\r\nbegging [his daily meal] he is not cast down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;600 It is the deluded =\r\nmen with outward-turned minds, hankering for worldly enjoyments, who talk o=\r\nf these siddhis, namely becoming minute, etc. Revelation&lt;br&gt;\n\nmentions thes=\r\ne siddhis for attracting the dull-witted ones also to the path for delivera=\r\nnce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;601 Since these are in the realm of ignorance, and therefore un=\r\nreal like dream-gains, no discriminating person will be deluded by them. [O=\r\nf course,] the sage is not deluded by these unrealities, as he has attained=\r\n the supreme state, which is the state of reality.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;602 Though thus=\r\n it has been made clear that there is no gain equal to the gain of the Self=\r\n, undiscriminating ones are afraid of the supreme state, believing that in =\r\nit the Self will be lost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That the Self is not lost there is next de=\r\nmonstrated by a summary of a verse from Yoga Vasishtam.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;603 =E2=80=\r\n=98Just as, by the oncoming of spring, great qualities such as beauty and s=\r\no on come to trees, so to the sage who abides in the supreme state, come lu=\r\nstre, keen intelligence and strength [of all kinds].&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even a common m=\r\nan, without education, if he becomes somehow aware of the real Self, become=\r\ns a centre of attraction for others and is worshipped as a perfected one.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Also, other perfections are seen in the sage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;604 Peace of mind and other good qualities, which aspira=\r\nnts to deliverance have to acquire and retain with effort, are natural to t=\r\nhe sage.

From this state of Being=\r\n there can never be a relapse to the thought =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=\r\n=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The answer to the question about going about lecturing or tea=\r\nching the people all over the world is as follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;614 Even though a=\r\npparently dwelling in some corner of the world, he is really like the sky. =\r\nWhile remaining always [uninterruptedly] in his own natural state [samadhi]=\r\n, by his power he pervades the whole world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This power of the sage=\r\n is =E2=80=98grace=E2=80=99, the power to bless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;615 The sage, remai=\r\nning all the time continuously in the natural state, with his mind utterly =\r\nstilled, protects his own people even from a very great distance by his unt=\r\nhinkable power of grace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But this protection is automatic, without=\r\n effort, or even conscious knowledge of doing this work of grace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;616 Does anyone worry, after awakening, abou=\r\nt men seen in a dream? So too, the sage who has awakened from the sleep of =\r\nignorance is not anxious about those who are still in ignorance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;From his point of view no one is really ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The actions =\r\nof a sage ought not to be judged from the ordinary, human standpoint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;617 Since the sage has transcended the three grades of character, there c=\r\nan be no faults in him. Whatever he does in the world is surely blameless.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;618 For this reason the sage transcends the sacred books that deal=\r\n with human conduct, because the mind-free one is not bound by them. Those =\r\nbooks are concerned with ignorant ones; they are subject to regulation by t=\r\nhem because they have the sense of being performers of activities.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The conventions of samsara have no place in the state of the sage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n619 By revelation the sage=E2=80=99s state is described as one in which the=\r\n Vedas are not Vedas, and the devas [the gods] are not devas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Incide=\r\nntally, a warning is given to disciples and sadhakas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;620 Though o=\r\nne should act upon the teachings of the sages, one must not imitate any act=\r\n done by a sage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The teachings of a sage are the highest authority, =\r\nnot their actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A noteworthy passage in the Gita in this context =\r\nis the following: =E2=80=98Even if he kills all these people, he is not a k=\r\niller, nor is he bound.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Nor is the sage bound to conform =\r\nto any particular mode of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sou=\r\nrce&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; t=\r\narget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;ma=\r\nrgin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, =\r\n51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;=\r\nmargin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=\r\n=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=\r\n=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016367f97649c608f04a257bf5c--\r\n\n"}}
