Narasimha is one of the right persons capable =\r\nof\n&gt; guiding you. If you are sincere, you&#39;ll be helped. although, i write\n&gt;=\r\n much now a days, i am just like anybody else, struggeling !!!\n\nI am a begg=\r\nar like others. But I try to help other beggars by showing the \nhouses wher=\r\ne they can try their luck by begging.\n\nNormally, one beggar may view anothe=\r\nr beggar as a competitor and not like \ntoo many people to beg in the same a=\r\nrea. However, this begging is different \nand there is no competition betwee=\r\nn different beggars. The owner of the \nhouse has enough to give to every be=\r\nggar and does not mind giving to many \nbeggars at the same time if they are=\r\n worthy.\n\nActually, if one beggar gets something, it will be so much that h=\r\ne/she can \nshare some of it with all around him/her. If you go with 100 oth=\r\ner beggars \nand beg, you are better off. If any one of them is able to melt=\r\n the heart of \nthe owner of the house, all the hundred will benefit from it=\r\n to varying \ndegrees!\n\nWhen I tell people about external practices such as =\r\nhomam and internal \npractices such as surrender and detachment in actions, =\r\nall I am really doing \nis to take fellow beggars in front of a house where =\r\na rich person lives. If \nthey are able to melt the heart of the owner of th=\r\ne house, their begging \nwill be fruitful. That is completely in *their* han=\r\nds.\n\nI am only a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg an=\r\nd I am \nnot really &quot;capable&quot; of anything more. Please do not treat me in an=\r\ny other \nway.\n\nWhen Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa, and \nThakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the Mot=\r\nher, mama kim \nkathaa (what is my story)..\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn general=\r\n, to those who are struggling with internal conflicts related to \nspiritual=\r\n progress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. Rome is not \nbuilt in=\r\n a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not built in a \nday! =\r\nBe patient.\n\nI have seen people change from inside out in a short span of t=\r\nime. There is \nno need to panic or give up hope.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBe p=\r\natient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as \nRamakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, \nSankaracharya, R=\r\namanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, \nBuddha, Mahavi=\r\nra, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. \nTry to integra=\r\nte some of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and \nyour life s=\r\ntyle. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner \ntransformation=\r\n. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired \nwritings.\n\nNobod=\r\ny can change you. You yourself can do it. You CAN do it, if you really \nwan=\r\nt to. Introspect and go to the root of your problems. If you introspect \nan=\r\nd analyze each big problem, you will realize that ego is the root of it \nal=\r\nl. Whenever something in life seems fundamentally important, question why. =\r\n\nI am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast analyze=\r\n \nwhy it is important and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh \nintro=\r\nspection will eventually lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, \nattachme=\r\nnt and pride that often color one&#39;s attitude.\n\nIntrospect on your attitude =\r\nand motives and contemplate on the nature of \ngod. Meditate.\n\nIn this age, =\r\nthere is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, \nsaying &quot;I =\r\nsurrender to you. So give me x or y&quot; is NOT total surrender. Total \nsurrend=\r\ner means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and \nexpectatio=\r\nns. If you can manage it, you are all set!\n\n*        *        *\n\nHomam or w=\r\norship of deities in fire is a powerful practice taught by rishis. \nI know =\r\nfrom experience that it burns blocking karmas and enables the inner \ntransf=\r\normation. It is a very useful spiritual practice. I know people who \nmade (=\r\nand are making) considerable spiritual progress through regular \npractice o=\r\nf homam. It is the most powerful method I know of and teaching it \nis one o=\r\nf my tasks for this life.\n\nDear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily=\r\n schedule and start doing \nMahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months=\r\n, you should switch to \nVishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my =\r\nwebsite by then). THAT \nshould help you find your way in your spiritual lif=\r\ne and strike the right \nbalance between spiritual life and material life.\n\n=\r\nThe purpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to pay bac=\r\nk \ndebts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress becomes \ns=\r\nmoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot become smooth.=\r\n \nHowever, without some spiritual progress, actions in material life create=\r\n \nnew debts. In the beginning, one needs to create a synergy between the tw=\r\no \nand use the actions in material life to promote spiritual life. For true=\r\n \nspiritual progress, most people cannot and should not run away from mater=\r\nial \nlife.\n\nVasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that a=\r\nction and \nknowledge are two wings with which the bird of manifested Self f=\r\nlies and \nbecomes liberated. Action without correct knowledge creates pride=\r\n, promote \nego and binds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge witho=\r\nut action \ndoes not become complete because of the remaining debts and one =\r\nis stuck. \nOne needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become =\r\nfree.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ta=\r\nrpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pat=\r\nhak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: T=\r\nhursday, December 18, 2008 3:29 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Br=\r\nahamcharya\n\nDear Raju,\n\nHave patience !

Z finds tha=\r\nt the same Desire has Risen again, he again\nsatsfies\n&gt; &gt; the same with the =\r\nsame action. these cycle keeps going on & on\nfor\n&gt; &gt; many years. Mr. Z feel=\r\ns like most in the world that this desire\nto\n&gt; &gt; have sexual relationship i=\r\ns &#39;Natural&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now let&#39;s analysie the above case. Though mr.Z satsfie=\r\ns the want\nof\n&gt; &gt; copulation, it comes back again & again. it means that th=\r\ne\ndesire\n&gt; &gt; has never been satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Our spiritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is\n=\r\nlost\n&gt; &gt; during copulation is the BEST Energy available in a person which\ni=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; restrained, controlled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and\ncan\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; help immensly in the path of Spiritual journey.\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; consider tha=\r\nt our Mr. Z some how got to read the above paragraph\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; started seri=\r\nously thinking about it. He tells himself that he\nwould\n&gt; &gt; refrain from in=\r\ntercourse for 3 months. The earlier frequency was\n&gt; 2/3\n&gt; &gt; days, now he su=\r\nddenly finds that desire has completely overtaken\n&gt; &gt; him. after 15 days, h=\r\ne finds that Desire has gone in to his\nevery\n&gt; &gt; pour and every thought and=\r\n he gives up and succumbs to that\n&gt; gigantic\n&gt; &gt; force of Kaam Vaasana. Thi=\r\ns may be called suppression initially\n&gt; &gt; which failed the effort. The pers=\r\non again analyses what went\nwrong\n&gt; &gt; and again tries to do the same and ag=\r\nain fails. he keeps on\ntrying\n&gt; &gt; and keeps on failing. during this battles=\r\n, he is also exploring\nand\n&gt; &gt; gathering knowledge of experienced people an=\r\nd knowledge from\n&gt; &gt; spiritual books. he understands that if he needs to wi=\r\nn the\nFinal\n&gt; &gt; WAR with this Very Formidable enemy, he needs to do lot of\n=\r\nthings\n&gt; &gt; simultaneously and he then resorts to the help from many\nquarter=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; He starts taking cold water bath, starts reading spiritual\nbooks,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; stops reading film magazine, stops watching Films and TV Shows,\n&gt; &gt; Reduc=\r\nes eating Onion and garlic, starts doing Yoga Aasan,\n&gt; Meditation\n&gt; &gt; and s=\r\no on and so forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on\nbatteling\n&gt; &gt; with the =\r\n*Natural Desire* and still keeps on loosing. but the\ngood\n&gt; &gt; news is that =\r\nhis days of batteling before loosing has increased.\n&gt; &gt; started from 10 day=\r\ns, he has now reached the struggeling\ncapacity\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; 90 days. (WE ARE AS=\r\nSUMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE IS FULLY\nCOOPERATIVE\n&gt; OF\n&gt; &gt; HIS THEATRICS). He =\r\nis still unhappy about his loosing, although\nhe\n&gt; &gt; is able to keep-up the =\r\nPhysical brahmacharya for 3 months. some\nhow\n&gt; &gt; he realises that God&#39;s gra=\r\nce is the most important thing\nespecially\n&gt; &gt; for this perticular matter an=\r\nd he now starts Praying to his\n&gt; &gt; favourite Deity every day. he cries and =\r\ncries and requests the\nGod\n&gt; &gt; to save him from this loss. he keeps on tryi=\r\nng every thing\n&gt; possible,\n&gt; &gt; keeps on praying sincerely and severly, keep=\r\ns on doing various\n&gt; &gt; spiritual sadhanas but still keeps on loosing at as =\r\nwell. over a\n&gt; &gt; period of some 8/10 years, the desired change is visible. =\r\nhe has\n&gt; &gt; conquered his desire. Now Sexual Desire which was his *Natural*\n=\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt; him has been replaced by Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when co=\r\nmbined with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; every possible prepa=\r\nration and will power to try untiringly\nagain &\n&gt; &gt; again finally results i=\r\nn to annihilation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.

This is the\n&gt; nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; desire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of any=\r\nthing other\n&gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self) or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical pleasure=\r\ns, the desire will never end no matter\nhow\n&gt; &gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one gets.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often requir=\r\nes suppressing\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily.

Practice suppressing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, but do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to=\r\n uproot it fully and\nkeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya\nis\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can a=\r\nlso\ndo\n&gt; &gt; it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in=\r\n 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and=\r\n\nbrahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most fund=\r\namental thing is to overcome ego and not\nbecome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attached to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and\n&gt; possess=\r\nions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the=\r\n most fundamental\nthing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several =\r\nthings in spiritual progress. They all\ncome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together! One\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions\nand\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may become easy as a result.

Narasimha is on=\r\ne of the right persons capable of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guiding you. If you are sincere,=\r\n you&#39;ll be helped. although, i write&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; much now a days, i am just li=\r\nke anybody else, struggeling !!!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI am a beggar like others. But I =\r\ntry to help other beggars by showing the &lt;br&gt;\nhouses where they can try the=\r\nir luck by begging.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNormally, one beggar may view another beggar a=\r\ns a competitor and not like &lt;br&gt;\ntoo many people to beg in the same area. H=\r\nowever, this begging is different &lt;br&gt;\nand there is no competition between =\r\ndifferent beggars. The owner of the &lt;br&gt;\nhouse has enough to give to every =\r\nbeggar and does not mind giving to many &lt;br&gt;\nbeggars at the same time if th=\r\ney are worthy.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nActually, if one beggar gets something, it will be =\r\nso much that he/she can &lt;br&gt;\nshare some of it with all around him/her. If y=\r\nou go with 100 other beggars &lt;br&gt;\nand beg, you are better off. If any one o=\r\nf them is able to melt the heart of &lt;br&gt;\nthe owner of the house, all the hu=\r\nndred will benefit from it to varying &lt;br&gt;\ndegrees!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen I tell pe=\r\nople about external practices such as homam and internal &lt;br&gt;\npractices suc=\r\nh as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am really doing &lt;br&gt;\nis to =\r\ntake fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person lives. If &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nthey are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their begging &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nwill be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI am onl=\r\ny a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg and I am &lt;br&gt;\nn=\r\not really &quot;capable&quot; of anything more. Please do not treat me in any other &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nway.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa, and &lt;br&gt;\nThakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of =\r\nthe Mother, mama kim &lt;br&gt;\nkathaa (what is my story).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *   =\r\n     *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn general, to those who are struggling with internal confl=\r\nicts related to &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress and getting frustrated, I have a fe=\r\nw words. Rome is not &lt;br&gt;\nbuilt in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protoco=\r\nl of Rome is not built in a &lt;br&gt;\nday! Be patient.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI have seen peop=\r\nle change from inside out in a short span of time. There is &lt;br&gt;\nno need to=\r\n panic or give up hope.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBe patient. R=\r\nead scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis such as &lt;br&gt;\nRamakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, &lt;br&gt;\nSankaracharya, Ra=\r\nmanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, Jesus Christ, &lt;br&gt;\nBuddha, Mah=\r\navira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are saying. &lt;br&gt;\nTry to =\r\nintegrate some of it into your common sense, your way of thinking and &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nyour life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is inner &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\ntransformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some inspired &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nwritings.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNobody can change you. You yourself can do it. You CA=\r\nN do it, if you really &lt;br&gt;\nwant to. Introspect and go to the root of your =\r\nproblems. If you introspect &lt;br&gt;\nand analyze each big problem, you will rea=\r\nlize that ego is the root of it &lt;br&gt;\nall. Whenever something in life seems =\r\nfundamentally important, question why. &lt;br&gt;\nI am not saying to leave it. Do=\r\n what you normally do. But, atleast analyze &lt;br&gt;\nwhy it is important and tr=\r\ny to understand your inner motives. Scuh &lt;br&gt;\nintrospection will eventually=\r\n lighten the clouds of fear, expectation, &lt;br&gt;\nattachment and pride that of=\r\nten color one&#39;s attitude.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIntrospect on your attitude and motives =\r\nand contemplate on the nature of &lt;br&gt;\ngod. Meditate.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIn this age, =\r\nthere is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. Of course, &lt;br&gt;\nsaying=\r\n &quot;I surrender to you. So give me x or y&quot; is NOT total surrender. Total &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nsurrender means you take whatever the Lord gives without questions and &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nexpectations. If you can manage it, you are all set!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        * =\r\n       *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHomam or worship of deities in fire is a powerful practic=\r\ne taught by rishis. &lt;br&gt;\nI know from experience that it burns blocking karm=\r\nas and enables the inner &lt;br&gt;\ntransformation. It is a very useful spiritual=\r\n practice. I know people who &lt;br&gt;\nmade (and are making) considerable spirit=\r\nual progress through regular &lt;br&gt;\npractice of homam. It is the most powerfu=\r\nl method I know of and teaching it &lt;br&gt;\nis one of my tasks for this life.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nDear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily schedule and start=\r\n doing &lt;br&gt;\nMahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months, you should sw=\r\nitch to &lt;br&gt;\nVishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my website by =\r\nthen). THAT &lt;br&gt;\nshould help you find your way in your spiritual life and s=\r\ntrike the right &lt;br&gt;\nbalance between spiritual life and material life.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe purpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to pa=\r\ny back &lt;br&gt;\ndebts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress b=\r\necomes &lt;br&gt;\nsmoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot b=\r\necome smooth. &lt;br&gt;\nHowever, without some spiritual progress, actions in mat=\r\nerial life create &lt;br&gt;\nnew debts.. In the beginning, one needs to create a =\r\nsynergy between the two &lt;br&gt;\nand use the actions in material life to promot=\r\ne spiritual life. For true &lt;br&gt;\nspiritual progress, most people cannot and =\r\nshould not run away from material &lt;br&gt;\nlife.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nVasishtha said in the=\r\n very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that action and &lt;br&gt;\nknowledge are two =\r\nwings with which the bird of manifested Self flies and &lt;br&gt;\nbecomes liberat=\r\ned. Action without correct knowledge creates pride, promote &lt;br&gt;\nego and bi=\r\nnds one further instead of liberating.

Z finds that the same Desire has Risen again, he again&lt;br&gt;\nsa=\r\ntsfies&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the same with the same action. these cycle keeps going=\r\n on &amp; on&lt;br&gt;\nfor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; many years. Mr. Z feels like most in the=\r\n world that this desire&lt;br&gt;\nto&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have sexual relationship is &#39;N=\r\natural&#39;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now let&#39;s analysie the above case. Tho=\r\nugh mr.Z satsfies the want&lt;br&gt;\nof&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; copulation, it comes back a=\r\ngain &amp; again. it means that the&lt;br&gt;\ndesire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; has never been=\r\n satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again &amp; again.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Our spiritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nlost&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; during copulation is the BEST Energy available in a per=\r\nson which&lt;br&gt;\nif&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; restrained, controlled and preserved, can ea=\r\nsly become OJAS and&lt;br&gt;\ncan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; help immensly in the path of Spir=\r\nitual journey.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ***&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; consider that our Mr. Z some=\r\n how got to read the above paragraph&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; started ser=\r\niously thinking about it. He tells himself that he&lt;br&gt;\nwould&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrefrain from intercourse for 3 months. The earlier frequency was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2=\r\n/3&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; days, now he suddenly finds that desire has completely ove=\r\nrtaken&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; him. after 15 days, he finds that Desire has gone in t=\r\no his&lt;br&gt;\nevery&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pour and every thought and he gives up and su=\r\nccumbs to that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gigantic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; force of Kaam Vaasana. This =\r\nmay be called suppression initially&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; which failed the effort. =\r\nThe person again analyses what went&lt;br&gt;\nwrong&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and again tries=\r\n to do the same and again fails. he keeps on&lt;br&gt;\ntrying&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and k=\r\neeps on failing. during this battles, he is also exploring&lt;br&gt;\nand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; gathering knowledge of experienced people and knowledge from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; spiritual books. he understands that if he needs to win the&lt;br&gt;\nFinal=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; WAR with this Very Formidable enemy, he needs to do lot of&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\nthings&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; simultaneously and he then resorts to the help from=\r\n many&lt;br&gt;\nquarters.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He starts taking cold water bath, starts =\r\nreading spiritual&lt;br&gt;\nbooks,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stops reading film magazine, sto=\r\nps watching Films and TV Shows,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reduces eating Onion and garl=\r\nic, starts doing Yoga Aasan,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Meditation&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and so on an=\r\nd so forth. taking the aids thus he keeps on&lt;br&gt;\nbatteling&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wi=\r\nth the *Natural Desire* and still keeps on loosing. but the&lt;br&gt;\ngood&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; news is that his days of batteling before loosing has increased.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; started from 10 days, he has now reached the struggeling&lt;br&gt;\nca=\r\npacity&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT HIS WI=\r\nFE IS FULLY&lt;br&gt;\nCOOPERATIVE&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; OF&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; HIS THEATRICS). He is=\r\n still unhappy about his loosing, although&lt;br&gt;\nhe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is able to =\r\nkeep-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 months. some&lt;br&gt;\nhow&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhe realises that God&#39;s grace is the most important thing&lt;br&gt;\nespecially&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; for this perticular matter and he now starts Praying to his&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; favourite Deity every day. he cries and cries and requests the&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nGod&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to save him from this loss. he keeps on trying every th=\r\ning&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; possible,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; keeps on praying sincerely and severly=\r\n, keeps on doing various&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; spiritual sadhanas but still keeps o=\r\nn loosing at as well. over a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; period of some 8/10 years, the d=\r\nesired change is visible. he has&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conquered his desire. Now Se=\r\nxual Desire which was his *Natural*&lt;br&gt;\nfor&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; him has been repl=\r\naced by Brahmacharya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when combine=\r\nd with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; every po=\r\nssible preparation and will power to try untiringly&lt;br&gt;\nagain &amp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; again finally results in to annihilation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; ***&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.
