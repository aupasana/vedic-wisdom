Unfortunately, barring some=\r\n, most of the advice you&#39;ve gotten is useless (with due respect to all the =\r\nsincere people who have given it: dont advise unless you have known OCD). I=\r\n have struggled quite a bit with OCD, my sister has full fledged OCD for 19=\r\n yrs. My brother-in-law has OCD. Others in both my wife&#39;s and my family hav=\r\ne had OCD.\n\nRead this carefully. Your problem is not with God. From my basi=\r\nc analysis of your writeup your problem is exactly the same as every other =\r\nOCD patient - the mind is terribly scared of a certain outcome, and in orde=\r\nr to avoid confronting that outcome, it adopts a ritual repetitive practice=\r\n in a hollow way (without meaning). Instead of recognizing that the practic=\r\ne is hollow, it believes that more repetition will bring meaning, and it do=\r\nes more and more and more until it takes over life altogether. Thats why yo=\r\nu go to the temple again and again - the temple has no meaning for you othe=\r\nr than an empty physical practice to allay the fear and doubt. There is no =\r\nGod in the temple for you, really.\n\nThe solution is not to adopt more ritua=\r\nl practices. A mantra becomes a meaningless ritual repetitive practice unle=\r\nss the mind is wholeheartedly participating in it with surrender and withou=\r\nt fear. Homam may be a little better, but powerful fears can render that us=\r\neless too.  \n\n\nTry the homeopathic/ayurvedic/allopathic options to get basi=\r\nc control of your life. Then confront the fear using a psychotherapist i.e.=\r\n one who will talk to you and help you deal with the fear. Then you may try=\r\n some homam/mantra, but only when your mind is calm and empty, and not assa=\r\niled with fear and doubt.\n\nMost people dont understand that repetitive reli=\r\ngious practices of any kind frequently increase the trouble of OCD sufferer=\r\ns, not because there is no God or because God has abandoned them. It is bec=\r\nause OCD sufferers get attached to and obsessed with the repetitive practic=\r\nes which drown out the real content completely. God is to be found using ri=\r\ntual and symbolic practices only when the mind is truly calm and wants to s=\r\nurrender, otherwise these practices themselves become fuel to the all consu=\r\nming destructive fire called OCD. This is exactly what has happened to you.=\r\n \n\nYou must search for real meaning  (astrologically - Jupiter). Who is God=\r\n? What does he mean to you? \n\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;as16475&quot; &lt;as16475@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear sir,\n&gt; namskar\n&gt; There was a t=\r\nime when I didnt use to have my meals before thanking god. I used to rememb=\r\ner god 24 hors a day. But in 1990 I started fearing god and now I hate him =\r\nso much so that I destroyed my home made temple and his posters. why i did =\r\nso the reason is as below:\n&gt; I am suffering from ocd (Obsessive compulsive =\r\ndisorder) since 1990. My problem is that whenever I am doing some work some=\r\n part of my mind says that if this work gets done I will go to temple but i=\r\nt is not me and I counter this thought by saying that I will not go to temp=\r\nle. But at the completion of the work I am compelled to go to temple. The p=\r\nroblem is that I have to go to temple compulsively and many times again and=\r\n again. Also the temple which comes to my thoughts has to be visited to sat=\r\nisfy my compulsion. Even a simple thought that if my son answers the questi=\r\non I will go to temple. I am not even able to teach him. I cant cross the r=\r\noad where there is a temple. How can I avoid that. There are temples all ar=\r\nound the world. Please help me out. For past 10 yrs I am taking allopathy m=\r\nedicine. For past 7 months I am taking homeopathy also. But sometimes it go=\r\nes out of control. Please guide me how can I stop hating GOD. \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Dob :16th april,1975\n&gt; Place:  kangra (Himachal Pradesh)\n&gt; Time : 8 pm\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; a\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
