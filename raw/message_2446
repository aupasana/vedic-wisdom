Normally, fire alarm is not pres=\r\nent in every room. If so, sit in a room that does not have fire alarm, clos=\r\ne the door, open the window and go on to do the homam. If you are getting s=\r\nmoke, you can consider dropping a towel near the closed door\n\n2. Take small=\r\ner pieces of dry coconus - may be 1.5 to 2 inc in size (take a dry coconut =\r\nhalf and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. That will be small enough to keep the smok=\r\ne level low.\n\n3. After the homam is over and the burnt dry coconut pieces c=\r\nool down, remove them and try to keep the homakundam clean. The pieces even=\r\n though are burnt, will catch fire if you keep them in the homakundam, and =\r\nthey will generate higher levels of smoke. So, keep it clean.\n\n4. Keep marm=\r\naya, and pelalu (these are like pop-corn but in a smaller size and devoid o=\r\nf oil etc). They are very effective in burning with out much smoke\n\n5. I pu=\r\nrchased a window exhaust fab ($20-40 in Wallmart), and kept in my window. T=\r\nhe amount of smoke during the homam is not too much if you keep the ghee le=\r\nvel and the size of dry coconut pieces small. How ever, after the fire goes=\r\n off, there will be some smoke. The exhaust will help in sending this out. =\r\nHow ever, you can move the homakundam out.\n\n6. I purchased 2 bricks from Ho=\r\nmedeopt and kept my Homakundam on them so that carpet does not get the heat=\r\n\n\n7. I also bought a terpentine (also found in Wallmart for about $15 in tr=\r\nekking related ile - it is used to make tents. I used to put it first and t=\r\nhen bricks and then the homamkundam. This helped my ensure that carpent did=\r\n not get any strains.\n\n8. Initially I was very skeptic about the fire alarm=\r\n, but, the day I started (with window exhaust fan), I was relieved and neve=\r\nr bothered again.\n\n9. Narayan&#39;s tip about keeping the lights at night is go=\r\nod. But, Candles are normal and if you keep the window blinders for the are=\r\na above the window exhaust, the light will not be so much for the out sider=\r\ns and will be similar to a bright candle if your fire size is small.\n\n10.
