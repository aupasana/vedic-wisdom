We must look at ma=\r\nny other qualities.\n\nSo does the pronounciation matter?\n\nIn my humble opion=\r\nion teaching is done silently or the best teachers do it silently, they rem=\r\nove all confusion within the disciples mind silently. What is a silent pron=\r\nounciation?\n\nLord Dakshinamoorty silently imparted a lot of teaching too.\n\n=\r\nI also agree with Manish on the count, If I recall correctly they have done=\r\n this 1000 homas on more than one occassion, in Napa Valley and before that=\r\n in a place they had near LA area. Prior to that they both lived in India a=\r\nnd may have done there too. The number is not of great importance They dono=\r\nt brag at all. I mentioned it with different angle.\n\nMy point on the count =\r\nwas in  their place i.e. their ashram where they have done some many chandi=\r\n homas, the place should be very special i.e. good vibrations etc, so from =\r\nthat perspective it is good to go and see it and experiance it.\n\nIn my humb=\r\nle opionion they teach a good methodical process. They have a very varied d=\r\nisciple slate. I am sure they adjust accordingly.\n\nWe live in a very impure=\r\n hybrid time and place and accordingly they have good process for learning =\r\nchandi paath and other things, I have a very positive opionion about them a=\r\nnd recommend them.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am sorry, but I=\r\n have to strike a discordant note.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Swamiji at Shree Maa&#39;s ashram may =\r\nbe a learned and sincere man and may give nice lectures on Chandipath. Howe=\r\nver, his pronunciation is unbelievably terrible. I have seen several wester=\r\nners who do a far far better job with the pronunciation of Chandipath as we=\r\nll as other Sanskrit hymns. His pronunciation is particularly bad.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of=\r\n course, pronunciation may not matter to some and, if so, please ignore my =\r\nmail. But, in case it matters, I must say that his pronunciation is unbelie=\r\nvably terrible and not a good starting point for learners.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am basing my judgment on listening to the first few verse=\r\ns of &quot;Chapter 4&quot; at\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/shree_maa_chandi_p=\r\nath_audio_classes\n&gt;  \n&gt; After listening to two verses, I simply could not c=\r\nontinue listening.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; where they have conduc=\r\nted the most Chandi Homas in all over USA.\n&gt;  \n&gt; They seem to have done a S=\r\nahasra (1000) Chandi homa over a period of 1000 days and they seem to be st=\r\nill doing Chandi homam on every Sunday. That is excellent.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, i=\r\nt is not possible to know where most Chandi homas were done in USA.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A=\r\nt my house, we do 3 Chandi homas per day (one by myself and two by two othe=\r\nr sadhakas). I myself have done about 1200 Chandi homas here. In a neighbor=\r\ning town 10 miles from here, a priest from India has been doing 10 Chandi h=\r\nomas per day for the last 2 months and plans to finish 1000 Chandi homas in=\r\n August. He is doing it as a private sadhana, but without a private sankalp=\r\na and for peace and dharma in the world.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like this, there may be seve=\r\nral sadhakas doing intense sadhana with Chandi homam that we may not know a=\r\nbout.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In any case, numbers do not matter. M=\r\nanish once told me, &quot;Narasimha, numbers do not matter. What one needs is on=\r\ne homam where one experiences Her in oneself and not twenty homas where not=\r\nhing happens. These days, I cannot properly finish even one Chandi homam. O=\r\nnce I am in the 4th or 5th chapter, I go into a trance and I cannot continu=\r\ne anymore. I stay like that for many hours and cannot finish the homam.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Shree Maa has a ashram in Napa Valley, a couple hou=\r\nr drive from bay area.
