A will get a \nsimilar opportunity later=\r\n (possibly in another life). At that time, he can \neither do the bad thing =\r\nto B or resist the temptation again and postpone \nfurther. If A becomes a j=\r\neevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is liberated while \nliving and engaging in=\r\n actions without any sense of I-ness, then he can pay \nback the bad thing w=\r\nithout incurring further karmas. If A got moksha and got \nout of the game, =\r\nthen A is fine but B still has that karma pending. Nature \nwill find a stub=\r\nstitute to pay back this karma to B. That person will get an \nopportunity t=\r\no do the bad thing to B.\n\nWhen I say paying back, please note that the acti=\r\non and reaction are not \nnecessarily identical, but they are compatible.\n\nN=\r\now, answer to Utpal: A is out of cycle as he accepted what happened and B \n=\r\nhas a bad karma. Either A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back tha=\r\nt \nbad karma to B later. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an \no=\r\npportunity later to pay back, he is back in the cycle.\n\nYou do something to=\r\n someone. They pay you back. The cycle is done. If they \nidentified with th=\r\ne action of payback, it becomes new karma for them. You \nwill again get a c=\r\nhance to pay back them again. If you do (and identify with \nthe action), yo=\r\nu are back in the cycle. And so on.\n\nIt is quite complex. But the key to ge=\r\ntting out of the cycle is: accepting \nwhat happens to you, being good to ot=\r\nhers and overcoming ego and the sense \nof &quot;I am doing&quot;.\n\n* * *\n\nKarma is no=\r\nt just good and bad things we do to people. It is also the \nthoughts entert=\r\nained by the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think &quot;how \nI wish I had =\r\nsuch a car&quot;. Any action or thought that has some force behind \nit becomes a=\r\n karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya balance \nis suffici=\r\nent in a future life, Nature will give you such a car, whether or \nnot you =\r\nwant it in that life! You may not know why you got it, but you got \nit beca=\r\nuse you asked for it earlier.\n\nNature is like a bank which keeps track of y=\r\nour wish list and your debt \nlist. It automatically withdraws from your kar=\r\nma account to pay back your \ndebts and it automatically withdraws from your=\r\n karma account to pay for \nthings on your wish list.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasim=\r\nha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan n=\r\nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n=\r\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com=\r\n&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:36 AM=\r\n\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n\nNamaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,=\r\n\n\nI wish to add or say Echo the same thing in different words.\n\nPlease Cons=\r\nider this -\n\nA Cheats B (Say for the instance that Cycle started now)\nNext =\r\ntime B gets the oppotunity and strong desire to cheat A and B does it \nwith=\r\n sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.\nNow if A accepts it calmly and natura=\r\nlly without any sadness and without any \nemotions of hatred towards B -Now =\r\nthen i feel that A is out of the \nperticular cycle but what about B.

Nature has cr=\r\neated \n&gt; a\n&gt; situation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature ha=\r\ns placed \n&gt; that\n&gt; person in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted hi=\r\nm to do so.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he ha=\r\ns used the\n&gt; opportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he =\r\nengages in \n&gt; the\n&gt; action while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing i=\r\nt&quot;), he now gets a\n&gt; new karma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both are co=\r\nrrect. From his perspective, he is doing it with identification\n&gt; and he is=\r\n incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being paid\n&gt; back fo=\r\nr what you did before.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; In order to break out of this cycle, a=\r\nccept it when somebody does \n&gt; something\n&gt; to you. Do not hate the person o=\r\nr pity yourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it\n&gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think on=\r\nly about your current action (&quot;what is the\n&gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;)=\r\n and do NOT think about what happened, why \n&gt; it\n&gt; happened, who did it and=\r\n how things happening to you are unfair.\n&gt;\n&gt; The tricky thing is when Natur=\r\ne places you in a position to pay back\n&gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma and crea=\r\ntes a strong temptation for you to do \n&gt; so.\n&gt; You may feel a sudden urge f=\r\nrom inside to do a bad thing to someone! But\n&gt; remember one thing. Any thou=\r\nght or action with a sense of doership (&quot;I am\n&gt; doing&quot;) will create a new k=\r\narma, even if the other person brought it on\n&gt; himself with a previous acti=\r\non.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and \n&gt; s=\r\nurrendering\n&gt; the action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. =\r\nBut that is\n&gt; very very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, =\r\nyou can also\n&gt; postpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i=\r\n.e. avoid the\n&gt; temptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As=\r\n long as we \n&gt; live\n&gt; in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But =\r\ngood discretion,\n&gt; self-control and strong will power will enable one to po=\r\nstpone the most\n&gt; troublesome karmas to a later time.\n&gt;\n&gt; When the reaction=\r\ns to your previous karmas are paid back and through who \n&gt; is\n&gt; not in YOUR=\r\n control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So \n&gt; you\n&gt; can =\r\ndo nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large\n&gt; ex=\r\ntent under your control.

Does h=\r\ne live in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the greater Boston area too?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Karma=\r\n and karmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; being pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you karmically push a=\r\nn object with some force and that object \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pushes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you back karmica=\r\nlly with the same force at a later point of time, it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not necessary =\r\nthat you resist it and apply some more force to push \n&gt; &gt;&gt; again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You =\r\npushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get it=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Even a person of a h=\r\nigh level of mental equanimity and stability does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each li=\r\nving person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him to a body and a=\r\nn identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this, who knows so =\r\nand so things, who does so and so things, who wants \n&gt; &gt;&gt; so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and so th=\r\nings, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini an=\r\nd Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). \n&gt; &gt;&gt; If\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the=\r\n binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fro=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body.=\r\n So\n&gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt;&gt; gets\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one b=\r\nody and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and environment. N=\r\nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addres=\r\nsed to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new apartment when you change addres=\r\ns, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life actions to=\r\n the sense of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is embodie=\r\nd and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will\n&gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver the react=\r\nions to various previous actions from that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an =\r\naccident, getting an Oscar award, losing an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; election, being criticized=\r\n by thousand people, being hit by wife, being\n&gt; &gt;&gt; abused by husband, being=\r\n killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend\n&gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc are examples o=\r\nf reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is b=\r\nound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reactions to previous =\r\nactions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; previous good=\r\n karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; excited or ela=\r\nted. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; good\n&gt; &gt;&gt; karm=\r\na is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one \n&gt; &gt;&gt; feels\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; should\n&gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature =\r\nto one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; bad\n&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoin=\r\nts him. You cheated\n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that that person=\r\n cheats you now. How\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relevant as far as t=\r\nhe old action-reaction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, =\r\nequal-minded and calm \n&gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happeni=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt;&gt; now,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a pers=\r\non in a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; previous\n&gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person t=\r\no cheat you now. His\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own act=\r\nion (but if he does it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it be=\r\ncomes a new karma for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to yo=\r\nu). If you just face it calmly and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish =\r\noff your karmic debt. Instead, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; suppose\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop=\r\n the person from cheating you. Then your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; current\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actions would b=\r\necome a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction\n&gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you=\r\n want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have to beh=\r\nave like the person you described below.

Her head was crashed into a pulp right before his =\r\neyes. He very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the hospital and too=\r\nk care of all \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the famil=\r\ny. His wife was a very spiritual \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right =\r\nbefore the accident, his wife told him of her\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditati=\r\non experience and that she would probably be leaving her body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. =\r\nher husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerfu=\r\nl frame of mind even during the funeral process. Some folks \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; felt\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a st=\r\nable \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spiritu=\r\nal and mental bond and they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I =\r\nhave the utmost reverance towards him and also in awe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his =\r\nspiritual level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Own a websit=\r\ne.Get an unlimited package.Pay next to nothing.*Go to http://in.business.ya=\r\nhoo.com/\r\n--0-1533088025-1240897669=:58784\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Narasimhaji&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I think I understood the mistake I was making in my understanding =\r\non how karma works.

A will get =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;similar opportunity later (possibly in another life). At that time, h=\r\ne can &lt;BR&gt;either do the bad thing to B or resist the temptation again and p=\r\nostpone &lt;BR&gt;further. If A becomes a jeevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is li=\r\nberated while &lt;BR&gt;living and engaging in actions without any sense of I-nes=\r\ns, then he can pay &lt;BR&gt;back the bad thing without incurring further karmas.=\r\n If A got moksha and got &lt;BR&gt;out of the game, then A is fine but B still ha=\r\ns that karma pending. Nature &lt;BR&gt;will find a stubstitute to pay back this k=\r\narma to B. That person will get an &lt;BR&gt;opportunity to do the bad thing to B=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I say paying back, please note that the action and reaction a=\r\nre not &lt;BR&gt;necessarily identical, but they are compatible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now, answ=\r\ner to Utpal: A is out of cycle as he\n accepted what happened and B &lt;BR&gt;has =\r\na bad karma. Either A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back that &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;bad karma to B later. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;opportunity later to pay back, he is back in the cycle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You do some=\r\nthing to someone. They pay you back. The cycle is done. If they &lt;BR&gt;identif=\r\nied with the action of payback, it becomes new karma for them. You &lt;BR&gt;will=\r\n again get a chance to pay back them again. If you do (and identify with &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;the action), you are back in the cycle. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is quite com=\r\nplex. But the key to getting out of the cycle is: accepting &lt;BR&gt;what happen=\r\ns to you, being good to others and overcoming ego and the sense &lt;BR&gt;of &quot;I a=\r\nm doing&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karma is not just good and bad things we do t=\r\no people. It is also the &lt;BR&gt;thoughts entertained by the mind. Suppose you =\r\nsee a nice car and think &quot;how &lt;BR&gt;I wish I had such a car&quot;. Any action or t=\r\nhought that has some force\n behind &lt;BR&gt;it becomes a karma and gets a reacti=\r\non from Nature. When your punya balance &lt;BR&gt;is sufficient in a future life,=\r\n Nature will give you such a car, whether or &lt;BR&gt;not you want it in that li=\r\nfe! You may not know why you got it, but you got &lt;BR&gt;it because you asked f=\r\nor it earlier.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish =\r\nlist and your debt &lt;BR&gt;list. It automatically withdraws from your karma acc=\r\nount to pay back your &lt;BR&gt;debts and it automatically withdraws from your ka=\r\nrma account to pay for &lt;BR&gt;things on your wish list.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality:\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. h=\r\nome.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan n=\r\nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;&lt;A h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic_pathak%40yahoo.c=\r\nom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_pathak%40yahoo.c=\r\nom&quot;&gt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.ma=\r\nil.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;\n target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:36 AM&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Namaste Narasimha &amp; =\r\nRajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I wish to add or say Echo the same thing in different word=\r\ns.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please Consider this -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A Cheats B (Say for the instance th=\r\nat Cycle started now)&lt;BR&gt;Next time B gets the oppotunity and strong desire =\r\nto cheat A and B does it &lt;BR&gt;with sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.&lt;BR&gt;N=\r\now if A accepts it calmly and naturally without any sadness and without any=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;emotions of hatred towards B -Now then i feel that A is out of the &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;perticular cycle but what about B.

Nature has created &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; situation where it can be paid bac=\r\nk. In other words, Nature has placed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; person in a posi=\r\ntion to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do\n so.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Th=\r\nat person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; opp=\r\nortunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; action while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;),=\r\n he now gets a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; new karma. He will be paid back later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Both are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identificati=\r\non&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are =\r\nbeing paid&lt;BR&gt;&gt; back for what you did before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In order to break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody do=\r\nes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; something&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourse=\r\nlf. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think only abou=\r\nt your current action (&quot;what is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) =\r\nand do NOT think about what happened, why &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happened, who=\r\n did it and how things happening to you\n are unfair.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The tr=\r\nicky thing is when Nature places you in a position to pay back&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some=\r\nbody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong temptation for you to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; so.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad thing to s=\r\nomeone! But&lt;BR&gt;&gt; remember one thing. Any thought or action with a sense =\r\nof doership (&quot;I am&lt;BR&gt;&gt; doing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the oth=\r\ner person brought it on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; himself with a previous action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; surrendering&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the action to the Lord completely, you will not incu=\r\nr karma. But that is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; very very difficult - almost impossible for mo=\r\nst. Of course, you can also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; postpone the payback through the use of=\r\n your *will power*, i.e. avoid the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; temptation and not do the bad th=\r\ning to the other person. As long as we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; live&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a body, som=\r\ne karmas will need to be\n incurred. But good discretion,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; self-contr=\r\nol and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most&lt;BR&gt;&gt; troub=\r\nlesome karmas to a later time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When the reactions to your p=\r\nrevious karmas are paid back and through who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not in YOU=\r\nR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to=\r\n a large&lt;BR&gt;&gt; extent under your control.

Does he live in&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; the greater Boston area too?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Karma and karmaphala (action and r=\r\neaction) are like pushing something &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nbeing pushing back as a reaction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When yo=\r\nu karmically push an object with some force and that object &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; pushes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you back karmically with the same force at a lat=\r\ner point of time, it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not necessary that you resist it a=\r\nnd apply some more force to push &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nYou pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and wheth=\r\ner you resist or not has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old action=\r\n and reaction balance. IF you resist &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n apply some force\n NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; reaction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of =\r\nmental equanimity and stability does&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each liv=\r\ning person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him to a=\r\n body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wants =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husband of =\r\nPadmaja, who is the father of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who=\r\n is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one wi=\r\nll no longer remain in the body. So&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being mus=\r\nt have a\n limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gets&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body an=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and environm=\r\nent. Nature&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delive=\r\nrs all mail addressed to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new ap=\r\nartment when you change address, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ndelivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as=\r\n one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nntinue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions from that&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, lo=\r\nsing an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people, bei=\r\nng hit by wife, being&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a=\r\n\n brother, being cheated by a friend&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc are examples =\r\nof reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sense o=\r\nf I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessar=\r\ny that one should be happy or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not th=\r\nink that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feels&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated=\r\n, it is not necessary that one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; should&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fe=\r\nel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; bad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction di=\r\nsappoints him. You cheated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will\n arrange s=\r\nuch that that person cheats you now. How&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it=\r\n now is not relevant as far as the old action-reaction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; equ=\r\nation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; does&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting t=\r\no what is happening &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; now,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventi=\r\nng new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; previous=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat yo=\r\nu now. His&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own a=\r\nction (but if he does it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with the=\r\n action, it becomes a new karma for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your\n karmic debt. In=\r\nstead, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suppose&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop=\r\n the person from cheating you. Then your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; current&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its rea=\r\nction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incu=\r\nrring new ones, you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you des=\r\ncribed below. Accept whatever &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; comes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your=\r\n way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; relaxed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like=\r\n the right thing to do at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the moment, with as little self-=\r\nidentification (sense of &quot;I am doing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. A=\r\ns you become better at this, your instincts and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; judgment w=\r\nill guide you better and show you the right action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: T=\r\nhursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Karma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to be in a ne=\r\nutral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be =\r\naffected by what is percieved as misfortune?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road acciden=\r\nt a few&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago.

Right before the accident, =\r\nhis wife told him of her&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n meditation experience and that she would probably be leaving her body&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost=\r\n calm and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even during the fune=\r\nral process.
