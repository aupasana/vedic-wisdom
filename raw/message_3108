Do not trust him when he speaks on any=\r\nthing else. He does know his Koran well.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Look at t=\r\nhis logically.

If that perfected man could not have a directed communion with Allah e=\r\nver, and needed a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermediary,=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A why should any=C3=83=E2=80=9A other muslim ever have a dire=\r\nct connection with Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; There is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the=\r\n fire. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Actually as far as I know - I maybe wrong =\r\n- Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The entities which live by fire as p=\r\ner Islam are called the Jinns. They are another class who mostly dwell in t=\r\nhe smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry information from earth=\r\n to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use Jinns for diff=\r\nerent purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence to Hindu term=\r\ninologies for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do actually use=\r\n Jinns and work out so called miracles. Maybe they are something like spiri=\r\nts or beings of some astral plane. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; However, one w=\r\nho does Homa need for a=C3=83=E2=80=9A deity need not worry about these in =\r\nthe least. When a deity like Mahaganapati or Chandika in present, nothing e=\r\nlse will dare interfere.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; But the real reason why m=\r\nost muslims have an issue with fire is because in one Hadith it is mentione=\r\nd prophet Muhammed disliked fire because it reminded him of Hellfire. Fire =\r\nto them is a symbol of the final times where the sinners and the kufrs will=\r\n be thrown by Allah into a huge fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; sadly in the=\r\n view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in diffe=\r\nrent directions or actually they try to make it such that they never meet.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Hmm, I would beg to disagree. In my reading of Isl=\r\nam, Zakir Naik is correct. As I said he only lies and use half truths when =\r\nit comes to other religion. For Islam he quotes correctly and wholesomely. =\r\nThe difference between Islam and non Islamic ideology - specially Hindus/Bu=\r\nddism/ Jainism etc is irreconcileable.=C3=83=E2=80=9A An explanation for th=\r\nis maybe digressing and long.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; But generally, if I =\r\nwere born in a muslim family, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths d=\r\nay in and day out and trust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muha=\r\nmmed as the perfected man, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I =\r\nwould consider Zakir Naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so funda=\r\nmental that unless one is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, th=\r\nere cannot be a reconciliation.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; Remember, Aurnagze=\r\nb started memorizing the koran for 9 years.

Whenever i visit their home, his wife sees to it that=\r\n there is no Non veg food brought in his home.\n&gt; &gt; He&#39;ll offer his Namaz ri=\r\ntual at my home. so Homam and Namaz will go parallelly. This parallel of di=\r\nfferent rituals has a meeting point in both of our hearts. sadly in the vie=\r\nw of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart in different=\r\n directions or actually they try to make it such that they never meet.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpa=\r\nl,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are asking specifically about Bulle =\r\nShah, he was a Sufi saint of the 15th Century in area of modern Pakisthan. =\r\nAs you can well understand from his poetry, his realization was quite diffe=\r\nrent from traditional Islamic learning. Bulle Shah was quite disliked by mu=\r\nslims of his time. He was a pacifist and a true saint.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C3=83=E2=80=9A to be a br=\r\nanch of Islam. My personal view is different. In most of the poetry I have =\r\nread of famous Sufi sants like Jal=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=AF=C2=BF=C2=BDl ad-D=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82=C2=ABn Mu=C3=83=C2=A1=C3=82=C2=B8=C3=82=C2=A5ammad Ba=\r\nlkh=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82=C2=AB Rumi convince me that their personal realiza=\r\ntion was quite different from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of the Su=\r\nfi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of these ar=\r\neas, specially Persia, after it was over run by Islam, in order to protect =\r\ntheir philosophy garbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise =\r\nthey would have faced sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self preserv=\r\nation which in turn, over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more=\r\n sublime path - IMHO -=C3=83=E2=80=9A than that which comes from the Ahadit=\r\nhs and the Koran proper.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example Rumi talk=\r\ns a about something similar to=C3=83=E2=80=9A reincarnation in some of his =\r\npoems while the following one does talk about communion with God:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I searched for God among the Christians and on the Cros=\r\ns and therein I found Him not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I went into the ancient temples of ido=\r\nlatry; no trace of Him was there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira=\r\n and then went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With set purpos=\r\ne I fared to the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habi=\r\ntation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and=\r\n young; God was not there even.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired abou=\r\nt him from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I fared then =\r\nto the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation on=\r\nly a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there even in tha=\r\nt exalted court.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart and there I saw =\r\nHim; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Communion with God i=\r\ns an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is always sepera=\r\nte from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in later verses =\r\nRumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation is that all tha=\r\nt was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The person who changed the life of Rum=\r\ni was also another Sufi called=C3=83=E2=80=9A Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda =\r\nmentions a popular legend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild r=\r\naise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demon=\r\nstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!=\r\n&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Fin=\r\nally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate t=\r\nhe Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for h=\r\nelp other than Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for=\r\n proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means I am the Truth. This statement =\r\nis also considered Kufr as per traditional Islam. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in Ind=\r\nia. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaji to worship lord Shiva f=\r\nor a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally, e=\r\nxcept for the famous=C3=83=E2=80=9A Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep=\r\n respect for most Sufis saint. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though Sufis a=\r\nlways showed a different more subjective interpretation of Koran, however t=\r\nhe genuine Muslim scholars were never fooled. Most of them considered Sufis=\r\n to be non Islamic. Even today. And I do not blame them. An honest reading =\r\nof the Koran and the hadiths with tell you in no uncertain terms that the p=\r\nhilosophy of Vedanta or any sort of God communion is unacceptable to Islam.=\r\n I won&#39;t digress into my views of what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely =\r\ncalled unIslamic if a true, traditional and authentic version of Islam is t=\r\no be followed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famou=\r\ns in modern day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual higher middl=\r\ne class.

Wajid Ali Shah - the nawab of =\r\nOudh was one such person. Vimalananda says he was a Kinnara who had incarna=\r\nted on this plane. Quite possible.

Islam considers Muhammed to be Insan-e-Kamil, the perfected man. If tha=\r\nt perfected man could not have a directed communion with Allah ever, and ne=\r\neded a Gibril (Gabriel is Gibril in Arabic) as in intermediary,=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A why should any=C3=83=E2=80=9A other muslim ever have a direct connectio=\r\nn with Allah? Therefore Islam forbids this idea.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is one idea in Islam that *Shayatan* was created from the fire=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually as far as I know - I maybe wro=\r\nng - Shaitan was an Angel, fallen by ego. The entities which live by fire a=\r\ns per Islam are called the Jinns. They are another class who mostly dwell i=\r\nn the smoke that comes from fire. They supposedly carry information from ea=\r\nrth to the heavens and use fire as a tool for the same.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Often muslim tantriks and Islamic occult practitioner use J=\r\ninns for different purposes. I don&#39;t know what is the exact correspondence =\r\nto Hindu terminologies for the entity called Jinn, but I know people who do=\r\n actually use Jinns and work out so called miracles. Maybe they are somethi=\r\nng like spirits or beings of some astral plane. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, one who does Homa need for a=C3=83=E2=80=9A deity need not =\r\nworry about these in the least.

In my reading of Islam, Zakir Naik is correct. As =\r\nI said he only lies and use half truths when it comes to other religion. Fo=\r\nr Islam he quotes correctly and wholesomely. The difference between Islam a=\r\nnd non Islamic ideology - specially Hindus/Buddism/ Jainism etc is irreconc=\r\nileable.=C3=83=E2=80=9A An explanation for this maybe digressing and long.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But generally, if I were born in a muslim =\r\nfamily, and were made to read teh Koran and Hadiths day in and day out and =\r\ntrust the Koran as the perfected word of God and Muhammed as the perfected =\r\nman, one whose whole life was teh Koran in motion, I would consider Zakir N=\r\naik to be 100 % correct. The differences are so fundamental that unless one=\r\n is ready to whitewash and ignore a LOT of things, there cannot be a reconc=\r\niliation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Remember, Aurnagzeb started memo=\r\nrizing the koran for 9 years.

As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in pre Islamic Persian=\r\n and India. The mystics of these areas, specially Persia, after it was over=\r\n run by Islam, in order to protect their philosophy garbed it with Islamic =\r\nterminologies and names. Otherwise they would have faced sure shot slaughte=\r\nr. That was a means of self preservation which in turn, over years, helped =\r\na lot of muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO -=C3=83=E2=80=9A th=\r\nan that which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example Rumi talks a about something similar to=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A reincarnation in some of his poems while the following one =\r\ndoes talk about communion with God:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nsearched for God among the Christians and on the Cross and therein I found =\r\nHim not.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I went into the ancient temples of idolatry; no trace of=\r\n Him was there.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then went=\r\n as far as Qandhar but God I found not.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; With set purpose I fared =\r\nto the summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young=\r\n; God was not there even.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired about =\r\nhim from ibn Sina but found Him not within his range.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I fared the=\r\nn to the scene of the Prophet&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation =\r\nonly a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; distance from him&quot; but God was not there even in t=\r\nhat exalted court.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, I looked into my own heart and there =\r\nI saw Him; He was nowhere else.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Commun=\r\nion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed. The creator is=\r\n always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is Kufr. Though in=\r\n later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my interpretation i=\r\ns that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Islamic garb. &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The person wh=\r\no changed the life of Rumi was also another Sufi called=C3=83=E2=80=9A Sham=\r\ns-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a popular legend which says Shams was so =\r\npowerful that he couild raise the dead. One day the mullas caught up with h=\r\nim and asked him to demonstrate. Shams went to a dead body and said, &quot;In th=\r\ne name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothing happened. He tried a few times and =\r\nyet nothing happened. Finally he said, &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead =\r\nbody woke up. Immediate the Mulla caught him for doing Kufr - ideally you c=\r\nannot invoke anyone for help other than Allah as per true Islam - and execu=\r\nted him.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same was with case with Mansu=\r\nr-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which literally means=\r\n I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per traditional =\r\nIslam. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another =\r\ngreat Sufi who introduced Qwaalis in India.

An honest reading of the Koran and t=\r\nhe hadiths with tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedan=\r\nta or any sort of God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress i=\r\nnto my views of what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic i=\r\nf a true, traditional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in moder=\r\nn day cities where we find the fashionably spiritual higher middle class.
