This is one of the reasons why Veda Adhyayanam was also not prescribed for ladies, since Veda Adhyayanam is to be started only after Upanayanam. During periods ladies need perfect rest. They should not be asked do domestic chores, what to talk of Pooja etc.? This was being strictly observed in all Brahmin families upto probably the early1900s. Now-a-days, people have scant regard for such observances. Not only that. They also laugh at ladies (Rajaswalas)observing the routine prescribed during periods. There could be genuine and  practical difficulties in observing what used to be known as Upahati  or &#39;thooram&quot;. It is considered as another form of untouchability by the younger generation.\nG. Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n   \n__________________________________________________\nDo You Yahoo!?\nTired of spam?
