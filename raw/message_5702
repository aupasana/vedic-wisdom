As per his statement He must have been=\r\n born somewhere and may be he is working somewhere for welfare of mankind. =\r\nMost probably in a different way he did in his previous birth.\n\nObviously h=\r\ne will never claim that he is reincarnation of Ramakrishna Paramhansa. Peop=\r\nle like me may never be able to know about who is reincarnation of Ramakris=\r\nhna and we can just make &quot;wild guesses&quot;. \n\nMay be, we soon start seeing him=\r\n on News channels or may be we already have started doing so. As current ti=\r\nme is of IT and information spread like fire now a days. Any marvelous work=\r\n he may be doing, or he will do, will surely make waves.\n\nWe all will like =\r\nto know about your personal opinion about this. What do you think that he h=\r\nas taken birth or have yet to take birth?\n\nI usually think that may be Mani=\r\nsh Ji, and you can be part of his Group. Well, for a stupid person like me,=\r\n It is another &#39;wild Guess&#39;  :)\n\nKind Regards\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; It is int=\r\neresting that Ramakrishna and Vivekananda both gave statements \n&gt; on coming=\r\n back. Perhaps as a result, there have been 3-4 cases of yogis \n&gt; who claim=\r\ned to be Ramakrishna&#39;s re-incarnation. All of them who made \n&gt; those claims=\r\n were good yogis themselves, but they did not seem to be \n&gt; surrounded by y=\r\nogis of the caliber of Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples such as \n&gt; Vivekananda, Brah=\r\nmananda, Yogananda, Shivananda etc. After all, \n&gt; Ramakrishna said that eve=\r\nrybody who was with him was to come back in 100 \n&gt; years.\n&gt; \n&gt; The fact tha=\r\nt multiple yogis made this claim seems to suggest that even \n&gt; a highly evo=\r\nlved yogi&#39;s mind can imagine things based on conditioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Ramakr=\r\nishna really comes back, he will probably not make any claims \n&gt; of being a=\r\n reincarnation and just do something marvelous on earth aided \n&gt; by others =\r\nwho will come with him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, there are many yogis on earth who a=\r\nre not Ramakrishna&#39;s \n&gt; reincarnations and yet do great deeds and show the =\r\nright path to scores \n&gt; of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ri=\r\ntual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; =\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On=\r\n Mon, Jan 24, 2011 at 8:35 PM, avmport wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hello everyone,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I would like to share some information with you about the reincarnation \n&gt;=\r\n of Sri Ramakrishna in the West.\n&gt; Sixteen years ago, We had the opportunit=\r\ny to meet him, and our lives \n&gt; have been blessed in many ways, and I serve=\r\n him until this day.\n&gt; Those who are true devotees and are willing to know =\r\nmore about his \n&gt; incarnation, please let me know, so that I can send more =\r\ninformation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Andre\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/in=\r\nfo/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
