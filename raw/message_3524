We tell him that he should go to so and so institution (e.g. IIT,=\r\n IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or getting 90% score =\r\nin exams is NOT the goal of education. The goal of education is to understa=\r\nnd the subject well and have a good career. It is possible to get 90% score=\r\n without understanding well and it is possible to go to IIT and not underst=\r\nand the subject well.\n\nSimilarly, the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get b=\r\netter control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as much as possible =\r\nand become liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so rituals, follow s=\r\no and so procedures/formulas, go to so and so temple etc.\n\nSome formulas we=\r\nre created so that there is some structure to sadhana. But there is nothing=\r\n absolute about those formulas.\n\nYes, if your gurus told you the formula of=\r\n n times japam, n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to f=\r\nollow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people believe that such a proc=\r\nedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in a mantra.\n\nHowever, please note that there are many=\r\n people who did purascharanas using such formulas and did not really get an=\r\ny &quot;siddhi&quot; in the mantra. On the other hand, there are people who did not s=\r\ntick to those formulas and yet found god through the mantra.\n\nIn my opinion=\r\n, you can do just japam with a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count h=\r\nomam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in ho=\r\nmam without any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice and do it until your =\r\nmind is so absorbed in it that your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consci=\r\nously when it is free (like some people hum catchy songs when they are free=\r\n).\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegarding the astrological formulas for evaluating th=\r\ne impact of a mantra, I would like disown those concepts originally taught =\r\nby Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my astrology classes. There are many =\r\ntechnicalities, but many many corruptions in the way knowledge is preserved=\r\n. Most rules and technicalities of mantra shashtra apply to people who do p=\r\nrayogas to get specific material results (and naturally those rules have be=\r\nen intentionally corrupted by Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).\n\nBo=\r\nttomline is that a mantra done for spiritual progress works based on your m=\r\nental visualization of the mantra and its deity and the latent forces of co=\r\nnditioning in your mind. All the house calculations based on the numbers of=\r\n letters and number of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like G=\r\nayatri mantra can be done by anyone without worrying about technicalities.\n=\r\n\nRegarding adding &quot;Om&quot; or &quot;Om Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om bhuvah om su=\r\nvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there are many standard approaches. I suggest using wh=\r\nat you were taught by your gurus and not worrying too much about it.\n\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nUtpal asked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people=\r\n to speed things up. In my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set=\r\n a time limit (e.g. one hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irr=\r\nespective of the count.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sh=\r\nort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re=\r\n: Repost:Manishji&#39;s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com\nDate: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 11:47 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  =\r\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Narasimhagaru, \n=C2=A0\nThank you for such a nic=\r\ne explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I could see signific=\r\nant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam=\r\n in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmacharya then (in future=\r\n I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did was it was one a la=\r\nkh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of two months and then=\r\n I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I =\r\nhave called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we al=\r\nl did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaj=\r\ni instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasr=\r\namsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number o=\r\nf brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to=\r\n finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thought the big japams =\r\nmust be done. Can you shed more light on\n this? \n=C2=A0\nAlso, Gayatri mantr=\r\na is a 24 syllable mantra starting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahrit=\r\nis are added it becomes a 30 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). =\r\nHow should this be practised? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, wher=\r\neas the 24 strengthens the 12th house, according to your explanation? Sorry=\r\n for digressing into astrology ! (but they are tightly integrated here and =\r\ncould not avoid this question). Please tell me if my interpretation is righ=\r\nt and also please tell me which approach is better. \n=C2=A0\nNagraj\n\n--- On =\r\nWed, 1/20/10, Narasimha P.V.R.

Then possibly =\r\ngive a break for a few days and do for another 100 days. Like that, do for =\r\n3 stretches of 100 days each.\n\nOf course, if needs no break, one can do 300=\r\n days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult=\r\n for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.\n\nFor success in any=\r\n sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint from sex and control of=\r\n anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying en=\r\nergy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.\n\nE=\r\nvery factor contributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition=\r\n of growing beard exists in many religions and it is not without a reason. =\r\nWe discussed this sometime back.\n\nIf one is living a lifestyle where one av=\r\noids\n contact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a rem=\r\note monastery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living =\r\na lifestyle where one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (=\r\ne.g. living in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can =\r\nbe very useful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the =\r\ncomplete solution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on th=\r\ne side of a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hil=\r\nl at night but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarl=\r\ny a beard can help a person with decent control over the mind to retain con=\r\ntrol in some tricky situations.\n\nTrimming beard is ok.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIf =\r\none indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) ev=\r\neryday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n \nwhile following the s=\r\nimple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the same direction=\r\n, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and =\r\nsitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the=\r\n other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the =\r\nbody is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chance th=\r\nat mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is still for even =\r\na moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still,=\r\n it will become still more often and for longer times. Then various kinds o=\r\nf samadhis become possible.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a diffe=\r\nrence: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Ko=\r\nta &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n=\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana proc=\r\nedure\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Wednesday, January 20, 2010,=\r\n 8:40 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a great mail and very inspiring.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personali=\r\nty sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata)=\r\n .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commandin=\r\ng a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it tha=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt;=\r\n\n &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; id=\r\nentification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; continue=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to me which is =\r\nblack magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a h=\r\nigher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, th=\r\nen your power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). =\r\nAfter the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deit=\r\ny or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm res=\r\nerved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bea=\r\nring of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people may reali=\r\nse this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the=\r\n city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may=\r\n even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and react=\r\nion.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of =\r\nthis from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later.=\r\n But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and ha=\r\ns very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because y=\r\nour attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or =\r\nthe universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a smal=\r\nl Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used,=\r\n moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of ide=\r\nntification with\n&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are gene=\r\nrally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits=\r\n\n which they have\n&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable expe=\r\nrience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes=\r\n, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a s=\r\nadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his prev=\r\nious\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in =\r\nthis lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are c=\r\nrucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to me the pr=\r\noof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; rei=\r\ntitions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; Same\n place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little mo=\r\nvement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbody), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you st=\r\nart, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue thi=\r\ns for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the difference =\r\nin your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is importan=\r\nt is that life may be short, so do some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that =\r\nsadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifie=\r\ns some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love=\r\n and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n clarificati=\r\non from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has =\r\na personality.

We tell him that he should go=\r\n to so and so institution (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know tha=\r\nt going to IIT or getting 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of education. =\r\nThe goal of education is to understand the subject well and have a good car=\r\neer. It is possible to get 90% score without understanding well and it is p=\r\nossible to go to IIT and not understand the subject well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly,=\r\n the goal of spiritual sadhana is to get better control over mind, overcome=\r\n the internal enemies as much as possible and become liberated. But, we tel=\r\nl people to do so and so rituals, follow so and so procedures/formulas, go =\r\nto so and so temple etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some formulas were created so that there is=\r\n some structure to sadhana. But there is nothing absolute about those\n form=\r\nulas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, if your gurus told you the formula of n times japam, n/10=\r\n times homam, n/100 times tarpana etc and you want to follow it, please do =\r\nso. No harm in it. Some people believe that such a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot;=\r\n in a mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, please note that there are many people who di=\r\nd purascharanas using such formulas and did not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in =\r\nthe mantra. On the other hand, there are people who did not stick to those =\r\nformulas and yet found god through the mantra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In my opinion, you ca=\r\nn do just japam with a mantra without worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/=\r\n100th count tarpana etc. Or you can also do a mantra entirely in homam with=\r\nout any japam or tarpana. Choose one practice and do it until your mind is =\r\nso absorbed in it that your mind is chanting that mantra sub-consciously wh=\r\nen it is free (like some people hum catchy songs when they are free).&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the astrological formulas for evaluating=\r\n the impact of a mantra, I would like disown those concepts originally taug=\r\nht by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me in my astrology classes. There are ma=\r\nny technicalities, but many many corruptions in the way knowledge is preser=\r\nved. Most rules and technicalities of mantra shashtra apply to people who d=\r\no prayogas to get specific material results (and naturally those rules have=\r\n been intentionally corrupted by Nature in preparation of deepening Kali).&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bottomline is that a mantra done for spiritual progress works based =\r\non your mental visualization of the mantra and its deity and the latent for=\r\nces of conditioning in your mind. All the house calculations based on the n=\r\numbers of letters and number of words are irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mant=\r\nra like Gayatri mantra can be done by anyone without worrying about technic=\r\nalities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding adding &quot;Om&quot;\n or &quot;Om Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh=\r\n om bhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there are many standard approaches. I =\r\nsuggest using what you were taught by your gurus and not worrying too much =\r\nabout it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal asked about count vs time. Cou=\r\nnts sometimes force people to speed things up. In my humble opinion, it is =\r\nfine or even better to set a time limit (e.g. one hour, two hours etc) and =\r\ndo japam for that time irrespective of the count.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;N=\r\narasimha&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a\n difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWrit=\r\nings&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;i&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;&lt;=\r\n/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 2=\r\n55); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Repost:Manishji&#39;s savitur =\r\ngayatri sadhana procedure&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wedn=\r\nesday, January 20, 2010, 11:47 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1620719101&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n  =\r\n    \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-v=\r\nariant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inh=\r\nerit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; -x-system-font: non=\r\ne;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Narasimhagaru, &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thank =\r\nyou for such a nice explanation. Even with not maintaining Brahmacharya, I =\r\ncould see significant progress in terms of my control of temper etc. when I=\r\n did Gayatri Japam in the past. Did not know the significance of Brahmachar=\r\nya then (in future I will practise with Brahmacharya) . But the way I did w=\r\nas it was one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 times) for a period of t=\r\nwo months and then I did a homam to complete the dasamsa in homam. For the =\r\nhomam, however, I have called about 10 people (Grihastas / Brahmacharis alt=\r\nogether) and we all did chant the mantra while I performed the homam. This =\r\nis how our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a Dasamsa homam, satamsa fo=\r\nr tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally dasamsa of shasramsa for fe=\r\neding the number of brahmins (so basically, for a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmi=\r\nns must be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharana) . This is how I thoug=\r\nht the big japams must be done. Can you shed more light on\n this? &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Also, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra starting =\r\nwith tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 letter=\r\n mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah&nbsp;). How should this be practised? 30, I=\r\n suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th hou=\r\nse, according to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology !

Then possibly give a break for a few days and d=\r\no for another 100 days. Like that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Of course, if needs no break, one can do 300 days in a row too. But, ke=\r\neping brahmacharya (abstinence) may be difficult for some people and hence =\r\nthe suggestion of the break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For success in any sadhana, brahmachary=\r\na is very important. Restraint from sex and control of anger and short-temp=\r\ner will help one avoid leakage of shakti (purifying energy). Everytime one =\r\nexperiences lust, anger etc, one loses some shakti.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every factor con=\r\ntributes a little to success. Beard is useful. The tradition of growing bea=\r\nrd exists in many religions and it is not without a reason. We discussed th=\r\nis sometime back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one is living a lifestyle where one avoids\n con=\r\ntact with any tempting situations altogether (e.g. living in a remote monas=\r\ntery), beard may or may not add much value. But, if one is living a lifesty=\r\nle where one comes in contact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. livi=\r\nng in the modern world with a family and job and a TV), beard can be very u=\r\nseful. As I said earlier when we discussed this, beard is not the complete =\r\nsolution but a small part of the solution. Just as a railing on the side of=\r\n a hill road may stop a slowly moving car from sliding off the hill at nigh=\r\nt but be unable to stop a fast moving car out of control, similarly a beard=\r\n can help a person with decent control over the mind to retain control in s=\r\nome tricky situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trimming beard is ok.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;If one indeed does 1000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of =\r\nhours) everyday for one year while maintaining brahmacharya,\n &lt;br&gt;while fol=\r\nlowing the simple rules of same place, same time everyday and facing the sa=\r\nme direction, one will certainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one ke=\r\ny thing and sitting still with an erect back, neck and head with the eyes c=\r\nlosed is the other thing. The probability of mind becoming still is almost =\r\nzero if the body is not still. If the body can be kept very still, there is=\r\n a chance that mind will also become still for a moment. If the mind is sti=\r\nll for even a moment, it will cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to =\r\nbeing still, it will become still more often and for longer times. Then var=\r\nious kinds of samadhis become possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n-&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyotish=\r\nWri tings&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;i&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@ya=\r\nhoo. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid=\r\n rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subje=\r\nct: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure=\r\n&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010=\r\n, 8:40 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1423440994&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D=\r\n&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit;=\r\n font-stretch: inherit;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;This is a great mail and very=\r\n inspiring.

The deity&#39;s personality is crucial.

If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuch as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After th=\r\ne death&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the dei=\r\nty or if he was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate=\r\n realm reserved for these&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; beings.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such =\r\na sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of th=\r\ne attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment(&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this wi=\r\nth&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit li=\r\nke you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of th=\r\nis from that same Atma&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes=\r\n later. But if you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the=\r\n universe and has very few karmas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itse=\r\nlf attacks you, because your attack is not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but=\r\n on his identification, ie God or the universe).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If people per=\r\nsist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, t=\r\nhen there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification wi=\r\nth&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally=\r\n termed as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spi=\r\nrits\n which they have&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an e=\r\nnjoyable experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandi=\r\nka for a few lifetimes, then&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is d=\r\nrawn to that deity and such a sadhak&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few r=\r\nepitions of a mantra(because of his previous&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial a=\r\nnd may not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; According to=\r\n me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sugge=\r\nst an easy sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on so=\r\nme good day, do 1000&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call=\r\n this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every=\r\n day, main constraints&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same\n=\r\n place.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same materials.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direction.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; As little movement as one can.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi=\r\n as is your inclination.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mi=\r\nnd and the body, not just the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow =\r\na beard.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bow=\r\nels are empty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; before you start.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this for=\r\n 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; See the differe=\r\nnce in your personality before and after.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Long and short , wha=\r\nt is important is that life may be short, so do some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, =\r\nand persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; pos=\r\nsible.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were b=\r\neing discussed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; manish&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n clarificat=\r\nion from me if you feel&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe I=\r\nNTERNET now has a personality.
