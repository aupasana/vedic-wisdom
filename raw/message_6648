Just hear this intere=\r\nsting story and wake up from the long slumber of ignorance!\n\nEven some Euro=\r\npeans have understood the glory and freedom of sannyasa and have embraced s=\r\nannyasa. Mr. Nixon, M.A. (Oxon) who was a Professor in Lucknow University i=\r\ns now a sannyasi. He is Swami Krishna Premi. He is a scholar in Sanskrit an=\r\nd Hindi. He does kirtan. He dances in divine ecstasy. He is the author of f=\r\namous books such as Yoga of the Bhagavadgita, Yoga of the Katha Upanishad, =\r\netc. He gives impressive, forcible speeches in English and Hindi also. You =\r\nwill be stunned when you hear his lectures.\n\nMr. Alexander I.M.S., who was =\r\nin the Medical College, Lucknow, is a sannyasin. He stays in Uttara-Brindav=\r\nan along with Sri Krishna Premi.\n\nSri Swami Tapovanam, the lion of Vedanta,=\r\n a Brahmajnani,the author of several Sanskrit books, the crest-jewel and be=\r\nacon-light of the Himalayas, lived in Uttarakasi. Even the biggest officers=\r\n sat at his lotus feet to learn Vedanta. \n\n\n"}}
