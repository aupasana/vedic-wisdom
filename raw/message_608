This is an unbelievable experience th=\r\nat I\nhave had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly\n=\r\nas was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74.\nKindl=\r\ny read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was working a=\r\ns telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka.\nMy duty was from 7 am =\r\nto 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for\nextra duty. There was a Te=\r\nlephone exchange just opposite to Post\noffice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t=\r\n; I had friendship with some Telephone\noperators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, =\r\n(we will call him as Mr. Patel)\nwas working as Operator. He was a staunch d=\r\nevotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\nRamkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him =\r\nhe was always talking about\nshri Thakur. We came close day by day. There wa=\r\ns a weekly gathering at\nhis home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional=\r\n songs created by\nhim and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkris=\r\nhna\nKathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting\no=\r\nn Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\nthen. We w=\r\nere used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\nand were talking =\r\nonly about Thakur.\n&gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me-=\r\n-=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\nsome guest have come to my home and my wife is remembe=\r\nring me. My son\nwill come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go n=\r\now=E2=80=9D. --\nAnd with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. =\r\n\n&gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane crash\ntomo=\r\nrrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him.\nHe could =\r\nforesee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he\ntold me not to=\r\n go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\nwent to Bus station b=\r\nut bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured\non the way. This was surpr=\r\nising.\n&gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power=\r\n\nand this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\nshri Th=\r\nakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\nThakur and the d=\r\nay came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself\nto Thakur at Mr. Pat=\r\nel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him\ndeeply from my heart=\r\n to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \n&gt; Next day morning I h=\r\nad a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\nwhile taking the tea. As my du=\r\nty was to start from 7 am I was waking\nup at 5.45 morning. I told to my wif=\r\ne in the morning that I have\naccepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My =\r\nwife was annoyed and she\nargued with me a lot. =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should y=\r\nou take such a hasty decision?\nRamkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa K=\r\nali at Calcutta. He was a\ngreat Saint but our Guru should be living one, wh=\r\no can guide us, give\nus Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram=\r\n Sharma Acharya\nsince you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; Her argume=\r\nnts were right at her place as people in general not know\nmuch about Thakur=\r\n and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\nhasty decision. I was in =\r\nthe influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me =\r\nthat Thakur was telling\ntheir disciples to test him before accepting him. I=\r\n also decided to\ntest Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=\r\n=9CSee, Mr. Patel has\nnever come to our home. You have also not seen him. H=\r\ne has never asked\nme where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our =\r\nhouse within\n10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thak=\r\nur is\nperfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; She laughed at me=E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is poss=\r\nible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr=\r\n. Patel immediately to justify my\ndecision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I=\r\n want to test your existence even\ntoday.=E2=80=99\n&gt; To our great surprise, =\r\nMr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\nmorning with angry mood. What he t=\r\nold?\n&gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happen=\r\ned?\nYesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\nmor=\r\nnings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\npulled my =\r\nblanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He\nis=\r\n waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D\n&gt;=\r\n I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way to\nyour h=\r\nouse and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbing\nhim in such =\r\nan early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99\n&gt; We both were so excite=\r\nd and surprised that we had no words that\nMorning. \n&gt; I will never forget t=\r\nhat 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There\nwere some more Devine experi=\r\nences about Shri Thakur but I will write\nit sometime.\n&gt; Dear Sir, and forum=\r\n members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the\nearth. This is a fact I have =\r\nwritten and no word is added to\nexaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all=\r\n of us.\n&gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add more friends t=\r\no your messenger and enjoy!
