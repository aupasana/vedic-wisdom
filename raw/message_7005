Awesome chant to listen to, and seems to have lots of \n&gt; water\n&gt; references, yet is typically chanted at the conclusion of a \n&gt; yagna/homa, no?\n\nYou can refer to the following website to see the traditionally given \nmeaning:\n\nhttp://www.celextel.org/vedichymns/mantrapushpam.html\n\nFor example, a couple of verses are taken to mean:\n\n&quot;Fire is the source of water,\nHe who knows this,\nBecomes established in himself,\nWater is the source of fire,\nHe who knows this,\nBecomes established in himself.\nHe who knows the source of water,\nBecomes established in himself&quot;\n\nThen repeat the same by replacing fire with wind, burning Sun, Moon, \nstars, clouds, year etc.\n\nDoes it make any sense to you?\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe word &quot;Apas&quot; is used in the 4th line above (with long vowel &quot;A&quot;), \nwhile the word &quot;apas&quot; (with short vowel &quot;a&quot;) is used in other places. \nThis happens consistently in all verses. Though both are translated as \nwater by many people, my take is that they are different.\n\nThe word ap or apas means &quot;actions&quot; in addition to water. In fact, it is \nused in that meaning in many places in Veda. The word Apas means \ninspired or equanimous actions. According to some, it means riligious \nceremonies also, but note that a religious ceremony is supposed to be an \ninspired and balanced action.\n\nIn my view, apas above means action and Apas means an equanimous action, \ni.e. action where the doer is established in Self.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe physical, mental and spiritual realms are controlled by Fire, Wind \nand Sun gods. Fire, the transformer, creates the physical reality by \nprocessing the elements through the physical senses and transforming \nthem into physical experiences. Wind, the mover, creates the mental \nreality to by moving the notions and concepts in the mind. Sun, the \nshiner, shows the spiritual reality by throwing light on the divinity in \neverything. That is why we make aahutis to fire, wind and Sun in \nuttarangam of a homam.\n\nWhene Mantra pushpam refers to those three, it is saying that one who \nrealizes that actions arise in the physical, mental & spiritual realms \nof one&#39;s being, is established in Self. In other words, &quot;I&quot; am not doing \nactions, but actions arise in parts of my being, which are repsented by \nfire, wind and Sun. Next, it is saying that one who realizes that \nequanimous action arising in Self is the source of all these realms of \nbeing (physical, mental and spiritual), is established in Self.\n\nIn other words, equanimous actions arising in Self give rise to various \naspects of one&#39;s being. And actions arise in various aspects of one&#39;s \nbeing. One who realizes this and does not entertain notions that &quot;I am \ndoing, I did this ritual&quot; etc will be established in Self.\n\nThis the main purport.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
