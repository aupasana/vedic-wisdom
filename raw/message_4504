Archana and abhishekam performed by a priest at a temple are also included.\n \nIf you want to remove a small rock blocking the road, a small amount of energy may be sufficient. If a big boulder is blocking the road, one cannot push it away just like that. One has to keep exerting force and push it persistently. Similarly, small problems are easy to solve. But most people now-a-days are bogged down by serious kaarmic blockages that require a lot of effort to overcome.\n \nOf course, if a superman is available to you to help, he may push the boulder in a second. But there are hardly any supermen anymore.\n \nIn the old days, many priests existed who did intense sadhana, became enlightened and were like walking fire. Also, many temples existed, where such priests, great yogis and rishis did sadhana and left great energy. Thus, big kaarmik problems could also be solved with one pooja, one homam, one abhishekam, one visit to a temple etc.\n \nSuch priests and temples are quite rare today. Do not expect one pooja, one archana, one homam or one abhishekam to solve problems.\n \nHowever, little bit at a time adds up over time. If you keep doing sadhana (pooja, archana, homam, abhishekam etc) regularly, it will slowly add up.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Harish Mohanbabu &lt;harishm_26@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; || Jai Gurudev ||\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or any ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable material or spiritual benefit. \n&gt; I wanted to ask this for quite some time now.  When you say any ritual, do you also mean rituals like archana and abhishegams that are performed in temples?  \n&gt; Kindly clarify.\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; Harish\n&gt; \n&gt;       Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would still go to a priest for doing homam. Why ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of going through an online manual I get a live person with\n&gt; &gt; experience who can help me setup the homam the ingredients needed. Note\n&gt; &gt; that most priests these days let YOU participate in the homam and\n&gt; &gt; constantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It just makes it more\n&gt; &gt; convenient.\n&gt; \n&gt; The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or any ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable material or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most people have, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event cannot fix things.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ritual) everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one&#39;s favor over the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one&#39;s spiritual evolution.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one has access and is able to engage a priest everyday or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; One point I want to make is that priests may have fallen just like rest\n&gt; &gt; of us , but they are also human living in the same world or rather same\n&gt; &gt; Yuga as we are! I feel a priest with reasonable desires of taking care\n&gt; &gt; of his daily needs and his family need not be shunned although he is\n&gt; &gt; doing rituals for the sake of money/tips/gifts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Absolutely. We should have nothing against them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no ability to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like many priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying of their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disappointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do something about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Jyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a different ball game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone and giving a boost to one&#39;s material and spiritual pursuits (using one&#39;s own spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well. These days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockages and how can they take care of others?\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I apologize if I offended you. I&#39;m a nobody compared to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; No offense taken. Whose caliber is what and whose potential is what, only god knows!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
