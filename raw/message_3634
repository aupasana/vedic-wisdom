He=\r\n never removed the dress and kept the dress on him all the time and never c=\r\nonsidered the possibility of changing into a different dress. The idea of r=\r\nemoving that dress was unbearable to that person.

A person looking extremely scary came up to the person one=\r\nday to remove the dress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated wit=\r\nh him and tore it apart violently if one fought back. After this scary pers=\r\non removed the old dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some pe=\r\nople became so afraid and ashamed when they lost old clothes that they ran =\r\naway and roamed around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, the=\r\ny would&#39;ve soon gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; The clothes in this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy.=\r\n The person looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Deat=\r\nh. Creator is the person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next bir=\r\nth is the new clothes. Persons running away in fear or shame before new clo=\r\nthese are given are like different kinds of spirits.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Regarding your visualization of your father using reiki, please note th=\r\nat all visualizations of the mind are imagery created by one&#39;s conscious an=\r\nd sub-conscious conditionining.

Also, there is no reliable way to know if your prayers made any dif=\r\nference to the path taken by your father after the cremation.

And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much aw=\r\ne and interest. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peace=\r\nfully (after struggling with renal failure and other complications) at our =\r\nhome in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bho=\r\nomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes=\r\n(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience =\r\nof doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I s=\r\ntarted wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi a=\r\nt Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam o=\r\nn my dad&#39;s funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as per the no=\r\nte). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar hom=\r\nam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even =\r\nthink that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan =\r\nbhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body.=\r\n..especially\n&gt;  in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;=\r\nwatched&#39; the sensations as equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;e=\r\nven this would change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is a=\r\nll at the level of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of =\r\nChandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible el=\r\nement to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame see=\r\nds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at=\r\n my request) - and he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10=\r\n minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first ti=\r\nme that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;d=\r\nelicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldes=\r\nt brother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in the directi=\r\non opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and sat down o=\r\nn a stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on=\r\n either side, told them that I would like to meditate, and requested them t=\r\no let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already observed a brown colore=\r\nd dog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached t=\r\nhe funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to behave a l=\r\nittle differently (silly me!!):). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mo=\r\nther Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeke=\r\nd their support and blessings in my very first attempt in doing such a ritu=\r\nal. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on breath, and I sa=\r\nw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my breath for few mi=\r\nnutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warning that this sh=\r\nould be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gaining spiritual p=\r\nrogress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be different. I had =\r\na deep desire that my father accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey i=\r\nn the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further and felt th=\r\nat there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about attempting such a =\r\nunconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered =\r\nmyself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mund=\r\nane desires. Everytime I have done\n&gt;  homam in the past, I have asked you t=\r\no purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe that it won&#39;t b=\r\ne good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karmas, if I conti=\r\nnue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I ask you to puri=\r\nfy my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane desire tha=\r\nt his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peaceful. I am sin=\r\ncere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurities and my ig=\r\nnorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yours if he is =\r\ndoing something wrong&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After this mental dialogue, I though of=\r\n invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Maa Kali/S=\r\nmashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little=\r\n comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are forms of o=\r\nne and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which Devi for=\r\nm I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and instead saw a=\r\n cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my mental imager=\r\ny. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with the colou=\r\nr of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was different=\r\n, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colour with =\r\nthe colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be f=\r\nunny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has arrived. =\r\nI did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts about t=\r\nhe desire and surrendering of\n&gt;  my ignorance. I sought permission from the=\r\n deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also remember clea=\r\nrly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT =\r\ngive me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT p=\r\nunish me in any way for doing this.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I had a small mental dialogu=\r\ne with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, and I=\r\n seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And then I s=\r\ntarted my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was o=\r\nffering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings=\r\n taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mant=\r\nra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at th=\r\ne end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi sta=\r\nnding on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her fee=\r\nt alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I f=\r\nelt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little dist=\r\nance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten mi=\r\nnutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had com=\r\ne and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the =\r\ndog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to think=\r\n I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I\n&gt;  continued. Few =\r\nminutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to=\r\n see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but =\r\nbright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smas=\r\nhaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending =\r\nfrom a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started =\r\njumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to ju=\r\nmp inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was =\r\nacting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked =\r\nlike &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire h=\r\nitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few =\r\nminutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but=\r\n nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I a=\r\nsked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I\n&gt;  continued the mental ch=\r\nanting. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for ev=\r\neryone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, m=\r\nixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself,=\r\n and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impuden=\r\nce and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, an=\r\nd it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how=\r\n far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Anothe=\r\nr cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and=\r\n join them, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly =\r\nwhat was happening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to =\r\nknow that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the co=\r\nntents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my=\r\n impudence and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at =\r\nthe funeral\n&gt;  pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested=\r\n her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yaho=\r\no group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; When I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at t=\r\nhe funeral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there b=\r\nefore (could be because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On=\r\n the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet =\r\nwithin. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thou=\r\nght of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, no=\r\nr was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within my existe=\r\nnce that evening. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no =\r\nquestions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a p=\r\nroduct of my own imagination - but the silence was real. And this experienc=\r\ne of silence was the most beautiful thing. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The next day, I hear=\r\nd my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the one ye=\r\nsterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother was s=\r\npeaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now that it =\r\nis few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen too, as=\r\n sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is ther=\r\ne a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen=\r\n-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to m=\r\ny dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as oppos=\r\ned to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day when I=\r\n was channeling some reiki to him? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure if these quest=\r\nions can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the=\r\n above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I =\r\nwould be most appreciative.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi fo=\r\nr the continued inspiration. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Also, apologies for the length of =\r\nthe note.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Sharad\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
