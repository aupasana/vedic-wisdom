I saw Sastr=\r\ni openly\nweep, lamenting the Muni&#39;s death. At that time Kapali Sastri had s=\r\no much\nfaith in Aurobindo and Mother, I heard him say, &quot;If Nayana was here =\r\n(at\nAurobindo Ashram) he would not have died.&quot;\n\nBhagavan was once talking a=\r\nbout him to me and said, &quot;If Nayana had not come\nhere (meaning to himself) =\r\nand had his mind turned inwards to the Self, he\nwould have certainly ended =\r\nup in jail.&quot; Nayana had in his earlier years a\npredilection for political a=\r\nctivity.\n\nAurobindo and the Mother recognized Ganapati Muni&#39;s extraordinary=\r\n gifts.\nKapali Sastri once took the Muni to Aurobindo Ashram and everyone t=\r\nhere was\neager that he should stay. He was given a royal welcome and offere=\r\nd a house\nand all the necessary conveniences for him and his family. Someon=\r\ne back at\nSri Ramanasramam informed Bhagavan of how Nayana was being entice=\r\nd to stay\nin Aurobindo Ashram. While this person was describing it all to B=\r\nhagavan, he\nexpressed the opinion that Nayana, indeed, might very well sett=\r\nle down\nthere. Bhagavan looked at the man in surprise and said, &quot;Nayana ? S=\r\nettle\ndown at Aurobindo Ashram? Impossible!&quot;\n\nLearned Scholars\n\nMany learne=\r\nd scholars and sannyasins would often visit Bhagavan and ask\nquestions. Bha=\r\ngavan&#39;s response to these visitors, and also to other\nvisitors, was not alw=\r\nays uniform. To some people he would give much\nattention, either by talking=\r\n to them or pouring out his grace through a\nsilent look; others he would st=\r\noically ignore. All these variations were not\ngoverned by status, wealth, o=\r\nr fame.\n\nOne morning a famous swami of Ahmedabad arrived at the ashram. I u=\r\nnderstood\nhe had many wealthy disciples and was himself attired in a costly=\r\n silk,\nochre-colored cloth. He also had several pieces of luggage, which cl=\r\nearly\nindicated he was a man of some means. The swami came into the Guest H=\r\nouse\nfor Gentlemen and introduced himself to me. He wanted to know when he =\r\ncould\nsee the Maharshi. I told him at 10 a.m. I would be going to the hall =\r\nand he\ncould accompany me and at that time I would introduce him to the Mah=\r\narshi.\n\nDuring that period, between 10 and 11 a.m. every morning in the Old=\r\n Hall,\nDevaraja Mudaliar, Munagala Venkataramiah and I were going through\nV=\r\nenkataramiah&#39;s English translation of a Tamil scripture. Bhagavan would\nope=\r\nn and hold the Tamil book in his hand and we would read the English\ntransla=\r\ntion for each verse. Then we would discuss it until we found it\nacceptable =\r\nto Bhagavan.\n\nThe swami entered the hall with me at 10 a.m. and I introduce=\r\nd him to\nBhagavan. He was fluent in Sanskrit and other languages, and also =\r\nwas well\nversed in all the scriptures. He inquired if he was allowed to ask=\r\n a\nquestion. The consent was given and he asked Bhagavan if Ishwara, the\npe=\r\nrsonal God, actually existed. The Maharshi replied with one of his\nstandard=\r\n rejoinders: &quot;We do not know about Ishwara or whether he exists or\nnot. But=\r\n what we do know is that we exist. Find out who that &#39;I&#39; is that\nexists. Th=\r\nat is all that is required.&quot;\n\nThe swami was not satisfied with this answer =\r\nand continued to discuss the\nmatter, quoting from various scriptures. Bhaga=\r\nvan then said, &quot;If the\nscriptures say all this about it, why question me fu=\r\nrther?&quot;\n\nThis also was not acceptable to the swami and he proceeded with mo=\r\nre\nelucidation, at which point Bhagavan cut him off by turning to us and\nsa=\r\nying, &quot;Come on. Let us begin our work.&quot; It is needless to say that the\nswam=\r\ni became quite annoyed and soon left the hall.\n\nLater in the day I met him =\r\nand he told me that my Maharshi doesn&#39;t seem to\nknow very much. I simply re=\r\nplied, &quot;Yes.&quot; And although this visitor was\noriginally planning on staying =\r\nfor three days, he cut his visit short and\nleft that very afternoon, withou=\r\nt ever going back into the hall to see the\nMaharshi. Bhagavan later asked m=\r\ne what the swami said before leaving. When I\ntold him, he simply smiled.\n\nA=\r\nnother incident comes to my mind when yet one more learned swami visited\nBh=\r\nagavan. He questioned Bhagavan in Sanskrit and Bhagavan, once again,\npatien=\r\ntly answered in Malayalam, the swami&#39;s mother tongue. As the session\ncontin=\r\nued it became clear that this swami&#39;s sole intention was to defeat\nBhagavan=\r\n in argument. Eventually Bhagavan said, &quot;Will you be satisfied if I\nissue y=\r\nou a certificate stating you have defeated me in the argument?&quot; But\neven th=\r\nat did not silence the swami&#39;s impertinence.\n\nJagadish Sastri, a Sanskrit p=\r\nundit, was quietly listening to the\nproceedings. When he saw that the swami=\r\n was incorrigible, he blurted out in\nSanskrit, &quot;He dushta bahirgachha,&quot; whi=\r\nch means &quot;O wicked man, get out!&quot; I\ndon&#39;t remember anyone ever making such =\r\nan aggressive remark in the presence\nof Bhagavan. But it worked. The swami =\r\nfinally got the message and left the\nhall.\n\nOnce a group of influential dev=\r\notees from Madras came up with a scheme to\ntake Bhagavan away to Madras. In=\r\n an attempt to execute this plan, a number\nof them arrived at the ashram an=\r\nd came into the hall. It wasn&#39;t long before\nthey realized that Bhagavan wou=\r\nld never consent to leave Ramanasramam, and\neventually they left.\n\nOne old =\r\ndevotee was sitting in the corner of the hall quietly watching the\nwhole dr=\r\nama unfold. He said nothing while the discussion was underway,\nthough he wa=\r\ns secretly in collusion with the group from Madras. After the\ngroup left, B=\r\nhagavan turned to one of his attendants and said, &quot;Some people\nwill sit qui=\r\netly as if they have nothing to do with what is taking place\nbefore them. B=\r\nut on the contrary, they have everything to do with what is\ngoing on.&quot;\n\nThe=\r\n old devotee questioned, &quot;Bhagavan, are you testing me?&quot;\n\nBhagavan simply r=\r\nemained silent. Any acts of insincerity were easily known\nto Bhagavan and h=\r\ne did not hesitate to point them out.\n\nForeigners and the English Language\n=\r\n\nBhagavan was familiar with, and had respect for, the classical English\nwor=\r\nks. He had read many English books and would daily read an English\nnewspape=\r\nr. W. Y. Evans-Wentz had given Bhagavan copies of his published\nbooks, and =\r\nof these books Bhagavan liked best Tibet&#39;s Great Yogi, Melarepa.\nHe once re=\r\nquested me to read it.\n\nAlthough he read and understood English quite well,=\r\n he rarely spoke it. If\npeople spoke English to him with clear diction and =\r\npronunciation he would\nnot have much trouble understanding them. Once he sa=\r\nid to me, &quot;I couldn&#39;t\nunderstand a word Chadwick said.&quot; Which shows he did =\r\nfail to understand\nEnglish at times if not spoken clearly.\n\nThe State of a =\r\nJnani\n\nOn another occasion there was a French visitor named Jean Herbert, w=\r\nho had\nwritten several books on India, its holy men, and ashrams, etc. I sa=\r\nw him\nwhile he was on his second visit to the ashram. During this visit he\n=\r\nrequested the publication rights of all of the ashram literature, as he\npla=\r\nnned on using this material in his books. The ashram authorities were at\nfi=\r\nrst enthusiastic about books being published in the West on Bhagavan and\nhi=\r\ns teachings. I told Bhagavan that Jean Herbert also requested the same\nperm=\r\nission from Aurobindo Ashram, but they decided not to give it. Perhaps\nthey=\r\n felt he would exploit Aurobindo&#39;s writings. When I had told Bhagavan\nthis,=\r\n he requested me to go to the office and explain it to them. I did, and\nthe=\r\n permission was withheld.\n\nIn this way, I observed Bhagavan taking special =\r\ninterest in the affairs of\nthe ashram and, at times, personally directing t=\r\nhem. It might not always\nhave been so apparent as in the two cases above, b=\r\nut it was, no doubt,\nforthcoming.\n\nThough Bhagavan generally opposed any fu=\r\nnds being solicited for the ashram,\nhe did not object in all cases.\n\nKrishn=\r\naprem visits the Ashram\n\nAfter my visit with Krishnaprem in 1938, I had cor=\r\nresponded with him a few\ntimes. In each of his letters he promised that he =\r\nwould soon be coming to\nsee the Maharshi. But he never came and I began to =\r\nthink that he would miss\nhis chance to have darshan of Bhagavan. This all c=\r\nhanged on a December\nmorning in 1948.\n\nI was sitting with my eyes closed ne=\r\nxt to Bhagavan, outside on the verandah.\nWhen I opened my eyes, who did I s=\r\nee sitting before me but Krishnaprem. I\nsaid to him, &quot;You have finally come=\r\n. Why didn&#39;t you write and let me know\nyou were coming?&quot;\n\nHe said, &quot;After w=\r\nriting to you so many times and promising to come, but\ndidn&#39;t, I was embarr=\r\nassed to write you again.&quot;\n\nDuring this visit, Krishnaprem handed over his =\r\nsmall Gopala Krishna idol to\nBhagavan. Bhagavan tenderly turned it this way=\r\n and that, looking at it\nintently, and then returned it to Krishnaprem. In =\r\nother places it has\nalready been recorded about Krishnaprem&#39;s vision and in=\r\nner experiences while\nsitting before Bhagavan in the Old Hall.\n\nFrom Sri Ra=\r\nmanasramam he travelled to Sri Aurobindo&#39;s Ashram. After staying\nthere a fe=\r\nw days we planned that he and I would rendezvous at the Villupuram\ntrain st=\r\nation, from where we would depart together and travel south,\nvisiting sever=\r\nal famous temples and holy places. My train from\nTiruvannamalai was schedul=\r\ned to leave at 1 P.M. So, immediately after lunch\nI approached Bhagavan to =\r\ntake leave of him. He had just then finished his\nmeal and was massaging his=\r\n rheumatic knee joints=E2=80=94in his old age he had to do\nthis prior to wa=\r\nlking. I prostrated before him and informed him of my\ndeparture. He already=\r\n knew all the details relating to this trip, and he\nalso knew I was plannin=\r\ng on visiting Kanyakumari. He said to me, &quot;These\npeople (meaning the manage=\r\nment) have written to an advocate-devotee of\nNagerkoil to send us the three=\r\n different-coloured sands that are available\nat Kanyakumari. These are need=\r\ned for the Kumbhabhishekam of the\nMatrubhuteswara Temple. So far, he has no=\r\nt sent them.&quot; Though Bhagavan did\nnot say specifically that I should bring =\r\nthose sands, I naturally understood\nwhat was on his mind. In fact, he often=\r\n employed this manner of speaking,\nasking us indirectly, when he wanted som=\r\nething done. Before leaving he also\nasked me to write and send him details =\r\nabout the pilgrimage.\n\nWhen I arrived in Kanyakumari I discovered that the =\r\ngovernment had enforced\na law prohibiting the removal of any sand from the =\r\nbeaches of Kanyakumari.\nUranium, the mineral used for making atomic bombs, =\r\nhad been found in some of\nthe sand. Nevertheless, I thought I should take m=\r\ny chances and stealthily\nproceeded to gather the three different sands. I f=\r\nilled three bags with the\nsands and concealed them in my bedroll. At the tr=\r\nain station I hired a man\nto carry my bedroll and luggage and moved on towa=\r\nrds the station gate.\nStanding at the gate, I saw the ticket collector and =\r\ntwo policemen. The\nticket collector was checking tickets and the policemen =\r\nwere checking\nbaggage for illegal sand. I asked my man to stop and we both =\r\nstood there\nmomentarily as I contemplated the situation. Pondering over my =\r\nnext move, I\nmentally prayed to Bhagavan, &quot;You wanted me to bring this sand=\r\n. Now look at\nthis=E2=80=94police! What am I to do?&quot; As soon as I had praye=\r\nd thus, the policemen,\nfor some unknown reason, turned and looked in a cert=\r\nain direction and walked\naway from the gate. I immediately told my man, &quot;Le=\r\nt&#39;s go,&quot; and we passed\nthrough the gate and boarded the train.\n\nWhen I retu=\r\nrned to the ashram and brought the bags of sands to Bhagavan, he\ncalled eve=\r\nryone around to come and look. Later, the sands expected from the\nadvocate =\r\narrived by post, but the bags had broken en route and the three\nvarieties o=\r\nf sands mixed, making them useless. When Bhagavan heard that he\nremarked, &quot;=\r\nIf Balaram Reddy had not brought the sands, how could we have\ngotten a fres=\r\nh consignment on time for the consecration ceremony?&quot;Krishnaprem\nfinally re=\r\nturned to North India after his tour of the South.\n\nSources:\n\n1) http://www=\r\n.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Djan-feb\n2) http://www.arunachala.org=\r\n/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd104f4ea7cf6047dbc2033\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Ganapati Muni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I n=\r\never met Ganapati Muni, but I remember being with Kapali Sastri in Aurobind=\r\no Ashram when the news of his death arrived. I saw Sastri openly weep, lame=\r\nnting the Muni&#39;s death. At that time Kapali Sastri had so much faith in=\r\n Aurobindo and Mother, I heard him say, &quot;If Nayana was here (at Aurobi=\r\nndo Ashram) he would not have died.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was once talkin=\r\ng about him to me and said, &quot;If Nayana had not come here (meaning to h=\r\nimself) and had his mind turned inwards to the Self, he would have certainl=\r\ny ended up in jail.&quot; Nayana had in his earlier years a predilection fo=\r\nr political activity.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Aurobindo and the Mother recognized Ganapati=\r\n Muni&#39;s extraordinary gifts. Kapali Sastri once took the Muni to Aurobi=\r\nndo Ashram and everyone there was eager that he should stay. He was given a=\r\n royal welcome and offered a house and all the necessary conveniences for h=\r\nim and his family. Someone back at Sri Ramanasramam informed Bhagavan of ho=\r\nw Nayana was being enticed to stay in Aurobindo Ashram. While this person w=\r\nas describing it all to Bhagavan, he expressed the opinion that Nayana, ind=\r\need, might very well settle down there.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ital=\r\nic&quot;&gt;Bhagavan looked at the man in surprise and said, &quot;Nayana ? Settle =\r\ndown at Aurobindo Ashram? Impossible!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Learned Scholars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many learned scholars and =\r\nsannyasins would often visit Bhagavan and ask questions. Bhagavan&#39;s res=\r\nponse to these visitors, and also to other visitors, was not always uniform=\r\n. To some people he would give much attention, either by talking to them or=\r\n pouring out his grace through a silent look; others he would stoically ign=\r\nore. All these variations were not governed by status, wealth, or fame.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;One morning a famous swami of Ahmedabad arrived at the ashram. I unde=\r\nrstood he had many wealthy disciples and was himself attired in a costly si=\r\nlk, ochre-colored cloth. He also had several pieces of luggage, which clear=\r\nly indicated he was a man of some means. The swami came into the Guest Hous=\r\ne for Gentlemen and introduced himself to me. He wanted to know when he cou=\r\nld see the Maharshi. I told him at 10 a.m. I would be going to the hall and=\r\n he could accompany me and at that time I would introduce him to the Mahars=\r\nhi.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;During that period, between 10 and 11 a.m. every morning in th=\r\ne Old Hall, Devaraja Mudaliar, Munagala Venkataramiah and I were going thro=\r\nugh Venkataramiah&#39;s English translation of a Tamil scripture. Bhagavan =\r\nwould open and hold the Tamil book in his hand and we would read the Englis=\r\nh translation for each verse. Then we would discuss it until we found it ac=\r\nceptable to Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The swami entered the hall with me at 10 a.m=\r\n. and I introduced him to Bhagavan. He was fluent in Sanskrit and other lan=\r\nguages, and also was well versed in all the scriptures. He inquired if he w=\r\nas allowed to ask a question. The consent was given and=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;he asked Bhagavan if Ishwara, the personal God, actually=\r\n existed. The Maharshi replied with one of his standard rejoinders: &quot;W=\r\ne do not know about Ishwara or whether he exists or not. But what we do kno=\r\nw is that we exist. Find out who that &#39;I&#39; is that exists. That is a=\r\nll that is required.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;The swami was not satisfied with this answer and continued to discuss the =\r\nmatter, quoting from various scriptures. Bhagavan then said, &quot;If the s=\r\ncriptures say all this about it, why question me further?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;This also was not acceptable to the swami and he proceeded with more e=\r\nlucidation, at which point=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan c=\r\nut him off by turning to us and saying, &quot;Come on. Let us begin our wor=\r\nk.&quot; It is needless to say that the swami became quite annoyed and soon=\r\n left the hall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Later in the day I met him and he told me t=\r\nhat my Maharshi doesn&#39;t seem to know very much. I simply replied, &quot=\r\n;Yes.&quot; And although this visitor was originally planning on staying fo=\r\nr three days, he cut his visit short and left that very afternoon, without =\r\never going back into the hall to see the Maharshi. Bhagavan later asked me =\r\nwhat the swami said before leaving. When I told him, he simply smiled.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Another incident comes to my mind whe=\r\nn yet one more learned swami visited Bhagavan. He questioned Bhagavan in Sa=\r\nnskrit and Bhagavan, once again, patiently answered in Malayalam, the swami=\r\n&#39;s mother tongue. As the session continued it became clear that this sw=\r\nami&#39;s sole intention was to defeat Bhagavan in argument. Eventually Bha=\r\ngavan said, &quot;Will you be satisfied if I issue you a certificate statin=\r\ng you have defeated me in the argument?&quot; But even that did not silence=\r\n the swami&#39;s impertinence.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Jagadish Sastri, a Sanskrit pundit,=\r\n was quietly listening to the proceedings. When he saw that the swami was i=\r\nncorrigible, he blurted out in Sanskrit, &quot;He dushta bahirgachha,&quot;=\r\n which means &quot;O wicked man, get out!&quot; I don&#39;t remember anyone=\r\n ever making such an aggressive remark in the presence of Bhagavan. But it =\r\nworked. The swami finally got the message and left the hall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Once a group of influential devotees from Madras came up with a scheme to=\r\n take Bhagavan away to Madras. In an attempt to execute this plan, a number=\r\n of them arrived at the ashram and came into the hall. It wasn&#39;t long b=\r\nefore they realized that Bhagavan would never consent to leave Ramanasramam=\r\n, and eventually they left.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One old devotee was sitting in the cor=\r\nner of the hall quietly watching the whole drama unfold. He said nothing wh=\r\nile the discussion was underway, though he was secretly in collusion with t=\r\nhe group from Madras. After the group left, Bhagavan turned to one of his a=\r\nttendants and said, &quot;Some people will sit quietly as if they have noth=\r\ning to do with what is taking place before them. But on the contrary, they =\r\nhave everything to do with what is going on.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The old devotee=\r\n questioned, &quot;Bhagavan, are you testing me?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan simp=\r\nly remained silent. Any acts of insincerity were easily known to Bhagavan a=\r\nnd he did not hesitate to point them out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;Foreigners and the English Language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was fam=\r\niliar with, and had respect for, the classical English works. He had read m=\r\nany English books and would daily read an English newspaper. W. Y. Evans-We=\r\nntz had given Bhagavan copies of his published books, and of these books=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan liked best Tibet&#39;s Great Y=\r\nogi, Melarepa. He once requested me to read it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Although he=\r\n read and understood English quite well, he rarely spoke it. If people spok=\r\ne English to him with clear diction and pronunciation he would not have muc=\r\nh trouble understanding them. Once he said to me, &quot;I couldn&#39;t unde=\r\nrstand a word Chadwick said.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Wh=\r\nich shows he did fail to understand English at times if not spoken clearly.=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The State of a Jnani&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;On another occasion there was a=\r\n French visitor named Jean Herbert, who had written several books on India,=\r\n its holy men, and ashrams, etc. I saw him while he was on his second visit=\r\n to the ashram.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0During this visit he requested the publication =\r\nrights of all of the ashram literature, as he planned on using this materia=\r\nl in his books. The ashram authorities were at first enthusiastic about boo=\r\nks being published in the West on Bhagavan and his teachings.&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;=C2=A0I told Bhagavan that Jean Herbert also requested =\r\nthe same permission from Aurobindo Ashram, but they decided not to give it.=\r\n Perhaps they felt he would exploit Aurobindo&#39;s writings. When I had to=\r\nld Bhagavan this, he requested me to go to the office and explain it to the=\r\nm. I did, and the permission was withheld.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In this way, I o=\r\nbserved Bhagavan taking special interest in the affairs of the ashram and, =\r\nat times, personally directing them. It might not always have been so appar=\r\nent as in the two cases above, but it was, no doubt, forthcoming.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Though Bhagavan generally opposed any fund=\r\ns being solicited for the ashram, he did not object in all cases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Krishnaprem visits the Ashram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;After my visit with Krishnaprem in 1938, I had corresponded with h=\r\nim a few times. In each of his letters he promised that he would soon be co=\r\nming to see the Maharshi. But he never came and I began to think that he wo=\r\nuld miss his chance to have darshan of Bhagavan. This all changed on a Dece=\r\nmber morning in 1948.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I was sitting with my eyes closed next to Bh=\r\nagavan, outside on the verandah. When I opened my eyes, who did I see sitti=\r\nng before me but Krishnaprem. I said to him, &quot;You have finally come. W=\r\nhy didn&#39;t you write and let me know you were coming?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He =\r\nsaid, &quot;After writing to you so many times and promising to come, but d=\r\nidn&#39;t, I was embarrassed to write you again.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During this v=\r\nisit, Krishnaprem handed over his small Gopala Krishna idol to Bhagavan. Bh=\r\nagavan tenderly turned it this way and that, looking at it intently, and th=\r\nen returned it to Krishnaprem. In other places it has already been recorded=\r\n about Krishnaprem&#39;s vision and inner experiences while sitting before =\r\nBhagavan in the Old Hall.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;From Sri Ramanasramam he travelled to Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo&#39;s Ashram. After staying there a few days we planned that he=\r\n and I would rendezvous at the Villupuram train station, from where we woul=\r\nd depart together and travel south, visiting several famous temples and hol=\r\ny places. My train from Tiruvannamalai was scheduled to leave at 1 P.M. So,=\r\n immediately after lunch I approached Bhagavan to take leave of him. He had=\r\n just then finished his meal and was massaging his rheumatic knee joints=E2=\r\n=80=94in his old age he had to do this prior to walking.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;I prostrated before him and informed him of my depart=\r\nure. He already knew all the details relating to this trip, and he also kne=\r\nw I was planning on visiting Kanyakumari. He said to me, &quot;These people=\r\n (meaning the management) have written to an advocate-devotee of Nagerkoil =\r\nto send us the three different-coloured sands that are available at Kanyaku=\r\nmari. These are needed for the Kumbhabhishekam of the Matrubhuteswara Templ=\r\ne. So far, he has not sent them.&quot; Though Bhagavan did not say specific=\r\nally that I should bring those sands, I naturally understood what was on hi=\r\ns mind. In fact, he often employed this manner of speaking, asking us indir=\r\nectly, when he wanted something done.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Before leaving he also as=\r\nked me to write and send him details about the pilgrimage.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When I arrived in Kanyakumari I discovered that t=\r\nhe government had enforced a law prohibiting the removal of any sand from t=\r\nhe beaches of Kanyakumari. Uranium, the mineral used for making atomic bomb=\r\ns, had been found in some of the sand. Nevertheless, I thought I should tak=\r\ne my chances and stealthily proceeded to gather the three different sands.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;=C2=A0I filled three bags with the sands and concealed them in my bed=\r\nroll. At the train station I hired a man to carry my bedroll and luggage an=\r\nd moved on towards the station gate. Standing at the gate, I saw the ticket=\r\n collector and two policemen.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The tic=\r\nket collector was checking tickets and the policemen were checking baggage =\r\nfor illegal sand. I asked my man to stop and we both stood there momentaril=\r\ny as I contemplated the situation. Pondering over my next move, I mentally =\r\nprayed to Bhagavan, &quot;You wanted me to bring this sand. Now look at thi=\r\ns=E2=80=94police! What am I to do?&quot; As soon as I had prayed thus, the =\r\npolicemen, for some unknown reason, turned and looked in a certain directio=\r\nn and walked away from the gate.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0I immediately told my man, &qu=\r\not;Let&#39;s go,&quot; and we passed through the gate and boarded the train=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When I returned to the ashram and brought the bags of sands to B=\r\nhagavan, he called everyone around to come and look. Later, the sands expec=\r\nted from the advocate arrived by post, but the bags had broken en route and=\r\n the three varieties of sands mixed, making them useless.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When Bhagavan heard that he remarked, &quot;If Balara=\r\nm Reddy had not brought the sands, how could we have gotten a fresh consign=\r\nment on time for the consecration ceremony?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;Krishnaprem finally=\r\n returned to North India after his tour of the South.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/span&gt;:=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Djan-feb&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Djan-feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Dmar-apr&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:=\r\nboth;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;l=\r\nine-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-si=\r\nze:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px=\r\n;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n=C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd104f4ea7cf6047dbc2033--\r\n\n"}}
