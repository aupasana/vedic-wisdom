I am sure ther=\r\ne are others saints too, if you have access to him or other great Saint, th=\r\ney can help.\n\nIf you feel like above than you can try meeting spiritual mas=\r\nters who have capability to awaken kundalini and also give guidance. Again =\r\ndepeding on your location you may be able to reach one of them.\n\nSwami Shiv=\r\nom Tirth Maharaj was a very capable and renouned shaktipatacharya and he es=\r\ntablished many ashrams in India. These places are very authentic. In Nasik =\r\nthere is Narayan Kaka. So it all depends on your comfort and to a great ext=\r\nent where your sanskars lead you.
