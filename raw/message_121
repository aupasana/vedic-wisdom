Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sharat ji,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I believe deepa homam can be performed with a deepam, with drops of \noil =\r\n\n&gt; offered into the deepam with mantras. However, compared to fire in \nregu=\r\nlar \n&gt; homam, fire in a deepa homam is restricted and unfree. Thus, a \nregu=\r\nlar homam \n&gt; is far more effective than a deepa homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, if you hav=\r\ne no better choice, it can certainly be considered.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people living=\r\n in apartments in USA have performed \nMahaganapathi homam, \n&gt; but I am not =\r\nthat familiar with UK.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you use dry coconut pieces only (i.e. no woo=\r\nd) and put the right \namount \n&gt; of ghee, it actually generates hardly any s=\r\nmoke. However, that \ntakes a \n&gt; little bit of practice. Doing the homam nea=\r\nr a window and keeping \nthe window \n&gt; open can also help.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a s=\r\nmoke detector right next to the door (which is always \nkept open) \n&gt; of the=\r\n room in which I do my daily homam at my house. It goes off \nvery \n&gt; rarely=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; If Ganapathi wants you to worship Him in fire, He will show you the =\r\n\nway.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\n&gt; From: &quot;Sharat&quot; &lt;gidoc@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: S=\r\nunday, August 19, 2007 7:32 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Ganapati Havan/Hom=\r\nam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; ||Namah Shivaya||\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narsimha ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I foll=\r\now your teachings and lessons very closely and have been\n&gt; &gt; reflecting on =\r\nbeginning the Ganapati havan as per your teching and\n&gt; &gt; illustrations.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n However I live in a modern apartment in UK,with fire/smoke alrams;\n&gt; &gt; hav=\r\ne no personal open ground or balcony.
