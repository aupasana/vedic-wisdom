BABAJI, THE YOGI&#8722;CHRIST OF MODERN INDIA \n\nThe northern Himalayan cr=\r\nags near Badrinarayan are still blessed by the living presence of Babaji, g=\r\nuru of\nLahiri Mahasaya. The secluded master has retained his physical form =\r\nfor centuries, perhaps for millenniums.\nThe deathless Babaji is an AVATARA.=\r\n This Sanskrit word means &quot;descent&quot;; its roots are AVA, &quot;down,&quot; and\nTRI, &quot;t=\r\no pass.&quot; In the Hindu scriptures, AVATARA signifies the descent of Divinity=\r\n into flesh.\n&quot;Babaji&#39;s spiritual state is beyond human comprehension,&quot; Sri =\r\nYukteswar explained to me. &quot;The dwarfed\nvision of men cannot pierce to his =\r\ntranscendental star. One attempts in vain even to picture the avatar&#39;s\natta=\r\ninment. It is inconceivable.&quot;\nThe UPANISHADS have minutely classified every=\r\n stage of spiritual advancement. A SIDDHA (&quot;perfected\nbeing&quot;) has progresse=\r\nd from the state of a JIVANMUKTA (&quot;freed while living&quot;) to that of a PARAMU=\r\nKTA\n(&quot;supremely free&quot;&#8722;full power over death); the latter has complete=\r\nly escaped from the mayic thralldom and its\nreincarnational round. The PARA=\r\nMUKTA therefore seldom returns to a physical body; if he does, he is an\nava=\r\ntar, a divinely appointed medium of supernal blessings on the world.\nAn ava=\r\ntar is unsubject to the universal economy; his pure body, visible as a ligh=\r\nt image, is free from any debt\nto nature. The casual gaze may see nothing e=\r\nxtraordinary in an avatar&#39;s form but it casts no shadow nor makes\nany footp=\r\nrint on the ground. These are outward symbolic proofs of an inward lack of =\r\ndarkness and material\nbondage. Such a God&#8722;man alone knows the Truth b=\r\nehind the relativities of life and death. Omar Khayyam, so\ngrossly misunder=\r\nstood, sang of this liberated man in his immortal scripture, the RUBAIYAT:\n=\r\n&quot;Ah, Moon of my Delight who know&#39;st no wane, The Moon of Heav&#39;n is rising o=\r\nnce again; How oft hereafter\nrising shall she look Through this same Garden=\r\n after me&#8722;in vain!&quot;\nThe &quot;Moon of Delight&quot; is God, eternal Polaris, an=\r\nachronous never. The &quot;Moon of Heav&#39;n&quot; is the outward\ncosmos, fettered to th=\r\ne law of periodic recurrence. Its chains had been dissolved forever by the =\r\nPersian seer\nthrough his self&#8722;realization. &quot;How oft hereafter rising =\r\nshall she look . . . after me&#8722;in vain!&quot; What frustration\nof search by=\r\n a frantic universe for an absolute omission!\nChrist expressed his freedom =\r\nin another way: &quot;And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I wi=\r\nll\nfollow thee whithersoever thou goest. And Jesus saith unto him, The foxe=\r\ns have holes, and the birds of the air\nhave nests; but the Son of man hath =\r\nnot where to lay his head.&quot; {FN33&#8722;1}\nSpacious with omnipresence, coul=\r\nd Christ indeed be followed except in the overarching Spirit?\nKrishna, Rama=\r\n, Buddha, and Patanjali were among the ancient Indian avatars. A considerab=\r\nle poetic literature\nin Tamil has grown up around Agastya, a South Indian a=\r\nvatar. He worked many miracles during the centuries\npreceding and following=\r\n the Christian era, and is credited with retaining his physical form even t=\r\no this day.\nBabaji&#39;s mission in India has been to assist prophets in carryi=\r\nng out their special dispensations. He thus\nqualifies for the scriptural cl=\r\nassification of MAHAVATAR (Great Avatar). He has stated that he gave yoga\ni=\r\nnitiation to Shankara, ancient founder of the Swami Order, and to Kabir, fa=\r\nmous medieval saint. His chief\nnineteenth&#8722;century disciple was, as we=\r\n know, Lahiri Mahasaya, revivalist of the lost KRIYA art.\n[Illustration: BA=\r\nBAJI, THE MAHAVATAR, Guru of Lahiri Mahasaya, I have helped an artist to dr=\r\naw a true\nlikeness of the great Yogi&#8722;Christ of modern India.=97see ba=\r\nbaji.jpg]\n\nThe MAHAVATAR is in constant communion with Christ; together the=\r\ny send out vibrations of redemption,\nand have planned the spiritual techniq=\r\nue of salvation for this age. The work of these two fully&#8722;illumined\nm=\r\nasters&#8722;one with the body, and one without it&#8722;is to inspire the =\r\nnations to forsake suicidal wars, race hatreds,\nreligious sectarianism, and=\r\n the boomerang&#8722;evils of materialism. Babaji is well aware of the tren=\r\nd of modern\ntimes, especially of the influence and complexities of Western =\r\ncivilization, and realizes the necessity of\nspreading the self&#8722;libera=\r\ntions of yoga equally in the West and in the East.\nThat there is no histori=\r\ncal reference to Babaji need not surprise us. The great guru has never open=\r\nly appeared\nin any century; the misinterpreting glare of publicity has no p=\r\nlace in his millennial plans. Like the Creator, the\nsole but silent Power, =\r\nBabaji works in a humble obscurity.\nGreat prophets like Christ and Krishna =\r\ncome to earth for a specific and spectacular purpose; they depart as\nsoon a=\r\ns it is accomplished. Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is c=\r\noncerned more with the slow\nevolutionary progress of man during the centuri=\r\nes than with any one outstanding event of history. Such\nmasters always veil=\r\n themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the power to become invisi=\r\nble at will.\nFor these reasons, and because they generally instruct their d=\r\nisciples to maintain silence about them, a number\nof towering spiritual fig=\r\nures remain world&#8722;unknown. I give in these pages on Babaji merely a h=\r\nint of his\nlife&#8722;only a few facts which he deems it fit and helpful to=\r\n be publicly imparted.\nNo limiting facts about Babaji&#39;s family or birthplac=\r\ne, dear to the annalist&#39;s heart, have ever been discovered.\nHis speech is g=\r\nenerally in Hindi, but he converses easily in any language. He has adopted =\r\nthe simple name of\nBabaji (revered father); other titles of respect given h=\r\nim by Lahiri Mahasaya&#39;s disciples are Mahamuni Babaji\nMaharaj (supreme ecst=\r\natic saint), Maha Yogi (greatest of yogis), Trambak Baba and Shiva Baba (ti=\r\ntles of\navatars of Shiva). Does it matter that we know not the patronymic o=\r\nf an earth&#8722;released master?\n&quot;Whenever anyone utters with reverence th=\r\ne name of Babaji,&quot; Lahiri Mahasaya said, &quot;that devotee attracts an\ninstant =\r\nspiritual blessing.&quot;\nThe deathless guru bears no marks of age on his body; =\r\nhe appears to be no more than a youth of twenty&#8722;five.\nFair&#8722;skin=\r\nned, of medium build and height, Babaji&#39;s beautiful, strong body radiates a=\r\n perceptible glow. His\neyes are dark, calm, and tender; his long, lustrous =\r\nhair is copper&#8722;colored. A very strange fact is that Babaji\nbears an e=\r\nxtraordinarily exact resemblance to his disciple Lahiri Mahasaya. The simil=\r\narity is so striking that,\nin his later years, Lahiri Mahasaya might have p=\r\nassed as the father of the youthful&#8722;looking Babaji.\nSwami Kebalananda=\r\n, my saintly Sanskrit tutor, spent some time with Babaji in the Himalayas.\n=\r\n&quot;The peerless master moves with his group from place to place in the mounta=\r\nins,&quot; Kebalananda told me. &quot;His\nsmall band contains two highly advanced Ame=\r\nrican disciples. After Babaji has been in one locality for some\ntime, he sa=\r\nys: &#39;DERA DANDA UTHAO.&#39; (&#39;Let us lift our camp and staff.&#39;) He carries a sy=\r\nmbolic DANDA\n(bamboo staff). His words are the signal for moving with his g=\r\nroup instantaneously to another place. He does\nnot always employ this metho=\r\nd of astral travel; sometimes he goes on foot from peak to peak.\n&quot;Babaji ca=\r\nn be seen or recognized by others only when he so desires. He is known to h=\r\nave appeared in many\nslightly different forms to various devotees&#8722;som=\r\netimes without beard and moustache, and sometimes with\nthem. As his undecay=\r\ning body requires no food, the master seldom eats. As a social courtesy to =\r\nvisiting\ndisciples, he occasionally accepts fruits, or rice cooked in milk =\r\nand clarified butter.\n&quot;Two amazing incidents of Babaji&#39;s life are known to =\r\nme,&quot; Kebalananda went on. &quot;His disciples were sitting\none night around a hu=\r\nge fire which was blazing for a sacred Vedic ceremony. The master suddenly =\r\nseized a\nburning log and lightly struck the bare shoulder of a chela who wa=\r\ns close to the fire.\n&quot;&#39;Sir, how cruel!&#39; Lahiri Mahasaya, who was present, m=\r\nade this remonstrance.\n&quot;&#39;Would you rather have seen him burned to ashes bef=\r\nore your eyes, according to the decree of his past\nkarma?&#39;\n&quot;With these word=\r\ns Babaji placed his healing hand on the chela&#39;s disfigured shoulder. &#39;I hav=\r\ne freed you tonight\nfrom painful death. The karmic law has been satisfied t=\r\nhrough your slight suffering by fire.&#39;\n&quot;On another occasion Babaji&#39;s sacred=\r\n circle was disturbed by the arrival of a stranger. He had climbed with\nast=\r\nonishing skill to the nearly inaccessible ledge near the camp of the master=\r\n.\n&quot;&#39;Sir, you must be the great Babaji.&#39; The man&#39;s face was lit with inexpre=\r\nssible reverence. &#39;For months I have\npursued a ceaseless search for you amo=\r\nng these forbidding crags. I implore you to accept me as a disciple.&#39;\n&quot;When=\r\n the great guru made no response, the man pointed to the rocky chasm at his=\r\n feet.\n&quot;&#39;If you refuse me, I will jump from this mountain. Life has no furt=\r\nher value if I cannot win your guidance to\nthe Divine.&#39;\n&quot;&#39;Jump then,&#39; Babaj=\r\ni said unemotionally. &#39;I cannot accept you in your present state of develop=\r\nment.&#39;\n&quot;The man immediately hurled himself over the cliff. Babaji instructe=\r\nd the shocked disciples to fetch the\nstranger&#39;s body. When they returned wi=\r\nth the mangled form, the master placed his divine hand on the dead\nman. Lo!=\r\n he opened his eyes and prostrated himself humbly before the omnipotent one=\r\n.\n&quot;&#39;You are now ready for discipleship.&#39; Babaji beamed lovingly on his resu=\r\nrrected chela. &#39;You have\ncourageously passed a difficult test. Death shall =\r\nnot touch you again; now you are one of our immortal flock.&#39;\nThen he spoke =\r\nhis usual words of departure, &#39;DERA DANDA UTHAO&#39;; the whole group vanished =\r\nfrom the\nmountain.&quot;\nAn avatar lives in the omnipresent Spirit; for him ther=\r\ne is no distance inverse to the square. Only one reason,\ntherefore, can mot=\r\nivate Babaji in maintaining his physical form from century to century: the =\r\ndesire to furnish\nhumanity with a concrete example of its own possibilities=\r\n. Were man never vouchsafed a glimpse of Divinity\nin the flesh, he would re=\r\nmain oppressed by the heavy mayic delusion that he cannot transcend his mor=\r\ntality.\nJesus knew from the beginning the sequence of his life; he passed t=\r\nhrough each event not for himself, not\nfrom any karmic compulsion, but sole=\r\nly for the upliftment of reflective human beings. His four\nreporter&#8722;d=\r\nisciples&#8722;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John&#8722;recorded the ineffable d=\r\nrama for the benefit of later\ngenerations.\nFor Babaji, also, there is no re=\r\nlativity of past, present, future; from the beginning he has known all phas=\r\nes of\nhis life. Yet, accommodating himself to the limited understanding of =\r\nmen, he has played many acts of his\ndivine life in the presence of one or m=\r\nore witnesses. Thus it came about that a disciple of Lahiri Mahasaya\nwas pr=\r\nesent when Babaji deemed the time to be ripe for him to proclaim the possib=\r\nility of bodily immortality.\nHe uttered this promise before Ram Gopal Muzum=\r\ndar, that it might finally become known for the inspiration\nof other seekin=\r\ng hearts. The great ones speak their words and participate in the seemingly=\r\n natural course of\nevents, solely for the good of man, even as Christ said:=\r\n &quot;Father . . . I knew that thou hearest me always: but\nBECAUSE OF THE PEOPL=\r\nE WHICH STAND BY I SAID IT, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.&quot;\n=\r\n{FN33&#8722;2} During my visit at Ranbajpur with Ram Gopal, &quot;the sleepless =\r\nsaint,&quot; {FN33&#8722;3} he related the\nwondrous story of his first meeting w=\r\nith Babaji.\n&quot;I sometimes left my isolated cave to sit at Lahiri Mahasaya&#39;s =\r\nfeet in Benares,&quot; Ram Gopal told me. &quot;One\nmidnight as I was silently medita=\r\nting in a group of his disciples, the master made a surprising request.\n&quot;&#39;R=\r\nam Gopal,&#39; he said, &#39;go at once to the Dasasamedh bathing GHAT.&#39;\n&quot;I soon re=\r\nached the secluded spot. The night was bright with moonlight and the glitte=\r\nring stars. After I had sat\nin patient silence for awhile, my attention was=\r\n drawn to a huge stone slab near my feet. It rose gradually,\nrevealing an u=\r\nnderground cave. As the stone remained balanced in some unknown manner, the=\r\n draped form of\na young and surpassingly lovely woman was levitated from th=\r\ne cave high into the air. Surrounded by a soft\nhalo, she slowly descended i=\r\nn front of me and stood motionless, steeped in an inner state of ecstasy. S=\r\nhe\nfinally stirred, and spoke gently.\n&quot;&#39;I am Mataji, {FN33&#8722;4} the sis=\r\nter of Babaji. I have asked him and also Lahiri Mahasaya to come to my cave=\r\n\ntonight to discuss a matter of great importance.&#39;\n&quot;A nebulous light was ra=\r\npidly floating over the Ganges; the strange luminescence was reflected in t=\r\nhe opaque\nwaters. It approached nearer and nearer until, with a blinding fl=\r\nash, it appeared by the side of Mataji and\ncondensed itself instantly into =\r\nthe human form of Lahiri Mahasaya. He bowed humbly at the feet of the\nwoman=\r\n saint.\n&quot;Before I had recovered from my bewilderment, I was further wonders=\r\ntruck to behold a circling mass of\nmystical light traveling in the sky. Des=\r\ncending swiftly, the flaming whirlpool neared our group and\nmaterialized it=\r\nself into the body of a beautiful youth who, I understood at once, was Baba=\r\nji. He looked like\nLahiri Mahasaya, the only difference being that Babaji a=\r\nppeared much younger, and had long, bright hair.\n&quot;Lahiri Mahasaya, Mataji, =\r\nand myself knelt at the guru&#39;s feet. An ethereal sensation of beatific glor=\r\ny thrilled\nevery fiber of my being as I touched his divine flesh.\n&quot;&#39;Blessed=\r\n sister,&#39; Babaji said, &#39;I am intending to shed my form and plunge into the =\r\nInfinite Current.&#39;\n&quot;&#39;I have already glimpsed your plan, beloved master. I w=\r\nanted to discuss it with you tonight. Why should you\nleave your body?&#39; The =\r\nglorious woman looked at him beseechingly.\n&quot;&#39;What is the difference if I we=\r\nar a visible or invisible wave on the ocean of my Spirit?&#39;\n&quot;Mataji replied =\r\nwith a quaint flash of wit. &#39;Deathless guru, if it makes no difference, the=\r\nn please do not ever\nrelinquish your form.&#39; {FN33&#8722;5}\n&quot;&#39;Be it so,&#39; Bab=\r\naji said solemnly. &#39;I will never leave my physical body. It will always rem=\r\nain visible to at least\na small number of people on this earth. The Lord ha=\r\ns spoken His own wish through your lips.&#39;\n&quot;As I listened in awe to the conv=\r\nersation between these exalted beings, the great guru turned to me with a\nb=\r\nenign gesture.\n&quot;&#39;Fear not, Ram Gopal,&#39; he said, &#39;you are blessed to be a wi=\r\ntness at the scene of this immortal promise.&#39;\n&quot;As the sweet melody of Babaj=\r\ni&#39;s voice faded away, his form and that of Lahiri Mahasaya slowly levitated=\r\n and\nmoved backward over the Ganges. An aureole of dazzling light templed t=\r\nheir bodies as they vanished into the\nnight sky. Mataji&#39;s form floated to t=\r\nhe cave and descended; the stone slab closed of itself, as if working on an=\r\n\ninvisible leverage.\n&quot;Infinitely inspired, I wended my way back to Lahiri M=\r\nahasaya&#39;s place. As I bowed before him in the early\ndawn, my guru smiled at=\r\n me understandingly.\n&quot;&#39;I am happy for you, Ram Gopal,&#39; he said. &#39;The desire=\r\n of meeting Babaji and Mataji, which you have often\nexpressed to me, has fo=\r\nund at last a sacred fulfillment.&#39;\n&quot;My fellow disciples informed me that La=\r\nhiri Mahasaya had not moved from his dais since early the\npreceding evening=\r\n.\n&quot;&#39;He gave a wonderful discourse on immortality after you had left for the=\r\n Dasasamedh GHAT,&#39; one of the\nchelas told me. For the first time I fully re=\r\nalized the truth in the scriptural verses which state that a man of\nself&#8=\r\n722;realization can appear at different places in two or more bodies at the=\r\n same time.\n&quot;Lahiri Mahasaya later explained to me many metaphysical points=\r\n concerning the hidden divine plan for this\nearth,&quot; Ram Gopal concluded. &quot;B=\r\nabaji has been chosen by God to remain in his body for the duration of this=\r\n\nparticular world cycle. Ages shall come and go=97still the deathless maste=\r\nr, {FN33&#8722;6} beholding the drama of\nthe centuries, shall be present on=\r\n this stage terrestrial.&quot;\nChapter 33 Footnotes\n{FN33&#8722;1} MATTHEW 8:19&=\r\n#8722;20.\n{FN33&#8722;2} JOHN 11:41&#8722;42.\n{FN33&#8722;3} The omnipresen=\r\nt yogi who observed that I failed to bow before the Tarakeswar shrine (../c=\r\nhapter\n13).\n{FN33&#8722;4} &quot;Holy Mother.&quot; Mataji also has lived through the=\r\n centuries; she is almost as far advanced\nspiritually as her brother. She r=\r\nemains in ecstasy in a hidden underground cave near the Dasasamedh GHAT.\n{F=\r\nN33&#8722;5} This incident reminds one of Thales. The great Greek philosoph=\r\ner taught that there was no\ndifference between life and death. &quot;Why, then,&quot;=\r\n inquired a critic, &quot;do you not die?&quot; &quot;Because,&quot; answered\nThales, &quot;it makes=\r\n no difference.&quot;\n{FN33&#8722;6} &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man k=\r\neep my saying (remain unbrokenly in the Christ\nConsciousness), he shall nev=\r\ner see death.&quot;&#8722;JOHN 8:51.\n\n\n"}}
