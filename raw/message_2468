I may be=\r\n pardoned for using the word gods; the\nliteral translation is &quot;the bright o=\r\nnes&quot;. These hymns are dedicated to Fire,\nto the Sun, to Varuna and other de=\r\nities. The titles run: &quot;such-and-such a\nsage composed this verse, dedicated=\r\n to such-and-such a deity&quot;.\n\nIn the tenth chapter comes a peculiar hymn =97=\r\n for the sage is a woman =97 and\nit is dedicated to the one God who is at t=\r\nhe background of all these gods.\nAll the previous hymns are spoken in the t=\r\nhird person, as if someone were\naddressing the deities. But this hymn takes=\r\n a departure: God [as the Devi]\nis speaking for herself. The pronoun used i=\r\ns &quot;I&quot;. &quot;I am the Empress of the\nUniverse, the Fulfiller of all prayers.&quot; (V=\r\nide =93Devi Sukta=94, Rig-Veda\n10.125)\n\nThere is that beautiful story of th=\r\ne great sage Y=E2jnavalkya, the one who\nvisited the kingdom of the great ki=\r\nng Janaka. And there in that assembly of\nthe learned, people came to ask hi=\r\nm questions. One man asked him, &quot;How am I\nto perform this sacrifice?&quot; Anoth=\r\ner asked him, &quot;How am I to perform the\nother sacrifice?&quot; And after he had a=\r\nnswered them, there arose a woman who\nsaid, &quot;These are childish questions. =\r\nNow, have a care: I take these two\narrows, my two questions. Answer them if=\r\n you can, and we will then call you\na sage. The first is: What is the soul?=\r\n The second is: What is God?&quot; (\nBrihad=E2ranyaka Upanishad 3.8.1.-12.)\n\nThu=\r\ns arose in India the great questions about the soul and God, and these\ncame=\r\n from the mouth of a woman. The sage had to pass an examination before\nher,=\r\n and he passed well.\n\nDrinking wine, killing a woman and killing a Brahmin =\r\nare the highest crimes\nin the Hindu religion.\n\nWe come to another class of =\r\nwomen. This mild Hindu race produces fighting\nwomen from time to time. Some=\r\n of you may have heard of the woman [Lakshmi\nBai, Queen of Jhansi] who, dur=\r\ning the Mutiny of 1857, fought against the\nEnglish soldiers and held her ow=\r\nn ground for two years =97 leading modern\narmies, managing batteries and al=\r\nways charging at the head of her army. This\nqueen was a Brahmin girl.\n\nThe =\r\nvery peculiarity of Hindu women, which they have developed and which is\nthe=\r\n idea of their life, is that of the mother. If you enter a Hindu&#39;s home,\nyo=\r\nu will not find the wife to be the same equal companion of the husband as\ny=\r\nou find her here. But when you find the mother, she is the very pillar of\nt=\r\nhe Hindu home. The wife must wait to become the mother, and then she will\nb=\r\ne everything.\n\nIt is alone in the Sanskrit language that we find four words=\r\n meaning husband\nand wife together. It is only in our marriage that they [b=\r\noth] promise,\n&quot;What has been my heart now may be thine&quot;. It is there that w=\r\ne see that the\nhusband is made to look at the Pole-star, touching the hand =\r\nof his wife and\nsaying, &quot;As the Pole-star is fixed in the heavens, so may I=\r\n be fixed in my\naffection to thee&quot;. And the wife does the same.\n\nAryan civi=\r\nlization has been of three types: the Roman, the Greek, the Hindu.\nThe Roma=\r\nn type is the type of organization, conquest, steadiness =97 but\nlacking in=\r\n emotional nature, appreciation of beauty and the higher emotions.\nIts defe=\r\nct is cruelty. The Greek is essentially enthusiastic for the\nbeautiful, but=\r\n frivolous and has a tendency to become immoral. The Hindu\ntype is essentia=\r\nlly metaphysical and religious, but lacking in all the\nelements of organiza=\r\ntion and work.\n\nAnd let me tell you, this should be done by women. There ar=\r\ne some of our\nbooks which say that the next incarnation, and the last (we b=\r\nelieve in ten),\nis to come in the form of a woman.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikis=\r\nource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_9/Lectures_an=\r\nd_Discourses/The_Women_of_India\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasant=\r\nh Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb5b05d44a9b0472e4b4ba\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(=\r\n51, 51, 51); &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;THE WOMEN OF INDIA (New Di=\r\nscoveries, Vol. 2, pp. 411-26.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic=\r\n; &quot;&gt;Volume 9, Lectures and Discourses&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going back to our Ve=\r\ndas =97 they are the oldest literature the world possesses and are composed=\r\n by your and my common ancestors (they were not written in India =97 perhap=\r\ns on the coast of the Baltic, perhaps in Central Asia =97 we do not know).&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Their oldest portion is composed of hymns, and these hymns are to t=\r\nhe gods whom the Aryans worshipped.
