So the love of the deity overcomes all our inhibi=\r\ntions and the person sits there with no thought for past or future, like a =\r\nlover with his lover.\n\nIf you go to Mumbai, by the sea,=C2=A0many lovers si=\r\nt there in the open, caressing each other with no thought as to who is watc=\r\nhing, .......why?\n=C2=A0\nBecause the love=C2=A0causes the inhibition of sha=\r\nme.\nThat is what anybody who goes to the smashaan must have, otherwise unne=\r\nccessarily one thinks of all these things like hens and dogs and forgets al=\r\nl about the real McCoy: the=C2=A0Deities of the smashaan who are also there=\r\n but who don&#39;t really want to be seen by you unless you are especially inte=\r\nrested in them.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nThe sadhana of fire must result in an experience o=\r\nf the deity in your house, experience that first within your own body, then=\r\n bother about a smashaan.\nAnyway the whole Universe is one big smashaan, al=\r\nl the people here are dying, just born and going to die or ....dead.\nAghora=\r\n is the absence of Ghora, becoming an Aghori is a privelege in this world o=\r\nf ours. Never be afraid to call yourself an Aghori if that is what you want=\r\n.\nFear of people labelling you is of no consequence, you came with nothing =\r\nand you will go with nothing.\nWhat is Aghora and what is Vedanta anyway, th=\r\ney are the same for me. \nThe whole Universe and it&#39;s layers exist before us=\r\n, let us all try and perceive those layers using all the tools given to us.=\r\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\nManish\n=C2=A0\n\nOn Wed, Feb 3, 2010 at 8:48 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

He never removed the dress and kept the dr=\r\ness on him all the time and never considered the possibility of changing in=\r\nto a different dress. The idea of removing that dress was unbearable to tha=\r\nt person. He thought he should wear that dress forever.\n\n\nThe dress became =\r\nso dirty and torn that it was time to change it. A person looking extremely=\r\n scary came up to the person oneday to remove the dress. He removed the dre=\r\nss gently if one co-operated with him and tore it apart violently if one fo=\r\nught back. After this scary person removed the old dress, another person ca=\r\nme and gave new clothes. Some people became so afraid and ashamed when they=\r\n lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed around naked. If they did n=\r\not become afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve soon gotten new clothes and slow=\r\nly started to enjoy them as well.\n\n\nThe clothes in this parable are akin to=\r\n the physical body we occupy. The person looking extremely scary is Mahaaka=\r\nala - personification of Death. Creator is the person giving new clothes. N=\r\new body taken in the next birth is the new clothes. Persons running away in=\r\n fear or shame before new clothese are given are like different kinds of sp=\r\nirits.\n\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegarding your visualization of your father using =\r\nreiki, please note that all visualizations of the mind are imagery created =\r\nby one&#39;s conscious and sub-conscious conditionining. One&#39;s beliefs, desires=\r\n, pride, frustrations etc shape the imagery one&#39;s mind visualizes. One cann=\r\not assume it to be accurate. Also, there is no reliable way to know if your=\r\n prayers made any difference to the path taken by your father after the cre=\r\nmation. The curiosity and the tendency to speculate will naturally last for=\r\n sometime, but the bottomline is that you cannot really do much more than s=\r\npeculate.\n\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegarding the hen/cock, it is associated with K=\r\noumaari, among the forms of Divine Mother.

In the Kaashi descr=\r\niptions given by Rajarshi, a sadhaka of Kaala Bhairava was worshipping in f=\r\nuneral pyre at a sacred place with Kaala Bhairava as the guardian deity (Ka=\r\nashi).

And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and inte=\r\nrest. \n\n\nOn the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after strugg=\r\nling with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. =\r\nWhen we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites=\r\n, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai=\r\n - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi H=\r\nomam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if=\r\n I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought ho=\r\nw wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral =\r\n- so that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immed=\r\niately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I=\r\n quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do=\r\n such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started ex=\r\nperiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially\n in/ar=\r\nound the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensatio=\r\nns as equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change=\r\n&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of th=\r\ne mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my me=\r\nntal imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I ask=\r\ned a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now w=\r\nhen I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he=\r\n went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the abo=\r\nve 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. \n\n\nIt was my first time at=\r\n a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead =\r\nbody at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but=\r\n soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset =\r\ntime), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the f=\r\nriends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasa=\r\nna. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I=\r\n would like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; h=\r\nappens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid des=\r\ncription in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I=\r\n think, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!)=\r\n:). \n\n\nI closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents=\r\n, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my ver=\r\ny first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am u=\r\nsed to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I con=\r\ntinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I=\r\n remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the pur=\r\nest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and fou=\r\nnd the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulate=\r\ns some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmaye=\r\ne&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too=\r\n in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to=\r\n give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa,=\r\n I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done\n hom=\r\nam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed=\r\n and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullifica=\r\ntion of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed=\r\n. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I=\r\n have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his j=\r\nourney ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so ple=\r\nase accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please =\r\npardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n\n\nAfter this men=\r\ntal dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I=\r\n thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi =\r\nmantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I=\r\n said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not real=\r\nly matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Ma=\r\na Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully o=\r\nccupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-r=\r\nelate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but=\r\n the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind asso=\r\nciating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewel=\r\nlery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form o=\r\nf Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated ment=\r\nally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of\n my ignorance. I sou=\r\nght permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the contex=\r\nt. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa =\r\nto be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, =\r\nbut to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n\n\nI had a small =\r\nmental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was goin=\r\ng to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n\nAnd then=\r\n I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I w=\r\nas offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offer=\r\nings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the =\r\nmantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha a=\r\nt the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi=\r\n standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her=\r\n feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later,=\r\n I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little =\r\ndistance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/te=\r\nn minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had=\r\n come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find =\r\nthe dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to t=\r\nhink I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I\n continued. Fe=\r\nw minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes =\r\nto see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, bu=\r\nt bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the sm=\r\nashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descendin=\r\ng from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and starte=\r\nd jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to =\r\njump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen wa=\r\ns acting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looke=\r\nd like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire=\r\n hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for fe=\r\nw minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, b=\r\nut nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I=\r\n asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I\n continued the mental ch=\r\nanting. \n\n\nAnd then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to=\r\n leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the =\r\nblack sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walk=\r\ned towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and as=\r\nked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was =\r\nsooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did =\r\nManish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin =\r\nof mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join the=\r\nm, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was =\r\nhappening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that=\r\n I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of=\r\n the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudenc=\r\ne and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the funer=\r\nal\n pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to sim=\r\nply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and=\r\n Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. \n\n\nWhen I w=\r\nas washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now t=\r\nhere was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could be beca=\r\nuse of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). \n\nOn the way back home and for the=\r\n entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I =\r\nfelt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happened was not s=\r\ntrong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. T=\r\nhere was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my=\r\n breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wo=\r\nnder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my own imagination -=\r\n but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was the most beau=\r\ntiful thing. \n\n\nThe next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had =\r\nwitnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat spe=\r\ncial. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for=\r\n our father.\n\n\nNow that it is few days since that incident, I have question=\r\ns like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madl=\r\ny&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fact that=\r\n in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti rea=\r\nlly grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad?

So the love of t=\r\nhe deity overcomes all our inhibitions and the person sits there with no th=\r\nought for past or future, like a lover with his lover.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;If you g=\r\no to Mumbai, by the sea,&nbsp;many lovers sit there in the open, caressing =\r\neach other with no thought as to who is watching, .......why?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Because the love&nbsp;causes the inhibition of shame.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;That is what anybody who goes to the smashaan must have, otherwise un=\r\nneccessarily one thinks of all these things like hens and dogs and forgets =\r\nall about the real McCoy: the&nbsp;Deities of the smashaan who are also the=\r\nre but who don&#39;t really want to be seen by you unless you are especially in=\r\nterested in them.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The sadhana of fire mus=\r\nt result in an experience of the deity in your house, experience that first=\r\n within your own body, then bother about a smashaan.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Anyway the =\r\nwhole Universe is one big smashaan, all the people here are dying, just bor=\r\nn and going to die or ....dead.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Aghora is the absence of Ghora, =\r\nbecoming an Aghori is a privelege in this world of ours.

It is =\r\nnot a full stop or period, but just a comma. Let me tell a parable.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;A person loved one dress and wore it always. He never removed the dress an=\r\nd kept the dress on him all the time and never considered the possibility o=\r\nf changing into a different dress. The idea of removing that dress was unbe=\r\narable to that person. He thought he should wear that dress forever.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;The dress became so dirty and torn that it was time to change it. A perso=\r\nn looking extremely scary came up to the person oneday to remove the dress.=\r\n He removed the dress gently if one co-operated with him and tore it apart =\r\nviolently if one fought back. After this scary person removed the old dress=\r\n, another person came and gave new clothes. Some people became so afraid an=\r\nd ashamed when they lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed around n=\r\naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve soon gotten n=\r\new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The clothes in=\r\n this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy. The person looking e=\r\nxtremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator is the per=\r\nson giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birth is the new clothes=\r\n. Persons running away in fear or shame before new clothese are given are l=\r\nike different kinds of spirits.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding you=\r\nr visualization of your father using reiki, please note that all visualizat=\r\nions of the mind are imagery created by one&#39;s conscious and sub-conscious c=\r\nonditionining. One&#39;s beliefs, desires, pride, frustrations etc shape the im=\r\nagery one&#39;s mind visualizes. One cannot assume it to be accurate. Also, the=\r\nre is no reliable way to know if your prayers made any difference to the pa=\r\nth taken by your father after the cremation. The curiosity and the tendency=\r\n to speculate will naturally last for sometime, but the bottomline is that =\r\nyou cannot really do much more than speculate.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Regarding the hen/cock, it is associated with Koumaari, among the forms o=\r\nf Divine Mother. In the 8th chapter of Chandipath, the Maatrikas (Mothers) =\r\nare described (Braahmi, Maaheswari, Koumari, Vaishnavi etc). Koumari is acc=\r\nompanied by peacock and cock. In the Kaashi descriptions given by Rajarshi,=\r\n a sadhaka of Kaala Bhairava was worshipping in funeral pyre at a sacred pl=\r\nace with Kaala Bhairava as the guardian deity (Kaashi). Dogs are associated=\r\n with Kaala Bhairava. Perhaps the place you went to and you yourself have s=\r\nome blessing of Koumaari.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;-----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrol=\r\noger.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F=\r\nilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n--- On &lt;b&gt;Wed, 2/3/10, sharadsap &lt;=\r\ni&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:sharadsap@...&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dsharadsap@...&quot;&gt;sharadsap@yahoo=\r\n.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px sol=\r\nid rgb(16, 16, 255); padding-left: 5px; margin-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: sharadsap =\r\n&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:sharadsap@...&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dsharadsap@...&quot;&gt;sharadsap@....=\r\nuk&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Experience at a Smashaan Bhumi&lt;br&gt;\nTo=\r\n: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, February 3, 2010, 6:19 AM&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dear Members,&lt;br&gt;After =\r\na lot of deliberation, I decided to write this note to share an experience =\r\nwith the members on this forum - hoping that doing so would elicit some fee=\r\ndback in the form of further guidance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nI am a student of Vipassana=\r\n and have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a si=\r\nmple version of Durga Homam) &#39;almost&#39; regularly for a year now. And I have =\r\nbeen reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;O=\r\nn the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling with =\r\nrenal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we we=\r\nre taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind =\r\nwas constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) =\r\nwritten by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a =\r\nfuneral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would g=\r\net to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderfu=\r\nl it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that =\r\nhe would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I =\r\nhad an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly r=\r\neminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a fe=\r\nat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing=\r\n intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially\n in/around the a=\r\nbdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equa=\r\nnimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon af=\r\nter, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, an=\r\nd may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental image=\r\nry. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a frien=\r\nd, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I thin=\r\nk of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away=\r\n saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 thing=\r\ns and in addition he bought some ghee. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;It was my first time at a s=\r\nmashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body=\r\n at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soo=\r\nn after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time=\r\n), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the frien=\r\nds/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. =\r\nI asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I wou=\r\nld like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happe=\r\nns. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descrip=\r\ntion in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I thi=\r\nnk, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;I closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparen=\r\nts, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my v=\r\nery first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am=\r\n used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I c=\r\nontinued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough.=\r\n I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the p=\r\nurest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and f=\r\nound the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumula=\r\ntes some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalma=\r\nyee&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement t=\r\noo in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want =\r\nto give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Ma=\r\na, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done\n h=\r\nomam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believ=\r\ned and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullifi=\r\ncation of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same spe=\r\ned. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that=\r\n I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his=\r\n journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so p=\r\nlease accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Pleas=\r\ne pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;After =\r\nthis mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even =\r\nthough I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ON=\r\nLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my=\r\n mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should =\r\nnot really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visu=\r\nalise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and=\r\n fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying=\r\n to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his f=\r\neet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my m=\r\nind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skelet=\r\nal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is th=\r\ne form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repea=\r\nted mentally the thoughts about the desire and\n surrendering of my ignoranc=\r\ne. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning th=\r\ne context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I t=\r\nold Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to =\r\nbe fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nI had a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about w=\r\nhat I was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessin=\r\ngs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried =\r\nvisualising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually=\r\n visualise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with the swah=\r\na at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam=\r\n without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visuali=\r\nsation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visua=\r\nlise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. =\r\nA few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and t=\r\nhrew it at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I=\r\n think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted t=\r\no see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I\n opened my ey=\r\nes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it=\r\n was silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but neverthe=\r\nless I continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering=\r\n and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, a=\r\ns it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of=\r\n land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not s=\r\nure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burnin=\r\ng funeral and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as i=\r\nf the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt=\r\n, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the fire pa=\r\nrticles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result=\r\n of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I wat=\r\nched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself,\n thinking a black hen cam=\r\ne instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it is ti=\r\nme for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I con=\r\ntinued the mental chanting. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;And then my cousin signalled me that i=\r\nt was time for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start walking to=\r\nwards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plast=\r\nic packet itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from M=\r\naa for my impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offered onl=\r\ny three times, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer and star=\r\nted wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into=\r\n the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked m=\r\ne to hurry up and join them, and even though it was dark and he would not h=\r\nave seen exactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I did no=\r\nt want anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped bac=\r\nk, emptied the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised to the =\r\nDevi again for my impudence and requested her to accept this final offering=\r\n and threw it at the\n funeral pyre from a distance. I thanked her once agai=\r\nn and requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (inc=\r\nluding the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joi=\r\nned the group. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;When I was washing my hands and feet at the well, I=\r\n looked at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, which was=\r\n not there before (could be because of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt very very ver=\r\ny quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement, because =\r\nthe thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgo=\r\ntten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within m=\r\ny existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as I could. No judgem=\r\nent, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have =\r\nbeen a product of my own imagination - but the silence was real. And this e=\r\nxperience of silence was the most beautiful thing. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The next day, I=\r\n heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but the o=\r\nne yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my brother =\r\nwas speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Now that i=\r\nt is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen too, =\r\nas sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is th=\r\nere a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perform h=\r\nen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to=\r\n my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (as opp=\r\nosed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day when=\r\n I was channeling some reiki to him? &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;I am not sure if these questi=\r\nons can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the =\r\nabove experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I w=\r\nould be most appreciative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the=\r\n continued inspiration. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Also, apologies for the length of the note=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regards&lt;br&gt;Sharad&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;min-height: 0pt;=\r\n color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/t=\r\nable&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-443529872-1265386274=:54379--\r\n\n"}}
