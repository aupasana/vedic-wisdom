The thing =\r\nis that please understand, the difference between your surface personality =\r\nand your true self( which you realize eventually by penance).\n\nSadhana is b=\r\nasically a process in which you/deity kill your&quot;self&quot;. Let us say that you =\r\nare &quot;Puneet/Nikhil/Gaurav/Chetna/Savitri/Mark/Andrew/John/Ali&quot;. You see, al=\r\nl ahutis in the homam are actually meant to be sacrifice of parts of this p=\r\nersonality and eventually the whole personality in the purna -ahuti where i=\r\nn you sacrifice your entire self to the deity in the fire. Actually the pur=\r\nna- ahuti is your funeral, if you are able to look at it in that manner.\n\nP=\r\nlease understand that all joys and sorrows are limited to your own false se=\r\nlf. What you think is the best for yourself ,actually is more often than no=\r\nt that good. It might be good for your limited self, but mind you , it isn&#39;=\r\nt good for &quot;you&quot;. And to tell you very honestly, god doesn&#39;t really care mu=\r\nch for your limited self and its endless desires, wants, desires. Mr god wa=\r\nnts you to be out of this convoluted mess, and be back with him/her/it ASAP=\r\n and the only way you are coming back is when the false self is completely =\r\nfree.\n\nNow how is that? You pay off Karma&#39;s. Now how the hell do you that? =\r\nYou suffer and stay silent. You do not make a cry and hue about it and cont=\r\ninuously chant. Crying and shouting actually makes god sentimental and you =\r\nextract out some stuff, maybe in the short run, but it will screw the &quot;real=\r\n you&quot; in the long run.\n\nPlease understand, none can escape suffering, for i=\r\nt is the only way you can pay back. You have to pay. When suffering, contin=\r\nuously remind yourself of your own confusion as to who you are and keep doi=\r\nng simple penance. The navagraha&#39;s and especially my beloved Mr Saturn are =\r\nonly doing their duty to get you back on track. Their duty is to break your=\r\n shackles, now whether they decide to do it by breaking your back, well, it=\r\n is their will.\n\nWhen Mr Ram, Arjun, Karna, couldn&#39;t escape, who the hell a=\r\nre we guys exactly?\n\nAnd what actually is suffering?\nbasic lack of acceptan=\r\nce of your own destiny and fate. Suffering is attributed to a sense of &quot; Wh=\r\ny ME?&quot; and &quot;why not ME?&quot;, &quot; why MY things were taken&quot; and &quot; Why I don&#39;t hav=\r\ne these things&quot;\n\nKundalini shundalini is all too far away for 95 out of 100=\r\n of us. Let&#39;s leave those, because unless you experience it yourself , you =\r\nare bound to confuse yourself and attribute mundane things to experiences t=\r\no people who are now progressed and thus digging yourself into a bigger hol=\r\ne. Apart from one book here and there, you won&#39;t know who is saying what. A=\r\nnd who do you trust, the author is human after all.\n\n&quot;You&quot; will have to die=\r\n, no matter what if you ever hope to reach god. How do you die?\nWhen your s=\r\nupposed joys and things are taken from you, do you ever look at god, and cr=\r\ny back. That is merely the beginning. Because without these things taken fr=\r\nom you , you will never ever look at god, unless you are some hi-fi being f=\r\nrom your previous birth. once you look and understand the purpose behind it=\r\n all, your cries will stop, and you will actually be able to laugh at your =\r\nown silliness in the beginning. Homam accelerates this progress.\n\nHere are =\r\nsome wise words from Mr Nanak ------\n&quot;If you have to reach heaven, you have=\r\n to die&quot;\nor\n&quot;Everyone wants heaven, nobody wants to die&quot;\n\nI think then ther=\r\ne was this another point of doing homam on somebody&#39;&#39;s half. Here is a true=\r\n story, once a girl who was facing incremental difficulty in getting marrie=\r\nd to the boy of her dreams due to her parents rejection, requested another =\r\nwoman who regularly does homam to do something. Hearing her story, the homa=\r\nm waali woman , decided to do a homam on the girl&#39;s behalf. here is what wa=\r\ns said to god when he was present in the fire.=C2=A0 =C2=A0\n\n&quot; Dear God, I =\r\ndedicate this one to the girl who suffers. I can&#39;t see her getting beat by =\r\nher parents and her lying in torment due to such and such problem. eventual=\r\nly she is you only, why do you make yourself suffer so much? If the marriag=\r\ne is ordained for her, remove obstacles, and get her married, and if it is =\r\nnot ordained, break her ties off with the boy and get her parents to send h=\r\ner off wherever you deem fit. Don&#39;t satiate the desires of the personality,=\r\n do what is best for the being powering the personality and if that best is=\r\n that she is not with the boy of her dreams, so be it. but stop suffering t=\r\nhrough her&quot;\n\nThe next week, all her ties with the boy were severed, she got=\r\n engaged to someone else, and is married now.\nWhat is the lesson??\nThe girl=\r\n was wanting based on her own belief that she wants this and that, but the =\r\nhomam waali woman was little more surrender -ful to god and left the whole =\r\nscenario. The whole damn point of any penance is end of your constant belie=\r\nf and desires based on your own limited self. And if you keep on harping, w=\r\nell it defeats the purpose.\n\nRegarding the lower ethereal beings being easi=\r\nly satiated and giving you what you want=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6\nHave you serious=\r\nly considered the price you will pay??\nThis time around mr Bhupendra Janmad=\r\nas may get some money or the job,\nbut next time lets say your are born as m=\r\naithali gupta , the price you will have to pay will be too immense.\nThen yo=\r\nu will ask &quot;why me?&quot; and again start the whole process, thus sliding furthe=\r\nr and further.\nDon&#39;t go down those routes, this is not a one birth game, yo=\r\nu won&#39;t be dead, no matter how many personalities you may shed and die in, =\r\nyou will still be there and boy you will pay.\n\nAnd the fees of the ethereal=\r\n beings? I can&#39;t shake my head enough.\nLets skip ethereal beings , access t=\r\no them is anyways blocked for 99 out 100 for us.\n\nAap ke toh naam mein hi s=\r\nir, janmadas hai, janmo ke das, aap sarne ke liye aaye hain, sar li jiye, j=\r\nab achha hona hoga, ho jayega, if you think you can force a change, forget =\r\nit.\n\nAur aapki saran is only limited to bhupinder, yeh bechara toh kabhi bh=\r\ni mar jaayega, jald hi naak mein rui aur muh mein ghee, aur para hoga jal r=\r\naha hoga, lekin tum reh jaaoge.\n\nKeep doing your homams, they will help &quot;yo=\r\nu&quot;, trust god on this.\n\nRegarding the prarbadha karma&#39;s, sanchit karma&#39;s an=\r\nd everything else, you will end up confusing yourself, seriously, it is a m=\r\ness to understand without penance and a deity or a deity like guru. Everybo=\r\ndy is trying to calculate based on whatever information about the system th=\r\ney have. Here is a fun fact:=C2=A0 _--------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\nYOU CAN&#39;T CALCULATE.\n\nTh=\r\nis system is too layered, too complex, and without you in touch with an adv=\r\nance being and god, forget it. Forget all of this. Focus on god as much as =\r\none can. And please let go of this expectation that worshipping god can get=\r\n you the monies, the comforts. If actual progress is there, quite the oppos=\r\nite is going to happen in most cases, but there is no formula and quite a l=\r\not of good can happen.\nIt just depends on what god decides. If you are mean=\r\nt to enjoy, you will, if no oh well, that too.\n\nDekho bhaiyon aur beheno, p=\r\nichle janmon ka ab toh kuch nahin kar sakte woh kaand to ho gaye, ab iss ba=\r\nar sambhal jaao, aur bhagwan ki taraf rukh karlo, is baar mauka hai, nahin =\r\ntoh next time around again the same routine ------\nborn crying\nsucking on b=\r\nreast\nplaying with toy\nhitting puberty\ngoing mad with lust\ncareer issues\njo=\r\nb issues\nhealth issues\nwife\nchild\nchildren\nHeart attack\nPHAT!\n\nand again cr=\r\nying without a body what did i do , what did i do, making the pledge in the=\r\n womb, that god i&#39;ll worship you and coming out then forgetting everything.=\r\n The circle won&#39;t end. It just won&#39;t end.\n\nAnd do it not for exiting, do it=\r\n for the love of god. Develop this love, how can you then afford to stay aw=\r\nay from your lover.\n\nIf the lover/owner of your &quot;self&quot; decides that you so =\r\n&quot;suffer&quot; so that you can visit him/her, oh well then Suffer.\n\nYour sufferin=\r\ng is actually false, stop crying &quot;me, me, me, me , why me etc&quot; and you will=\r\n likely move to where you are trying to be sent. Continue with this radio, =\r\nyou are digging yourself a grave. You wont shutup in a day, it will take ye=\r\nars, so let it, but develop it.\n\n\nJai Shree Ram!

Because without these things taken from you , you=\r\n will never ever look at god, unless you are some hi-fi being from your pre=\r\nvious birth. once you look and understand the purpose behind it all, your c=\r\nries will stop, and you will actually be able to laugh at your own sillines=\r\ns in the beginning. Homam accelerates this progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are some w=\r\nise words from Mr Nanak ------&lt;br&gt;&quot;If you have to reach heaven, you have to=\r\n die&quot;&lt;br&gt;or&lt;br&gt;&quot;Everyone wants heaven, nobody wants to die&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think =\r\nthen there was this another\n point of doing homam on somebody&#39;&#39;s half. Here=\r\n is a true story, once a girl who was facing incremental difficulty in gett=\r\ning married to the boy of her dreams due to her parents rejection, requeste=\r\nd another woman who regularly does homam to do something. Hearing her story=\r\n, the homam waali woman , decided to do a homam on the girl&#39;s behalf. here =\r\nis what was said to god when he was present in the fire.&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&quot; Dear God, I dedicate this one to the girl who suffers. I can&#39;t see her =\r\ngetting beat by her parents and her lying in torment due to such and such p=\r\nroblem. eventually she is you only, why do you make yourself suffer so much=\r\n? If the marriage is ordained for her, remove obstacles, and get her marrie=\r\nd, and if it is not ordained, break her ties off with the boy and get her p=\r\narents to send her off wherever you deem fit. Don&#39;t satiate the desires of =\r\nthe personality, do what is best for the being powering the personality and=\r\n if that best is that\n she is not with the boy of her dreams, so be it. but=\r\n stop suffering through her&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next week, all her ties with the bo=\r\ny were severed, she got engaged to someone else, and is married now.&lt;br&gt;Wha=\r\nt is the lesson??&lt;br&gt;The girl was wanting based on her own belief that she =\r\nwants this and that, but the homam waali woman was little more surrender -f=\r\nul to god and left the whole scenario. The whole damn point of any penance =\r\nis end of your constant belief and desires based on your own limited self. =\r\nAnd if you keep on harping, well it defeats the purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding t=\r\nhe lower ethereal beings being easily satiated and giving you what you want=\r\n=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6&lt;br&gt;Have you seriously considered the price you will pay?=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;This time around mr Bhupendra Janmadas may get some money or the job,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;but next time lets say your are born as maithali gupta , the price you w=\r\nill have to pay will be too immense.&lt;br&gt;Then you will ask &quot;why me?&quot; and aga=\r\nin start the whole process,\n thus sliding further and further.&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t go =\r\ndown those routes, this is not a one birth game, you won&#39;t be dead, no matt=\r\ner how many personalities you may shed and die in, you will still be there =\r\nand boy you will pay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And the fees of the ethereal beings? I can&#39;t s=\r\nhake my head enough.&lt;br&gt;Lets skip ethereal beings , access to them is anywa=\r\nys blocked for 99 out 100 for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aap ke toh naam mein hi sir, janma=\r\ndas hai, janmo ke das, aap sarne ke liye aaye hain, sar li jiye, jab achha =\r\nhona hoga, ho jayega, if you think you can force a change, forget it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Aur aapki saran is only limited to bhupinder, yeh bechara toh kabhi bhi m=\r\nar jaayega, jald hi naak mein rui aur muh mein ghee, aur para hoga jal raha=\r\n hoga, lekin tum reh jaaoge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep doing your homams, they will help =\r\n&quot;you&quot;, trust god on this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Regarding the prarbadha karma&#39;s, sanchit k=\r\narma&#39;s and everything else, you will end up confusing yourself, seriously, =\r\nit is a mess to\n understand without penance and a deity or a deity like gur=\r\nu. Everybody is trying to calculate based on whatever information about the=\r\n system they have. Here is a fun fact:&nbsp; _--------&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;YOU CAN&#39;T CALCULATE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This system is too layered, too complex,=\r\n and without you in touch with an advance being and god, forget it. Forget =\r\nall of this. Focus on god as much as one can. And please let go of this exp=\r\nectation that worshipping god can get you the monies, the comforts. If actu=\r\nal progress is there, quite the opposite is going to happen in most cases, =\r\nbut there is no formula and quite a lot of good can happen.&lt;br&gt;It just depe=\r\nnds on what god decides. If you are meant to enjoy, you will, if no oh well=\r\n, that too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dekho bhaiyon aur beheno, pichle janmon ka ab toh kuch n=\r\nahin kar sakte woh kaand to ho gaye, ab iss baar sambhal jaao, aur bhagwan =\r\nki taraf rukh karlo, is baar mauka hai, nahin toh next time around again th=\r\ne same\n routine ------&lt;br&gt;born crying&lt;br&gt;sucking on breast&lt;br&gt;playing with =\r\ntoy&lt;br&gt;hitting puberty&lt;br&gt;going mad with lust&lt;br&gt;career issues&lt;br&gt;job issue=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;health issues&lt;br&gt;wife&lt;br&gt;child&lt;br&gt;children&lt;br&gt;Heart attack&lt;br&gt;PHAT!&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;and again crying without a body what did i do , what did i do, making =\r\nthe pledge in the womb, that god i&#39;ll worship you and coming out then forge=\r\ntting everything. The circle won&#39;t end. It just won&#39;t end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And do it=\r\n not for exiting, do it for the love of god. Develop this love, how can you=\r\n then afford to stay away from your lover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the lover/owner of you=\r\nr &quot;self&quot; decides that you so &quot;suffer&quot; so that you can visit him/her, oh wel=\r\nl then Suffer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your suffering is actually false, stop crying &quot;me, me=\r\n, me, me , why me etc&quot; and you will likely move to where you are trying to =\r\nbe sent. Continue with this radio, you are digging yourself a grave. You wo=\r\nnt shutup in a day, it will take years, so let it, but develop\n it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Jai Shree Ram! Jai Shree Radheya!&lt;br&gt;Har lo Mahadev&lt;br&gt;(P.S. - rough tr=\r\nanslation - loot lo mahadev, loot lo in yaadon ko ki &quot;main&quot; yeh tha/thi, sa=\r\nb khatam only mahadev left, yay!!)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1131079492-1301604748-1362661345=:83581--\r\n\n"}}
