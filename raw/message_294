I see your point though I do not completely agree to either of the veiw points or logics.\n   \n  Yes the interpretation of the shatras are in unison. But then Sri Yukteshwar also mentions that the post the mahabharata war, the interpretation of the scriptures as well as the manu smriti was misguided by wrong connotations which resulted in the error having creeped in. \n   \n  Actually what is interesting in the theory is the concept of the binray oppostise for the sun. Generally science at this point does not accept such a view,(neitehr does it categorically reject the same), its still open to speculation and research. And astronomy being the kind of science that it is, enough data or sameples cannot really be gathered for proper testing since the time scales are so vast. The other debatable issue with Sri Yukteshwars theory is that the precission of the equinoxes should be around 25,770 years which is in variace with the 24000 years scheme given by him. But then the equinoxes may not( one of the scientic views) move at fixed rates or the motion maybe such that over sufficient theoritical distances in space it averages out to create a 24000 years scheme. \n   \n  Anyway only future can tell for sure what is correct and what is not.  As per his theory the Kalki Avatar will come when the equinox will reach a certain point in the leo aquarius axis. \n   \n  -Regards\n   Rajarshi\n   \n  \n\n&quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

To think that, THAT supersoul specifically\n&gt; blessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong\n&gt; calcuation becomes a little difficult to comprehend.\n\nWell, all shastras are clear. Common Hindu understanding is clear. Millions \nof Hindus mention the current yuga as Kali yuga before doing any pooja and \nreligiously keep count of the years that passed in Kali yuga. Moreover, when \nI see the happenings in the world and how dharma is deteriorating compared \nto even a few hundred years back, I cannot think that anything other than \nKali yuga is running right now. I reject the notion that Kali yuga is only \n1200 years and that we are in Dwapara yuga right now.\n\nEven great souls can advance incorrect or partially correct understanding at \ntimes, because there is some purpose.\n\nI reject the teaching of Yukteshwar Maharaj related to yugas and yet retain \nrespect for him and his lineage.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, May 04, 2008 4:51 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n\n&gt; Dear Mr Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Was going through some older posts in this community when I came\n&gt; across this mail. This is regarding the metion of Sri Yukteshwar\n&gt; Giris calculations of the yugas.\n&gt;\n&gt; Firstly let me clarify that I personally am no vedic scholar, nor\n&gt; can I read sanskrit. So I really have no idea of what or who is\n&gt; right. But I had the good fortune of reading the book &quot;The Holy\n&gt; Science&quot; where he refers to this calcuation of yugas. Now you must\n&gt; have read in th autobiography of a yogi that Sri Lahiri Mahasaya had\n&gt; instructed Sri Yukteshwar Giri to go to the Kumb Mela so that he\n&gt; could meet the Mahamauni. And later after Sri Yukteshwar Giri\n&gt; Maharaj had completed his book, that very day he met the Mahamauni\n&gt; who was sitting under a tree with his disciples. Infact the incident\n&gt; goes this way that as the Mahamauni had promised Yukteshwar Giri\n&gt; that he would meet him once the book get written. So as Sri\n&gt; Yukteshwar Giri was passing by in the morning to take a bath\n&gt; suddenly he finds the Mahamauni with his disciples under a tree. And\n&gt; the first thing that the Mahamauni tells Sri Yukteshwar giri is to\n&gt; to bring perfection in his vision by increasing his meditation\n&gt; because had he done so he should have been able to see Him(the\n&gt; Mahamauni) and his disciple inside the sunlight. Anyway that is\n&gt; beside the point.\n&gt; What I was wondering is that, if the calculation of yugas as given\n&gt; by Sri Yukteshwar is wrong then that means even the Mahamauni Babaji\n&gt; blessing the book and meeting him in kumb and again later is also\n&gt; wrong. I mean all these people are way way way way ahead of me, but\n&gt; even among them Mahamauni is just not another sadhaka or a yogi. He\n&gt; is the Babaji. As Lahiri Mahasay mentions in his dairy.&quot;budhe babai\n&gt; kisun hai&quot;.. Lahiri Mahasay used to refer to Babaji as budhe baba.\n&gt; And Kisun was Krishna. To think that, THAT supersoul specifically\n&gt; blessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong\n&gt; calcuation becomes a little difficult to comprehend.\n&gt; I of my own have no knowledge or learning to be able to decide what\n&gt; is right and what is not. I just voiced a concern of mine from the\n&gt; point of view of an ordinary individual who considers the Mahamauni\n&gt; to be one with God himself. If He is can make such a mistake, then\n&gt; God is not really that omnipotent I guess.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

They are arranged in their\n&gt; current form by\n&gt;&gt; Vyasa about 5,000 years back. But they were revealed to rishis\n&gt; millions of\n&gt;&gt; years back. Yogis have been meditating on verses from Vedas and\n&gt; realizing\n&gt;&gt; universal truths represented by them for millions of years.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, wasnt\n&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any philosophy before that?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The modern chronology of Hindu scriptures was created by people\n&gt; with heavy\n&gt;&gt; biases and agendas. Darshanas are not a few thousand of years old.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We had Veda(s), vedanta, vedangas, darshanas etc for millions of\n&gt; years.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -What is the divison of the ages(yugas). Again there is a lot of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; confusion here as some say they are thousands of years long but\n&gt; others\n&gt;&gt; &gt; say millions of years long. Can you please explain it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Krita/Sat yuga is 1,728,000 years long. Treta yuga is 1,296,000\n&gt; years long.\n&gt;&gt; Dwapara yuga is 864,000 years long. Current Kali yuga started\n&gt; about 5,000\n&gt;&gt; years back and it is 432,000 years long.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yukeshwar maharaj (guru of Paramahamsa Yogananda) took a different\n&gt; view,\n&gt;&gt; where all the above numbers are divided by 360. He is a great yogi\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; belongs to a great lineage and I have the highest respect. But he\n&gt; is simply\n&gt;&gt; wrong on this. A yogi can experience all times and spaces. In\n&gt; fact, time is\n&gt;&gt; a very weird concept, even though it seems natural to us when we\n&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; completely bound to this body in this particular space-time\n&gt; continuum. When\n&gt;&gt; a yogi enters nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no space and time for\n&gt; him/her.\n&gt;&gt; The space-time continuum experienced by a yogi in different realms\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; consciousness are different. I submit that Yukteshwar Maharaj made\n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; mistake, either intentionally or unintentionally, in drawing\n&gt; conclusions\n&gt;&gt; from his experiences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Traditionally, we mention the number of years that passed since\n&gt; Kali yuga\n&gt;&gt; started, at the start of every ritual. The number mentioned (about\n&gt; 5,000\n&gt;&gt; years) matches with the astronomical dating of Mahabharata. All\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; astronomical combinations mentioned by Vyasa in Mahabharata\n&gt; occurred in that\n&gt;&gt; sequence in a consistent manner about 5,000 years back. There were\n&gt; tens of\n&gt;&gt; those eventsand they occurred in that sequence only once in the\n&gt; last 7,400\n&gt;&gt; years. For sure, Krishna lived about 5,000 years back and Kali\n&gt; yuga started\n&gt;&gt; then.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar\n&gt; incarnation).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real\n&gt; story\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and is there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation.\n&gt; Also\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can you please illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All the stories of Puranas are metaphors of some internal\n&gt; happenings and\n&gt;&gt; also real stories at the same time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each of is a microcosm of the entire universe. Thus, macro events\n&gt; described\n&gt;&gt; in scriptures happen microcosmically inside us. It is equally\n&gt; valid to see\n&gt;&gt; them as real stories and as metaphors. When one&#39;s self-\n&gt; consciousness ascends\n&gt;&gt; to a particular realm of consciousness, it is actually possible to\n&gt; see one\n&gt;&gt; of these stories actually happening. In our normal realm of\n&gt; consciousness,\n&gt;&gt; these are just stories and we can only understand them\n&gt; intellectually.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are Jupiter, his wife Tara, Moon and Mercury externally.\n&gt; Internally,\n&gt;&gt; they represent the intelligence, the expression of intelligence,\n&gt; mind and\n&gt;&gt; learning ability (respectively). The story of Jupiter&#39;s wife Tara\n&gt; begetting\n&gt;&gt; a child (Mercury) through Moon is real. It is also a metaphor for\n&gt; the fact\n&gt;&gt; that internally, mind combines with the expression of intelligence\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; generate learning ability.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regarding Varaha avatara, here is my view. Hiranya means gold and\n&gt; also\n&gt;&gt; great. Aksha has many meanings, but one of them is &quot;sense organs&quot;.\n&gt; The demon\n&gt;&gt; Hiranyaksha symbolizes the mighty sense organs. He stole Mother\n&gt; earth and\n&gt;&gt; sunk Her in water. Mother earth is symbolized by Kundalini\n&gt;&gt; (self-consciousness, microcosmic representation of the divine\n&gt; Mother within\n&gt;&gt; each person) who is normally in the Mooladhara chakra (earth\n&gt; element). When\n&gt;&gt; a sadhaka is caught by the mighty sense organs, Kundalini\n&gt;&gt; (self-consciousness) is stuck in the samsara saagara (the ocean of\n&gt; material\n&gt;&gt; life) and loses balance. Lord Vishnu (sattwa guna in a person)\n&gt; takes the\n&gt;&gt; form of a boar and comes from the nostril of the creator. He digs\n&gt; in and\n&gt;&gt; rescues earth from Hiranyaksha. When sattwa guna enters the praana\n&gt; (life\n&gt;&gt; force - nostril reference) of a person, dives down to Mooladhara\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; destroys the attachment to the mighty sense organs there, the\n&gt; Mother is\n&gt;&gt; freed and can move up to Merge with the Lord (i.e. self-\n&gt; consciousness\n&gt;&gt; ascending to merge with Brahman). Basically Varaha avatara\n&gt; represents the\n&gt;&gt; sattwa guna in a person that tries to give detachment from the\n&gt; perceptions\n&gt;&gt; of the sense organs and then make the calm praana dives down to\n&gt; Mooladhara\n&gt;&gt; to give balance to Kundalini to move up.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me how\n&gt; is it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; going to affect my spiritual life. My fiancee&#39;s Birth Details-\n&gt; 02 Oct\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Good luck with your marital life!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces from March\n&gt; 2008\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if\n&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can explain me which one is correct.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Drigdasa was taught incorrectly by some teachers earlier, based on\n&gt; wrongly\n&gt;&gt; remembered teachings of tradition. Most softwares (including my\n&gt; own\n&gt;&gt; Jagannatha Hora software) calculate it incorrectly. My personal\n&gt; version of\n&gt;&gt; the software (to be released to the public later) calculates it\n&gt; based on\n&gt;&gt; Parasara&#39;s teachings and I believe it to be correct based on my\n&gt; study of the\n&gt;&gt; charts of several spiritualists. I taught it in the recent two\n&gt; issues of\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Jyotish Digest&quot; magazine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Next thing is about meditation, can you please advise me any good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation postures or any book where I can learn some.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t worry about technicalities too much. The most fundamental\n&gt; thing is\n&gt;&gt; that your back and neck should be erect, straight and not tense at\n&gt; the same\n&gt;&gt; time. You may sit on floor cross-legged preferably or even sit in\n&gt; a chair if\n&gt;&gt; you have weak knees. The most important thing is the back and neck\n&gt; being\n&gt;&gt; erect. Secondly, close the eyes, otherwise a lot of fire is wasted\n&gt; in the\n&gt;&gt; act of seeing. That agni is better used for other things! Then\n&gt; repeat the\n&gt;&gt; mantra. If your focus is wandering elsewhere, don&#39;t panic and\n&gt; worry too\n&gt;&gt; much. Just bring back your mind to the mantra. Try your best to\n&gt; focus on the\n&gt;&gt; mantra. With time, you will succeed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally remember - no effort is wasted. Even an effort that seems\n&gt; to be not\n&gt;&gt; yielding results is actually working towards a final result. If a\n&gt; straw of\n&gt;&gt; the grass makes the scales tilt, it does not mean all the objects\n&gt; placed on\n&gt;&gt; the scale previously were unneeded! Just have faith and keep doing\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 17, 2008 4:22 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hari OM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; First of all I would like to thank you for the illustrative and\n&gt; quick\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reply.

People find their path, make some\n&gt; progress\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and then\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feel lost again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to March 2017.\n&gt; Taking\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Cancer\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house will be\n&gt; strong with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in lagna. The\n&gt; 8th\n&gt;&gt; &gt; house\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords Saturn and\n&gt; Rahu\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th house axis\n&gt;&gt; &gt; strongly\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually speaking.\n&gt; Just\n&gt;&gt; &gt; keep\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and keep doing your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and vimsamsa. This\n&gt; shows\n&gt;&gt; &gt; devotion\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is empty and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mercury owns\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests that worship\n&gt; of Lord\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast spiritual\n&gt; progress.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@ (http://ashramaustralia.net) and\n&gt; ask\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia. Swami Suresh\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Battar is a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are available\n&gt; there,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he may be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or circle\n&gt; shaped\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vessel\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not iron) can be\n&gt; used.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Good\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct experience\n&gt; through\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender\n&gt; to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Lord,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perceive in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we\n&gt; keep\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly\n&gt; attracted to or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In\n&gt;&gt; &gt; addition, if\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too\n&gt; helps.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a commentary on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita by\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a unique\n&gt; saint,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic and\n&gt; adwaitic\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings coming from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and writings\n&gt; coming\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than 700\n&gt; years ago,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physical\n&gt; body at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the age\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT read a more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; competent or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is quite an\n&gt; inspired\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work. A\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good English translation of this work is available at\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-\n&gt; Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; opinion.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to come with\n&gt; him to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; forest,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the presence of\n&gt; Maharshi\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned people,\n&gt; Maharshi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Vasishtha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His teachings\n&gt; were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; captured\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. There\n&gt; is an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; inspired\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; English translation available at\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-\n&gt; Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?\n&gt; ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Various Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful reading too.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although this is my first writing in this group but i have\n&gt; been\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reading the threads for almost one year now. And you people\n&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many times but\n&gt; now i\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what brought me here(\n&gt; and to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember the thread\n&gt; where\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of Sani and\n&gt; now i have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this thread and\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other sources but with that i can not really make any\n&gt; decisions of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are many\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and\n&gt; guide me i\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there and doing\n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this was random and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my\n&gt; spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of\n&gt; reading more to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from\n&gt; where to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a\n&gt; regular\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the\n&gt; homa kundam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone\n&gt; tell me\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i want to ask but if\n&gt; someone\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would be very thankful to him\n&gt; and i will\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n\n\n\n                           \n\n\n  Aditya Hrudayam punyam Sarva satru Vinasanam\n   Jayavaham Japet Nityam Akshyayyam paramam sivam ||\n\n\n       \n---------------------------------\n Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more.

I see your point though I do not completely agree to either of the veiw points or logics.&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Yes the interpretation of the shatras are in unison. But then Sri Yukteshwar also mentions that the post the mahabharata war, the interpretation of the scriptures as well as the manu smriti was misguided by wrong connotations which resulted in the error having creeped in. &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Actually what is interesting in the theory is the concept of the binray oppostise for the sun. Generally science at this point does not accept such a view,(neitehr does it categorically reject the same), its still open to speculation and research. And astronomy being the&nbsp;kind of science that it is,&nbsp;enough data or sameples cannot really be gathered for proper testing since the time scales are so vast.&nbsp;The other debatable issue with Sri Yukteshwars theory is that the\n precission of the equinoxes should be around 25,770 years which is in variace with the 24000 years scheme given by him. But then the equinoxes may not( one of the scientic views) move at fixed rates or the motion maybe such that over sufficient theoritical distances in space it averages out to create a 24000 years scheme. &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;Anyway only future can tell for sure what is correct and what is not.&nbsp; As per his theory the Kalki Avatar will come when the equinox will reach a certain point in the leo aquarius axis. &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I mean all these people are way way way way ahead of me, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; even among them Mahamauni is just not another sadhaka or a yogi. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the Babaji.

To think that, THAT supersoul specifically&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong&lt;BR&gt;&gt; calcuation becomes a little difficult to comprehend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Well, all shastras are clear. Common Hindu understanding is clear. Millions\n &lt;BR&gt;of Hindus mention the current yuga as Kali yuga before doing any pooja and &lt;BR&gt;religiously keep count of the years that passed in Kali yuga. Moreover, when &lt;BR&gt;I see the happenings in the world and how dharma is deteriorating compared &lt;BR&gt;to even a few hundred years back, I cannot think that anything other than &lt;BR&gt;Kali yuga is running right now. I reject the notion that Kali yuga is only &lt;BR&gt;1200 years and that we are in Dwapara yuga right now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even great souls can advance incorrect or partially correct understanding at &lt;BR&gt;times, because there is some purpose.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I reject the teaching of Yukteshwar Maharaj related to yugas and yet retain &lt;BR&gt;respect for him and his lineage.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org/&lt;WBR&gt;homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A\n href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;WBR&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;WBR&gt;group/vedic-&lt;WBR&gt;wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;WBR&gt;home.comcast.&lt;WBR&gt;net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;WBR&gt;nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=&quot;mailto:rajarshi14%40yahoo.co.in&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@yahoo.&lt;WBR&gt;co.in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@&lt;WBR&gt;yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Sunday, May 04, 2008 4:51 PM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Mr Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Was going through some older posts in this\n community when I came&lt;BR&gt;&gt; across this mail. This is regarding the metion of Sri Yukteshwar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Giris calculations of the yugas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Firstly let me clarify that I personally am no vedic scholar, nor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; can I read sanskrit. So I really have no idea of what or who is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; right. But I had the good fortune of reading the book &quot;The Holy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Science&quot; where he refers to this calcuation of yugas. Now you must&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have read in th autobiography of a yogi that Sri Lahiri Mahasaya had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; instructed Sri Yukteshwar Giri to go to the Kumb Mela so that he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; could meet the Mahamauni. And later after Sri Yukteshwar Giri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharaj had completed his book, that very day he met the Mahamauni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; who was sitting under a tree with his disciples. Infact the incident&lt;BR&gt;&gt; goes this way that as the Mahamauni had promised Yukteshwar Giri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that he would meet him once the book get written. So as Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yukteshwar Giri was passing\n by in the morning to take a bath&lt;BR&gt;&gt; suddenly he finds the Mahamauni with his disciples under a tree. And&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the first thing that the Mahamauni tells Sri Yukteshwar giri is to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to bring perfection in his vision by increasing his meditation&lt;BR&gt;&gt; because had he done so he should have been able to see Him(the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mahamauni) and his disciple inside the sunlight. Anyway that is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beside the point.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; What I was wondering is that, if the calculation of yugas as given&lt;BR&gt;&gt; by Sri Yukteshwar is wrong then that means even the Mahamauni Babaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessing the book and meeting him in kumb and again later is also&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrong. I mean all these people are way way way way ahead of me, but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; even among them Mahamauni is just not another sadhaka or a yogi. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the Babaji. As Lahiri Mahasay mentions in his dairy.&quot;budhe babai&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kisun hai&quot;.. Lahiri Mahasay used to refer to Babaji as budhe baba.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; And Kisun was Krishna. To\n think that, THAT supersoul specifically&lt;BR&gt;&gt; blessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong&lt;BR&gt;&gt; calcuation becomes a little difficult to comprehend.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I of my own have no knowledge or learning to be able to decide what&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is right and what is not. I just voiced a concern of mine from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; point of view of an ordinary individual who considers the Mahamauni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be one with God himself. If He is can make such a mistake, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; God is not really that omnipotent I guess.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@&lt;WBR&gt;yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

They are arranged in their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; current form by&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Vyasa about 5,000 years back. But they were revealed to rishis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; millions of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; years back. Yogis have been meditating on verses from Vedas and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; realizing&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; universal truths represented by them for millions of years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, wasnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; any philosophy before that?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The modern chronology of Hindu scriptures was created by people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with heavy&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; biases and agendas. Darshanas are not a few thousand of years old.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; We had Veda(s),\n vedanta, vedangas, darshanas etc for millions of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -What is the divison of the ages(yugas). Again there is a lot of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; confusion here as some say they are thousands of years long but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; others&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; say millions of years long. Can you please explain it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Krita/Sat yuga is 1,728,000 years long. Treta yuga is 1,296,000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; years long.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Dwapara yuga is 864,000 years long. Current Kali yuga started&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about 5,000&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; years back and it is 432,000 years long.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Yukeshwar maharaj (guru of Paramahamsa Yogananda) took a different&lt;BR&gt;&gt; view,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; where all the above numbers are divided by 360. He is a great yogi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; belongs to a great lineage and I have the highest respect. But he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is simply&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; wrong on this. A yogi can experience all times and spaces. In&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fact, time is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a very\n weird concept, even though it seems natural to us when we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; completely bound to this body in this particular space-time&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continuum. When&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a yogi enters nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no space and time for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him/her.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The space-time continuum experienced by a yogi in different realms&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; consciousness are different. I submit that Yukteshwar Maharaj made&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mistake, either intentionally or unintentionally, in drawing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conclusions&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; from his experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Traditionally, we mention the number of years that passed since&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kali yuga&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; started, at the start of every ritual. The number mentioned (about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 5,000&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; years) matches with the astronomical dating of Mahabharata. All&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; astronomical combinations mentioned by Vyasa in Mahabharata&lt;BR&gt;&gt; occurred in that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; sequence in a\n consistent manner about 5,000 years back. There were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tens of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; those eventsand they occurred in that sequence only once in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; last 7,400&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; years. For sure, Krishna lived about 5,000 years back and Kali&lt;BR&gt;&gt; yuga started&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; then.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; incarnation)&lt;WBR&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real&lt;BR&gt;&gt; story&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and is there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; can you please illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; All the stories of Puranas are metaphors of some internal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; happenings and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; also real stories at the same time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Each of is a microcosm of the entire universe. Thus, macro events&lt;BR&gt;&gt; described&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; in scriptures happen microcosmically inside us. It is\n equally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; valid to see&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; them as real stories and as metaphors. When one&#39;s self-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness ascends&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; to a particular realm of consciousness, it is actually possible to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; see one&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of these stories actually happening. In our normal realm of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; these are just stories and we can only understand them&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intellectually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; There are Jupiter, his wife Tara, Moon and Mercury externally.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Internally,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; they represent the intelligence, the expression of intelligence,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; learning ability (respectively)&lt;WBR&gt;. The story of Jupiter&#39;s wife Tara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; begetting&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a child (Mercury) through Moon is real. It is also a metaphor for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the fact&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; that internally, mind combines with the expression of intelligence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; generate learning ability.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Regarding Varaha avatara,\n here is my view. Hiranya means gold and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; also&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; great. Aksha has many meanings, but one of them is &quot;sense organs&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The demon&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Hiranyaksha symbolizes the mighty sense organs. He stole Mother&lt;BR&gt;&gt; earth and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; sunk Her in water. Mother earth is symbolized by Kundalini&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; (self-consciousness&lt;WBR&gt;, microcosmic representation of the divine&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mother within&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; each person) who is normally in the Mooladhara chakra (earth&lt;BR&gt;&gt; element). When&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a sadhaka is caught by the mighty sense organs, Kundalini&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; (self-consciousness&lt;WBR&gt;) is stuck in the samsara saagara (the ocean of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; material&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; life) and loses balance. Lord Vishnu (sattwa guna in a person)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; takes the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; form of a boar and comes from the nostril of the creator. He digs&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; rescues earth from Hiranyaksha. When sattwa guna enters the praana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (life&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; force -\n nostril reference) of a person, dives down to Mooladhara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; destroys the attachment to the mighty sense organs there, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mother is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; freed and can move up to Merge with the Lord (i.e. self-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ascending to merge with Brahman). Basically Varaha avatara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; represents the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; sattwa guna in a person that tries to give detachment from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; perceptions&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; of the sense organs and then make the calm praana dives down to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mooladhara&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; to give balance to Kundalini to move up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me how&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; going to affect my spiritual life. My fiancee&#39;s Birth Details-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 02 Oct&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Good luck with your marital life!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces from\n March&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2008&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; can explain me which one is correct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Drigdasa was taught incorrectly by some teachers earlier, based on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrongly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; remembered teachings of tradition. Most softwares (including my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; own&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Jagannatha Hora software) calculate it incorrectly. My personal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; version of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the software (to be released to the public later) calculates it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; based on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Parasara&#39;s teachings and I believe it to be correct based on my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; study of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; charts of several spiritualists. I taught it in the recent two&lt;BR&gt;&gt; issues of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Jyotish Digest&quot; magazine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Next thing is about meditation, can you please advise me any good&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n meditation postures or any book where I can learn some.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t worry about technicalities too much. The most fundamental&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thing is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; that your back and neck should be erect, straight and not tense at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the same&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; time. You may sit on floor cross-legged preferably or even sit in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a chair if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; you have weak knees. The most important thing is the back and neck&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; erect. Secondly, close the eyes, otherwise a lot of fire is wasted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; act of seeing. That agni is better used for other things! Then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mantra. If your focus is wandering elsewhere, don&#39;t panic and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; worry too&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; much. Just bring back your mind to the mantra. Try your best to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; focus on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; mantra. With time, you will succeed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Finally remember - no effort is wasted. Even an effort that seems&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be\n not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; yielding results is actually working towards a final result. If a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; straw of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the grass makes the scales tilt, it does not mean all the objects&lt;BR&gt;&gt; placed on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the scale previously were unneeded! Just have faith and keep doing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org/&lt;WBR&gt;homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;WBR&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;WBR&gt;group/vedic-&lt;WBR&gt;wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;WBR&gt;home.comcast.&lt;WBR&gt;net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A\n href=&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;WBR&gt;nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@&lt;WBR&gt;...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &lt;&lt;A href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@&lt;WBR&gt;yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 17, 2008 4:22 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Hari OM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; First of all I would like to thank you for the illustrative and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; quick&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; reply. I really dont have the words to express my gratitude.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n First of all with Homam Kundam I have ordered it online from an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Indian&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; store, I am expecting it in few weeks time after which I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; start&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; doing Homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces from March&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2008&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; can explain me which one is correct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; As you mentioned it is correct that I have been a devotee of Shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Krishna since childhood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Next thing is about meditation, can you please advise me any good&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation postures or any book where I can learn some.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Like I said before there are so many other questions which come&lt;BR&gt;&gt; up\n in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; my mind. Although you will find that most of them are silly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; but if you can answer them in brief it will increase my faith in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; scriptures and clear my doubts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -When did Lord Ramchandra appear. Some say He appeared few&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thousand&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; years before Lord Krishna, Is that true?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -As most of the people believe these days that the Vedas were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; written/revealed 7-8000 yrs ago, if this is true then what was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; source of knowledge before that?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, wasnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; any philosophy before that?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -What is the divison of the ages(yugas). Again there is a lot of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; confusion here as some say they are thousands of years long but&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n others&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; say millions of years long. Can you please explain it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; incarnation)&lt;WBR&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real&lt;BR&gt;&gt; story&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and is there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; can you please illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me how&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is it&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; going to affect my spiritual life.

People find their path, make some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; progress&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; and then&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; feel lost again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to March 2017.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Taking&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Cancer&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house will be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; strong with&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in lagna. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 8th&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; house&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords Saturn and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rahu&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th\n house axis&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; strongly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually speaking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; keep&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and keep doing your&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and vimsamsa. This&lt;BR&gt;&gt; shows&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; devotion&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is empty and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mercury owns&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests that worship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Lord&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@ (&lt;A href=&quot;http://ashramaustralia.net/&quot;&gt;http://ashramaustra&lt;WBR&gt;lia.net&lt;/A&gt;) and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ask&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia. Swami Suresh&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Battar is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are available&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; he may be&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or circle&lt;BR&gt;&gt; shaped&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; vessel&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not iron) can be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; used.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Good&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; luck for your homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct experience&lt;BR&gt;&gt; through&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Lord,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; perceive in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; we\n are&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we&lt;BR&gt;&gt; keep&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; attracted to or&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; addition, if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too&lt;BR&gt;&gt; helps.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;&lt;WBR&gt;, a commentary on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita by&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a unique&lt;BR&gt;&gt; saint,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; who is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; adwaitic&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings coming from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and writings&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n coming&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than 700&lt;BR&gt;&gt; years ago,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physical&lt;BR&gt;&gt; body at&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; the age&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT read a more&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; competent or&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is quite an&lt;BR&gt;&gt; inspired&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; work. A&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good English translation of this work is available at&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-&quot;&gt;http://www.amazon.&lt;WBR&gt;com/Jnaneshwars-&lt;WBR&gt;Gita-Jnaneshwari&lt;WBR&gt;-Swami-&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kripananda/dp/&lt;WBR&gt;0911307648&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; opinion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra\n wanted Lord Ramachandra to come with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; forest,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the presence of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned people,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vasishtha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His teachings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; captured&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;&lt;WBR&gt;.

And you people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many times but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; now i&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what brought me here(&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember the thread&lt;BR&gt;&gt; where&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of Sani and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; now i have&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this thread and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other sources but with that i can not really make any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; decisions of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are many&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guide me i&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given below:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab)&lt;WBR&gt;, India&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading some&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritua&lt;WBR&gt;l writings from here and there and doing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this was random and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reading more to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; where to&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am\n planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regular&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; homa kundam&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tell me&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i want to ask but if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someone&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would be very thankful to him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and i will&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&quot;&gt;Aditya Hrudayam punyam Sarva satru Vinasanam&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&nbsp;Jayavaham Japet Nityam Akshyayyam paramam sivam ||&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;?XML:NAMESPACE PREFIX = O /&gt;&lt;O:P&gt;&lt;/O:P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#32;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Bollywood, fun, friendship, sports and more.
