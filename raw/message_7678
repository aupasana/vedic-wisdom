As Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya explains i=\r\nn this timely and important video, the root cause of all these peripheral c=\r\nrises can be directly attributed to a deep crisis in leadership. We are lac=\r\nking able leaders. We are, today, lacking credible political, spiritual and=\r\n cultural leaders who are equipped to lead us out of the darkness and into =\r\nthe light. \n\nIn this bold presentation, Sri Acharyaji explains to us the cu=\r\nrrent crisis that we are facing, how our leadership has fallen far short in=\r\n their sacred duty toward their people, and what must be done to create a f=\r\nuture leadership that will ensure the rebirth of spiritual civilization and=\r\n a more just world. If you are currently occupying a leadership position, i=\r\nf you aspire to someday become a leader, or if you understand the importanc=\r\ne of leadership during this time of global crisis, you must see this greatl=\r\ny enlightening video today.\n\nWATCH THE FULL VIDEO HERE\n\nhttp://www.youtube.=\r\ncom/watch?v=3DY4daX2lhghA\n\n\nBrought to you by the\nInternational Sanatana Dh=\r\narma Society\n\n\n\nWe need your continued support and donations to continue pr=\r\noviding you with many more high quality videos like this one.
