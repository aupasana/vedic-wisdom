How to eat. What to eat.\nWhen to eat. How to wash your hands after you eat. How many times should\nyou shake your hands to dry them off after you eat. How to do homa. Etc.\n\nBut, here&#39;s the kicker. There isn&#39;t one single set of rules. There are many\ncontradicting sets of rules. So, doing anything according to &quot;the&quot; rules is\nsimply not possible. The reality is that there are a set of timeless\nprinciples, which have been laid down as many sets of rules.\n\nMany of the people in this list are doing homa according to rules. They may\nnot be the same rules that you are following, but that most certainly does\nnot mean that they are rule-less :-)\n\n\n&gt; wrong pronunciation is very dangerous.\n&gt; In the airforce, you need to have great experience flying a sports/small\naircraft,\n\n\nOur rishis are geniuses. They put in a few safeguards. The intent of the\nrules, and basic things like pronunciation is akin to putting the key in\nthe plane. Without it, nothing happens, and we can all pretend to fly the\nplane. As long as we are pretending, it doesn&#39;t matter if it is a small\nplane, or a military jet. It is all totally harmless.\n\nFrankly, &quot;correct pronunciation&quot; is hard. I know basic sanskrit. I have\nworked on my pronunciation, and it is decent. I have even studied a little\nbit of the shAstra that underlies pronunciation. And I know that I am\nnowhere close to &quot;correct pronunciation&quot;. Honestly, I have yet to meet a\nsingle person with perfect pronunciation. But, I have met some people who\nare great sAdhakas, who are much furthur along the spiritual path that me.\n\nHere&#39;s another way of thinking about it. Riding a bike incorrectly is very\ndangerous. If you go too fast, you will fall and get hurt. If you go too\nslow, you will fall and get hurt. If you don&#39;t look ahead, you will hit\nsomething and get hurt. And yet, we all teach our children how to ride\nbikes. Every one of them makes every one of these mistakes. But, that is\nhow they learn.\n\nFundamentally, things like homa, japa, tarpana, dhyana etc are mandated in\nthe shastras from a young age. Our munis would not have prescribed these\nfor young children if they were dangerous. We all know -- children do\neverything wrong before they do it right. The rishis have taken this into\naccount. In the spiritual path, we are all children.\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\r\n--bcaec51a8e52334bb004bf237c84\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Sunil,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; Homa is not like reciting another mantr=\r\na, it has to be according to the rules.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything in our tradition has rules and mantras.
