When I look at =\r\nthe development and \n&gt; &gt; transformation that he has gone through in this pe=\r\nriod, it \namazes \n&gt; me \n&gt; &gt; to no end. Initially he was (of course still is=\r\n) a scholar of \nVedic \n&gt; &gt; astrology and later is developing in to a spirit=\r\nual giant. In \nall \n&gt; &gt; these years, he has unselfishly contributed to what=\r\never he takes \nup \n&gt; &gt; and made it a point to spread the knowledge all arou=\r\nnd for the \n&gt; &gt; benefit of the humanity in general. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know Narasi=\r\nmha will not appreciate this mail as it contains no \n&gt; &gt; valuable informati=\r\non for the seekers and it might sound as \nthough I \n&gt; &gt; am praising him.

When your mind is well-focu=\r\nsed and \nblissful, \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will automatically bu=\r\nrn bright.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The state of your mind will decide how=\r\n you will taste \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences you are goi=\r\nng to absorb from around you. \nThat \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decides w=\r\nhich tongues (tasting agents) of your internal \n&gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n receiving food right now. That in turn decides which \n&gt; tongues \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external fire are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The external fire is a mirror to your internal state=\r\n. \nAn \n&gt; &gt; adept \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be able to detect, looking at the=\r\n fire, which tongues of \n&gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; active right now and=\r\n hence guess the state your mind is \nin.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, trying to pay too much attention to this=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; technicality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and becoming over-conscious of the nature =\r\nof fire is \n&gt; &gt; unneeded. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external can be used =\r\nto manipulate the internal (within \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; limits),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it=\r\n can become a distraction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether internal follo=\r\nws external or external follows \n&gt; &gt; internal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invalid =\r\nquestion.
