Com=\r\nming from your experience of almost 2 decades at the highest level, it sets=\r\n somethings very clear.\n\nyou wrote following 2 lines\n&quot;what decides the natu=\r\nre of one&#39;s worship is not just the name used for the deity and the prayer =\r\nused, but also the intention and attitude.&quot;\n&quot;The vibrations created in the =\r\nconsciousness are a function of which deity/prayer is used and with which i=\r\nntention/attitude.&quot;\n\nFirst line says that we control the intention and atti=\r\ntude and choice of diety.\nSecond line says that our own consciousness is/be=\r\ncomes a function of diety/prayer and intention/attitude.\n\nfrom my limited u=\r\nnderstanding It means it is/becomes a closed loop. we cant clearly say who =\r\nchooses whome. are we just mere puppets or is there a choice we have?\n\n\n* *=\r\n *\n\n2. \nNow that you have made clear that Ishta devata and perfect devotion=\r\n is the best remedy for all afflictions (short term/longterm).\n\n- What are =\r\nthe thing we can/should learn from our kundali?\n- What are the best questio=\r\nns to ask to an astrologer?\n- What is the proper approach/perspective going=\r\n for kundali reading?\n- Is there anything substantial we can learn form our=\r\n kundali apart form asking quickfix for our karmas and asking for money/pos=\r\nition/future?\n- What we can learn form this map? because this certainly isn=\r\nt the territory itself, or is it in territory in terms of consciousness?\n\n\n=\r\n* * * \n\n3. Some places i have read that a kundali does predict future lifet=\r\nimes also. \n\n- Do we live one lifetime at a time with some free will or man=\r\ny lifetimes are set with limited free will\n\n* * *\n\n4. Your car dent example=\r\n is very clear. in light of this the question seems silly. \n\nI guess this i=\r\ns the nature of knowledge/perspective itself. once you know the higher trut=\r\nh, the lower one automatically drops away. strange is the play of the consc=\r\niousness!!!\n\n\nregards\nPriyank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Priyank,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Perf=\r\nect devotion to any one form of god is enough to take care of all \n&gt; aspect=\r\ns of one&#39;s life. Though different forms work differently in the \n&gt; short ru=\r\nn (though they lead to the same thing in the long run), choosing \n&gt; forms b=\r\nased on horoscope is not foolproof. I have studied various \n&gt; classics and =\r\nmodern works on astrology and know the subject as \n&gt; thoroughly as anybody =\r\non earth today. I can declare confidently that \n&gt; astrology is not reliable=\r\n for deciding the deities to worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, what decides the nature of=\r\n one&#39;s worship is not just the name used \n&gt; for the deity and the prayer us=\r\ned, but also the intention and attitude. \n&gt; The vibrations created in the c=\r\nonsciousness are a function of which \n&gt; deity/prayer is used and with which=\r\n intention/attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Suppose there is a dent on the side of my car =\r\nthat makes it a little \n&gt; difficult to close the door. If I do not care abo=\r\nut how good my car \n&gt; looks and the little difficulty in closing the door, =\r\nI may not want to \n&gt; spend money and get it repaired. I can use that money =\r\nfor something \n&gt; better.\n&gt; \n&gt; For someone like Ramana Maharshi or Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa, body is \n&gt; just as external as a car. One who identifies ma=\r\ninly with the body will \n&gt; be so concerned with bodily problems, but not on=\r\ne whose identification \n&gt; with the body is bare minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. As we pray=\r\n, god gives what we seek. He also creates situations that \n&gt; make us wonder=\r\n if we are seeking the right things. We can improve in \n&gt; what we seek. As =\r\nwe evolve, we may seek something better and god may \n&gt; eventually give it t=\r\noo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Parents may give a small child a toy. They may give an older child=\r\n a \n&gt; book to read. They may give an even older child some work to do.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n In fact, an adult son may work and bring money to buy toys for the \n&gt; smal=\r\nler children. Some saints take on suffering so that some other \n&gt; people ar=\r\ne spared of the suffering as they embark on their spiritual \n&gt; journey.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jy=\r\notish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films=\r\n that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @hom=\r\nam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
