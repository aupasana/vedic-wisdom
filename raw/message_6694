They are as efficient as men in the field of spir=\r\nituality.\n\nWhen one is born with sannyasa samskaras no force on the earth c=\r\nan prevent him or her from taking sannyasa. Even if you keep a hundred guar=\r\nds to prevent them from leaving the house they cannot check them. The fathe=\r\nr of the great Buddha guarded him in all possible ways, but his horse scale=\r\nd the heights of the compound and took him to the forest. It is only the ef=\r\nfeminate, impotent, timid men (who are only moustached ladies), with no goo=\r\nd samskaras, and no spiritual asset, who are spiritual bankrupts, that will=\r\n cling to things mundane and die like worms. They will speak against sannya=\r\nsa. He who has understood the glory and freedom of sannyasa, a real child o=\r\nf Sri Shankara, Sri Dattatreya, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and Sanatkumara=\r\n, cannot remain even for a day in the pravritti-marga. \n\n\n"}}
