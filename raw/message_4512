Or, they can sit facing north.\n \nYes, vada can certainly be offered as naivedyam and offered in homam. You can offer it when you offer naivedyam in the beginning (after invocation) or in the end (before uttarangam). Show naivedyam to fire and offer some in the fire. Make sure that the amount you offer is compatible with the size of the fire, i.e. fire should be able to eventually devour everything you offered.\n \nGood luck with the homam!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Murali &lt;mkv1960@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste!\n&gt; \n&gt; *We are planning to do Hanuman Homam tomorrow , June 22nd with my family.
