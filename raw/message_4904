To borrow an example from an older mail of \n&gt; Narasimha, the Ku=\r\nnjika is a=C2=A0gun whose safety catch has been locked by Her \n&gt; firmly.

Where as in eastern I=\r\nndia, Bengal/Assam areas, and also \n&gt; &gt;some \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Kaula samprad=\r\nayas in Varanasi, this is not considered to be equal to \n&gt; &gt;Saptasati. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;The reasons why these sampradayas do not con=\r\nsider KS to be equal to \n&gt; &gt;Saptasati is \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;the same as wh=\r\nat Narasimha stated. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;In my personal experie=\r\nnce, about a year before I actually started reading \n&gt; &gt;the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;ful=\r\nl Saptasati, I used to do the KS for a few months. I was shown a specific \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;method of chanting the KS - there is some breath control require=\r\nd at certain \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;lines etc etc. I had almost mugged it up. But the =\r\nexperience of chanting the \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;actual Saptashati (full) is vastly m=\r\nore powerful and different than the KS. \n&gt; &gt;I \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;have serious doub=\r\nts whether a person doing only the KS can ever experience \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;samadhi a=\r\nt all; whereas the Saptasati by itself is capable of bestowing the \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;highest and varied types of spiritual experiences to a sadhaka. Therefor=\r\ne, I \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;tend to agree with the sampradayas from Bengal and Assam t=\r\nhat the actual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Saptasati is anytime more powerful than the KS when =\r\nit comes to spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;experiences. KS is about siddhis. That too, n=\r\not a simple straight chanting \n&gt; &gt;but \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;with some modulatio=\r\nns, breath controls etc etc which have to be learnt from \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;someone=\r\n qualified.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Just my 2 cents on the topic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;-Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shashi_nambisan&quot; &lt;shashin@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot.

I a=\r\nm afraid it is a coded \n&gt; &gt;prayer. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It contains hints in=\r\n coded form for several specific sadhanas to get \n&gt; &gt;specific \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;results using Devi Saptashati.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; From that point=\r\n of view, one can understand why it says there is no \n&gt; &gt;siddhi \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;without Kunjika stotra. However, one will almost certainly not get =\r\nsiddhi \n&gt; &gt;by \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;merely chanting Kunjika stotra or adding it to o=\r\nne&#39;s Saptashati chanting. \n&gt; &gt;In \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fact, siddhi often comes to t=\r\nhose who do not consciously pursue it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If one says &quot;just spending time with your mother and expres=\r\nsing your \n&gt; &gt;love and \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;respect for her will not give =\r\nyou her wealth. You need her checkbook to \n&gt; &gt;access \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;he=\r\nr wealth&quot;, that is not incorrect. But that is not the complete story. \n&gt; &gt;J=\r\nust by \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;having the checkbook of one&#39;s mother, one may n=\r\not be able to get her \n&gt; &gt;wealth. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Check needs her signature. O=\r\nn the other hand, a simple child who does not \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;consciously or expli=\r\ncitly try to get the wealth of one&#39;s mother and only \n&gt; &gt;spends \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;time with mother expressing love and respect from her may end up =\r\ngetting \n&gt; &gt;her \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wealth when she decides by herself to give.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, I suggest not being a son who looks to get mo=\r\nther&#39;s wealth by \n&gt; &gt;laying \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;hands on her checkbook. J=\r\nust cultivate love for mother and devote yourself \n&gt; &gt;to \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;her.
