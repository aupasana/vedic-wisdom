If that is so let me say one thing ,still today in Bengal=\r\n it is strongly believed that if one keeps the picture of Thakur in ones ro=\r\nom one is bound to be liberated.\nBelur Math is still revered as an elite ti=\r\nrtha sthan laden with the dust of the feet of  Sri Maa, Swami Vivekananda a=\r\nnd all his brother disciples.\nRegarding siddhis,spiritual callibre i think =\r\nthe likes of Swami Vivekananda ,Swami Brahmananda,Swami Abhedananda,Swami Y=\r\nogananda,Swami Turiyananda,Saint Nag Mahasay and all others are completely =\r\nunfathomable.I tell this not by mere emotion but I came to know blessedly m=\r\nany such events that is not well publicised but that occured during their t=\r\nimes.\nSuch discussions are shocking and very much sensitive.Perhaps you wou=\r\nld never understand how much we Bengalis get hurt through them.We are not J=\r\nnaanis we are Bhaktas of very tender heart.Please don=E2=80=99t do this to =\r\nus.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
