Sanatana Dharma is singularly unique an=\r\nd different from all other existing spiritual paths and world religions. Sa=\r\nnatana Dharma is the most ancient spiritual tradition in creation, while si=\r\nmultaneously being on the very cutting-edge of present-day global change. S=\r\nanatana Dharma represents the very greatest spiritual and cultural achievem=\r\nent of the past, the present, and the future of Man. \n\nOur religion is Sana=\r\ntana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way. We are Dharmis, followers of the path=\r\n of Sanatana Dharma.\n\nThe practice of all followers of Sanatana Dharma is t=\r\no conduct our lives in accordance with those natural laws (Dharma) that hav=\r\ne been instituted by God Himself, that have been revealed in the Vedic scri=\r\nptures, and that are designed to guarantee us maximal health, peace, joy, p=\r\nrosperity, enlightenment and total liberation. The ultimate goal of all Dha=\r\nrmis (followers of Sanatana Dharma) is to free ourselves of all illusion, a=\r\nnd to reawaken our innate God-consciousness. This is achieved via the Yoga =\r\nof devotional meditation (bhakti) upon the Divine.\n\n1) Every aspect of the =\r\nlife of a Dharmi, both spiritual and secular, is guided by the eternal and =\r\nperfect wisdom of the divinely revealed Vedic scriptures (shastras). We acc=\r\nept the eternal Vedic scriptures as our infallible guide. By definition, a =\r\nperson is considered to be a follower of Sanatana Dharma only if they accep=\r\nt in full the validity of the scriptures of Sanatana Dharma. \n\n2) Followers=\r\n of Sanatana Dharma accept the dual principle of karma and punar-janma (rei=\r\nncarnation) as one of the laws of nature. \n\n3) Dharmis aspire to be ethical=\r\nly virtuous individuals, following the ten principles known as the Yamas an=\r\nd Niyamas to the best of our ability, in addition to the many other ethical=\r\n guidelines of the Vedic scriptures. We reject ethical relativism. To know =\r\nGod means to be good.\n\n4) Dharmis aspire always to be noble (arya) in every=\r\nthing that we think, say and do. \n\n5) Dharmis do not consume animals, and a=\r\nre strict lacto-vegetarians (avoiding all meat, fish and eggs).\n\n6) Sanatan=\r\na Dharmis are guided by, and offer all our most reverential respect to, the=\r\n authentic and qualified spiritual teachers (sad-gurus) of our tradition.\n\n=\r\n7) Individual Dharmis practice a consistent program of spiritual discipline=\r\n (sadhana) given to us by our guru, guided by the Vedic scripture (shastra)=\r\n, and continuously confirmed by our own individual intellectual discernment=\r\n (viveka) and inner experience (anubhava). \n\nOur chosen spiritual path is S=\r\nanatana Dharma: The Eternal Natural Way. \n\n\nTo learn more about the path of=\r\n Sanatana Dharma, visit Dharmacentral:\n\nhttp://dharmacentral.com/dharmastor=\r\ne/acharyaji_books.php\n\n\n\n"}}
