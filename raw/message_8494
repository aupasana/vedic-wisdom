If one has a sadguru, whose con=\r\nsciousness is always established in god, such a person may be able to tell =\r\nthe correct form. Otherwise, the best recourse one has is to follow one&#39;s h=\r\neart.\n=A0\nIf one is not sure, one can start off with Ganapathi homam and ev=\r\nentually Lord shows the correct direction.\n=A0\nIn any case, if one does hom=\r\nam just for the pleasure of Lord and has only small dharmik desires, one ne=\r\ned not worry about too many technicalities.\n=A0\n2) You can mix it up as you=\r\n want.\n=A0\nBut, the advantage of sticking to one thing for a considerable t=\r\nime is that a specific mantra or prayer becomes second nature to one&#39;s mind=\r\n after a period of time. After repeating enough, one may start to chant the=\r\n prayer at the back of the mind when doing other things. In time, this purg=\r\nes useless thoughts from the mind and creates positive vibrations and peace=\r\n in the mind. If one is switching between different things all the time, it=\r\n is more difficult to create such a state of mind.\n=A0\n3) Currently only Ga=\r\nnapathi homam video and audio exist. Because the template and the initial a=\r\nnd final portions are common, it can help no matter which homam one does. I=\r\nn the long run, we will try to add video and audio for all homas. A lot of =\r\npeople asked for it.\n=A0\nSome people see the video a few times, put a print=\r\nout next to them and start. Some people play Ganapathi homam MP3 on a compu=\r\nter and do homam while pausing and un-pausing. After a few weeks, they get =\r\nthe mantras (which are not too many) by heart and do without MP3. One can d=\r\no whatever is convenient. Eventually, everyone finds their steady state and=\r\n starts to enjoy it.\n=A0\nAbove all, Fire (Agni) is the greatest teacher and=\r\n the original purohit of Vedas. If one starts to spend time with Fire, Fire=\r\n will take care of things and will slowly transform one.\n=A0\n4) One of the =\r\nfinal steps in all homas (and all rituals really) is &quot;mantraheenam kriyaahe=\r\nenam bhaktiheenam&quot; mantra. We ask for forgiveness of Lord for errors in pro=\r\nnunciation, procedures, devotion etc. If one does THAT step sincerely and w=\r\nith humility, all is well. Other errors are forgiven and moreover Lord help=\r\ns one improve those aspects as well, with time.\n=A0\nIn fact, in my humble o=\r\npinion, people who do not know much Sanskrit and do not have much intellect=\r\nual understanding, are more likely to please Lord and experience internal t=\r\nransformation faster, than those who know Sanskrit well and are very intell=\r\nigent. Pride comes easier to the latter group, while humility comes easier =\r\nto the former group (though there can be exceptions). Humility and sincerit=\r\ny in the ritual is far more important than knowledge=A0 and technical perfe=\r\nction.\n=A0\nBTW, one word on ugra devatas (this is not for you, as you picke=\r\nd a soumya devata): In general, one should worship an ugra devata only if o=\r\nne is sure of what one is doing. After all, one can learn something from a =\r\nvery tough task master only if one can take the grind! In the process of cl=\r\neansing our consciousness, ugra devatas are like tough task masters, while =\r\nsoumya devatas are like kinder and gentler masters. If one is unsure, soumy=\r\na devatas are better.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spir=\r\nituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n=A0\n=A0\n--- In JyotishG=\r\nroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bhaskar&quot; &lt;bhaskar_jyotish@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Ah yes, at=\r\n certain places I cannot recite the Mantras myself.
