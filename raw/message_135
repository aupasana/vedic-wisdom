When the British Raj was \nestablished, the Christ=\r\nians did not attempt to physically annihilate \nHinduism as the Muslims had =\r\nearlier.  Rather, they attempted a more \ngenteel and sophisticated intellec=\r\ntual/cultural/spiritual \nannihilation of what remained of Vedic culture.  W=\r\ne are dealing with \nthe negative effects of this less violent form of genoc=\r\nide to this \nvery day.  \n\nToday, as a direct result of this millennium-long=\r\n persecution, we \nhave a Sanatana Dharma that finds itself only now beginni=\r\nng to arise \nfrom the smoldering ashes of this 1000 Year Holocaust.  Hindui=\r\nsm is \nonly now beginning to reconstruct itself as an authentic, shastra-\nb=\r\nased Sanatana Dharma, to rid itself of all non-Dharmic influences \nover its=\r\n philosophy and culture, and to begin finally reasserting \nitself again ont=\r\no the world-stage.  The horrific psychic remnants of \nthe anti-Hindu Holoca=\r\nust have survived, however, and have manifested \nthemselves in today&#39;s Hind=\r\nus in deeply self-destructive psychological \nterms.  \n\nHindus have been rel=\r\nentlessly forced to hear from our deceitful \npersecutors for so very long t=\r\nhe false propaganda that Hinduism is an \ninferior and unworthy religion, an=\r\nd that Hinduism only leads to \nsuperstition and poverty.  As a direct resul=\r\nt of generations of such \nbrainwashing, today even the most vocal Hindu act=\r\nivists often find \nthemselves suffering from agonizing bouts of self-doubt,=\r\n passivity, \nimpotence, and feelings of utter powerlessness in the face of =\r\nthe \nmany challenges that Sanatana Dharma is currently facing.  Most \nHindu=\r\ns today find themselves unable to defend Hinduism from our \npersecutors in =\r\nanything but the most passive, cursory, fearful, and \nweakest of ways.  Too=\r\n much of the Hindu world has been \npsychologically impacted, and strategica=\r\nlly paralyzed, by what I call \nImpossibility-Thinking =96 the idea that we =\r\ncan accomplish no large \ntask in the name of Sanatana Dharma, and that our =\r\nreligion is somehow \ndestined to extinction regardless of what we may attem=\r\npt to save it.  \nThis problem is especially seen when it comes to the major=\r\nity of \nHindus venturing to acknowledge and embrace the vast potential that=\r\n \nSanatana Dharma has to offer us personally, and that our religion has \nto=\r\n offer the world at-large.  \n\nThe Hindu world has been infected by Impossib=\r\nility-Thinking for too \nlong. We have allowed ourselves to be convinced tha=\r\nt we are \npowerless, that we are incapable of achieving greatness in Dharma=\r\n. \nThe time of such hopelessly negative thinking is over! The era of the \np=\r\nassive Hindu is over! We need to know that, with Bhagavan&#39;s \nblessings and =\r\ngrace, anything and everything is possible in His \nservice. We need to adop=\r\nt Possibility-Thinking, and know that there \nis no barrier, no obstacle, no=\r\n enemy, and no challenge that we cannot \novercome. With such thinking, we w=\r\nill see Sanatana Dharma change the \ncourse of world history.  We will see t=\r\nhe beginning of the new \nDharmic Era that will affect every corner of the g=\r\nlobe.  \n\nSanatana Dharma is the most personally expansive and psychological=\r\nly \nempowering religion on earth.  It is a path that teaches its \nfollowers=\r\n to be fearless, dedicated, focused, strong, assertive, self-\ncontrolled, v=\r\nirtuous, self-reliant, and to strive for excellence in \nall endeavors.  Thi=\r\ns, however, is only the case when Dharma is \nactually followed and practice=\r\nd.  \n\nIt is only by embracing the daily practice of Dharma that we can \nbeg=\r\nin to access the full potential that we all have lying within.  \nThrough st=\r\neadfast practice of the remarkable techniques of Yoga, \nmeditation, puja, a=\r\nnd bhakti, all of which are at the very heart of \nHinduism, God has provide=\r\nd us with powerfully effective tools by \nwhich we can perfect ourselves and=\r\n manifest unparalleled excellence \nin our lives.  By practicing a strict re=\r\ngimen of Hindu sadhana, we \ncan achieve our utmost potential physically, em=\r\notionally, mentally, \nintellectually, and spiritually.  It is by practicing=\r\n, and witnessing \nthe direct results, of these Dharmic disciplines that we =\r\ncan develop \nthe self-confidence, healthy assertiveness, fearlessness, inne=\r\nr \npeace, and self-control that are the hallmark of any healthy and well-\nb=\r\nalanced person.  It is no longer enough merely to call ourselves \nHindus, t=\r\no be merely Nominal-Hindus any more; it is incumbent upon us \nall to practi=\r\nce Hinduism if we are to experience firsthand what it \nmeans to live a life=\r\n that is empowered by the grace of God, and to \nknow that in Dharma all thi=\r\nngs are possible.  \n\nSanatana Dharma is a religion of the possible.  It is =\r\na tradition \nthat teaches us that anything and everything we can dream is \n=\r\nattainable.  In Sanatana Dharma, we are radically free to perform any \nposi=\r\ntive task, to reach out boldly toward any constructive goal, to \nachieve an=\r\ny dream that our imaginations can reveal.  Dharma frees us \nfrom the bonds =\r\nof ignorance and fear that bind us, and gives mighty \nwings to realize our =\r\ninner yearning for peace, joy, and unlimited \nfreedom.  \n\nOurs has historic=\r\nally been a religion that has fostered Possibility-\nThinking.  Sanatana Dha=\r\nrma is a religion that reflects the very \nessence of the diverse and infini=\r\nte possibilities that the universe \nhas to offer us.  The infinitely expans=\r\nive range of thinking, \nfeeling, and experiential possibilities that the Dh=\r\narmic world-view \noffers is without limit. The Possibility-Thinking that Dh=\r\narma \nencourages is one reason why we find so many amazing stories, \nwondro=\r\nus deeds, and heroic feats in our scriptures that would \notherwise defy our=\r\n common-day imagination.  Only in Sanatana Dharma \ndo we find such stories =\r\nas Lord Shiva having the ability to \nfearlessly drink deadly poison from an=\r\n ocean of milk and yet not die; \nor stories of the divine Sage Narada freel=\r\ny traversing the length and \nbreadth of the universe at will in his unendin=\r\ng mission to share \nGod&#39;s love with all sentient beings; or the story of Ha=\r\nnuman bravely \nleaping to Lanka in a single monumental bound to seek out th=\r\ne beloved \nof Lord Rama.  The one thing that these and so many thousands of=\r\n \nsimilar sacred stories tell us in the boldest of voices is that there \nis=\r\n no challenge in this world that cannot be overcome in the service \nof the =\r\nDivine.  There is no possibility that is beyond us.  \n\nThe scriptures (shas=\r\ntras) and history of Sanatana Dharma are replete \nwith the examples of many=\r\n thousands of brave men and women who \nunderstood the principle of embracin=\r\ng the oceanic potential of \nPossibility-Thinking.  Numerous sages, rishis, =\r\nyogis, kings and \nqueens, and leaders of the Hindu people throughout our hi=\r\nstory have \nshown us what can be accomplished when we know that all things =\r\nare \npossible, and that we can achieve anything in Bhagavan&#39;s service.  \nCh=\r\nanakya had the determination to drive the Greeks out of Hindu \nIndia.  Shan=\r\nkara used the power of resolute focus to revive Hinduism \nwhen it was threa=\r\ntened with extinction.  Ramanuja possessed the \ndetermined will to revive p=\r\nure bhakti throughout the length and \nbreadth of Bharat.  Shivaji Maharaja =\r\nhad the fearless fortitude \nnecessary to route the mighty and seemingly inv=\r\nincible Moghul empire, \nand to reestablish the Dharma Nation as a viable mi=\r\nlitary-political \nentity.  Vivekananda showed us that Sanatana Dharma is no=\r\nt merely the \npossession of India, but can be realized as the future pre-em=\r\ninent \nworld-view of the entire globe.  Prabhupada showed us that Americans=\r\n \nand Europeans and East Asians and Russians and the peoples of the \nentire=\r\n world can =96 and will - enthusiastically embrace pure and \nauthentic Sana=\r\ntana Dharma in their millions.  \n\nDharma, when practiced, provides us with =\r\nMoksha =96 radical existential \nfreedom, and liberation from all the worldl=\r\ny impediments that bind \nus.  Such is the nature of the radical freedom of =\r\nMoksha that we find \nourselves without the limiting bounds that so affect t=\r\nhose who have \nnot tasted the nectar of Brahma-vidya (God-realization).  As=\r\n servants \nof Dharma and devotees of God, we naturally find that our lives =\r\ncan \nbe lived without limits.  When we experience the spiritual revolution =\r\n\nin our lives that the Dharma lifestyle can grant us, our \npossibilities ar=\r\ne then endless.  \n\nBy God&#39;s grace, there is nothing we cannot accomplish.  =\r\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.=\r\nD.) is an \nAmerican of Italian and Spanish ancestry who has been studying, =\r\n\npracticing, and teaching Sanatana Dharma for over 30 years.
