However, depending on who one  was earlier and what one did earlier, one may experience different levels of  affinity towards different practices and also get results at different speeds  with different practices.\n  \n Normal people can only give you good advice from  THEIR perspective. They cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective. Only a  sadguru, who knows more about the real you than you yourself do, can give you  advice from your perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not one.\n  \n If you want my suggestion nevertheless, here are  some basic suggestions.\n  \n (1) In &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, Maharshi Vasishtha  prescribes company of saints as the first step in acquiring self-knowledge.  Spend some time every week with spiritually inclined people discussing  spiritual matters.\n  \n (2) Identify one personal weakness (e.g. anger,  jealosy). Make a sincere effort to overcome it. Whenever the weakness strikes  you (e.g. you become angry), consciously restrain yourself and divert your mind  to something else (e.g. repeating a mantra).\n  \n (3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend  atleast 30 minutes everyday repeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a  reasonably straight back and closed eyes and repeat the mantra. If your mind  wanders off the mantra and its deity and you get distracted by all kinds of  thoughts, do not worry. Accept it as the nature of mind and make a conscious  effort to pull the mind back into the mantra and its deity.\n  \n (4) Before that japa, do a simple pranayama for 5  minutes. Breath in through the right nostril for n seconds, breath out through  the left nostril for n seconds, breath in through the same left nostril for  another n seconds and then breath out through the right nostril for n seconds.  Keep the time duration - n seconds - approximately the same in all steps. If you  want, you can use a small mantra as the measure of time and say it mentally in  each step. Keep repeating this sequence for 5 minutes.\n  \n (5) Cultivate the thinking that you do not own  anything. Think that you are just a *temporary caretaker* of things that seem  like your possessions (e.g. you relations, your house, your car and even your  own body, name, fame etc). Tell yourself that all these are god&#39;s property and  that you are servant and a temporary caretaker. Just as a servant working at a  rich man&#39;s house takes excellent care of things entrusted to him without  developing the &quot;it is mine&quot; attachment to the things, tell yourself that you too  have to take excellent care of all the things entrusted to you (e.g. your  relations, your house, your car, your body, name, fame etc) while cultivating  the &quot;it is god&#39;s and not mine&quot; sense.\n  \n This is a very important step and just keep on  trying if you keep failing.\n  \n (6) Read a little of some scripture or teachings of  a holy man everyday. Examples are BhagavadGita, Jnaneshwari etc. I particularly  recommend &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;. Ramakrishna Parahamahamsa was a great master  who taught the highest knowledge in simplest terms to all kinds of people. Read  his teachings with an open mind, understand them and try to follow  them.\n  \n *         *        *\n  \n If some previous karmas are blocking one&#39;s  spiritual progress, one has to either burn those karmas through sadhana or  experience the result of the karmas. Then only the blockage will go away. There  is no other way.\n  \n Each minute spent in spiritual sadhana - including  japam, homam etc - contributes to that. No effort is wasted. One should never  get disheartened.\n  \n Best  regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam  manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri  Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n   From:    Kishore    Chitrapu \n   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com    \n   Sent: Sunday, June 17, 2007 10:08  AM\n   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] vedic wisdom for    learners\n   \n\nDear PVR,\n\nThere is a profound    gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here.
