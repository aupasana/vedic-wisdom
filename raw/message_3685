His mother Alagammal, who was living in Manamadurai, was=\r\n informed\nand every effort was made to try and find him. But nobody, neithe=\r\nr friends\nnor neighbours, had any idea where he might be. People hoped for =\r\nhis return,\nbut in vain, as weeks and months went by without any news. Alag=\r\nammal=E2=80=99s\nanguish increased and she beseeched both her brothers-in-la=\r\nw, Subba and\nNelliappa Iyer, to try and find him. It was rumoured that Rama=\r\nna had joined\na theatrical troupe performing religious dramas in Trivandrum=\r\n. Nelliappa\nIyer twice went there to look for him among the various troupes=\r\n, once\naccompanied by Alagammal =E2=80=93 but without success.\n\nAlmost two =\r\nyears went by and people started to believe that they would never\nsee the l=\r\nost son again. On 1st May 1898 Subba Iyer died. Nelliappa Iyer and\nthe rest=\r\n of the family came to the funeral in Madurai. During the funeral a\nyoung m=\r\nan from Tiruchuli brought the unexpected news that he had met\nTambiran and =\r\nhad heard him talking about a young Swami, called Venkataraman,\nwho came fr=\r\nom Tiruchuli. The Swami was a venerated saint in Tiruvannamalai\nand was und=\r\noubtedly the person they were looking for.\n\nImmediately after the funeral N=\r\nelliappa Iyer and a friend started out for\nTiruvannamalai. There they learn=\r\ned that the young Swami was living in the\nmango grove. However, when they w=\r\nent there they were prevented from entering\nby the owner of the garden,who =\r\nsaid that Ramana was a mauni, a silent saint,\nand should not be disturbed. =\r\nNelliappa Iyer therefore wrote the following\nmessage ona piece of paper for=\r\n his nephew, =E2=80=9CNelliappa Iyer, pleader of\nManamadurai,wishes to have=\r\n your darshan=E2=80=9D, and asked Naicker, to pass on the\nmessage.\n\nRamana =\r\nrecognized his uncle=E2=80=99s handwriting. The piece of paper came from a\n=\r\nrecords office and had on the back some official entries in the handwriting=\r\n\nof his older brother Nagaswami. From this he was able to conclude in\naddit=\r\nion that Nagaswami had become an employee in a records office. He\nagreed th=\r\nat his uncle should enter.\n\nNelliappa Iyer argued and pleaded with all the =\r\neloquence of a lawyer. But\nRamana did not move and gave not the least sign =\r\nof recognition.\n\nThe uncle finally had no alternative but to give up. He se=\r\nnt Alagammal the\njoyful news that he had found her son, but that he had cha=\r\nnged a lot and\nsadly would not return. Nelliappa Iyer himself returned to M=\r\nanamadurai after\nfive days, unsuccessful in his mission.\n\nAbout his two unc=\r\nles, Nelliappa and Subba Iyer, Sri Ramana later remarked,\n=E2=80=9CSubba Iy=\r\ner had great courage and pride, but this man [Nelliappa] was very\nmeek and =\r\nmild. If it had been Subba Iyer, he would never have gone back home\nleaving=\r\n me here. He would have bundled me up and carried me away. As I am\ndestined=\r\n to stay here, my whereabouts were not known so long as he was\nalive.Nellia=\r\nppa Iyer, being spiritually minded and mild in his ways, left me\nhere sayin=\r\ng, =E2=80=98Why trouble him?=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D\n\nLater, Nelliappa Iyer visit=\r\ned his nephew twice while he was living in the\nVirupaksha cave. Ramana had =\r\nby then started to give spoken answers to his\ndisciples=E2=80=99 questions =\r\nand to interpret the holy Advaita scriptures. Once,\nwhilst he was in the mi=\r\ndst of an explanation about the Dakshinamurti\nStotram, his uncle unexpected=\r\nly came to visit and was astounded by his\nnephew=E2=80=99s erudition. From =\r\nthat day on Nelliappa knew that he need not trouble\nhimself anymore and ret=\r\nurned home deeply satisfied. Soon afterwards he died.\n\nA few months after N=\r\nelliappa=E2=80=99s first visit, Sri Ramana left the mango grove\nto live in =\r\na small temple in Arunagirinathar. He had decided that he should\nno longer =\r\nbe dependent upon the care of others and that from now he would\nlook for hi=\r\ns own daily meal. So he said to Palaniswami, =E2=80=9CYou go one way, beg\ny=\r\nour food and get on. Let me go another way, beg my food and get on. Let us\n=\r\nnot live together.=E2=80=9D But Palaniswami, in the evening returned to the=\r\n\nArunagirinathar temple, saying, =E2=80=9CWhere can I go? You have the word=\r\ns of\nlife.=E2=80=9D Now Ramana felt compassion for him and Palaniswami was =\r\nallowed to\nstay with him.\n\nAfter they had spent about four weeks during Aug=\r\nust and September 1898\nliving in the small temple, they went to live for a =\r\nweek in the quiet upper\nrooms of the towers of the Arunachaleswara temple a=\r\nnd in the Alari garden,\none of the temple gardens. There Ramana was again t=\r\nracked down by admirers.\nHe withdrew from them and went to Pavalakkunru, on=\r\ne of the eastern foothills\nof Arunachala where there was a Shiva temple, a =\r\ncave and a spring.\n\nHe sat most of the time in samadhi in a tiny room in th=\r\ne temple,which was so\nsmall that it was impossible to stand upright. Severa=\r\nl times, after\nperforming the puja, the priest forgot to see if the Swami w=\r\nas sitting in\nhis room and inadvertently locked him in.His admirers also tr=\r\nacked him down\nin Pavalakkunru. Patiently they waited until he appeared fro=\r\nm inside the\ntemple or the cave to have his darshan.\n\nIn the meantime Raman=\r\na had decided to look for his own food and used to go\ninto town to beg for =\r\nhis meals. About the first time he went begging he\nsaid, =E2=80=9CThe first=\r\n day, when I begged from Gurukkal=E2=80=99s wife, I felt bashful\nabout it a=\r\ns a result of habits of upbringing,but after that there was\nabsolutely no f=\r\neeling of abasement. I felt like a king and more than a king.\nI have someti=\r\nmes received stale gruel at some house and taken it without\nsalt or any oth=\r\ner flavouring, in the open street, before great pandits\n[scholars] and othe=\r\nr important men who used to come and prostrate themselves\nbefore me at the =\r\nAshram.=E2=80=9D\n\nDuring the Christmas holidays of 1898 his mother came to =\r\nvisit him for the\nfirst time, accompanied by her eldest son Nagaswami,who h=\r\nad a few days off\nwork. They had searched for him in the mango grove in vai=\r\nn. Now they had\nclimbed up to Pavalakkunru.Ramana was laying on a rock in a=\r\n state of neglect\nsuch that he was barely recognizable, clothed in a dirty =\r\nscrap of a\nloincloth only.Twenty-eight months had passed since his mother h=\r\nad last seen\nhim. Bitterly she complained about his neglected bodily condit=\r\nion and\nimplored him to come home with her, but he did not react.\n\nDay afte=\r\nr day they came up to see him, brought him sweets and entreated him\ntireles=\r\nsly, but all to no avail. Ramana remained silent.Alagammal tried\neverything=\r\n. One day when she broke down in tears, he was unable to bear it\nany longer=\r\n and simply went away.\n\nOnce she despairingly turned to the others present =\r\nand asked for their\nsupport. Then one of them said to Ramana, =E2=80=9CYour=\r\n mother is weeping and\npraying. Why do you not answer her? Whether it is =\r\n=E2=80=98yes=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98no=E2=80=99, why not\ngive her a reply? Sw=\r\nami need not break his vow of silence. Here are pencil\nand paper. Swami may=\r\n at least write out what he has to say.=E2=80=9D So Ramana wrote\ndown, =E2=\r\n=80=9CThe Ordainer controls the fate of souls in accordance with their past=\r\n\ndeeds =E2=80=93 their prarabdhakarma. Whatever is destined not to happen w=\r\nill not\nhappen, - try how hard you may. Whatever is destined to happen will=\r\n happen,\ndo what you may to stop it. This is certain. The best course, ther=\r\nefore, is\nfor one to be silent.=E2=80=9D\n\nWhether this message convinced hi=\r\ns deeply religious mother or not, there was\nnothing left for her to do but =\r\nto leave him to the life he had embarked\nupon. Furthermore Nagaswami=E2=80=\r\n=99s holidays were coming to an end and he had to\nreturn to his office. Wit=\r\nhout having achieved what they had set out to\nachieve and with a heavy\nhear=\r\nt, they returned to Manamadurai.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biogr=\r\naphy by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=\r\n  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=\r\n=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1aa68c1b4dd047f4ecdad\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nRamana=E2=80=99s disappearance and his parting note were soon noticed.His f=\r\namily was stunned.

During =\r\nthe funeral a young man from Tiruchuli brought the unexpected news that he =\r\nhad met Tambiran and had heard him talking about a young Swami, called Venk=\r\nataraman, who came from Tiruchuli. The Swami was a venerated saint in Tiruv=\r\nannamalai and was undoubtedly the person they were looking for.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Immediately after the funeral Nelliap=\r\npa Iyer and a friend started out for Tiruvannamalai.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0There they=\r\n learned that the young Swami was living in the mango grove.
