Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into \nprescription=\r\n medicines and how that ruins some people&#39;s lives. That somehow \nreminded m=\r\ne of a story.\n=A0\nSometime back, mother of a young man came to me to \nshow =\r\nhis chart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was \nbrillia=\r\nnt from the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale \ncombination=\r\ns. I declared, &quot;this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but \nthat =\r\nof a sannyasi (ascetic/monk) .&quot; She broke down into tears and gave me some =\r\n\nbackground. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and hi=\r\ns \nmother does not want him to.\n=A0\nThis boy had been calm, peaceful, conte=\r\nnted and an \nintrovert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, h=\r\ne had an \ninteresting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father w=\r\nas teaching \nmath to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voi=\r\nces. Suddenly, he \nstopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anythin=\r\ng for a while. His mind \nwas completely blacked out. After a while, his min=\r\nd returned to normalcy and he \nsaw and heard everything. But he felt a trem=\r\nendous sense of bliss and \ncontentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he =\r\nfelt then.\n=A0\nHe realized that what people pursue as happiness is \nnothing=\r\n in front of what he experienced then. He did not want to study or do \nanyt=\r\nhing anymore. He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became \n=\r\nworried and took him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brai=\r\nn and \nfound nothing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one mon=\r\nth. They put \nhim on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept=\r\n telling the \ndoctors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they w=\r\nould not understand \nwhat he experienced. After a month, those doctors conc=\r\nluded he was normal and \nhad no problem. The powerful drugs he received dur=\r\ning the month wreaked havoc on \nhim, but he was not angry or mad at his par=\r\nents or doctors. He says he \nunderstands his parents love him and hence the=\r\ny did all this. He does not want \nto hurt them. He also says he knows what =\r\nhe wants but does not know how to get \nit. But he knows that regular studie=\r\ns and regular material life will not get him \nwhat he wants.\n=A0\nWhen I cha=\r\ntted with him alone, I realized that he \nis a brilliant young man with clea=\r\nr thinking. He is certainly not a mad person. \nHe just needs someone to sho=\r\nw him a spiritual path to make something permanent, \nwhich temporarily came=\r\n to him and left him! To get it permanently now, he needs \nto do serious sa=\r\ndhana. His parents also took him to many so-called swamijis, but \nhe was no=\r\nt satisfied with the advice given anyone. He started reading Ramana \nMahars=\r\nhi and a few others and liked some of them. But he is still without a \nclea=\r\nr direction.\n=A0\nInterestingly, just when I was about to chat with \nthis pe=\r\nrson after making his parents leave, my guru Manish called me. He asked \nme=\r\n what was going on. I mentioned that I was about to talk to a teenager who =\r\nhad \na nice chart. He asked for the birthdata, checked it out and confirmed=\r\n my \nfeeling that this boy had great spiritual potential.\n=A0\n\nUnfortunatel=\r\ny, the system we have in place looked \nat him with suspicion and gave power=\r\nful drugs to mess up his mind for one full \nmonth! He is lucky and survived=\r\n the ordeal. This is a sign of the times we live \nin that someone who reali=\r\nzes, albeit momentarily,=A0the essence of \nscriptures, is labeled as a ment=\r\nally disturbed person and powerful drugs are \ngiven to him, instead of clea=\r\nr spiritual direction to make that realization more \npermanent.\n=A0Best \nre=\r\ngards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- ---------\nDo \na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n homam\nDo \nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpan=\r\na\nSpirituality: \nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree \nJyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree \nJyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri \nJagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n\n \n\n      \n\n    \n    \n\t\n\t \n\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\n\n      New Email addresses available on Yahoo!\nGet the Email name=\r\n you&#39;ve always wanted on the new @ymail and @rocketmail. \nHurry before =\r\nsomeone else does!\nhttp://mail.promotions.yahoo.com/newdomains/aa/\r\n--0-833015926-1246515090=:16320\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;JAI MAA&lt;br&gt;Narasimha Ji&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;namaskar&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;will you plz share his birth data with us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;thanks&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- O=\r\nn &lt;b&gt;Thu, 2/7/09, Narasimha P.V.R.
