Shiva in\nthe dream of king told him that he would be attending the function of his\ndevotee who had built a temple for him than built by the King.\nLater King realised the power of mental/Manasa Pooja and worshipped the\ndevotee and gave him lot of land and money to take care of temple built by\nking.\nI think this will give you the answer you expected in the forum\nH Ramalingam\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com [mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Narasimha P.V.R.

When a\nhighly purified mind makes offerings internally, it is possible for it to be\nhighly focused on the visualization. That can indeed be more effective.\n \nHowever, until one reaches such a stage, it is quite useful (and often\nunavoidable) to engage in external and material offerings. A mind that is\nunfocused and distracted needs some objects and actions to anchor it and\nmake it somewhat focused and disciplined.\n\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt; \n--------\n \n\n________________________________\n\n\tFrom: monkeymonkeyking10 &lt;monkeymonkeyking10@...&gt;\n\tTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n\tSent: Thursday, April 11, 2013 10:07 AM\n\tSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Manas Puja\n\t\n\n\t  \n\tNamaste to All,\n\t\n\tI have recently heard it said that offerings made &#39;mentally&#39; can be\nsuperior/more effective in manifesting desired results than actual material\nofferings.
