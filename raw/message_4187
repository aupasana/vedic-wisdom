The gist of that letter is,=\r\n that countless people in the\ncountry are suffering for want of food, that =\r\nthere is any amount of\ncommotion,that we are unable to see their troubles, =\r\nthat Bhagavan must give\nout some plan to alleviate their suffering and that=\r\n elders like him should\nnot remain unconcerned like this.\n\nBhagavan read it=\r\n and looking at him critically said, =E2=80=9CIs that what you want?\nYou sa=\r\ny that you are suffering at the sight of their troubles. Does that\nmean tha=\r\nt you yourself are all right unlike them and are happy?=E2=80=9D\n\n=E2=80=9C=\r\nNo, I am also suffering in one way or other,=E2=80=9D said that young man.\n=\r\n\n=E2=80=9CAh! that is the trouble. You do not know what is your own happine=\r\nss, and\nyet you are worried about others. Is it possible to make all people=\r\n similar?\nIf all get into the palanquin, who is to carry it? If all are kin=\r\ngs, what is\nthe point in saying that any one is a king?\n\nSome people will b=\r\ne known as wealthy only if others are poor. A Jnani can be\nrecognised only =\r\nwhen there are ignorant people. Darkness will be known only\nwhen there is l=\r\night.Happiness will be known only if there is suffering. Food\nwill be taste=\r\nful only if there is hunger.\n\nHence, help can be rendered only to the exten=\r\nt possible, but if it is\ndesired to make all people equally happy, that is =\r\nnever possible.\n\nA number of leaders of the country are working. Some of th=\r\nem say the work\nthat has been contemplated has not been finished properly a=\r\nnd so they will\nlecture. What for? People become leaders one after another =\r\nand work goes\non. There must be one shakti directing them all. If we throw =\r\nthe burden on\nthat shakti with the confidence that it can do what is requir=\r\ned and be free\nfrom worry, things will somehow go on.\n\nSome preach against =\r\nthe killing of animals. If people do not listen to\nthem,they say they will =\r\nfast unto death, =E2=80=98We will commit suicide or we will\ngive up life=E2=\r\n=80=99. If one says he will commit suicide, if others do not give up\nkillin=\r\ng animals, is not suicide itself a killing of a living being? They\nthink su=\r\nicide is merely leaving the body. Is not the body a part of the\nself? Atma =\r\nis always there, at all times and all places. Instead of looking\nat the Sel=\r\nf which is real and permanent, if one looks upon the body, etc. as\none=E2=\r\n=80=99s own Self, it is suicide. What other murder could there be than that=\r\n?\n\nHe who is able to see his own Self by knowledge and wisdom will not be m=\r\noved\nby whatever conflicts may come about. He will look upon the sorrows an=\r\nd\nhappiness of the world as mere acting on a stage. In his view the whole\nw=\r\norld is a stage.\n\nOn that stage the same man once puts on the dress of a ki=\r\nng, another time of\na minister, next a servant, washerman,barber, and many =\r\nother dresses, and\nacts appropriately on each occasion, but as he is consci=\r\nous of his real Self\nand knows\nthat he is not any one of those whose parts =\r\nhe is acting, he does not worry\nabout the various vicissitudes of life he d=\r\nepicts on each occasion. In the\nsame manner, the world is a stage of Ishwar=\r\na. In that stage you are an\nactor. You may help to the extent of your abili=\r\nty, but you cannot make all\npeople equal.It has not been possible in the pa=\r\nst for anybody to do so and\nit will not be possible in future either.=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n\nThe young man said, =E2=80=9CBecause of all this, there is no peace in=\r\n this world. I\nam unhappy about that.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CLook, you have come=\r\n again to the point where you\nbegan,=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan replied. =E2=80=9CI=\r\nnstead of feeling concerned about there being no peace\nin the world, it is =\r\nbetter to enquire and find out how you will get peace in\nthis world. If you=\r\n give up that objective,what is the use of worrying\nyourself about the lack=\r\n of peace in the world? If one=E2=80=99s mind has peace, the\nwhole world wi=\r\nll appear peaceful. Tell me, have you that peace?=E2=80=9D asked\nBhagavan.\n=\r\n\nThat person said, =E2=80=9CNo.=E2=80=9D\n\n=E2=80=9CAh! that is the thing. Y=\r\nou do not have peace. You do not know how to secure\nthat peace. If instead =\r\nof trying to gain that peace, you attempt to secure\npeace for the world, it=\r\n is like one who has no food, asking for food himself\nwhich, if given, he s=\r\nays he will use to feed any number of other people.\nSomething like the lame=\r\n man who said, =E2=80=98If only someone holds me up can=E2=80=99t I\nbeat up=\r\n the thieves!=E2=80=99=E2=80=9D\n\nSources:\n\n1) Letters from Sri Ramanasramam=\r\n VOLUMES I, II & Letters from and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasramam By SURI=\r\n NAGAMMA Translated by D.
