I will give this a real g=\r\no starting this week.\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Satish =\r\nDeshpande &lt;satishdesh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear          aparnaji - namast=\r\ne\n&gt; \n&gt; What you had done once can / should become a daily practice. \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nn our scriptures lot of rules and regulations are given which are primarily=\r\n subjective and not objective. According to desha, kala and sthiti these ar=\r\ne bound to change / have transformation. So do not hesitate to have this in=\r\n your daily routine. You can utilize your precious time in this way.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n&#39;ll suggest one more step for the ease of your homam. You might have seen r=\r\nudrabhishek ritual in shiva temples. On the same line purchase one tripod, =\r\none small half circular pot [ =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=B2=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80=\r\n, =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B7=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=\r\n=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 etc. ] with a small hole at the bottom and an a=\r\nppropriate home kunda. Adjust position of tripod, circular pot w.r.t. centr=\r\ne of fire and half fill this pot with ghee, [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=AF ] or=C2=A0 [=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B2] =\r\nseasem oil. This havan dravya in liquid form will start following in the ce=\r\nntre of fire drop by drop and at the same time you can recite your mantra. =\r\nDo not bother for touch with homedravya every time while reciting mantra, s=\r\npeed w.r.t. drop of ghee e.etc. Some time more drops will follow or some ti=\r\nme more mantras will be recited. But most imp is your involvement in mantra=\r\n chanting with least distraction and you will not be bothered for offering =\r\naahuti every time while doing other house hold work.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know this is so=\r\nme what break away from ancient practice, rules etc but in=C2=A0 current wo=\r\nrld scenario doing sincere sadhana is imp. There might be a some objections=\r\n=C2=A0 on this practice but try this and you will find more peace, ease of =\r\ndoing home in such a way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                 =\r\n        Yours sincerely\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;                             =\r\n Satish\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 30/7/12, sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam in=\r\n the kitchen while standing\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Mond=\r\nay, 30 July, 2012, 2:14 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Dear all,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m afraid I have a very stupid question. Is it okay to do homam wh=\r\nile standing up? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I once did a very simple homam while cooking. =\r\nWhile the food cooked for 20-30 minutes, I muttered the mantras and tended =\r\nto a small homam kunda (basically a brass bowl, with some wooden sticks and=\r\n ghee and basil leaf offerings) that I placed on the table next to the cook=\r\ning food. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It was a very pleasant experience. Far from feeling d=\r\nistracted, the simplicity of the whole process made it easier for me to foc=\r\nus on the mantra. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The key thing is I could do this sort of a ho=\r\nmam every day, as I cook most days. And my family would not complain that I=\r\n am spending too much time away from them doing spiritual things. (It might=\r\n even give the food a better flavour as people say that food cooked while r=\r\nepeating mantras with feeling absorbs the mantra...who knows!)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n am thinking of doing an ultra simple homam while standing in the kitchen. =\r\nPlease tell me if you think this is against the scriptures, as I wouldn&#39;t w=\r\nant to do it if so.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I know people say feeling is more important =\r\nthat ritual. This homam procedure gives me a pretty good feeling. I&#39;m plann=\r\ning to give it a try again and see how it feels. I was wondering if there i=\r\ns anything in the scriptures that forbids doing homam standing up? If I can=\r\n generate concentration and feeling while standing and doing the homam, sur=\r\nely it will be equally effective (I hope so anyway). \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks ver=\r\ny much in advance. Sorry if it sounds silly! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nP.S. I am doing a weekly homam the &#39;proper&#39; way i.e. sitting down and focus=\r\nsing. Just wanted to do a daily one and this would be the best way for me r=\r\night now. I have read the Agnihotra homam can be done &quot;anywhere&quot; so wonderi=\r\nng about other homams.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
