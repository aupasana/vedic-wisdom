It symbolizes absorbing \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndigesting experiences. As you make offerings in fire and they \n&gt; burn in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; fire, various spiritual experiences are processed and digested \nby\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; your internal fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Tongue is that which allows one to tast=\r\ne things that one is \ngoing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to accept inside and digest. Each tongue =\r\nof fire stands for a \n&gt; spirit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that controls how you absorb spiritual=\r\n experiences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The seven tongues of Agni a=\r\nre: Kaali, Karaali, Manojava, \n&gt; Sulohita,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sudhoomra-Varna, Sphulingi=\r\nni, and Vishwaruchi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Kaali is the dark and black/blue fire.

Spirit of detachment contr=\r\nols how you absorb your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences, when you are offering in that to=\r\nngue of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Karaali is the monstrous, dreadful fire that lo=\r\noks like a wide \n&gt; open\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mouth.

That in \nturn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\necides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal fire are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recei=\r\nving food right now.
