It is understandable if he says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe =\r\nthat such a great person claims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what re=\r\nally is the definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?\n\nSome=\r\n months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with h=\r\nim on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/t=\r\nheological debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he sto=\r\npped the debate because I was getting agitated and it would have affected o=\r\nur friendship. \n=C2=A0\nWhenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will o=\r\nnly mention that what he can support using logic. Therefore he never genera=\r\nlly discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate s=\r\ncriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)=C2=A0but not about mystici=\r\nsm or sadhana or anything which=C2=A0needs a belief system. That is why mos=\r\nt people know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and unco=\r\nrruptable=C2=A0human being.=C2=A0=C2=A0They have no clue about his meditati=\r\nons or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and generally would=\r\n not discuss God in public.\n=C2=A0\nTherefore our discussion was also on tho=\r\nse aspects which can be proved or disproved theologically=C2=A0- 1) Is Rama=\r\n a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C2=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him =\r\nas God=C2=A0.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. \n=C2=A0\n2) To the=\r\n second question he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it =\r\nis right or wrong=C2=A0- but his personal opinion is that one should try to=\r\n follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He s=\r\naid, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ra=\r\nvana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he=\r\n was=C2=A0located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Ram=\r\na did not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the h=\r\numan way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas=\r\n than to worship Rama.\n=C2=A0\n3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a l=\r\niterary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to =\r\nBrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been f=\r\nlouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equat=\r\nes women with animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces=\r\n in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Ther=\r\nefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he ar=\r\ngues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarh=\r\nood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was=\r\n there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this =\r\nplane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nThe above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nDear Utpal,\n=C2=A0\nOne request, if you can speak to him about his th=\r\nought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.\n=C2=A0\nI have been out of touch with =\r\nhim since August, been busy myself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know =\r\nwhether he will respond. Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/=\r\ndebates anything from a purely spiritual angle. \n=C2=A0\nIt was only by chan=\r\nce that I found out one day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed=\r\n them when asked.\n=C2=A0\nI have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from=\r\n a scientific point of view - about why there is no harm in having regulate=\r\nd amounts of meat (not red meat). \n=C2=A0\nBut I say, as Narasimha said, thi=\r\ns person should not be taken as an ideal regarding food=C2=A0 habits.

He is married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n=C2=A0\nBe=\r\nfore I tell you anything more=C2=A0about his spiritual life=C2=A0that I kno=\r\nw, let me say=C2=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I m=\r\net him about two years back. What first attracted me to=C2=A0 towards him w=\r\nas his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2=A0when it comes to=C2=\r\n=A0honestly.=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to j=\r\nust say a simple, harmless=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would n=\r\not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never =\r\never=C2=A0spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he=\r\n was in his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are ric=\r\nher than English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him Engl=\r\nish is more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got =\r\nconfused. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one=\r\n English, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading t=\r\nhe English dictionary and\n one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from=\r\n reading=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2=A0When I asked=\r\n him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C2=A0equally adept at =\r\nboth the languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to ju=\r\ndge the truth about=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, h=\r\ne has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth abo=\r\nut anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in dif=\r\nferent fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for=\r\n long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hind=\r\ni, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He co=\r\nmposes poetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he consid=\r\nered himself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place mak=\r\nered for religion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the for=\r\nms saw that blank space, he asked\n my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, =\r\nthe clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the =\r\nclerk and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist=\r\n and writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. \n=C2=A0\nSo this gives=\r\n a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows h=\r\nim, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n=C2=A0\nOne day, long back, he was going to =\r\noffice for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna templ=\r\ne. As he was passing by in=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urg=\r\ne to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside =\r\nthe temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he =\r\nsees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how th=\r\ne time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into th=\r\ne temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any =\r\nmovement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had =\r\nno idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep slee=\r\np.\n=C2=A0\nThen he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2=A0that he=\r\n got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most =\r\npeople who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samad=\r\nhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same pla=\r\nce and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2=A0 Only his wife and close=\r\n relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits f=\r\nor meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him =\r\nhow he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe =\r\norginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the anim=\r\nals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the=\r\n atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=A0He=\r\n considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.Tha=\r\nt is why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevate=\r\nd Sri=C2=A0Rama to the\n level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmi=\r\nki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2=A0not a God.The differ=\r\nence he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordin=\r\nary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be em=\r\nulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2=A0can try to =\r\nlead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely =\r\nstating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and=\r\n advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is =\r\nnot an atheist any more.\n=C2=A0\nLater he had once=C2=A0mentioned he knew th=\r\ne relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mot=\r\nher he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lo=\r\nt of time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=\r\n=C2=A0with those in=C2=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and=\r\n everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, et=\r\nc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be th=\r\ne future of this country.\n=C2=A0\nHe is am omnivorous person. Like any other=\r\n Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.\n=C2=A0\nI shall refrain from mentioning his n=\r\name because I had not asked his permission before mentioning him.\n=C2=A0\n-R=\r\negards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nPS: I would not like this mail to be considered as =\r\na part of the debate.

Nothing can be more God than=\r\n Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The =\r\nabove are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Utpal,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;One=\r\n request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll b=\r\ne great.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have been out of touc=\r\nh with him since August, been busy myself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;=\r\nt know whether he will respond. Because as I explained above, he rarely dis=\r\ncusses/debates anything from a purely spiritual angle. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It was only by chance that I found out one day about his meditati=\r\nons etc and then he confirmed them when asked.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific point of v=\r\niew - about why there is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat (not r=\r\ned meat). &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;But I say, as Narasimha said, this =\r\nperson should not be taken as an ideal regarding food&nbsp; habits. Sachin =\r\ncan bat and score century even with a sore back, we will not be able to do =\r\nit. His strength is his control of mind and his dedication to truth. &lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STR=\r\nONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verda=\r\nna&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The=\r\n upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;=\r\n/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 15/12/09, Kishore Chitra=\r\npu &lt;I&gt;&lt;chitrapu@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PA=\r\nDDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;From: Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

Do you know him=\r\n as a friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he following?=\r\n? Is he a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his =\r\nlife after&nbsp; he had these samadhi and visions.Any other special things =\r\nabout him.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Yes he is a friend of mine.&nbsp; I can only tell you very little about hi=\r\ns spiritual life, because he hardly ever shares it with anyone. He is marri=\r\ned, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Befo=\r\nre I tell you anything more&nbsp;about his spiritual life&nbsp;that I know,=\r\n let me say&nbsp;line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met=\r\n him about two years back. What first attracted me to&nbsp; towards him was=\r\n his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac&nbsp;when it comes to&nbsp=\r\n;honestly.&nbsp;If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to jus=\r\nt say a simple, harmless&nbsp;lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not=\r\n say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ev=\r\ner&nbsp;spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he w=\r\nas in his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are riche=\r\nr than English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him Englis=\r\nh is more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got co=\r\nnfused. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one E=\r\nnglish, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one\n hour reading th=\r\ne English dictionary and one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from r=\r\neading&nbsp;up volumes of Hindi and English literature.&nbsp;When I asked h=\r\nim why, he just said it is because he wanted to be&nbsp;equally adept at bo=\r\nth the languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judg=\r\ne the truth about&nbsp;which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he =\r\nhas an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about=\r\n anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in diffe=\r\nrent fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for l=\r\nong in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi,=\r\n Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He comp=\r\noses poetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he consider=\r\ned himself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place maker=\r\ned for religion as blank. When the clerk who was\n supposed to take the form=\r\ns saw that blank space, he asked my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, th=\r\ne clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the cl=\r\nerk and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist a=\r\nnd writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his frie=\r\nnds, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. H=\r\nis way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in&nbsp;h=\r\nis scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says =\r\nhe still does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was =\r\nat 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the =\r\nevening! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the pr=\r\niest, the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed=\r\n as he was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt=\r\n scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He rem=\r\nembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;T=\r\nhen he started meditating at home, and it was there&nbsp;that he got vision=\r\ns etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who =\r\nknow him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 h=\r\nours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same=\r\n position for 3 days continuously.&nbsp; Only his wife and close relatives =\r\nknow about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditati=\r\non he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt=\r\n during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates f=\r\nrom me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, w=\r\nomen, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and b=\r\nigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.&nbsp;He considers =\r\nSri Krishna to be God and&nbsp;Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he=\r\n does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it\n elevated Sri&nbsp=\r\n;Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana=\r\n was to show Sri Rama as an ideal &lt;I&gt;man,&nbsp;&lt;/I&gt;not a God.The difference=\r\n he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary =\r\nman can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulat=\r\ned by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one&nbsp;can try to lead=\r\n his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stat=\r\ning his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and adv=\r\nises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not =\r\nan atheist any more.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Later he had once&nbsp;me=\r\nntioned he knew the relation he had with all the people around him in his p=\r\nast lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowad=\r\nays he spends a lot of time on different internet forums interacting with p=\r\neople, specially&nbsp;with those in&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, discuss=\r\ning anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian histo=\r\nry, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young peopl=\r\ne who will be the future of this country.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He i=\r\ns am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I h=\r\nad not asked his permission before mentioning him.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;PS: I wo=\r\nuld not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.

So he is offering all these non-veg to L=\r\nord with devotion, Right?? Then prasdam all around??&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My curious ques=\r\ntions are not against your acceptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.A=\r\nfter all he is\n part of hidden violence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome&nb=\r\nsp; pain and misery on animals and birds on his behalf and he is consuming =\r\nthem and yet he is experiencing all these exotic&nbsp; visions, But no feel=\r\ning of kindness towards birds and animals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where did I go wrong? Sim=\r\nple dal/roti and do not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi=\r\n? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in =\r\na book/article&nbsp; about Dayamata who succeded&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand.=\r\n Once she went to India and told a Spiritual Master that her progress has s=\r\ntopped. Master said, you are eating eggs which she admitted that she was do=\r\ning&nbsp; secretly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is very complex world. No outright solution=\r\ns for so many difficult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originat=\r\ned in middle east are fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, =\r\nfrom which part of Spiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also en=\r\nemies\n there?? Their Gods said in their holy books that animals are their f=\r\nood. So they cannot even think about souls in animals or their pain and emo=\r\ntions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then I have read stories about several people, who follow the=\r\nse faiths and are non-veg and how they exexperience&nbsp; spiritual highs a=\r\nnd other such phenomena. It is so difficult to comprehend.&nbsp; Would they=\r\n remain in the cycle of b/d&nbsp; till they learn about kindness???&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nKind Regards&lt;BR&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On Sat, 12/12/09, rajar=\r\nshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://co.in/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;co.in&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
