For example if one has listened to a particular upakhaya=\r\nna or story one would get certain results. In particular:\n\n1. One very ofte=\r\nn finds statements like &quot;if one has read even one shloka, or half a shloka =\r\nor even one fourth a shloka one shall be delivered of all sins&quot;.\n\n2. Anothe=\r\nr example one story in harivamsha purana says that if one has listened to i=\r\nt, one shall never be born in a tiryak or animal yoni.\n\n3. Padma purana giv=\r\nes phala shurti for each chapter of the Gita.\n\nThere are many many such sta=\r\ntements that one can find in texts. By reading them, one gets a feeling tha=\r\nt these statements must be exaggerations since how can one get delievered o=\r\nf all sins by simply reading one-fourth of a shloka? But then, such stateme=\r\nnts being made by scriptures, cannot be doubted so easily.\n\nWhat should be =\r\nmade out of such statements? Is reading one-fourth of a shloka really so po=\r\nwerful?\n\n-Veneet\n\n\n\n"}}
