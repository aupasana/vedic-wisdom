T=\r\nhis was made this way for the oridinary people to understand and not leave =\r\nthe folds of Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism. That is why not only t=\r\nhese stories were &quot;made&quot; which were based on deeper spiritual symbolism gen=\r\nerated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and made easier. Th=\r\ne sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskrit of the puranic age.\n=\r\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The reason Buddism could become such a threat to Hinduism was becau=\r\nse the people (priests)=A0had reducded the Vedas to a book of mere rituals.=\r\n The Vedas are both internal and external, but the priests took over the re=\r\nligion from the sages/mystics and reduced/neglected/forgot the internal and=\r\n=A0relied solely on the external. That is why Buddha rejected the Vedas.\n&gt; =\r\nInfact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was a wrong step in the cy=\r\ncle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice after Krishna and tha=\r\nt, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. However, the coming of Buddha=\r\n was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall spiritual evolution of =\r\nthis world by increasing the distance between God and man. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; So esse=\r\nntially, the Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood movies as compa=\r\nred to the Vedas which were the Art films.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; My personal take on this=\r\n: As far as they are able to induce spirituality in an very average ordinar=\r\ny person from a village they are excellent. But at the same time, if a Hind=\r\nu who is not aware of the comprehensive nature of his own scriptures, a poo=\r\nr, uneducated man,=A0is told that his idols are mere stones and his stories=\r\n are cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily much beyond all this, th=\r\ne idea of a single God, would be enough reason to make him switch religions=\r\n. It would sound very logical to him. Infact, this is how it often happens.=\r\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need to learn our re=\r\nligion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on television would d=\r\no well to try and educate their followers about the comprehensive/all inclu=\r\nsive=A0nature of Hinduism instead of mere reciting the stories from teh Pur=\r\nanas.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 24/4=\r\n/09, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;ved=\r\nic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Our Deities and their stories =\r\n(Deities in different religions!)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date=\r\n: Friday, 24 April, 2009, 10:02 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasi=\r\nmha Garu and friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi&#39;s question was in some aspect similar t=\r\no one question i was asked about a month ago. while traveling back to home =\r\nfrom office, one person asked me that what is these stories of our Gods suc=\r\nh as Ganapati and his story of being Shiva&#39;s son and cutting of head and re=\r\nplaced by elephant head etc...\n&gt; Stories of Vishnu and like wise many gods =\r\nand goddesses.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; A fantastic question and one that downplays the importance of religion =\r\nand rituals in the minds of intelligent and rational people! Hence a very i=\r\nmportant question to answer..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To answer it, I will go back to the =\r\nanalogy I gave just a few days back:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- wisdom/message/ 1673 (Why rituals)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The ch=\r\nild is taught by parents to say things like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in diff=\r\nerent situations. I compared it to engaging in rituals and repeating mantra=\r\ns without understanding. I said that the child slowly understands the true =\r\nmeaning with experience and feels the emotions represented by those words w=\r\nhen saying them. I compared it to a sadhaka experiencing spiritual truths r=\r\nepresented by the rituals as he gains experience and becomes more ready.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, think about this. Parents speaking different languages teach di=\r\nfferent words to the child. A parent speaking English may teach &quot;I am sorry=\r\n&quot;. A parent speaking Hindi may teach &quot;mujhe maaf keejiye&quot;. Another Hindi sp=\r\neaking person may teach &quot;mujhe maaf karo&quot;. A parent speaking Telugu may tea=\r\nch &quot;nannu kshaminchandi&quot; . Another Telugu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu =\r\nkshaminchu&quot;. And so on. The words are different. But they represent the sam=\r\ne thought and emotion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Actually, at one level, the meaning is slig=\r\nhtly different in each case, depending on the peculiarities and cultural co=\r\nntext of the language used. For example, the English expression has &quot;I&quot; as =\r\nthe subject and one is talking about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu ex=\r\npressions have the other person as the subject and asking him to forgive. T=\r\nhe amount of respect shown is different in different expressions. Thus, the=\r\n exact meaning is slightly different. Thus, children speaking different lan=\r\nguages may visualize something slightly different as their understanding of=\r\n the languages improves. However, these differences are minor. As one delve=\r\ns deeper, the basic emotions associated with these different expressions is=\r\n the same in different languages and one will feel those emotions with comp=\r\nassion as one masters the language.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, deities, rituals an=\r\nd mantras used in different religious traditions may be different, but they=\r\n may represent the same divine energy and the same spiritual experiences. J=\r\nust as the immeidate visualization of an expression in the mind of a child =\r\nmay change based on cultural context and grammar that one is exposed to, th=\r\ne immeidate imagination of a deity&#39;s gross/external form in the mind of a s=\r\nadhaka may change based on the religious paradigms and spirutal context tha=\r\nt one is exposed to. However, these differences are minor. As one delves de=\r\neper, the basic energies and experiences represented by various deities and=\r\n rituals are the same in different religious traditions and one will experi=\r\nence the same spiritual truths as one masters one&#39;s path.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No wonde=\r\nr Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot; (Truth is One, but the le=\r\narned say it differently) .\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One language may have a=\r\n lot of different words for an object with slight variation whereas another=\r\n language may have fewer words. As an example, a language spoken near equat=\r\nor may have a single word for &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, whereas Eng=\r\nlish has so many words. Native language of Alaskans, who live in snow and i=\r\nce most of the year, has many more words than English for slightly differen=\r\nt kinds of snow, whereas English calls all of them as &quot;snow&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Simi=\r\nlarly, religious traditions that explored slightly different kinds of the s=\r\name divine energy may have personified those energies as different deities.=\r\n So some religions may have more deities than some other religions. Some re=\r\nligions may have a lot of deities for different variations of a similar pur=\r\npose, whereas another religion may have only one deity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; If communication can be internalized and we can communicate with our e=\r\nmotions, we do not need language and we will all be on the same page always=\r\n. But we cannot communicate with our internal emotions and need an external=\r\n method. So language is needed. But language can divide.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly=\r\n, spiritual truths are internal (like our emotions). In order to express th=\r\nem and transmit them to others, we need deities, mantras, rituals and relig=\r\nion. But religion can divide.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One child may say &quot;I am sorry&quot; and a=\r\nnother may say another expression meaning the same thing and they may argue=\r\n who is right. One may say &quot;my father said this is correct&quot; and another may=\r\n say &quot;my mother said this is correct&quot; and they may fight on who is correct.=\r\n People fighting over whose religion is superior and trying to &quot;convert&quot; ot=\r\nhers are like such children. Unfortunately, my &quot;child and language&quot; analogy=\r\n is too mild in this area and the fights between religions have been far wo=\r\nrse than two children arguing about their language. Countless people have b=\r\neen murdered in the name of religion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of arguing which exp=\r\nression is correct and finding fault with others, children learning should =\r\nfocus on the true meaning of what they saying and try to understand what ex=\r\nactly their expression means and feel the correct emotions when they say th=\r\nings. Similarly, instead of fighting with others on religion, one should tr=\r\ny to understand one&#39;s own religion better and experience the spiritual trut=\r\nhs represented in that religion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One may think ther=\r\ne is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu god etc and they are responsi=\r\nble for respective religions and societies. That is not true.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If o=\r\nne believes that there is a supreme deity (whatever the name you use to des=\r\ncribe) who creates all beings, then one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, =\r\nChrist, Propher Mohammed and Mahavira were sent to this earth by that same =\r\nsupreme deity and different religions came into being only because that sup=\r\nreme deity willed so! Each religion serves a useful purpose at a given plac=\r\ne and a time. When a religion&#39;s time is up, it goes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Some may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspec=\r\nts of divine energy running the universe are a creation of the mind. Howeve=\r\nr, they are not a creation of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulat=\r\ned many layers of conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ev=\r\ner seen or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this lif=\r\ne, but may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulat=\r\ned through many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following mes=\r\nsage:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He had not read about some of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above t=\r\nhe fire. But he saw them and could describe them. This is because those for=\r\nms represent a personification of a certain energy and his mind imagined th=\r\nat energy in that form in a previous life. The memory stayed with the mind =\r\n(though not consciously) and it can come back anytime. So, though he did no=\r\nt know about that form, that form appeared before him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Vivek=\r\nananda famously said (paraphrased) , &quot;a human being imagines god as a super=\r\n human being with many hands and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may i=\r\nmagine god as a super buffalo with many horns&quot;. Though he is right in a sen=\r\nse, it is misleading too. It may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Tho=\r\nugh external forms are a work of the mind, that does not make them unimport=\r\nant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Until one learns how to feel sorry and show that feeling, say=\r\ning &quot;I am sorry&quot; as a ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a child wo=\r\nrds because he cannot anyway understand their correct meaning is wrong. The=\r\n child should be taught even if he does not understand. He will understand =\r\nthe true meaning later Similarly, though the energy represented by a form i=\r\ns more basic than a specific external form associated with that energy, man=\r\ny people will reach that energy only by imagining that form and worshipping=\r\n that form. So, if one&#39;s mind tends to imagine a form, one should imagine t=\r\nhe form and worship that form.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though we say that forms of deities=\r\n and mystical experiences are a creation of mind, that is in a vedantic sen=\r\nse, i.e. the entire manifested universe is a creation of the mind (over man=\r\ny lives). Only Brahman is real and not created by the mind. Everything else=\r\n is a creation of the mind over the time. If we say that a form of a deity =\r\nor an experience is an imagination of the mind, it does not mean it is a ha=\r\nllucination. Mind is connected to its field of experience. Various minds in=\r\n its field of experience are connected to it. For example, the experience d=\r\nescribed in the following message was independently &quot;observed&quot; by two peopl=\r\ne. Human mind can imagine things and hallucinate, but two minds observing t=\r\nhe same thing is different from a typical hallucination:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://gr=\r\noups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most divine form=\r\ns and divine experiences chronicled in sacred texts of various religions ha=\r\nve been independently experienced by multiple people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; When someone looks sad, one person may say &quot;he is sad&quot;. Another person m=\r\nay say &quot;woh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person may say &quot;vaadu baadha padutunnaadu&quot; =\r\n. Similarly, when a divine energy is present in a place, one may perceive t=\r\nhe energy as deity X and another may perceive it as a deity Y. Just as the =\r\nexpression one uses to describe the feeling one perceives is based on the l=\r\nanguage one knows, similarly the form mentioned by one to describe the eneg=\r\ny one perceives depends on the conditioning of one&#39;s mind and the religious=\r\n tradition one is exposed to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know one person who does Chandi ho=\r\nmam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the Divine Mother into his h=\r\neart by showing the fire with his hands and motioning the hands towards his=\r\n heart (with eyes closed). When he does it, he just perceives a nice energy=\r\n around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he was doing this oneday, a =\r\ngentleman was visiting and sitting right behind him. His eyes were closed a=\r\nnd he was meditating. When the above happened, he was baffled and opened hi=\r\ns eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision of a dark goddess who was =\r\njumping towards him along with a big pile of kumkum (vermillion powder) all=\r\n around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and opened his eyes. But the =\r\nperson who did homam perceived only some nice energy and no specific form. =\r\nThus, the same energy may be perceived by different people in a different f=\r\norm. One person may perceive only some energy and another may perceive a sp=\r\necific form. Yet another may\n&gt;  perceive a different form. The exact percep=\r\ntion is based on the conditioning of the mind. But the energy itself is uni=\r\nform, though the form is not.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have covered variou=\r\ns aspects related to this topic.
