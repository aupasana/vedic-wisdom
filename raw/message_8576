In a private communication, Sri Svoboda made some poi=\r\nnts that I liked. I am sharing it with you with his kind permission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Instead of focusing on offending gods or any other beings, as=\r\n some people do, please note that he focused on the prevailing gunas and al=\r\nso on downward movement of apaana vaayu. Focused sadhana is meant to make a=\r\npana move up (Kundalini moves up when praana and apaana meet) and some phys=\r\nical conditions direct apana heavily downward (e.g. full bowels, monthly pe=\r\nriods, full bladder).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Of course, in the end, when one is dyi=\r\nng, one MAY need to focus mind on god and make apana move up, under equally=\r\n (if not more) challenging circumstances. But one can make things easy and =\r\ncontrolled, when still alive and practicing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If I may a=\r\ndd my 2 cents of perspective to the learned opinion below, please keep in m=\r\nind that some highly taamasik men may be influenced by tamas more than some=\r\n highly saattwik women even in their first day of periods. Things are relat=\r\nive. Also, many people (men and women) do most of their sadhana when their =\r\napaana is clearly directed downwards and does not move up at all. They do n=\r\not experience anything. Sadhana in such stages is for instilling discipline=\r\n rather than making apaana move up and meet with praana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt; Astrology & Spirituality Res=\r\nources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- For=\r\nwarded Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Robert Svoboda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: Narasimha P.V.R.

The second day is ruled by rajas,\n&gt; &gt; and that devi is r=\r\ned; and the third day is ruled by sattva, and that\n&gt; &gt; devi is white. Durin=\r\ng those first 3 days I believe it is better for a\n&gt; &gt; woman to be away from=\r\n everybody except other women; better for them\n&gt; &gt; not to cook, clean &c; a=\r\nnd better for them not to involve\n&gt; &gt; themselves in ritual. After all, when=\r\n apana is moving downwards\n&gt; &gt; strongly, why disturb vayu by performing som=\r\ne activity like puja &c\n&gt; &gt; that is meant to encourage vayu to move upwards=\r\n?  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;After\n&gt; &gt; that, I think it depends on the woman. Some =\r\nwomen are basically\n&gt; &gt; balanced and even if they spot for a day or two mor=\r\ne, the bleeding is\n&gt; &gt; effectively ended by the third day. Other women blee=\r\nd heavily for\n&gt; &gt; four or five days, during which time apana is clearly sti=\r\nll moving\n&gt; &gt; downward; in these cases, I think they are better off waiting=\r\n until\n&gt; &gt; the main flow ends.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;IMO\n&gt; &gt; during this period =\r\na woman can still do japa & internal\n&gt; &gt; meditation and naama japa, but in =\r\nan easy, sahaja, saumya fashion; no\n&gt; &gt; kathina prayogas EXCEPT when for ce=\r\nrtain tantrika rituals, e.g. if\n&gt; &gt; the centerpiece of the ritual is to off=\r\ner menstrual blood, it can be\n&gt; &gt; a big help to have an actual menstruating=\r\n woman present, to invoke\n&gt; &gt; that particular shakti.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Ge=\r\nnerally\n&gt; &gt; I have found that so long as the woman is sufficiently comforta=\r\nble to\n&gt; &gt; be able to sit up, that there is no problem for her to sit and w=\r\natch\n&gt; &gt; someone doing a ritual, except when that ritual is of a type where=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the very presence of a menstruating woman can disturb the delicate\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n shakti that is being invoked. Sadly, I have found that most of the\n&gt; &gt; peo=\r\nple who claim that a menstruating woman can disturb them are\n&gt; &gt; people who=\r\n are not as sensitive as they imagine themselves to be.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nI\n&gt; &gt; often find that when I am myself doing homam and a menstruating woman=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; is sitting at the fire (which I usually permit so long as the woman\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; understands what she is doing), that the fire often doesn&#39;t burn as\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nell =E2=80&quot; this makes sense to me, and so I simply adapt to the\n&gt; &gt; situat=\r\nion (e.g. by having plenty of ghee on hand!). Watching homam is\n&gt; &gt; (I have=\r\n found) generally OK, except that for some sensitive women the\n&gt; &gt; activati=\r\non of agnitattva heats them up in a way that they can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; control.  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What\n&gt; &gt; does your heart tells you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Best\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;RS  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.
