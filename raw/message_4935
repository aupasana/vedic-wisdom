Some people use the tubes in which incense sticks (dhoop or agarbatti st=\r\nicks) are sold. Even with bamboo tubes, if air directly goes from mouth int=\r\no fire, it can carry saliva. The key is that air blown from mouth should to=\r\nuch some surface (e.g. inside wall of bamboo tube) at an angle slightly les=\r\ns than 180 deg, get reflected and then go towards fire. Then, air touching =\r\nfire will not have saliva in it. You can experiment by blowing air onto one=\r\n palm by reflecting it off the other palm.

The priest you mentioned below simply showed poo=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judgment and understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whe=\r\nn one blows air into homa kundam directly from mouth, small amounts of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s saliva and one&#39;s germs get into homa kundam. That is a very=\r\n bad idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one must absolutely blow air, V=\r\nimalananda suggests blowing through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand or some other object=\r\n, i.e. you blow onto your palm and the air reflects\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at a slig=\r\nht angle and goes into homa kundam. That is better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I never blow air. When=\r\n fire is getting smaller, I offer ghee, sesame seeds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or wood =\r\nto make it bigger. One need not wait so long that fire is about to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguish. One should make it bigger earlier.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ideally, there should be fire in a bigger part of homa kundam than sm=\r\noke.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If fire has gone out in a bigger part of the homa kundam=\r\n and there is smoke\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and if fire is present in a smaller part =\r\nof homa kundam, that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inauspicious and ineffective. Lord Vi=\r\nshnu specifically taught that homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be done with more =\r\nfire in homa kundam than smoke.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the habit=\r\n of waiting till fire becomes so small that it comes close\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n extinguishing, is a bad one to start with. One should maintain a bigger\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire always.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When a sadhaka with a very thin kaarmik pipeline =\r\ndoes something, the result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is seen very soon. So, if one star=\r\nts a wrong practice, one will see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result soon and learn o=\r\nne&#39;s lesson. When someone with a very deep kaarmik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pipeline s=\r\ntarts engaging in a wrong practice, the result may be seen much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; much later. By that time, one may have done that wrong thing too many ti=\r\nmes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests used to do intens=\r\ne sadhana and burn their karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even if they did something w=\r\nrong, they would quickly figure it out and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct themselves=\r\n. Many priests of today have very deep kaarmik pipelines,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do =\r\nnot do much sadhana and the Nature&#39;s feedback system is broken.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When a pri=\r\nest or someone respectable does something incorrect, one can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nspeak out if one thinks there is a reasonable chance of benefit from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaking out. Some priests are open-minded and understanding, but s=\r\nome are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; egoistic and they do not want to be corrected by laym=\r\nen. If one questions a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; priest and the priest becomes angry, c=\r\nan one remain calm or will one start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to feel guilty or scared=\r\n? If so, one should not question. One should not do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something=\r\n, unless one is prepared for the consequences.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedi=\r\ncastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- pinky s &lt;shakti.axapta@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Res=\r\npected sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With the inspriration of &quot;Do Homam Yourself&quot; from Pujya Sri PVR N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rao garu, i thought it would be a gud idea to perf=\r\norm mahalakshmi homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during sravana month friday and appro=\r\nached a brahmin priest for the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lotus =\r\nflowers dipped in honey, Bilva fruits, Bilva leaves and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n flowers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were offered during the homa with 16 times recital=\r\n of Srisuktham.

When the homam fire was weakened and about to extinguis=\r\nh, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; priest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has blown air through his mouth=\r\n directly into teh homa kundam to increase\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the intensity of=\r\n flames in it :(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i have heard from my grandmother that blow=\r\ning air through mouth into a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flame/fire is equal to spittin=\r\ng on it and its a very unholy act. Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i =\r\nthought that my &#39;fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through =\r\nmouth)&#39; knowledge may not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relevant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the=\r\n homam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be well experienced in performing homams.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PLease comment something about this and enlighten us=\r\n with your knowledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that i will be carefu=\r\nl from next time.
