This diversity of topics is by design, since ther=\r\ne is no aspect of the human experience that Dharma does not touch upon dire=\r\nctly and conclusively.  Thus, while each one of these short wisdom sayings =\r\nwill provide a deeply spiritual vision to the reader, some of them also com=\r\nment upon such seemingly &quot;secular&quot; aspects of human thought as psychology, =\r\npolitics, economics, social science, culture, aesthetics and health.
