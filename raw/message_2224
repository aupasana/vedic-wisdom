One is the\nmother of Indian culture and the other is the father o=\r\nf Indian spirituality.\nBoth are mutually dependent on one another. Without =\r\nexecuting a Yajna at the\nend of a Gayatri Mantra chanting program (Anushtha=\r\nan) the latter remains\nincomplete. One portion of Japa or Mantra chanting i=\r\ns in the form of Havan\nor fire sacrifice. In ancient times when people were=\r\n materially well off a\ntenth portion of Mantra chanting program was devoted=\r\n to Yajna. But looking\nat today=92s circumstances a 100th portion of the nu=\r\nmber of Mantras chanted is\noffered as Ahutis (sacred materials to the Yajna=\r\n fire saying =91Swaahaa=92) to a\nYajna. Without this an Anushthaan remain i=\r\nncomplete. A question may arise\nthat what happens to those who are not mate=\r\nrially very well off? The answer\nis that such individuals should chant extr=\r\na Mantras amounting to a 10th\nportion of the number chanted during an Anush=\r\nthaan. For them this extra\nMantra Japa is considered equivalent to performi=\r\nng a Yajna. By giving this\noption it is not as though Yana is being ignored=\r\n but that its importance\nalbeit indirectly has been highlighted. Again it s=\r\nhould be noted that this\narrangement is only for the poor strata of society=\r\n.\n\n\n A dialogue between Janak and Yajnavalkya regarding the non availabilit=\r\ny of\nYajna materials took place. Janak insisted the problems of Yajna perfo=\r\nrmance\nare many and Yajnavalkya kept giving solutions to those problems thu=\r\ns\ninsisting that Yajnas were a very important aspect of Vedic culture. Jana=\r\nk\nasked: Suppose Yajna materials like Charu are not available what is to be=\r\n\ndone? The answer was: Conduct Yajnas using materials eaten by a person dai=\r\nly\n(rice, wheat, millet etc grains). Janak asked: Suppose there is no food =\r\nwhat\nhappens then? The answer is make-do with plants. Janak asked: Suppose =\r\nthere\nare no plants? The answer was that use only Samidha (wood based fuel)=\r\n for\nthe Yajna. Janak asked: Suppose fire itself is not available? The answ=\r\ner is\nthat mentally execute a Yajna using the fire of faith in a meditative=\r\n\nmanner. This is the gist of the long conversation that had taken place.\n\nF=\r\nrom the above it becomes clear that along with Gayatri Mantra Japa\nconducti=\r\nng a Yajna is a must. Further in an Anushthaan both these are\nmutually conj=\r\noined. Gayatri Japa and 5-fold Yajna are imperative. We all\nknow that conjo=\r\nined to meditative methods are the Balivaishwa rites and it\nis nothing but =\r\na mini Yajna. During dire times this Balivaishwa rite became\nso miniscule t=\r\nhat women after taking fire from their cooking pyre offered 5\nsmall parts o=\r\nf a Roti (Indian wheat bread) to it while chanting the Gayatri\nMantra. Thus=\r\n it was taken to be a Yajna. Further those who worshipped\nGayatri regularly=\r\n too performed this miniscule Yajna. Before partaking food\nthey would remov=\r\ne 5 small portions of food from their plates and offer it to\na small bowl o=\r\nf fire. Even today here and there this tradition can be seen\nin India. Toda=\r\ny Yuga Nirman Mission is trying to rejuvenate this tradion of\nminiscule Yaj=\r\nnas.\n\nIn ancient India great Rishi-Seers kept in mind at every step, wisdom=\r\n,\nsubtle viewpoint, utility and state of facts before embarking on any worl=\r\nd\nwelfare program. Despite giving due importance to Yajnas in religious\nact=\r\nivities they have kept many other precepts in mind too. They could never\nma=\r\nke any endeavor which had no great utility value. They have always gave\ndue=\r\n emphasis to the results and attainments while giving more importance to\nan=\r\ny sacred endeavor. Thus they gave Yajnas more importance amongst all\nspirit=\r\nual endeavors keeping in mind their capacity to bestow world denizens\nboth =\r\nmaterial and spiritual prosperity.\nAuthor:  Pt shriram Sharma Acharyaji\n-- =\r\n\nThank you and Have a Fulfilling Day\n\nVenkat Koppaka\n\r\n--0015175cb058f3f805047059c3e4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear ALL,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Super Mantra Gayatri and Yajnas are like an inseparable couple.
