I have already implemented some of the recommendat=\r\nions you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam Tva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot;=\r\n from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians sp=\r\neak Hindi, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;,=\r\n &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskri=\r\nt that a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowe=\r\nl. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They c=\r\narry that habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the =\r\nNorth Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s B=\r\nhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;,=\r\n which sounded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages li=\r\nke Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Mana=\r\nsa&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avad=\r\nhi also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that=\r\n, that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; =\r\n Saroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sr=\r\ni Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on this aspect as well. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, as=\r\nwinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: aswinefy2003 &lt;a=\r\nswinefy2003@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Common Sanskrit Pronunciati=\r\non Errors (Part 1)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thurs=\r\nday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion=\r\n, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot!&quot;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear narasimha guru=\r\nji \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing a great job to this universe by sharing your=\r\n knwledge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo humble!!!.Truth ia truth =\r\nand what ever you are saying is also truth .no need to consider yourself as=\r\n an idiot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR.

It=\r\n is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is m=\r\ny feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scholars, pronou=\r\nnce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorrectly.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion=\r\n and the spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronun=\r\nciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very importan=\r\nt in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from t=\r\nhe most complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people=\r\n who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;e=\r\nxperience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will writ=\r\ne my views on correct pronunciation and point out some common errors. If yo=\r\nu do not think that correct pronunciation is important or if you disagree w=\r\nith my assessment of the errors or if you do not want to change your pronun=\r\nciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if y=\r\nou are open to changing your pronunciation, please give a consideration to =\r\nmy views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words lik=\r\ne &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scho=\r\nlars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;t=\r\nu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corruption came in=\r\nto practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prac=\r\nhodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you change i=\r\nt into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, it becomes t=\r\nwo aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chhandas an=\r\nd changes the meaning also. You may still experience something when meditat=\r\ning on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the fullest =\r\nwith that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowel=\r\ns (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have just a co=\r\nnsonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and N=\r\nOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (withou=\r\nt adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener c=\r\nannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;=\r\nt&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has=\r\n the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhanda=\r\ns, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; co=\r\nrrectly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said=\r\n &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but o=\r\ntherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient=\r\n sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This m=\r\nakes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some oth=\r\ner vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and bec=\r\nomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas chang=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; =\r\nas &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to he=\r\nar, so that his students would not get confused when learning. Probably the=\r\n students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used t=\r\no that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standard practice after a=\r\n couple of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;p=\r\nath&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot;=\r\n as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be ad=\r\nded at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants a=\r\npplies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly enco=\r\nuntered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, pe=\r\nople normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing =\r\nthe chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wr=\r\nong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the=\r\n sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this =\r\nas &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symb=\r\nols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is dif=\r\nferent. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound b=\r\necause of their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now =\r\npronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will=\r\n be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never =\r\nhave two different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds for t=\r\nhe same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds =\r\nare different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D cop=\r\nper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaa=\r\nma moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining=\r\n the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties=\r\n), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developin=\r\ng detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; a=\r\ns &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. =\r\nEven &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a=\r\n human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have see=\r\nn it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you read=\r\n Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference betwe=\r\nen &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see &quot;t=\r\nha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that you are not =\r\nconfusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are se=\r\nveral other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pronu=\r\nnciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the nex=\r\nt few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please giv=\r\ne me your consideration and take my input into consideration in altering yo=\r\nur pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in =\r\nwhat I am saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can underst=\r\nand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation.
