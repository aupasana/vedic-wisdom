Ailments, sickness, dis=\r\nease or terrible physical\nhandicaps148This often is the result of some terr=\r\nible karma of past\nlife. In such conditions a great guru askshis disciple n=\r\not to be\ndisappointed but continue doing sadhana inspite of this handicap. =\r\nI\nhavegiven instances in the book how some good sadhaks have done it.2.\nUnh=\r\nappinessIn the case of Indians it is caused by all their worries with\ntheir=\r\n families while this is not the casein the USA where family ties do\nnot exi=\r\nst except in some sections of orthodox Christians. In theUSA the\nproblem is=\r\n very complex. It starts with the story of a broken home,\npremarital sex,un=\r\nhappy relationships and finally the damage done by\npsychiatrists whose roar=\r\ning businessthrives in &#39;discovering&#39; complexes\nin their patients and keepin=\r\ng them rooted in childhoodabuses.3. Physical\nUnsteadiness (resembling Parki=\r\nnson&#39;s disease)The result of consumption\nof intoxicants and wild habits lik=\r\ne drug addiction leads to thissometime\nor the other.4. Difficulties in Inha=\r\nlationIt can be caused by asthma or\nsome other ailments. It definitely dest=\r\nroys the rhythm of japamand\npranayam.5. Difficulties in Exhalation Same as =\r\nnumber 4 above.\nPsychological/Mental Obstacles6. Frustration Caused by Non =\r\nFulfilment of\nDesiresIn the case of most disciples, whether Indians or pers=\r\nons of any\ncountry, one&#39;s own frustrationsregarding wishes, desires related=\r\n to\ntheir wordly, physical, sexual, material, career or family lifeis alway=\r\ns\nthe most common obstacle. It is not easy to be non attached which I know\n=\r\nis God&#39;sgreatest gift to a spiritual aspirant, yet it has to be\ncultivated =\r\nintelligently. All the knocks of lifeteach this valuable\nlesson which we fo=\r\nrget.7. Doubts It can be called the most common\nobstacle of educated Indian=\r\ns and most of theAmericans I have met. In the\nUSA they switch gurus as soon=\r\n as they do not find an instant pillfor\nillumination. These days when there=\r\n is so much character assassination\nof some of thesegurus in the USA, wheth=\r\ner Indian or American, through\nmischievous publicity, a disciple&#39;s doubtin =\r\nhis own guru can assail him\nconstantly. It is not necessary to treat it as =\r\nan obstacle. Even ifthe\nguru is a very ordinary person, that a sincere disc=\r\niple has to be\nrewarded by God is wellknown to us in India. Losing faith in=\r\n one&#39;s own\nguru, expecting quick supernormal powers(siddhis), or even illum=\r\nination,\nthe disciple cannot progress.8. Material/Sensual/Sexual\nObsessions=\r\nIndians are familiar with the stories of their great rishis,\nVishwamitra, D=\r\nurvasa and Naradafalling into temptations, suffering their\nagonies but doin=\r\ng their sadhana with greater intensity andzeal. There\ncan be no sadhak who =\r\ndoes not fall into such temptations. The wiser\nforget them,overcome those t=\r\nemptations and regain their spiritual\nsplendour. Most of such stories are n=\r\notrecorded. In my talks with\nhundreds of yogis, I learnt from them that the=\r\nse temptations have\nto149come, a sadhak, must fall into them. The wiser sad=\r\nhak does not\ndespair. He decides not to fallinto those traps again and is e=\r\nver\ncautious. In the USA somehow it has not been possible toconvince people=\r\n\nthat these could not be combined with spiritual demands of life. It\nwould =\r\nbe farbetter to be an honestly married man doing sadhana rather\nthan imagin=\r\ning fancifully that onecould have many relationships and also\na good spirit=\r\nual life.Spiritual Obstacles9. Illusory Spiritual\nExperiencesLike the wish =\r\nfulfilment Freud talked of, every sadhak has\nmany spiritual experiences. Th=\r\ney canbe very damaging when the sadhak\nmistakes them for real spiritual pro=\r\ngress. I have written inthe book\nthat my own Guruji&#39;s instruction was to te=\r\nst these experiences again and\nagain beforeaccepting them as genuine ones. =\r\nI know of thousands of such\nexperiences of hundreds ofsadhaks and sadhikas =\r\nwhich did damage to them\nbecause it inflated their ego.10. Not Making Expec=\r\nted Spiritual\nProgressIt is very natural for a sadhak to feel that he has n=\r\not made\nadequate or expected spiritualprogress. It creates deepest frustrat=\r\nion.\nI know of sadhaks who gave up their sadhana and tookto violent, vulgar=\r\n\nor grossly materialistic life after such frustrations. To know spiritual\np=\r\nrogress isbeing made and when not, is most confusing. It is well\nexplained =\r\nin the fifteenth chapter of theGita which should be read\nrepeatedly.11. Not=\r\n Remaining Steady in Spiritual ProgressSome sadhaks\nattain early success in=\r\n spiritual life but fail to remain steady. They\nlose patienceand even give =\r\nup their sadhana. This is the worst mistake\none can commit. After attaining=\r\n somereal tangible progress, there should\nbe no need to feel frustrated at =\r\nall or panic.12. Neglecting SadhanaThis\nneed not be elaborated. The meaning=\r\n is crystal clear.13. CarelessnessIt\nis the most common fault. Every good g=\r\nuru instructs his disciple in some\ndo&#39;s and somedon&#39;ts. They should always =\r\nbe remembered.14. LazinessIt\nneed not be explained. It is a common fault. I=\r\n have been a victim of\nthis repeatedly whenduring my office work and later =\r\nload of astrological\nresearch, I made no attempt to squeeze outsome time fo=\r\nr my own sadhana.\nWays of Overcoming Frustration in Spiritual Life\nThe reme=\r\ndies which work most miraculously in overcoming frustrations in\nspiritual l=\r\nife are four:1501. Company of Happy PersonsA person who has\nleast attachmen=\r\nts, desires and frustrations in life is a happy man. He\nhastranscended dual=\r\nities of life, if not totally, sufficiently well, to\nbe happy mostly. In hi=\r\ns companythe astral vibrations of his personality\ncreate a diffuse sense of=\r\n happiness. We have many suchpersons in India\namong good Sadhakas. Remember=\r\n not to become a nuisance for them.2.\nShowing Kindness to Unhappy PersonsIt=\r\n need not be elaborated. The\nunconscious blessings of an unhappy person who=\r\nm you havehelped will\nalways help you overcome your miserable spiritual con=\r\ndition.3. Keeping\nAlive Your Sense of Sacredness for the VirtuousDo not bec=\r\nome judgmental.\nA virtuous man may stray from the path of virtue in a bad m=\r\noment.But he\nwill come back to his sacred state very easily. If you lose yo=\r\nur own\nfaith in thesacredness of his life, it does damage to you spirituall=\r\ny.4.\nIndifference to the Non-VirtuousIn the world we live in, a majority ar=\r\ne\nnon-virtuous. Remain indifferent to them. Do not hatethem. Hatred is a\nba=\r\nd and very damaging emotion, spiritually.\nIII Additions\nTo all the above, l=\r\net me add, what great yogis have told their\ndisciples.1. Do Not Invite a Yo=\r\ngi to Your House FrequentlyA yogi leads a\nlife which is a total reversal of=\r\n the life you lead. If you begin to\ninvite him to yourhouse, you give him a=\r\n chance to go astray and get\nattracted to sex and money. Then youyourself b=\r\negin to lose faith in him.\nIf he comes once in a while, uninvited serve him=\r\n properly butdo not\nallow him to stay long in your house, for your own sake=\r\n.(Instruction of\nthe great Yogi, Devraha Baba)2. Do Not Read Too Many Booh =\r\non Supposedly\nSpiritual SubjectsIt is better to do your own sadhana as you =\r\nhave been\ninstructed. Reading too many books cancause more confusion. Write=\r\nrs of\nbooks on spiritual subjects may themselves be very confusedpersons bu=\r\nt\nwith a gift for writing. Reading those books can create avoidable\nconflic=\r\nts in yourmind.(Instruction of the great Vaishnava Guru, Prabhu\nBejoy Krish=\r\nna Goswami)3. Keep Alive a Sense of Sacredness when it comes\nto Money and S=\r\nex151A person obsessed with sex and money slips fastest\nfrom spiritual path=\r\n. I have met more cheatswho pretended to be\nspiritual, tried to promote spi=\r\nritual, religious, ayurvedic and\nastrologicalseminars, cheated others and a=\r\nccumulated money or promoted\nthemselves.Extend these tendencies to all the =\r\nactivities of your life.\nWithout this precaution your spiritual lifewill de=\r\nteriorate very\nfast.(Ramakrishna Paramhamsa)4. Take Bath at Least Twice a D=\r\nayA clean\nbody and a clean mind are necessary for sadhana. In my childhood =\r\nI\nremembermeeting white men coming to India with their stinking bodies and\n=\r\nthick yellowish layers on theirteeth resembling paint. The reason why\nIndia=\r\nns were forbidden to go abroad became clear tome then. But it seems\nthat th=\r\ne westerners have discovered the virtues of daily bath in the\nrecenttwo or =\r\nthree decades and from an Indian point of view, some\nglimmerings of civiliz=\r\nations haveappeared in the west which we have\nalways associated with plunde=\r\nring imperialisms.(All yogis advise)5.\nAvoid Carnivorous VegetarianismThe f=\r\nood you consume should be pure and\nvegetarian. It should be known to you th=\r\nat asstressed in the Gita and\nthe Chandogya Upanishad, the strongest spirit=\r\nual base of any sadhanais\npure food. For better spiritual life, do not cons=\r\nume even the milk of\ncows fed on nonvegetarian fodder. The mad cow disease =\r\nof England must be\ntaken as a warning. It is difficult toget pure and unadu=\r\nlterated food in\nIndia. But India&#39;s adulterated stuff is better than thecar=\r\nnivorous\nvegetarianism of Europe and the USA. The dangerously adulterated f=\r\nood of\nIndiacan ruin health. Our incompetent governments can take no action=\r\n\nagainst this inspite of theAnti-Adulteration Laws.(All yogis advise)6.\nTri=\r\nple Fires of LifeVishnu Purana states in clearest terms that it is\nafter se=\r\neing, suffering and realizing that no mancan escape the triple\nfires of lif=\r\ne, that one develops detachment and divine knowledge.\nTheyare: the physical=\r\n ones likes sickness and psychological problems:the\nnatural ones like victi=\r\nmization by fellow human beings and fear from\nanimal (accidents etc.in mode=\r\nrn life): the spiritual ones as given in\nthe Patanjali Yoga Sutras.(Vishnu =\r\nPurana)7. Signs of Spiritual\nProgressThe Gita gives some clear indications =\r\nwhich can be used to see\nhow much spiritual progressanyone has made:1. To f=\r\neel that you are not a\nsignificant person.2. To not be haughty.3. Forgivene=\r\nss.4.\nNon-violence.5. Simple and honest speech.6. Serving the Guru.7. Inner=\r\n\nand outer cleanliness.8. Inner stability.9. Self control.10. To be\nnon-att=\r\nached to life&#39;s enjoyments.11. Lack of pride.12. To think about\nthe world f=\r\null of grief.13. Doing the duties of a householder without\nany sense of att=\r\nachment.14. Equanimity.15. Unconditional devotion to the\nLord.16. Love of s=\r\nequestered life.17. Not to be attached to persons\nimmersed in worldliness.1=\r\n8. Loving always the knowledge of the\ndivine.19. Experience of cosmic secre=\r\nts.(The Gita)\n\r\n--7-1422486835-0504675412=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Obstacles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The obstacles to spiritual life given in th=\r\ne Patanjali Yoga Sutras are being given here briefly:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical Obstacles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Ailments, sickness, disease o=\r\nr terrible physical handicaps&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;148&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This often is the=\r\n result of some terrible karma of past life. In such conditions a great gur=\r\nu asks&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;his disciple not to be disappointed but continue doing sad=\r\nhana inspite of this handicap. I have&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;given instances in the book=\r\n how some good sadhaks have done it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Unhappiness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;In the case of Indians it is caused by all their worries with their fam=\r\nilies while this is not the case&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;in the USA where family ties do =\r\nnot exist except in some sections of orthodox Christians.

It starts with the story of a broken home,=\r\n premarital sex,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;unhappy relationships and finally the damage don=\r\ne by psychiatrists whose roaring business&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;thrives in &#39;discovering=\r\n&#39; complexes in their patients and keeping them rooted in childhood&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;abuses.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Physical Unsteadiness (resembling Parkinson&#39;s dis=\r\nease)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The result of consumption of intoxicants and wild habit=\r\ns like drug addiction leads to this&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sometime or the other.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Difficulties in Inhalation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It can be caused by asth=\r\nma or some other ailments. It definitely destroys the rhythm of japam&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;and pranayam.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. &lt;b&gt;Difficulties in Exhalation Same as numbe=\r\nr 4 above.&lt;/b&gt; Psychological/Mental Obstacles&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6. &lt;b&gt;Frustration C=\r\naused by Non Fulfilment of Desires&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the case of most discip=\r\nles, whether Indians or persons of any country, one&#39;s own frustrations&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;regarding wishes, desires related to their wordly, physical, sexual, =\r\nmaterial, career or family life&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;is always the most common obstacl=\r\ne. It is not easy to be non attached which I know is God&#39;s&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;greate=\r\nst gift to a spiritual aspirant, yet it has to be cultivated intelligently.=\r\n All the knocks of life&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;teach this valuable lesson which we forge=\r\nt.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. &lt;b&gt;Doubts&lt;/b&gt; It can be called the most common obstacle of =\r\neducated Indians and most of the&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Americans I have met. In the USA=\r\n they switch gurus as soon as they do not find an instant pill&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;fo=\r\nr illumination. These days when there is so much character assassination of=\r\n some of these&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;gurus in the USA, whether Indian or American, thro=\r\nugh mischievous publicity, a disciple&#39;s doubt&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;in his own guru can=\r\n assail him constantly. It is not necessary to treat it as an obstacle. Eve=\r\nn if&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;the guru is a very ordinary person, that a sincere disciple =\r\nhas to be rewarded by God is well&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;known to us in India. Losing fa=\r\nith in one&#39;s own guru, expecting quick supernormal powers&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(siddhi=\r\ns), or even illumination, the disciple cannot progress.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;8. &lt;b&gt;Mat=\r\nerial/Sensual/Sexual Obsessions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Indians are familiar with the=\r\n stories of their great rishis, Vishwamitra, Durvasa and Narada&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;f=\r\nalling into temptations, suffering their agonies but doing their sadhana wi=\r\nth greater intensity and&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;zeal. There can be no sadhak who does no=\r\nt fall into such temptations. The wiser forget them,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;overcome tho=\r\nse temptations and regain their spiritual splendour. Most of such stories a=\r\nre not&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;recorded. In my talks with hundreds of yogis, I learnt fro=\r\nm them that these temptations have to&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;149&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;come, a sadha=\r\nk, must fall into them. The wiser sadhak does not despair. He decides not t=\r\no fall&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;into those traps again and is ever cautious. In the USA so=\r\nmehow it has not been possible to&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;convince people that these coul=\r\nd not be combined with spiritual demands of life. It would be far&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;better to be an honestly married man doing sadhana rather than imagining f=\r\nancifully that one&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;could have many relationships and also a good =\r\nspiritual life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spiritual Obstacles&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9. &lt;b&gt;Illusory Spir=\r\nitual Experiences&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like the wish fulfilment Freud talked of, e=\r\nvery sadhak has many spiritual experiences. They can&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;be very dama=\r\nging when the sadhak mistakes them for real spiritual progress. I have writ=\r\nten in&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;the book that my own Guruji&#39;s instruction was to test thes=\r\ne experiences again and again before&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;accepting them as genuine on=\r\nes. I know of thousands of such experiences of hundreds of&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sadhak=\r\ns and sadhikas which did damage to them because it inflated their ego.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;10. &lt;b&gt;Not Making Expected Spiritual Progress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is ver=\r\ny natural for a sadhak to feel that he has not made adequate or expected sp=\r\niritual&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;progress. It creates deepest frustration. I know of sadha=\r\nks who gave up their sadhana and took&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;to violent, vulgar or gross=\r\nly materialistic life after such frustrations. To know spiritual progress i=\r\ns&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;being made and when not, is most confusing. It is well explaine=\r\nd in the fifteenth chapter of the&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gita which should be read repea=\r\ntedly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;11. &lt;b&gt;Not Remaining Steady in Spiritual Progress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some sadhaks attain early success in spiritual life but fail to remai=\r\nn steady. They lose patience&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;and even give up their sadhana. This=\r\n is the worst mistake one can commit. After attaining some&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;real t=\r\nangible progress, there should be no need to feel frustrated at all or pani=\r\nc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12. &lt;b&gt;Neglecting Sadhana&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This need not be elabo=\r\nrated. The meaning is crystal clear.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;13. &lt;b&gt;Carelessness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is the most common fault. Every good guru instructs his disciple i=\r\nn some do&#39;s and some&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;don&#39;ts. They should always be remembered.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;14.&lt;b&gt; Laziness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It need not be explained. It is a com=\r\nmon fault. I have been a victim of this repeatedly when&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;during my=\r\n office work and later load of astrological research, I made no attempt to =\r\nsqueeze out&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;some time for my own sadhana.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ways of Overcoming Frustration in Spiritual Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The remedies which work most miraculously in overcoming frus=\r\ntrations in spiritual life are four:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;150&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Company =\r\nof Happy Persons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A person who has least attachments, desires =\r\nand frustrations in life is a happy man. He has&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;transcended duali=\r\nties of life, if not totally, sufficiently well, to be happy mostly. In his=\r\n company&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;the astral vibrations of his personality create a diffus=\r\ne sense of happiness. We have many such&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;persons in India among go=\r\nod Sadhakas. Remember not to become a nuisance for them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Sh=\r\nowing Kindness to Unhappy Persons&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It need not be elaborated. =\r\nThe unconscious blessings of an unhappy person whom you have&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;help=\r\ned will always help you overcome your miserable spiritual condition.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Keeping Alive Your Sense of Sacredness for the Virtuous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Do not become judgmental. A virtuous man may stray from the path of vi=\r\nrtue in a bad moment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But he will come back to his sacred state v=\r\nery easily. If you lose your own faith in the&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sacredness of his l=\r\nife, it does damage to you spiritually.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Indifference to the=\r\n Non-Virtuous&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the world we live in, a majority are non-vir=\r\ntuous. Remain indifferent to them. Do not hate&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;them. Hatred is a =\r\nbad and very damaging emotion, spiritually.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;III=\r\n Additions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To all the above, let me add=\r\n, what great yogis have told their disciples.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Do Not Invite=\r\n a Yogi to Your House Frequently&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A yogi leads a life which is=\r\n a total reversal of the life you lead. If you begin to invite him to your&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;house, you give him a chance to go astray and get attracted to se=\r\nx and money. Then you&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;yourself begin to lose faith in him. If he =\r\ncomes once in a while, uninvited serve him properly but&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;do not al=\r\nlow him to stay long in your house, for your own sake.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Instructi=\r\non of the great Yogi, Devraha Baba)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Do Not Read Too Many Bo=\r\noh on Supposedly Spiritual Subjects&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is better to do your o=\r\nwn sadhana as you have been instructed. Reading too many books can&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;cause more confusion. Writers of books on spiritual subjects may themselv=\r\nes be very confused&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;persons but with a gift for writing. Reading =\r\nthose books can create avoidable conflicts in your&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;mind.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;(Instruction of the great Vaishnava Guru, Prabhu Bejoy Krishna Goswami)&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Keep Alive a Sense of Sacredness when it comes to Money and =\r\nSex&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;151&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A person obsessed with sex and money slips =\r\nfastest from spiritual path. I have met more cheats&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;who pretended=\r\n to be spiritual, tried to promote spiritual, religious, ayurvedic and astr=\r\nological&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;seminars, cheated others and accumulated money or promot=\r\ned themselves.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Extend these tendencies to all the activities of y=\r\nour life. Without this precaution your spiritual life&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;will deteri=\r\norate very fast.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Ramakrishna Paramhamsa)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. &lt;b&gt;Take Ba=\r\nth at Least Twice a Day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A clean body and a clean mind are nec=\r\nessary for sadhana. In my childhood I remember&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;meeting white men =\r\ncoming to India with their stinking bodies and thick yellowish layers on th=\r\neir&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;teeth resembling paint. The reason why Indians were forbidden=\r\n to go abroad became clear to&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;me then. But it seems that the west=\r\nerners have discovered the virtues of daily bath in the recent&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;tw=\r\no or three decades and from an Indian point of view, some glimmerings of ci=\r\nvilizations have&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;appeared in the west which we have always associ=\r\nated with plundering imperialisms.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(All yogis advise)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5=\r\n. &lt;b&gt;Avoid Carnivorous Vegetarianism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The food you consume sho=\r\nuld be pure and vegetarian. It should be known to you that as&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;str=\r\nessed in the Gita and the Chandogya Upanishad, the strongest spiritual base=\r\n of any sadhana&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;is pure food. For better spiritual life, do not c=\r\nonsume even the milk of cows fed on non&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;vegetarian fodder. The ma=\r\nd cow disease of England must be taken as a warning. It is difficult to&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;get pure and unadulterated food in India. But India&#39;s adulterated st=\r\nuff is better than the&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;carnivorous vegetarianism of Europe and th=\r\ne USA. The dangerously adulterated food of India&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;can ruin health.=\r\n Our incompetent governments can take no action against this inspite of the=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anti-Adulteration Laws.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(All yogis advise)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;6=\r\n. &lt;b&gt;Triple Fires of Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vishnu Purana states in clearest te=\r\nrms that it is after seeing, suffering and realizing that no man&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\ncan escape the triple fires of life, that one develops detachment and divin=\r\ne knowledge. They&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;are: the physical ones likes sickness and psych=\r\nological problems:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;the natural ones like victimization by fellow =\r\nhuman beings and fear from animal (accidents etc.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;in modern life)=\r\n: the spiritual ones as given in the Patanjali Yoga Sutras.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Vish=\r\nnu Purana)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. &lt;b&gt;Signs of Spiritual Progress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Gi=\r\nta gives some clear indications which can be used to see how much spiritual=\r\n progress&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;anyone has made:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1. To feel that you are not =\r\na significant person.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2. To not be haughty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;3. Forgiven=\r\ness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;4. Non-violence.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;5. Simple and honest speech.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;6. Serving the Guru.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;7. Inner and outer cleanliness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;8. Inner stability.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9. Self control.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;10. To be non-=\r\nattached to life&#39;s enjoyments.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;11. Lack of pride.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;12. T=\r\no think about the world full of grief.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;13. Doing the duties of a =\r\nhouseholder without any sense of attachment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;14. Equanimity.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;15. Unconditional devotion to the Lord.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;16. Love of sequest=\r\nered life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;17. Not to be attached to persons immersed in worldlin=\r\ness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;18. Loving always the knowledge of the divine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;19.=\r\n Experience of cosmic secrets.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(The Gita)&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--7-1422486835-0504675412=:4--\r\n\n"}}
