R=\r\nao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; There is need at all to address me =\r\nas Ji or Sir.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Personally, I do not like to do Japa with a Mala, as I=\r\n feel this\n&gt; &gt; makes the whole process very mechanical and preoccupies my m=\r\nind \nwith\n&gt; &gt; issues such as not crossing the Meru, handling the Mala prope=\r\nrly\n&gt; &gt; etc..I find my mind dwelling on these issues rather than the \nmantr=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; itself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mind anyway preoccupies itself with many things! :-) By =\r\ngiving it \nan anchor \n&gt; to focus on (like handling of the maalaa), you are =\r\nactually \nstabilizing it \n&gt; somewhat. If this specific pre-occupation minim=\r\nized many other (and \nworse) \n&gt; pre-occupations, it is not a bad thing at a=\r\nll.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is like a monkey that keeps jumping from one place to another \n=\r\nplace being \n&gt; tied to a pole with a chain to limit its jumping. The monkey=\r\n may \nstill be \n&gt; jumping up and down, but the chain atleast *limits* its m=\r\novement \naround one \n&gt; pole.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if the monkey learns to stay i=\r\nn one place without \njumping, it \n&gt; needs no chain or pole anymore. Chain w=\r\nas there in the first place \nto limit \n&gt; its jumping.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each person is t=\r\nhe best judge of where one is and what is \nappropriate for \n&gt; oneself. We m=\r\nake progress by recognizing our weaknesses and \naddressing them.\n&gt; \n&gt; In ad=\r\ndition, there are certain chakras in the tips of fingers that \nare \n&gt; direc=\r\ntly connected to the brain. Objects like rudraksha and tulasi \nbeads can \n&gt;=\r\n stimulate those minor energy centers. Thus, there is *some* use in \nthe \n&gt;=\r\n beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Does Japa have to be done with a Mala?\n&gt; \n&gt; Upto you.=\r\n For most people, I recommend using a maalaa.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. What are the ramifi=\r\ncations of crossing the Meru bead?\n&gt; \n&gt; What use is it to know? Avoid it as=\r\n much as you can. If you cross \nit, so be \n&gt; it. Don&#39;t worry and move on. B=\r\nut, avoid crossing it again.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know some scriptures say Japa done wi=\r\nth Mala (in my case Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; mantra done with Tulsi Mala) is more effecti=\r\nve then japa done \nwithout\n&gt; &gt; Mala.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. Is this meant to be taken s=\r\neriously?\n&gt; \n&gt; It is also given in a scripture that Rudraksha and Tulasi ma=\r\nalaas \ncan be \n&gt; used for chanting any mantra and they are many more times =\r\npowerful \nthan \n&gt; other maalaas. My suggestion is to pick up either a Rudra=\r\nksha \nmaalaa or a \n&gt; Tulasi maalaa based on your taste and use it for *all*=\r\n mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to categorically state that using a Tulasi maalaa for=\r\n Shiva \nor a \n&gt; Rudraksha maalaa for Vishnu will NOT do you any harm.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 3. What should one concentrate when reciting Japa for purpose of\n&gt; &gt; reme=\r\ndial measures? The mantra, the devata, one&#39;s goals?\n&gt; \n&gt; Anything that work=\r\ns as an anchor to limit the mind from straying \naway too \n&gt; much is useful.=\r\n An image or visualization of deity may work for \nsome. \n&gt; Focussing on eac=\r\nh sound and ups and downs in intonation may work \nfor some. \n&gt; The goal is =\r\nto minimize other thoughts. Thinking of one&#39;s goals \nwill usually \n&gt; make t=\r\nhe mind stray away into unnecessary pre-occupations. It is \nbetter to \n&gt; fo=\r\ncus on deity or mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comc=\r\nast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 11:59 AM\n&gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is my first po=\r\nst.
