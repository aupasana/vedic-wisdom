What a grave mis=\r\ntake!\nMahaprabhuji used to say that practice was necessary no matter what\ns=\r\ntage one had reached.\n\n&quot;Water should always flow,&quot; he said. &quot;If it stands s=\r\ntill it stagnates\nand begins to stink.&quot;\n\nThe well from which water is drawn=\r\n is always replenished with that pure,\nfresh water of the spring. But still=\r\n water becomes foul and undrinkable.\nContinuity is a natural law of life, s=\r\ntagnation is death. What we\ncommonly call a &quot;standstill&quot; is actually a step=\r\n taken back, by no means\ndoes it mean stability. If we wish to avoid stagna=\r\nting, or going\nbackward in development, we need to keep practising whatever=\r\n\npsychophysical, mental or spiritual discipline we believe in.\n\nWe should f=\r\naithfully continue our sadhana day by day throughout  our\nentire life, whet=\r\nher we are disciples or Masters. Dear readers,\nMahaprabhuji also continued =\r\nto practise certain yoga techniques.
