Recently I met someone who suffers from serious cronic de=\r\npression and bipolar disorder (shifting between extreme states of exhilarat=\r\nion and severe depression). The person wanted me to check her chart, but I =\r\ntrust Ganapati far more than my astrological readings. I advised the person=\r\n to start off worshipping Ganapati in fire irrespective of astrology.\n\nNow =\r\nrecently while reading a book on herbs I found a reference that Jaatamaasi =\r\ncan be used to cure mental/psychological disorders. Can doing a homa using =\r\njust jataamaasi and black til help a person get out of severe depression?\n\n=\r\nAll thoughts/advices are welcome!\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi \n\n\n"}}
