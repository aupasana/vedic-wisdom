B=\r\nut still he\n&gt; sits on ground saying that &quot;mandir is closed, but mata is pre=\r\nsent in\n&gt; sorrounding, so no problem..and he sits on ground.&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; There h=\r\ne is approached by a Senoir Pujari--he feels a feeling of\n&gt; GURU-bhakti=EF=\r\n=BF=BD for the pujari.\n&gt; He wanted to talk/discuss to GURU ji=EF=BF=BD Re:d=\r\niksha matter..\n&gt; But The Guru ji did not gave chance to speak and asked him=\r\n to Come Close.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Dream he feel that this GURU ji already knows Every=\r\nthing about his\n&gt; Curiosity and his Icchha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guru asks him about Import=\r\nance of Cow Dung...Gobar. he replies\n&gt; satisfactory about importance of gob=\r\nar from vedic point of view\n&gt; etc.etc. here....some discussions.....\n&gt; \n&gt; t=\r\nhen Guru ji asks him to put Gobar on his own head (friend).\n&gt; he does. he t=\r\nakes around a Kilo and Covers Whole Head.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then GURU ji Keeps Talking a=\r\nbout other puja matter...while Doing some\n&gt; Formalities.\n&gt; Guru ji=EF=BF=BD=\r\n also says that in Garbh-Grih only He with his=EF=BF=BD Some selected\n&gt; dik=\r\nhit -Sishya do puja..other people not allowed.\n&gt; My friend says that, &quot;He K=\r\nnows He has heard/read about this&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Friend in dreams Strongly Feels=\r\n That he is getting Diksha. (Guru ji\n&gt; is Giving Diksha).\n&gt; (as guru ji doi=\r\nng some mantra jaap....touching his head several times)\n&gt; \n&gt; After this Gur=\r\nu ji Instructs his one disciple to bring the Mata\n&gt; Bagalamukhi Idol from G=\r\narbh-Grih and let the Friend do Darshan. which\n&gt; he did..\n&gt; \n&gt; After that g=\r\nuru ji tells him,=EF=BF=BD &quot;have you decided your Diksha Name&quot;\n&gt; My friend =\r\ntells No, &quot;but i will be happy whatever name you decide for me&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Guru =\r\ntell him,&quot;from today your name will be Dityanand&quot;.\n&gt; my friend touches the =\r\nGuru Ji feet.
