Let me give the crux of \nthe philosophy.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place to another very rapidly \nand gives varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadness etc. When the \nmind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can experience the bliss of \nfinding the true Self. The goal of all spiritual sadhana - japam, homam, \ndhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - is to enable the mind to become \ncalm.\n\nAt first, one cannot make the mind stable and calm. All one can do it to tie \nthe monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still moves around, \nbut its motion is restricted. Once it goes far, the thread tying it to the \npole stops it from going further away. Similarly, when one tries to focus on \na mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one constantly brings it \nback to the mantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the mantra.\n\nThus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries to become \ncalm and stable.\n\nAfter trying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop jumping around \nand fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop thinking of so \nmany things and become absolutely calm and stable while repeating a mantra. \nWhen all the thoughts cease and some level of silence comes to the mind, one \nexperiences some level of bliss.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by the mind to aid \nmind to stop wandering from one thing to another thing. The goal is to give \nan anchor for the mind to focus on, instead of jumping everywhere.\n\nVarious sound combinations can be used for this purpose. For example, one \ncan even repeat &quot;I want to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every combination of \nsounds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating it enough. Sound \npatterns making sense in various languages were used by some saints and \nmessiahs from time to time in the past to obtain bliss and those sound \npatterns are revered as being sacred in various religions.\n\nCompared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are easier to \nfocus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24 letters/syllables, a \npart of the mind is responsible for changing from one letter to another and \nthere is more mind activity even in a state of high mental focus on the \nmantra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly, the task is simpler for \nthe mind and it is easier for the mind to shut down various tasks of the \nmind and become close to being still and silent.\n\nVarious syllables can be used for this purpose. These syllables are called \nbeeja aksharas.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBeeja means a seed. Beeja  akshara means a seed syllable.\n\nWhen mind has absolutely no activity and becomes completely still (i.e. \nceases to exist!), one realizes the true Self (Aatman or Brahman). When mind \nhas very little activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still exists, but in \na very high state of focus and calmness), one realizes different pure \nmanifestations of cosmic being.\n\nWhen one meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the above state of high \nmental focus and calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thoughts other than the \nrepetition of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a seed corresponding to a \ndeity. The energy of that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness when one&#39;s mind is \nfilled with that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. In other words, \neach deity is a personifications of the state of a mind that is focused on \nthe sound of a specific beeja with no other thoughts in it.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOf course, if one&#39;s mind has many thoughts while repeating a beeja akshara \n(or any mantra in general), one may experience a lot of emotions and things. \nBut, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still and calm with no thought in it \n(other than what is needed for repeating that sound), we can say that one&#39;s \nindividual ego has been replaced with that of a deity and the deity has \nfilled one&#39;s mind.\n\nThus, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one experience the \nenergy of a deity.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhich syllables make one experience which energy was well-understood and \ncatalogued by ancient Hindu sages nicely.\n\nMany mantras other than beeja aksharas were also experiemented by rishis, \nwho understood the nature of energy experienced by one&#39;s mind when one&#39;s \nmind is completely filled with the sound of the mantra and all other \nthoughts leave the mind.\n\nSo we need not experiment newly. We can use the knowledge discovered by \nrishis and go further.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Dear all,\n&gt; This is my first time posting on the vedic-wisdom group. Hope the\n&gt; topic is not inappropriate.\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering if someone could tell me or point me to articles\n&gt; which explain to some depth what a Bijakshara is, what are the\n&gt; Bijaksharas and why they are said to be powerful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Specifically, I also want to know - why do only some\n&gt; sounds/syllables qualify as Bijaksharas? Also, what exactly is the\n&gt; difference between a mantra and bijaksharas? Are all bijaksharas\n&gt; automatically mantras? Do mantras consist only of bijaksharas? What\n&gt; effects do bijaksharas have that mantras dont have and vice versa?\n&gt;\n&gt; As you can see, I want a detailed explanation.. Any and all details\n&gt; will be highly appreciated..\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sundeep\n\n\n"}}
