I am of the opinion that if the prie=\r\nst does not posses at least a little spiritual power, He can not invoke dei=\r\nty&#39;s presence however expert and perfectionist he is in performing a ritual=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, i agree with you that &quot;Results&quot; are given because Deity is =\r\npleased by the ritual and offerings BUT can a divine deity will even be pre=\r\nsent if invoked by a person who is not capable?. Pleasing of deity is even =\r\nfar away.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is well known that Brahamana&#39;s of yore were following=\r\n very stringent, disciplined, Unselfish and God-oriented life. They everyda=\r\ny used to devote good amount of time in their personal sadhanas. (I am talk=\r\ning about Majority of them. every Yuga has every yuga present as you correc=\r\ntly said). I think, because of that highly evolved life style and off cours=\r\ne equipped with expertise of performing various rituals, they were fit to b=\r\necome mediators between Yajamana and Devata. A real brahmana would therefor=\r\ne capable of invoking Devine preence to the best of his ability and get the=\r\n results for the Yajamana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So here i am sure you&#39;ll see point of &quot;=\r\ncaliber&quot; factor for person performing the ritual for &quot;Materialistic Desires=\r\n&quot; of 3rd party (i.e. Yajamana).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) You have mis-understood &quot;Baggin=\r\ng bawl&quot; &quot;Beggars&quot; etc...

It=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=99s really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; painful to read s=\r\nuch thing from a person of his status whom lot of people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; considered a=\r\ns a good astro-spiritual personality. Though I am not having\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scriptur=\r\ne references i=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=99ll try to post my humble protest and reques=\r\nt to all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; members to understand and study shastra deeply for better un=\r\nderstanding. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though believers call priests and get poojas don=\r\ne, in the hope that their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problems will be solved, many priests today=\r\n are incapable of producing any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; results. As a result, some believers =\r\ngot accustomed to accepting that a pudding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exists even without eating=\r\n it and remain hungry throughout life. And some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; intelligent people st=\r\nopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address\n&gt; &gt; &gt; why this=\r\n has come to be and then talk about what we should do. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Result=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata =\r\nor deity and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings are called =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=95=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=\r\n=83=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AA=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; krupA] Here we think result=\r\ns are produced; so let us understand the method. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody wants go=\r\nod match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perform re=\r\nmedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; foca=\r\nl point is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=C3=\r\n=A2=C2=80=C2=99s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=\r\n=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=99s desire and in return get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paid. So in this whole e=\r\nxercise priest is a mere mediator or a technician who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can interact wi=\r\nth both parties. And interaction means correct rituals with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appropria=\r\nte mantras. So his spiritual or mental strength is not required but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nis skill and knowledge is of prime importance. Can we consider a mortal pri=\r\nest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to bless a yajamana? And if a priest can bless yajamana what is t=\r\nhe role of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rituals, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are bestowed upo=\r\nn the human beings by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devatas as only divinity is capable of this. An=\r\nd many times fruits are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; received due to karmic blockages of yajam=\r\nana. =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=95=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B2=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BF=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=AF=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=81=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=97=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=87\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A0=C2=\r\n=A4=C2=9A=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=81=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=\r\n=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=97=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=81=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A3=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=82 =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AA=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=\r\n=8B=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=95=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=82=\r\n [ in kaliyuga four\n&gt; &gt; &gt; times efforts are needed] and this is due to loss=\r\n of anushtAna falA for doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this=\r\n is not an easy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; task on the part of astrologer to fix the amount of p=\r\nrArabdha karma of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yajamana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one has one million dolla=\r\nrs in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for thousand dollars i=\r\ns meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is a thousand=\r\n dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one any benefits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yajamana get=\r\n fruits of the rituals from the inbuilt bank balance of deities\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and n=\r\not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine energy, called devata can give\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n million dollar check to unlimited no of people as GOD has sanctioned rathe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tradition in vedic rituals=\r\n in any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pooja with or without homa in the beginning there is one ritu=\r\nal called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aAchAryavarana [=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=86=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=9A=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=A4=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AF=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=A4=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A3] means yajamana nominate a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf and in the end be=\r\nfore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; visarjana of pooja [=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B6=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=87=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AF=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8B=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=A4=C2=A6=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A8] shreyodAn ritual is performe=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in which priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to=\r\n yajamana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here we can clearly understand the role of priest and the =\r\nrole of deity. As per\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmic law if you bless some body you lose your=\r\n punya and blessed one get that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; share of punya reducing your strength=\r\n on all levels. Can a mortal though highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; qualified priest blessed m=\r\nany yajamanas as he interacts with many in his lifetime?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This could b=\r\ne possible only for highly evolved soul like saints and yogis as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; due =\r\nto great penance they do have such powers. But even for them also some time=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; loss of spiritual energy leads for further penance. We read lot of s=\r\ntories in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ancient mythology of sages enticed by apsarAs [superhuman b=\r\neautiful lady] or if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they cursed some body results in renewed penance=\r\ns to regain there status.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One import=\r\nant note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or =\r\na sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendenc=\r\ny to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and r=\r\nituals as the focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; points may generate different kinds of energy, bu=\r\nt the key is focus.

We se=\r\ne picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus which originates from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nava=\r\nl of Vishnu indicating creation origin of universe. This is puran based\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are having same concept =\r\nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different terminology. The subtle seat of paravak is at naval an=\r\nd creator\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahma creates this world with the help of saraswati and sa=\r\nrsawati is nothing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but 52 syllable; =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A3=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=\r\n=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B2=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of syllables.=\r\n When two unknown person meets first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time how they get connected? Thr=\r\nough communication and thought is a form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vak, pashyanti. First the=\r\nre is desire to know each other and then communication\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starts. And in=\r\n communication if some body express negativity communication\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stops. S=\r\no for communication soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; assume that mantra or rituals are of no importance? These show qualities=\r\n, tools\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary to get connected with devatas in right perspective.=\r\n In scriptures\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. which de=\r\nnotes the nature of that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; syllable resulting in typical energy. To be =\r\nprecise power rest with desire and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is a mere tool to channalise =\r\nthat power and strength of desire will decide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depth of focused mind. =\r\nSo desire is from yajamana, mind is of priest and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings are from =\r\npleased devata. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parAsharA =\r\nrecommended various rituals of various devatas for removing bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effec=\r\nts of bad dashas or bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nrituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so many homa manuals. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To consider spiritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who =\r\ndo have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharanA like a solid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanav=\r\nashtA need not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; require mantra or tantra, rituals for creating energy.=\r\n A mere wish of them can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do work. Normal people like me; require all =\r\nearlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; patanjali like yama, niyama, aAsa=\r\nna, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all steps are embedded=\r\n in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tantra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nyas, etc. S=\r\no for wish to be get full filled by devata many many things count. =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0This whole confus=\r\nion is due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narsimhaji=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=99s sincere wish to spread sp=\r\nirituality and he is doing this with pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; heart. Yes, focus mind is o=\r\nne of the factors in this whole exercise. Many have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seen shatachandI =\r\nor mahArudra anushathAna where many priest at a time read or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chant ma=\r\nntras with different level of mind focus still yajamana get fruits of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n it in terms of desires. This is because devata is pleased by offerings, ja=\r\npa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and hOme which in turn bless the yajamana with HIS blessings.=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 For spirituality focus, pure heart and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuous efforts a=\r\nre of prime importance but for getting our desires to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fulfilled we=\r\n need correct procedure, appropriate deity and correct mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit=\r\nuality =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=85=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A7=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=\r\n=C2=AF=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=AE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B6=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B8=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=\r\n=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0 is a love relationsh=\r\nip BTW jiva and parmAtmA =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AD=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=95=C3=A0=C2=A5=\r\n=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=80 =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B8=C3=A0=C2=A4=\r\n=C2=BE =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AA=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=A4=\r\n=C2=AA=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=87=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=AE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=81=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AA=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=\r\n; where as =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A6=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=87=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B6=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=A4=\r\n=C2=B8=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=B0 or mantrashAshtra is a give and take relationship =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AF=C3=\r\n=A0=C2=A4=C2=9C=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=9E=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=87=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=A4=C2=A8\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AF=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=9C=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=\r\n=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=9E=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AF=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=9C=C3=\r\n=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4.

The procedures have evolved to become quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; complicated over the =\r\ntime too! However, complexity of rituals should never be a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deterrent.=\r\n Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access=\r\n to such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a bal=\r\nanced meal or will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you manage with whatever you have? If you just hav=\r\ne a bowl of dal (lentil soup)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and rice,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you will simply =\r\neat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not know th=\r\ne &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait\n&gt; &gt; &gt; till you kno=\r\nw the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giv=\r\ne you energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledg=\r\ne&quot; stems from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. =\r\nThat notion is not totally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; baseless, but it is irrelevant today. It i=\r\ns possible to focus the mind on some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras and rituals and get spec=\r\nific results. When used by someone with a high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of spiritual ene=\r\nrgy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific po=\r\nwerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nings in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes vedic, tantrik=\r\n rituals are complex and should be done by experts only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as these are =\r\nfor special purposes and should be done by trained people. There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are =\r\nhundreds of ways for GOD realization and a single way to fulfill our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndesires. If you don=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=99t know how to drive a car why opt for =\r\na fighter plane? =C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0Only if you elders, gurus have san=\r\nctioned it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden anything but =\r\ndue to loss of energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. for rem=\r\noving karmic blocks we feel we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; need more energy and we are not gettin=\r\ng it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thing as perfection is subj=\r\nective matter but we must read study, think, analyze\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before accepting=\r\n any concept. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this is o=\r\nne of the best ways for acceleration according to my experiences in my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; twenties but it is for spirituality and for desires to get full filled th=\r\nrough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities every thing counts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Different mantras and rituals are like beggin=\r\ng bowls of different shapes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; They matter only so much. Depending on w=\r\nhat kind of a begging bowl you use, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may be given different kind o=\r\nf alms. But it is important to start begging with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some begging bowl o=\r\nr the other, instead of spending years looking for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect beggin=\r\ng bowl. Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ill-con=\r\nceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but ans=\r\nhA of GOD. =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=9C=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=80=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=A5=C2=88=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B5 =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AC=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B9=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A8=C3=A0=C2=A4=\r\n=C2=83 . Human being is the best creativity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of HIM, the divine. The s=\r\nole aim of manushyayOnI is to realize HIM. In this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; journey we may fac=\r\ne many types of different obstacles due to our karma and to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surpass t=\r\nhem HE has given us power and rights to use our intellect, mind for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nealthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And whole karma done for this in a pious=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manner is a sattvic karma. Even for getting fulfilled our desires we=\r\n do have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship of respect, love, gratitude with devatas.

The key is f=\r\naith and persistence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your kaarmik blockage is the si=\r\nze of a rock, small amount energy may be enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to move it away.

Remedies are needed to full fi=\r\nll desires, by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; removing karmic blocks we can get this, by doing vario=\r\nus correct procedures we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can achieve this and this happens due to gen=\r\nerated punya in this whole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exercise. For full filling desires we shou=\r\nld know the depth of karma, to remove\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karmic blocks we need appropria=\r\nte devata, to achieve this we must have exact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tools in the form of ma=\r\nntra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last generation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; punya in real ti=\r\nmeframe. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us have a quick look at Narsimhji=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=\r\n=99s post on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remedy for begetting a child. He has suggested main reme=\r\ndy as santangopal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he su=\r\nggested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that? If every mantra from his generic list can do this he sh=\r\nould have suggested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any one. As per the shashtra the analogy should b=\r\ne like this. Here we will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sidetrack depth of karma as this is near im=\r\npossible to understand =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=97=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B9=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=\r\n=A8=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=8B =C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=95=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=\r\n=8D=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=97=C3=A0=C2=A4=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=A5=C2=80=\r\n [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; childless couple a=\r\nged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a baby. =\r\nSnatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity responsible for\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; sustenance of universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the mantra itsel=\r\nf is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the most im=\r\np it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called =\r\ngeneric mantra is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of giving everything to everybody but the m=\r\nain hurdle is timeframe. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we do any sadhana for long time we accumu=\r\nlate punya; energy to have all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pleasures in the world whereas the use=\r\n of this punya depends upon the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual. In this case punya requir=\r\ned to beget a child is missing so we need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that energy in real time fr=\r\name as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lady will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capable of begett=\r\ning a child. Yes, all generic mantra will give child but in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next birt=\r\nh as specific form of punya required to beget a baby will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accumula=\r\nted after doing generic mantra for long time rather whole life time. As\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next birth inclu=\r\nding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; baby and major part of that punya will be consumed for said caus=\r\ne of baby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden ha=\r\nmmer to fix a nail\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it might take one hour to finish job but metal ham=\r\nmer can do this in five\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes. This science, not logic is behind di=\r\nfferent mantra, rituals sanctioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by sages for different purposes as=\r\n karma is never generic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narsihmaji you are doing very no=\r\nble karma in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sattvic manner so thousands will read you, hundreds wi=\r\nll follow you; so for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them and to our scientific spiritual tradition =\r\ni think you should do justice by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rethinking on this topic. I myself r=\r\nead your spiritual post with respect but in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this matter you miss the =\r\ntarget. =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;                Yours sincerely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;                    Sat=\r\nish\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
