I would say that we are very much observing B=\r\nrahmacharya. Now coming to Ojas I doubt that Ojas can be so physical as Sem=\r\nen. If the act of Sex is itself perfomed as an offering to God and without =\r\nany thoughts other than that of God then where is the question of loosing a=\r\nny spiritual energy . In fact you are adding to your spiritual growth. \nI h=\r\nave observed a change in myself after doing this practically over the past =\r\ncouple of months.

Others answered your questions and I will leav=\r\ne them. But I want to say a few words on (3) as the recent discussion on ag=\r\nhora seems to have created some confusion. It is very easy to misunderstand=\r\n when we are communicating verbally, because one&#39;s own mental conditioning =\r\nhas a role in deciding how one interprets words, sentences and their sub-te=\r\nxt. It is more so when we are talking about delicate matters.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; 3. =\r\nWhen the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, is it really needed\n&gt; to perform &quot;Br=\r\namhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam?\n\nBrahmacharya is very important in a=\r\nny spiritual sadhana. Period. As Narayan said, sexual activity results in l=\r\noss of ojas (subtle vitality) and wastes a part of one&#39;s creative essence. =\r\nDoing sadhana without brahmacharya is like filling a water pot that is leak=\r\ning through a hole. Even if you succeed in filling the pot with water, it w=\r\nill soon become empty!\n\nJust as a filled water pot that is leaking may stil=\r\nl satisfy the thirst of someone who takes a glass of water from it, similar=\r\nly a person doing sadhana without brahmacharya may sometimes be able to do =\r\nhis dharma and serve his purpose in the world. So, it is a good idea to do =\r\nsadhana even as one&#39;s brahmacharya is not good yet. But, the best will be i=\r\nf the filled water pot is not leaking and holds all the water. Similarly, a=\r\n sadhaka who is accumulating some shakti through sadhana and does not leak =\r\nthat energy through acts of lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to=\r\n serve dharma better.\n\nIf there are 12 people who maintain physical and men=\r\ntal brahmacharya for a few years while doing homam everyday, I think the wo=\r\nrld can be changed.\n\n* * *\n\nIf an aghora sits naked with partner and chants=\r\n mantra, please remember that the goal isn&#39;t having sex. This practice is b=\r\ny means a glorification of sex. The goal is to *resist*. Even if the mind i=\r\ns overwhelmed in the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the =\r\ngoal is to reach a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy=\r\n as something to be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahm=\r\nacharya can be maintained despite such provocation.\n\nIn fact, the true mean=\r\ning of brahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to re=\r\nfrain from sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be=\r\n able to set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain =\r\nphysical brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain fro=\r\nm mental thoughts.\n\nAn aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those t=\r\nhoughts in his mind (what Manish called as &quot;sampradaaha&quot; ). Mind considers =\r\nsome things as pure and some things as impure. The &quot;impure&quot; objects and cir=\r\ncumstances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other di=\r\nsturbance to the mind and waver it from god. But an aghora puts them right =\r\nin the middle of a &quot;pure&quot; activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to de=\r\nal with them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill o=\r\nr other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer imp=\r\nure! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure =\r\nabout it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind =\r\nand waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, wha=\r\nt is impure about it?\n\nThat is the basic thinking in this practice. Some yo=\r\ngis may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure to opp=\r\nosite sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in front of=\r\n a naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, his m=\r\nind may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to incinera=\r\nte the very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be arou=\r\nsed by, not by staying away from it but by being with it and yet trying to =\r\nfocus the mind on god.\n\nBottomline: An aghora engaging in this practice may=\r\n stray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to attain more p=\r\nerfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to attain brahma=\r\ncharya.\n\nIf one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginning of sadhana, it =\r\nmay be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to somehow or the ot=\r\nher attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting it.\n\n* * *\n\nThe c=\r\noarse meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy.\n\nThe finer meaning of b=\r\nrahmacharya is physical celibacy and refraining from any sexual thoughts ev=\r\nen in the mind.\n\nThe finest meaning of brahmacharya is refraining from lust=\r\n, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy and establishing mind in B=\r\nrahman always. Brahmacharya literally means &quot;engaging in Brahman or Self&quot;. =\r\nOne experiences lust, anger, greed, jealosy etc only when one&#39;s mind percei=\r\nves and engages with impermanent manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful l=\r\nady, a bad person, a lot of money, a person being appreciated more than me =\r\netc) and NOT when one&#39;s mind engages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmach=\r\narya comes only on Self-realization. But one can start with physical celiba=\r\ncy and control over anger.\n\nRome is not built in a day.\n\nBottomline: It is =\r\nvery important to keep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. S=\r\ntart off with some level of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes=\r\n on. Never be frustrated with lack of progress and keep trying.\n\n* * *\n\nBTW=\r\n, regarding (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be =\r\nburning in the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there consuming=\r\n your offerings, even after it seems like there is no fire.\n\nKeep it as che=\r\nap as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood stic=\r\nks collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need.\n\nBest rega=\r\nrds,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nS=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@yahoo. c=\r\nom&gt; wrote: \n&gt; NAMASKAR to all\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama f=\r\nor the last three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus=\r\n of this beautiful forum...\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I need some practical approach best su=\r\nitable for me...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

Similarly, a sadhaka who is accumulating some=\r\n shakti through sadhana and does not leak that energy through acts of lust,=\r\n anger, greed, jealosy etc will be able to serve dharma better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If t=\r\nhere are 12 people who maintain physical and mental brahmacharya for a few =\r\nyears while doing homam everyday, I think the world can be changed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If an aghora sits naked with partner and chants mantra, please=\r\n remember that the goal isn&#39;t having sex. This practice is by means a glori=\r\nfication of sex. The goal is to *resist*.\n Even if the mind is overwhelmed =\r\nin the beginning with thrill and one ends up having sex, the goal is to rea=\r\nch a stage where mind is not looking at nakedness or intimacy as something =\r\nto be excited about. The goal is to reach a stage where brahmacharya can be=\r\n maintained despite such provocation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact, the true meaning of b=\r\nrahmacharya is not only to refrain from physical sex but also to refrain fr=\r\nom sexual thoughts in the mind. Many married people of today may be able to=\r\n set time limits (e.g. 40 days, 100 days, 1 year etc) and maintain physical=\r\n brahmacharya for that time, but it may be difficult to refrain from mental=\r\n thoughts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An aghora tries to incinerate the root cause of those tho=\r\nughts in his mind (what Manish called as &quot;sampradaaha&quot; ). Mind considers so=\r\nme things as pure and some things as impure. The &quot;impure&quot; objects and circu=\r\nmstances are considered impure because they cause thrill or some other dist=\r\nurbance to the mind and waver it\n from god. But an aghora puts them right i=\r\nn the middle of a &quot;pure&quot; activity (e.g. meditation), forcing oneself to dea=\r\nl with them. After some time, the impure objects do not cause any thrill or=\r\n other disturbance to waver the mind from god. Then they are no longer impu=\r\nre! For example, what is impure about a naked body? The only thing impure a=\r\nbout it is that it arouses certain thoughts in mind that disturb the mind a=\r\nnd waver it from god. If a naked body no longer arouses such thoughts, what=\r\n is impure about it?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That is the basic thinking in this practice. So=\r\nme yogis may physically abstain from sex and even stay away from exposure t=\r\no opposite sex, for several decades. But, if such a person is placed in fro=\r\nnt of a naked beauty, what thoughts will go on his mind? For all you know, =\r\nhis mind may indeed be disturbed and waver from god. An aghora tries to inc=\r\ninerate the very notion in the mind that so and so thing is something to be=\r\n aroused by, not by\n staying away from it but by being with it and yet tryi=\r\nng to focus the mind on god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline: An aghora engaging in this =\r\npractice may stray from brahmacharya in the beginning, but the goal is to a=\r\nttain more perfect brahmacharya later on. The goal of this practice is to a=\r\nttain brahmacharya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one does not keep brahmacharya in the beginni=\r\nng of sadhana, it may be ok. But, to really start progressing, one needs to=\r\n somehow or the other attain some level of brahmacharya and keep perfecting=\r\n it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The coarse meaning of brahmacharya is physical cel=\r\nibacy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The finer meaning of brahmacharya is physical celibacy and re=\r\nfraining from any sexual thoughts even in the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The finest meani=\r\nng of brahmacharya is refraining from lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonn=\r\ness and jealosy and establishing mind in Brahman always. Brahmacharya liter=\r\nally means &quot;engaging in Brahman or Self&quot;. One experiences lust, anger, gree=\r\nd, jealosy\n etc only when one&#39;s mind perceives and engages with impermanent=\r\n manifestations of Self (e.g. a beautiful lady, a bad person, a lot of mone=\r\ny, a person being appreciated more than me etc) and NOT when one&#39;s mind eng=\r\nages in true Self. Thus the truest brahmacharya comes only on Self-realizat=\r\nion. But one can start with physical celibacy and control over anger.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Rome is not built in a day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline: It is very important to ke=\r\nep brahmacharya, even using the coarse meaning above. Start off with some l=\r\nevel of brahmacharya and try to improve it as time goes on. Never be frustr=\r\nated with lack of progress and keep trying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, regard=\r\ning (4), even after fire goes away, you can meditate. Fire will be burning =\r\nin the ember form for a long time. So Agni is still there consuming your of=\r\nferings, even after it seems like there is no fire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Keep it as cheap=\r\n as you can, based on your financial level. Little ghee, fallen wood sticks=\r\n\n collected manually and some sesame seeds may be all you need.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best=\r\n regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- biswa108 &lt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:biswa1975%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nbiswa1975%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;biswa1975@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; NAMASKA=\r\nR to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama for the la=\r\nst three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of this =\r\nbeautiful forum...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now I need some practical approach best=\r\n suitable for me...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1.

(In my practical experience, consume very low-diet litt=\r\nle food at last night are excellent for performing Ganapati Homama in the m=\r\norning. my point is, readying our body/mind 5-6 hours before the homama pro=\r\ncedure by controlling sex/food are very much useful for me!)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; 4.
