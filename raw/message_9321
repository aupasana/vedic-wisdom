Assuming Apsaras cannot come to us in physical form at all, then how i=\r\ns it that our Puranas are full of incidents like Rishis marrying Apsaras, A=\r\npsaras giving birth to children due to their physical union with Rishis, et=\r\nc.? Even some great kings are known to have had the company of Apsaras. For=\r\n example, Emperor Pururava was seduced by Urvashi Apsara. She lived with hi=\r\nm for one year, and then disappeared, leaving him distressed. How all this =\r\ncan be explained? Any insightful ideas from you learned ones pertaining to =\r\nthese incidents would be very helpful.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;vernman_1976&quot; &lt;vernman1976@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; dear sir..from what i unde=\r\nrstand from certain serious tantrics i met....they told me that these being=\r\ns cant come to you in a physical form at all....and if you r doing these ty=\r\npe of sadhanas without a proper guru chances are that nothing would happen =\r\nat all.\n&gt; \n&gt; you will be far better off with a human companion....and gain =\r\nfar more doing normal worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; and dont trust what you come across on =\r\nthe net on apsaras and yakshinis.a whole lot of male fantasies get carried =\r\naway with the nonsense being portrayed.\n&gt; \n&gt; with regards.....and god bless=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
