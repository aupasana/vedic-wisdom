I thought to pause after Ganapati m=\r\nantras before offering Naivedyam (punahpuja) and to jump into Vratha katha(=\r\nVinayaka chavithi story). Once after completion of it, would like to offer =\r\nNaivedyam and will be carrying on to Uttarangam. \n\nHappy Vinayaka Chavithi\n=\r\n\nSrini.\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Happy Vinayaka Chaturthi to all, \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear PVRji, \n&gt; \n&gt; I have a=\r\n couple of questions. \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I had been doing daily Ganapathi homam for t=\r\nhe last couple of months and I feel a lot connected to God this way. For th=\r\ne Ganesha Chaturthi that is day after tomorrow, is it enough if just do the=\r\n Ganesha Homam with Shodasa upacharas and recite the story later, instead o=\r\nf the traditional &quot;Vinayaka Vratham&quot; or should I also do that in addition t=\r\no the homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Is it okay to reuse the left over ghee for the next da=\r\ny homam? Because I am doing daily homam, there is some ghee remaining every=\r\nday which I ask my wife to use for the regular consumption with food. But s=\r\nhe keeps complaining that it smelling like smoke, which I suspect is happen=\r\ning because we take shruk and shruvam so close to fire and dip in the ghee =\r\nagain multiple times. So, how about re-using the remaining ghee with some f=\r\nresh ghee mixed together for the next day homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
