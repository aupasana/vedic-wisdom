Since the tim=\r\ne I \nhad been doing homa on a regular basis I had first started off with \na=\r\nn iron kunda, then an aluminium and finally shifted to a copper \nhoma kunda=\r\n. And in each cases, I could feel some very papable \neffects.\n\nWhen I was d=\r\noing it in an iron kunda for some days I would often get \nsinged in the fla=\r\nmes. Once it was to quite an extent, such taht I \nhad problems in walking f=\r\nor a few days. This was after I had used \nthe iron kunda for consequetive h=\r\nomas for some days.\n\nThen I changed it and started using an Aluminuim kunda=\r\n which became \ndark and black with use. I had been using this aluminum kund=\r\na for \nabout a month and half regularly when some strange things started \nh=\r\nappening. There used to be some sort of infestation of incests in \nmy pooja=\r\n room. One day I found a scorpion in my room! This was quite \nstrange since=\r\n I had been living there for many months and now and \nnever have I seen any=\r\n before. Then came spiders. Now I am generally \nscared of spiders. This had=\r\n a strange psychological effect on my \nmind, such that one day when I close=\r\nd my eyes to meditate infront of \nthe fire, I could just see spiders all ar=\r\nound. And strangest of all, \nwithin a few days I got bitten by one! Never h=\r\nad I or anyone else I \nknew, had known that spiders can bite. But this is a=\r\n fact, cause I \nwent through it and it is quite painful. It sort of left a =\r\nsmall \ngaping wound on my neck.\n\nThen finally I shifted to a copper kunda a=\r\nnd all such incidents \nstopped. Infact after using a copper kunda for somet=\r\nime it created a \nmarked feeling of lightness and joy. Very distinct and pa=\r\npable.\n\nOf course if someone takes a hard rational stance, all this can be =\r\n\nput down to coincidence. But I personally do not think so. Infact \nthese j=\r\nust proved the truth of Narasimhajis advice. Copper kundas \nare the best. I=\r\nron can increase effects of Shani in a person&#39;s life \nand sadhana. And Alum=\r\ninium I believe is Rahu. The homa agni just \namplified the effects.\n\n-Regar=\r\nds\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
