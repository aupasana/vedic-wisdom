It=\r\n is thrown away. If you live in woods,\n&gt; &gt; throw it away\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the open s=\r\no animals can eat it. Otheriwse, throw it in \ngarbage.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On the oth=\r\ner hand, &quot;naivedyam&quot; offered to god can be consumed by\n&gt; &gt; people as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; p=\r\nrasad.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (2) Either is fine. They symbolize the path of shakti movi=\r\nng \nfrom\n&gt; &gt; you to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fire and vice versa.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (3) Either is f=\r\nine.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas used in a \n=\r\npooja,\n&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; has a purpose and it has to go when its purpose =\r\nis served. \nThat&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; the nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of life. While the flowers and aksha=\r\ntas are used in homam, they\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sacrosanct and should be handled w=\r\nith care, love and respect.\n&gt; &gt; After they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; serve their purpose, they h=\r\nave to be disposed of however one \ncan.\n&gt; &gt; Throwing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in garbage is fin=\r\ne if you ask me. Another way is to collect them\n&gt; &gt; in a bag\n&gt; &gt;&gt; until you=\r\n accumulate a good amount and burn them oneday. If you\n&gt; &gt; have a local\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; temple, you can go and see if you can throw them wherever they\n&gt; &gt; throw =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; flowers etc they use at the temple.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The ashes from the h=\r\nomam are considered sacred. They contain\n&gt; &gt; *some* of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; energy gene=\r\nrated from the homam. The best way to dispose the \nashes\n&gt; &gt; is to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thr=\r\now them into a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean).\n&gt; &gt; This\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n ensures that the energy is not localized to one place and is\n&gt; &gt; distribut=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt;&gt; back to the Nature. Another thing some people do is to dig a \ndeep\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; pit in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yard and bury the ashes. It restricts the energy to the=\r\n place \nand\n&gt; &gt; not a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; great idea. Please remember that the energy in t=\r\nhe ashes is \nonly a\n&gt; &gt; *part* of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the energy generated. Some energy is=\r\n also within the person\n&gt; &gt; performing homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and helps to purify the p=\r\nerson. Giving some part back to the\n&gt; &gt; nature is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; very good idea.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n--\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comca=\r\nst.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n-- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, November 01, =\r\n2008 7:18 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] questions w.r.t.
