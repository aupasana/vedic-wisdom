There=\r\n he remains without affirmations and\nvacillations, immersed in the depths o=\r\nf peace, the mind having become\nextinct.\n\nIt is next shown that in that sta=\r\nte death is transcended.\n\n570 Becoming aware of the real Self, which has ne=\r\nither beginning nor end,\nthe sage transcends death. Surely no one in the wo=\r\nrld transcends death\nwithout experiencing the truth of the Self as deathles=\r\ns.\n\n571 That exalted one who has attained, by enquiring =E2=80=98Whence am =\r\nI?=E2=80=99, birth in\nhis own source, the supreme one =E2=80=93 only he can=\r\n be said to be truly born. He\nhas been born once and for all time, and is e=\r\nternally new. He is the Lord of\nthe Munis [a title reserved for God].\n\n572 =\r\nHe that is established in his own natural state, in perfect identity\nwith B=\r\nrahman, is free from disease and beyond time and space. This is the\nsupreme=\r\n state that has been taught to us by the great Guru.\n\nThe body itself is di=\r\nsease, says Bhagavan. So true health is to be aware\nthat the body is not th=\r\ne Self. Bodily disease does not detract from the\nperfectly healthy state of=\r\n the sage, as we all know.\n\nThe truth about birth and death is next discuss=\r\ned.\n\n573 For the ignorant one in the world, birth is for dying and his deat=\r\nh is\nfor being reborn again. Consequently, the most holy one [Sri Ramana] h=\r\nas\ntold us that this birth and this death are unreal.\n\nThe kosas, usually t=\r\nranslated as =E2=80=98sheaths=E2=80=99, are the five forms through which\nth=\r\ne ego functions, and by doing so, cover the Self.\n\nEach cancels the other a=\r\nnd so samsara is without end.\n\n574 Real death is death of the ego. Real bir=\r\nth is to dwell in one=E2=80=99s natural\nstate. In that state, in which pair=\r\ns of opposites have no existence, birth\nand death have never become one.\n\nA=\r\nnother aspect of the supreme state is next discussed.\n\n575 How can the sage=\r\n, who is forever established in the state of\nnon-duality, become aware of d=\r\nifferences? The world that appears to the\nignorant as riddled with differen=\r\nces is to the sage only the\nundifferentiated Self.\n\n576 Some speak of the s=\r\nage as having two attributes: =E2=80=98equal vision=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98n=\r\not\nseeing differences=E2=80=99. This amounts to saying that he is free from=\r\n the state\nin which differences are seen. In the state in which one knows t=\r\nhat the Self\nalone exists, nothing is seen.\n\n577 In all persons the sage se=\r\nes only that real Self who is eternally aware\nof the truth. He does not see=\r\n anyone as separate from himself, nor does he\nlook upon anyone as ignorant.=\r\n In his sight all are sages.\n\nThis was exactly what Bhagavan was heard to s=\r\nay. This brings out the\nuniqueness of the sage. He does not look down upon =\r\nanyone or anything as\ninferior to himself.\n\nNow the question of the actions=\r\n of sages is taken up.\n\n578 The sage in his worldly activities may appear t=\r\no be aware of worldly\ndifferences, but he is really no more aware of them t=\r\nhan a sleepwalker who\nmoves about, performing actions.\n\nThis point will bec=\r\nome clear later on while dealing with the distinction\nbetween the yogic (ke=\r\nvala) samadhi and the natural (sahaja) samadhi of the\nsage.\n\nThe crucial te=\r\nst of the sage, by which he is distinguished from the\nignorant, is next giv=\r\nen.\n\n579 The difference between a sage and an ignorant one can be plainly s=\r\neen in\nrespect to censure and praise. The sage does not know the difference=\r\n between\nthe two since, for him, this pair of opposites, like all others, i=\r\ns unreal.\n\n580-1 There are those who have not attained the permanent abode =\r\nof the\nnatural state of the Self by following the quest for the truth. Thes=\r\ne\npeople, who have not freed themselves from the feeling that identifies th=\r\ne\nbody with the Self, are still subject to the delusion that jivas are\ndiff=\r\nerent from one another. Though these people may have understood well the\nsu=\r\nbtle meanings of Vedanta, even if they may have renounced the whole world\na=\r\ns mere trash, they inevitably become a slave to the harlot named =E2=80=98p=\r\nraise=E2=80=99.\n\nThis refers to an incident in the life of Sri Sadasiva Bra=\r\nhmendra, who for\nlong lived in the woods, practising sadhana. Once a co-pup=\r\nil of his met him\nin a forest and began praising him for a long time. At la=\r\nst Sadasiva became\nso elated by it that he exhibited horripilation. Noticin=\r\ng this, the other\nquestioned Sadasiva how such an exalted person could be s=\r\no affected.\nSadasiva replied by a verse in Sanskrit to the effect that even=\r\n such a one,\nif he had not reached the experience of the real Self, cannot =\r\nhelp feeling\npleasure from praise. This verse has been translated by Bhagav=\r\nan and placed\nin the Supplement (Anubandham) of Ulladu Narpadu. That the sa=\r\nge is not so\naffected is shown next.\n\n582 The sage, who does not know anyon=\r\ne as other than himself, and hence\nnever swerves from his own true state, i=\r\ns unaffected by censure, or praise,\nbecause for him censure or praise appea=\r\nr to be made by himself.\n\nThis is the uniqueness of egolessness. The sage i=\r\ns really bodiless. Those\nthat see his body judge him as if he were like the=\r\nm.\n\n583 Though he appears as embodied, he is really bodiless, being egoless=\r\n. His\nsubtle body does not survive and go forth somewhere when the gross bo=\r\ndy\nfalls, but undergoes disintegration here.\n\nAdherents of sects, whose doc=\r\ntrines are different, have raised controversy,\nstating that the soul remain=\r\ns an individual after enlightenment, being\nendowed with a sort of body.\n\nOn=\r\n this point there are two views: one that the liberated soul has a body\nalw=\r\nays, and another that he has no body, but can assume a body when he\npleases=\r\n. Bhagavan=E2=80=99s teaching is that all forms are unreal, and hence neith=\r\ner\nof these two is acceptable. This is dealt with below.\n\n584 Some believer=\r\ns in the reality of the world say that the sage has a body.\nOthers say that=\r\n the sage, being bodiless, can assume a body if he so\npleases.\n\n585 By the =\r\ndawn of right awareness of the real Self, the ego, the root cause\nof the ap=\r\npearance of forms, has been lost. Therefore for the sage, all forms\nare unr=\r\neal, and hence this talk of forms is foolishness.\n\nBhagavan has made it cle=\r\nar, by adopting the simile of the river mingling\nwith the ocean, that the s=\r\noul as such does not survive the dawn of right\nawareness. The soul has been=\r\n declared to be a false appearance due to\nconfusion of the body with the Se=\r\nlf, which cannot survive the extinction of\nignorance, its parent.\n\n586 Sinc=\r\ne it is not proper to say that this [world] existed before\n[enlightenment],=\r\n but was lost afterwards, and since [even in ignorance] no\none has a form f=\r\nrom the point of view of the reality, how can the sage have\na form?\n\nForms =\r\nbelong to duality, but duality, it has been declared, is never real.\nNon-du=\r\nality is true always, being unaffected by time.\n\n587 In the case of the sag=\r\ne who is established in his own natural state,\nfree of all the three bodies=\r\n, how can a desire arise to have a body? This\ntalk of forms is in vain, bei=\r\nng merely a concession to the unenlightened.\n\nEven in the Upanishads there =\r\nare passages suggesting that in salvation there\nare forms, but they are int=\r\nerpreted as a means of enabling unripe souls to\ntake to sadhana for salvati=\r\non. The real teaching of the Upanishads appears\nin texts such as the follow=\r\ning.\n\n588 As a river reaching the ocean loses its river-form and becomes\nin=\r\ndistinguishable from it, so too the sage, losing his form as a soul,\nbecome=\r\ns non-different from that Supreme Being, to whom all else is inferior.\n\n589=\r\n Thus revelation says that the sage in that supreme state becomes one\nwith =\r\nthe Supreme Being. Even when alive, the liberated one is bodiless\nbecause h=\r\ne does not think of himself as having a body.\n\nBhagavan defines liberation =\r\nas follows.\n\n590 Bhagavan our Guru says that liberation is just the extinct=\r\nion of the\nego, who becomes a disputant concerning the form of the sage. So=\r\n, this\ndispute about forms is meaningless.\n\nIt is to be noted that those wh=\r\no raise this controversy, do so without\nlosing their ego-sense. Can they ra=\r\nise this question after getting rid of\ntheir ego?\n\n591 Therefore, on the fa=\r\nll of the body his subtle form does not go forth, as\nin the case of the ign=\r\norant; it goes back and merges into its cause, and\nnothing survives for goi=\r\nng forth.\n\nThe cause of the subtle body is the unquintuplicated five bhutas=\r\n (materials\nof creation).\n\nThere is an incidental misconception which is ne=\r\nxt dispelled.\n\n592 The popular notion that there are many sages is also not=\r\n true. All\ndifferences belong to the world. In the worldless state they do =\r\nnot exist.\n\nThe controversy about the plurality of selves, which has been d=\r\niscussed and\nsettled before, is relevant here also.\n\n593 He who says, =E2=\r\n=80=98I have today seen this sage; I shall see others also,=E2=80=99\ndoes n=\r\not know the true nature of sages, which is\nreality-consciousness-bliss. Thi=\r\ns is what Bhagavan has told us on this\npoint.\n\n594 For him who knows not th=\r\ne sage who is within himself there appear many\nsages. For him who knows tha=\r\nt one, which is his own Self, this plurality [of\nsages] is non-existent.\n\nT=\r\nhe absurdity of these questions is thus pointed out by Bhagavan. Questions\n=\r\nabout the egoless state cannot be decided by the ego-ridden ones.\n\nThe foll=\r\nowing is the corollary from the above discussion.\n\nSource: http://www.david=\r\ngodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=\r\n=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d50b47ea204a2260157\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n567 In those who are ignorant,the real Self appears to have beco=\r\nme circumscribed and made finite by the sheaths.The real Self, infinite lik=\r\ne the sky and completely free from all limiting factors, is the state in wh=\r\nich none of the sheaths remain.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is the sheaths that create the =\r\nfalse sense of finiteness for the soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Buddhist teaching of nir=\r\nvana is next compared with this state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;568 Guru [Ramana] has said th=\r\nat the state of nirvana that was taught by Buddha to be the state in which =\r\nsamsara and suffering are ended is the same as remaining in the supreme sta=\r\nte, having discarded all the sheaths.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;So the Buddhist goal is the =\r\nsame as the state of deliverance taught in the Vedantas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is next =\r\nshown that by the experience of the true nature of the Self, doubts become =\r\nimpossible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;569 In that state doubts do not arise since the sage is =\r\never firm in his awareness of the true Self.

The soul has been declared to be a false appearance due to confus=\r\nion of the body with the Self, which cannot survive the extinction of ignor=\r\nance, its parent.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;586 Since it is not proper to say that this [wor=\r\nld] existed before [enlightenment], but was lost afterwards, and since [eve=\r\nn in ignorance] no one has a form from the point of view of the reality, ho=\r\nw can the sage have a form?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Forms belong to duality, but duality, =\r\nit has been declared, is never real. Non-duality is true always, being unaf=\r\nfected by time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;587 In the case of the sage who is established in hi=\r\ns own natural state, free of all the three bodies, how can a desire arise t=\r\no have a body? This talk of forms is in vain, being merely a concession to =\r\nthe unenlightened.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even in the Upanishads there are passages sugge=\r\nsting that in salvation there are forms, but they are interpreted as a mean=\r\ns of enabling unripe souls to take to sadhana for salvation. The real teach=\r\ning of the Upanishads appears in texts such as the following.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;588 =\r\nAs a river reaching the ocean loses its river-form and becomes indistinguis=\r\nhable from it, so too the sage, losing his form as a soul, becomes non-diff=\r\nerent from that Supreme Being, to whom all else is inferior.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;589 T=\r\nhus revelation says that the sage in that supreme state becomes one with th=\r\ne Supreme Being. Even when alive, the liberated one is bodiless because he =\r\ndoes not think of himself as having a body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan defines liberat=\r\nion as follows.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;590 Bhagavan our =\r\nGuru says that liberation is just the extinction of the ego, who becomes a =\r\ndisputant concerning the form of the sage. So, this dispute about forms is =\r\nmeaningless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is to be noted that those who raise this co=\r\nntroversy, do so without losing their ego-sense. Can they raise this questi=\r\non after getting rid of their ego?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;591 Therefore, on the fall of the=\r\n body his subtle form does not go forth, as in the case of the ignorant; it=\r\n goes back and merges into its cause, and nothing survives for going forth.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The cause of the subtle body is the unquintuplicated five bhutas =\r\n(materials of creation).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is an incidental misconception which =\r\nis next dispelled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;592 The popular notion that there are many sages =\r\nis also not true. All differences belong to the world. In the worldless sta=\r\nte they do not exist.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The controversy about the plurality of selve=\r\ns, which has been discussed and settled before, is relevant here also.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;593 He who says, =E2=80=98I have today =\r\nseen this sage; I shall see others also,=E2=80=99 does not know the true na=\r\nture of sages, which is reality-consciousness-bliss.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0This is wh=\r\nat Bhagavan has told us on this point.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;594 For him who knows not t=\r\nhe sage who is within himself there appear many sages. For him who knows th=\r\nat one, which is his own Self, this plurality [of sages] is non-existent.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;The absurdity of these questions is thus pointed out by Bhagavan. Que=\r\nstions about the egoless state cannot be decided by the ego-ridden ones.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The following is the corollary from the above discussion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgod=\r\nman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.or=\r\ng/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-=\r\nright:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margi=\r\nn-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0=\r\n =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=\r\n=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d50b47ea204a2260157--\r\n\n"}}
