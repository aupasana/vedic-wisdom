Nice quote from Chaitanya\n&gt; Mahaprabhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to say more on one statement:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; When a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord\n&gt; talks\n&gt; &gt; to him personally,and that they are a direct\n&gt; vehicle\n&gt; &gt; to serve the Lord.\n&gt; &gt; that is good indication the person is suffering\n&gt; from a\n&gt; &gt; certain level of delusion/maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is a good indication but not a conclusive\n&gt; proof.\n&gt; \n&gt; Someone like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa may mention\n&gt; many times that Kali told \n&gt; him this or Kali told him that. At a casual\n&gt; observation, he may seem like a \n&gt; proud person suffering from delusion. But he may\n&gt; have no such pride.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, someone else may talk very humbly and\n&gt; very sweetly. But all that \n&gt; may be a facade. The person may be internally quite\n&gt; proud of his purity and \n&gt; even proud of how humble and saattwik he thinks he\n&gt; is. At a casual \n&gt; observation, he may seem like a very humble and\n&gt; saattwik person. But he may \n&gt; not be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me give a simple analogy. One who watches a\n&gt; movie and narrates its story \n&gt; to another person is not necessarily deluded by the\n&gt; movie. He may have \n&gt; watched the movie impassionately and be simply\n&gt; narrating the story to one \n&gt; who is curious. On the contrary, someone else may\n&gt; claim &quot;oh, it&#39;s just a \n&gt; movie. It&#39;s not real. Don&#39;t take it seriously&quot; and\n&gt; yet secretly feel \n&gt; excitement in some scenes, fear in some scenes and\n&gt; sadness in some scenes \n&gt; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; One&#39;s detachment and one&#39;s ego cannot be judged from\n&gt; one or two actions. \n&gt; Only a careful observation over a period of time can\n&gt; reveal what motivates \n&gt; one, what one&#39;s agenda is, how one thinks and\n&gt; potentially give clues \n&gt; regarding one&#39;s purity level. Actually, even after a\n&gt; long observation, one \n&gt; may not be able to judge others. The best thing is\n&gt; not to judge the \n&gt; spiritual purity of others.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said before, we should focus internally. Each\n&gt; of us can analyze our own \n&gt; mind and its motivations. We should try to weed out\n&gt; pride from our actions, \n&gt; thoughts and instincts. Irrespective how we appear\n&gt; to the world and what \n&gt; others think about is, each of us should be able to\n&gt; recognize pride with \n&gt; some conscious intrpspection. We know what is going\n&gt; on in our mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):\n&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Lakshmi Kary&quot; &lt;lakshmikary@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, December 07, 2008 1:12 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Maha\n&gt; Ganapati Homam / Re-igniting \n&gt; Fire\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hare Rama Krishna\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; These are my thoughts.Hope no one takes offense.\n&gt; &gt; The problem with &quot;I ness&quot; is that just by focusing\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; it, one becomes more aware of sense of self.\n&gt; &gt; The real cure for &quot;I ness&quot; is to serve others,\n&gt; focus\n&gt; &gt; on others.\n&gt; &gt; Serve God , be the servant of God , instead of\n&gt; &gt; oneself.\n&gt; &gt; Then.. the person is &quot;self less&quot; - which is the\n&gt; cure\n&gt; &gt; for too much &quot;I ness&quot;\n&gt; &gt; When one loves someone they spend all their mind\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; heart thinking and serving that person. If a \n&gt; person\n&gt; &gt; is focusing constantly on the &quot;I ness&quot;  and on\n&gt; &gt; themselves it is pretty self oriented , the\n&gt; opposite\n&gt; &gt; of what is needed.. However sometimes, one has to\n&gt; &gt; realize how much &quot;I&quot; is there.\n&gt; &gt; When a person thinks he is so pure that the Lord\n&gt; talks\n&gt; &gt; to him personally,and that they are a direct\n&gt; vehicle\n&gt; &gt; to serve the Lord.\n&gt; &gt; that is good indication the person is suffering\n&gt; from a\n&gt; &gt; certain level of delusion/maya. In fact the world\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; full of people who are either deluding themselves\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; trying to delude others.\n&gt; &gt; But it doesn&#39;t matter because the Supreme Lord\n&gt; knows\n&gt; &gt; what is in everyones heart and has the perfect\n&gt; plan\n&gt; &gt; for our purification and realizations.Of course\n&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; are many paths to the same end.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is one verse/quote from Lord Caitanya-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;One should chant the holy name of the Lord in a\n&gt; &gt; humble state of mind,\n&gt; &gt; thinking oneself lower than the straw in the\n&gt; street;\n&gt; &gt; one should be more tolerant than a tree,\n&gt; &gt; devoid of all sense of false prestige,\n&gt; &gt; and should be ready to offer all respect to\n&gt; others.\n&gt; &gt; In such a state of mind one can chant the holy\n&gt; name\n&gt; &gt; of the Lord constantly.\n&gt; &gt; Best wishes\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; learns vedas, upanishad and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vedangas and is proud of one&#39;s knowledge and one\n&gt; who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; engages in rituals and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is proud of one&#39;s rituals, are better than many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; people who are in utter\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ignorance and yet proud of this or that. However,\n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; point is that both are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; far away from realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; True knowledge is one that makes one lose pride.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; True knowledge is one that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; increases the surrender. True knowledge is one\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; does not bind further,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but liberates one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As you correctly pointed out, recognizing the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; problem of pride is the first\n&gt; &gt;&gt; step in improving. As you said, pride does not\n&gt; leave\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one even during\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual sadhana! One may be proud of one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhana, even without fully\n&gt; &gt;&gt; realizing it consciously. One does not have to\n&gt; dig\n&gt; &gt;&gt; deep. One needs to only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scratch the surface of one&#39;s mind, thoughts and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; instincts to see the lion of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ego alive, kicking and roaring.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one recognizes the problem and\n&gt; \n=== message truncated ===\n\n\n"}}
