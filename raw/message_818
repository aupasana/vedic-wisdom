K. Kashyap, Nat=\r\nional\n&gt; Institute of Biologicals, India, and Dr. Peter Underhill of \nStanfo=\r\nrd\n&gt; University in California. Their results generally contradict the \nnoti=\r\non\n&gt; Aryan invasion/migration theory for the origin of Indian \ncivilization=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Underhill concluded &quot;the spatial frequency distributions of both L1\n=\r\n&gt; frequency and variance levels show a spreading pattern emanating \nfrom\n&gt; =\r\nIndia&quot;, referring to a Y chromosome marker. He, however, put \nseveral\n&gt; cav=\r\neats before interpreting genetic data, including &quot;Y-ancestry \nmay not\n&gt; alw=\r\nays reflect the ancestry of the rest of the genome&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dr. Kashyap, on th=\r\ne other hand, with the most comprehensive set of\n&gt; genetic data was quite e=\r\nmphatic in his assertion that there is &quot;no \nclear\n&gt; genetic evidence for an=\r\n intrusion of Indo-Aryan people into India, \n[and]\n&gt; establishment of caste=\r\n system and gene flow.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Michael Witzel, a Harvard linguist, who is kno=\r\nwn to lead the idea \nof\n&gt; Aryan invasion/migration/influx theory in more re=\r\ncent times, \ncontinued\n&gt; to question genetic evidence on the basis that it =\r\ndoes not provide \nthe\n&gt; time resolution to explain events that may have bee=\r\nn involved in \nAryan\n&gt; presence in India.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dr. Kashyap&#39;s reply was that=\r\n even though the time resolution needs\n&gt; further work, the fact that there =\r\nare clear and distinct \ndifferences in\n&gt; the gene pools of Indian populatio=\r\nn and those of Central Asian and\n&gt; European groups, the evidence neverthele=\r\nss negates any Aryan \ninvasion or\n&gt; migration into Indian Subcontinent.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Witzel though refused to present his own data and evidence for his\n&gt; theo=\r\nries despite being invited to do so was nevertheless present \nin the\n&gt; conf=\r\nerence and raised many questions. Some of his commentaries\n&gt; questioning th=\r\ne credibility of scholars evoked sharp responses from\n&gt; other participants.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Rig Veda has been dated to 1,500 BC by those who use linguistics to\n&gt;=\r\n claim its origin Aryans coming out of Central Asia and Europe.\n&gt; Archaeolo=\r\ngist B.B. Lal and scientist and historian N.S. Rajaram\n&gt; disagreed with the=\r\n position of linguists, in particular Witzel who\n&gt; claimed literary and lin=\r\nguistic evidence for the non-Indian origin \nof\n&gt; the Vedic civilization.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Dr. Narahari Achar, a physicist from University of Memphis clearly\n&gt; sho=\r\nwed with astronomical analysis that the Mahabharata war in \n3,067 BC,\n&gt; thu=\r\ns poking a major hole in the outside Aryan origin of Vedic \npeople.\n&gt; \n&gt; In=\r\nterestingly, Witzel stated, for the first time to many in the\n&gt; audience, t=\r\nhat he and his colleagues no longer subscribe to Aryan\n&gt; invasion theory.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Dr. Bal Ram Singh, Director, Center for Indic Studies at UMass\n&gt; Dartmo=\r\nuth, which organized the conference was appalled at the \nlevel of\n&gt; viscera=\r\nl feelings Witzel holds against some of the scholars in the\n&gt; field, but fe=\r\nlt satisfied with the overall outcome of the \nconference.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;I am glad t=\r\no see people who have been scholarly shooting at each \nother\n&gt; for about a =\r\ndecade are finally in one room, this is a progress&quot;, \nsaid\n&gt; Singh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne conference was able to bring together in one room for the \nfirst time\n&gt; e=\r\nxperts from genetics, archeology, physics, linguistics, \nanthropology,\n&gt; hi=\r\nstory, and philosophy.

His reasoning was that an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* =\r\nof some poet can never Inspire & attract\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; millions of people for tho=\r\nusans of years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery =\r\nstory of \nMahabhaarat to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic genious then how come h=\r\ne himself features \nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; story? if let&#39;s consider even that=\r\n as a possibility but then \nWHY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll write another book just on Sh=\r\nri Krishna i.e. \nBhaagavata. why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;Kaa=\r\nlpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how=\r\n come so many \nSaints of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can=\r\n argue that becuase of their intense worship of that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perticular For=\r\nm, they could see the same form of the supreme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reality...the suprem=\r\ne power can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The solid counter argumen=\r\nt is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, n=\r\never were a Devotee of that \nform of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in=\r\n their case, without devotion &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they got to see the fo=\r\nrm of Shri Krushna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Any thought=\r\ns about this?
