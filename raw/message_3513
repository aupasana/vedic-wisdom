Did not know t=\r\nhe significance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will practise with Brahma=\r\ncharya). But the way I did was it was one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3=\r\n000 times) for a period of two months and then I did a homam to complete th=\r\ne dasamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have called about 10 people (=\r\nGrihastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did chant the mantra while =\r\nI performed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is=\r\n a Dasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally=\r\n dasamsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmins (so basically, for=\r\n a laksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish the ritual of purasch=\r\narana). This is how I thought the big japams must be done. Can you shed mor=\r\ne light on this?\n \n=C2=A0\nAlso, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra star=\r\nting with tatsavitur...., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 30 le=\r\ntter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). How should this be practised? 3=\r\n0, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the 12th=\r\n house, according to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrology =\r\n!

The probability of min=\r\nd becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If the body can b=\r\ne kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also become still for a=\r\n moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cause great bliss.=\r\n As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still more often and=\r\n for longer times.

How =\r\ncan i\n&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of =\r\nmantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effa=\r\nced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experi=\r\nences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no differen=\r\nce in the sadhak or the deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be =\r\nit what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The=\r\n deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almo=\r\nst for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the per=\r\nson&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very =\r\nlittle=C3=82 according to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of S=\r\nhakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Cha=\r\nndika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God=\r\n himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such=\r\n a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath =\r\nor a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attac=\r\nking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of t=\r\nhe attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan=\r\n comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; Shakti ca=\r\nusing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic=\r\n. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; a normal =\r\nperson, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; whom you =\r\nharmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebody who is=\r\n identifying with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, then the U=\r\nniverse itself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, =\r\nbut on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist i=\r\nn using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is on=\r\nly a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then their minds a=\r\nnd intellects will not be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; the body and so t=\r\nheir actions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black magic. These=\r\n people usually join the same spirits which they have\n&gt; &gt; been using after =\r\ndeath, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is wors=\r\nhipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she=\r\n is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repit=\r\nions of a mantra(because of his previous\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand=\r\n somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 =\r\nthings which bind every mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; acheive in this =\r\nlifetime.\n&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so=\r\n let me\n&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starti=\r\nng on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call =\r\nthis the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main=\r\n constraints\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksh=\r\na or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the m=\r\nind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedu=\r\nre 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n possible.\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being =\r\ndiscussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post=\r\n this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; that this is s=\r\nuitable.\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

But, if one is living a lifestyle where one comes in cont=\r\nact with tempting situations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world wit=\r\nh a family and job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier w=\r\nhen we discussed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part =\r\nof the solution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a sl=\r\nowly moving car from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a =\r\nfast moving car out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with de=\r\ncent control over the mind to retain control in some tricky situations.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Trimming beard is ok.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one indeed does 1=\r\n000 times Gayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one ye=\r\nar while maintaining brahmacharya,\n &lt;BR&gt;while following the simple rules of=\r\n same place, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one will cer=\r\ntainly make good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still =\r\nwith an erect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. =\r\nThe probability of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is not st=\r\nill. If the body can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind will a=\r\nlso become still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it w=\r\nill cause great bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it will becom=\r\ne still more often and for longer times. Then various kinds of samadhis bec=\r\nome possible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish S=\r\noftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual=\r\n manuals for short Homam and Pitri\n Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On=\r\n &lt;B&gt;Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;I&gt;&lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Nag=\r\nraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Repost=\r\n:Manishji&#39; s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 8:40 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dy=\r\niv1423440994&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpa=\r\ncing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:=\r\n inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit&quot; vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;This is a great mail and very inspiring. However, I have one question o=\r\nn Sri Manishji&#39;s advise on how to carry out the sadhana. He says do it for =\r\n100 days and repeat the whole procedure for 3 times. So, should we do 3000 =\r\ntimes japam in a day for 100 days or do 1000 times every day for&nbsp;300 d=\r\nays? He also says &#39;Grow a beard&#39;. Now, in a professional corporate life, th=\r\nat could be a difficult thing. How about trimming it?.... just to be tolera=\r\nble to other people.

How can i&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; again experi=\r\nence the Beloved.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when i=\r\nt is done correctly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced =\r\nsuch that the deity&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak e=\r\nxperiences himself as that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There =\r\nthen arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. U=\r\ngra&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, =\r\nso self&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual=\r\n evolution&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; continues.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 ve=\r\nry little=C3=82 according to me which is black magic.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; It is al=\r\nl a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After t=\r\nhe death&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the de=\r\nity or if he was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separat=\r\ne realm reserved for these&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; beings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such=\r\n a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of t=\r\nhe attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment(&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this w=\r\nith&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit l=\r\nike you attack&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of t=\r\nhis from that same Atma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetime=\r\ns later. But if you attack&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with th=\r\ne universe and has very few karmas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe its=\r\nelf attacks you, because your attack is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, bu=\r\nt on his identification, ie God or the universe).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If people pe=\r\nrsist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, =\r\nthen there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification w=\r\nith&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generall=\r\ny termed as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same sp=\r\nirits\n which they have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an =\r\nenjoyable experience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chand=\r\nika for a few lifetimes, then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is =\r\ndrawn to that deity and such a sadhak&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few =\r\nrepitions of a mantra(because of his previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime ma=\r\ny&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial =\r\nand may not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; According t=\r\no me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sugg=\r\nest an easy sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on s=\r\nome good day, do 1000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 cal=\r\nl this the=C3=82 Gayatri, but the real&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) ever=\r\ny day, main constraints&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same=\r\n\n place.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same materials.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; As little movement as one can.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tuls=\r\ni as is your inclination.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the m=\r\nind and the body, not just the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow=\r\n a beard.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bo=\r\nwels are empty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; before you start.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this fo=\r\nr 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; See the differ=\r\nence in your personality before and after.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Long and short , wh=\r\nat is important is that life may be short, so do some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana,=\r\n and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; po=\r\nssible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were =\r\nbeing discussed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; manish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n clarifica=\r\ntion from me if you feel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe IN=\r\nTERNET now has a personality.
