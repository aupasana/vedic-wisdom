I persona=\r\nlly admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel and have placed them t=\r\no the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one for whom i have same lo=\r\nve and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda or Narasimha. Why? =\r\nBecause all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us proud not only by eff=\r\nectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECAUSE THEY OPERATED IN =\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATTACHED TO TH=\r\nEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the ideals of Sanatan Dharm=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; Regarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about him initially.=\r\n a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i switched on TV where=\r\n in i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of a ga=\r\nthering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go through.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his lecture. The r=\r\neason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christianity for prov=\r\ning his points. Immediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;A=\r\nshta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus)  come for =\r\ndiscourses. and i do not remember any instance where in they have attacked =\r\nany religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of Sanatan Dharma=\r\n. there is such an obvious contrast.\n&gt; after that first lecture, i watched =\r\nZakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced that this person is not a true spi=\r\nritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a fanatic and =\r\nthen never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debate at the sa=\r\nme site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated on the i=\r\nssue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking him that do=\r\nes he really believe that other religions and faith are also true. I must s=\r\nay that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more tolerance and und=\r\nerstanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; The unfortunate part is that the broad min=\r\nded people of today&#39;s generations are getting corrupted by such fanatic lea=\r\nders.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good frie=\r\nnds), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when =\r\nwe must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious faiths but also we must beli=\r\nve in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is true and we must nev=\r\ner try to convert people of other religion to our religion but on the contr=\r\nary we must discourage a person who wants to formally convert by telling hi=\r\nm/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I a=\r\nbsolutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are=\r\n there&quot;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe him as a great spi=\r\nritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me believe that. Now =\r\nthat is the reason i wish to know his views on this particular debate episo=\r\nde.

In fact, this is a q=\r\nuestion that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know h=\r\nim. In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that =\r\nsomebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures=\r\n, who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning=\r\n, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody tea=\r\nching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the =\r\nworld on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining some simple ques=\r\ntions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri=\r\n Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not a=\r\nn article of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Truth to those t=\r\nhat are ready. He is not interested in anything else. He answers only when =\r\nthere is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he would say s=\r\nome polite words and let it pass, however big the occasion may be. Most of =\r\nthe questions that were raised in that meeting were answered elaborately by=\r\n Sri Sri in his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The to=\r\npic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam=\r\n&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the v=\r\nery thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were read=\r\ny to benefit from it from the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but ma=\r\ny be of interest to everyone, especially those among us that are intellectu=\r\nally curious about spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri S=\r\nri always practices &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; =\r\nprinciple. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of=\r\n people and Sri Sri will only say very simple things or share some simple j=\r\nokes and laughs, but his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed fo=\r\nr those that are receptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,0=\r\n00 people trading one mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere p=\r\nerson opening up to Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for=\r\n that to happen. Words are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions=\r\n,  the point of words is to create inner silence or illumination and if tha=\r\nt is not created, there is no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a g=\r\nreat privilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living Ma=\r\nster whether it is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we listen =\r\nto them from our Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, ther=\r\ne are innumerable examples of very simple people benefiting from his mere l=\r\nooks & presence while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss the =\r\nopportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere queries, S=\r\nri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am an il=\r\nliterate! What a disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to lab=\r\nel Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without=\r\n an accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of=\r\n an experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will bec=\r\nome yet another mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadh=\r\nak. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are creat=\r\ned by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! =\r\nThings like lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in th=\r\nat way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasionally visit this forum. I happened to see=\r\n several emails about AOL and the below email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a disciple and devot=\r\nee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few things to the extent of =\r\nmy understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each lea=\r\nding to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use =\r\nausterities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss=\r\n is also blissful. That does not make it in any way inferior to paths of au=\r\nsterities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this p=\r\nath one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the=\r\n sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they=\r\n progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is =\r\na seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spri=\r\ntual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is co=\r\nmmonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansin=\r\ng and settling of the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spi=\r\nritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right a=\r\nttitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the b=\r\nody (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salu=\r\ntations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under th=\r\nis category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all t=\r\nhe pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art o=\r\nf Living course, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study =\r\nand imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Git=\r\na and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentar=\r\ny on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tap=\r\nes and the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33=\r\n DVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for th=\r\nose that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampa=\r\nra, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and som=\r\ne wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nLet me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a f=\r\nully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of=\r\n guiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having t=\r\no be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I mysel=\r\nf had that experience twice), some in person and several via various other =\r\nways. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master i=\r\ns essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate=\r\n and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to gui=\r\nde disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be es=\r\ntablished.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mos=\r\ntly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order capable of reaching S=\r\natChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. They may be not fully=\r\n established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru and can=\r\n appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It=\r\n is very easy to accept those that left their body as having achieved highe=\r\nst realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi=\r\n. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are in physical fo=\r\nrm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: =\r\nAOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor=\r\n its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go=\r\n to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full tim=\r\ne teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in prope=\r\nrty to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither need=\r\ns all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went throug=\r\nh very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge t=\r\no the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be reveale=\r\nd to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers=\r\n have faced danger to their lives by going without any help or guidance to =\r\nareas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Pal=\r\nestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as =\r\ntheir aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in A=\r\nOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience sho=\r\nwed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more =\r\ndiligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be den=\r\nied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part =\r\nof organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where peop=\r\nle took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Wh=\r\nenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their ow=\r\nn pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the vi=\r\nctims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmi=\r\nc debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some doership =\r\nin them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in ge=\r\ntting everyone turn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that i=\r\ns inside everyone. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders t=\r\no any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
