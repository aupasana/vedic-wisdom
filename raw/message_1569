I have no idea of Mantra for shifting the lord temp=\r\nerorily.\n\nMy point in Abhisheka was that, if we don&#39;t like to bath with reu=\r\nsed water then we don&#39;t do that for The lord.If we wish to eat best quality=\r\n food, we must strive to offer same quality if not the better as Naivedya. =\r\nYou know all this but still i wrote with the intentions that somebody comin=\r\ng to the list might get some idea in future.\n\nHowever, you are the best jud=\r\nge of your situation w.r.t. Abhisheka as you mentioned your practical diffi=\r\nculties.\n\nVey happy Ugaadi, Cheti Chand, Gudi Padava, Navreh to every one f=\r\nrom Andhra, Karnaataka, Maharashtra and Kashmir.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana Rao Ping=\r\nali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal =\r\npathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Vijay,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Few things c=\r\name to my mind after reading your message.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Your intentions were =\r\nright. i.e. you wanted your son to stay focussed in the Puja hence you move=\r\nd the Shiva Linga\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * If you lifted the Linga without having any sen=\r\nse of presence of Shiva then i think your own faith of invokation was lesse=\r\nr. This seems to be the case for many of us or Most of us. We invoke the de=\r\nity in the Fire and Idol but then the prsence is forgotten.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I mov=\r\ned, I mentally asked Siva to pardon me. So, I did not have any doubt about =\r\nSiva presence when I moved it. How ever, if a person I respect is sitting i=\r\nn a sofa, I will try to avoid moving the sofa. But, if needed, I will reque=\r\nst the guest to stand up and then move the sofa. In this case, if I had req=\r\nuested Siva to come to another object and after moving the siva linga, I re=\r\nstored him into Siva lingam, I would not have felt bad. How ever, I do not =\r\nquite know if this is appropriate (I know how to ask Siva to come to yatha =\r\nsthanam, but is there any procedure to shift the place of the God once he i=\r\ns invoked?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; * Same goes for reusing of Water for Abhisheka. it gives =\r\nthat we didn&#39;t care much for Shiva.\n&gt; No, I won&#39;t agree your view here. I d=\r\nid not care about the act of abhisheka. I was seeing it merely as an act to=\r\n glue my son to the seat. How ever, my son pour the water fast and hence I =\r\nend up get lots and lots of water. I usually drink the water after he finis=\r\nhes the abhishekam. If I should not reuse the water, I won&#39;t be able to dri=\r\nnk up all the water. May be I can use it for bathing the next day (but then=\r\n storing the water becomes a regular activity). So, reusing the water seem =\r\nto simplify the whole thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But It is your own good heart which imm=\r\nediately realised the error and provocated the thought of doubt. it was suc=\r\nh a strong feeling that you wrote to the list. that shows your concern abou=\r\nt the whole issue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my opinion, both the points mentioned needs =\r\nto be avoided hence forth. Though i feel Shiva is easy going and Bhole Baba=\r\n who is reputed for not taking offense for such trivial issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks=\r\n for your kind responce.\n&gt; \n&gt; I treated Siva as a kid (if my son is in sofa=\r\n watching TV, I won&#39;t hesitate to move the sofa - in this case I had mental=\r\nly requested Siva not to mind; but in the end my son started doing it himse=\r\nlf, (once the bowl was full, he took the siva lingam out and put it in the =\r\nother container and continued that way. That is what made me think if I am =\r\nmisdirecting him.\n&gt; \n&gt; How ever, strangely I felt resonating sound while I =\r\nwas chanting mRtyunjaya mantra (felt as if there is chanting from with in m=\r\ne) and felt very well. So, I am sure Siva was not upset - but that could be=\r\n because he is Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will definitely try not to move the idol.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
