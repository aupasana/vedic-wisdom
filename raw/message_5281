Therefore, the period of her appearing as goddess of learning \ncannot b=\r\ne easily determined.\n\nSarasvati appears first of all as a mighty river in t=\r\nhe RV. She is said \n&quot;to flow from the mountains upto the sea&quot; (7,95,2), &quot;to=\r\n swell by getting\nwaters from the rivers&quot; (6,52,6), and &quot;to be the seventh =\r\nriver, fed by  \n(other) rivers&quot; (7,36,6). All these facts from the family-b=\r\nooks of the \nRV attest the intimate relation of the RSis with the river Sar=\r\nasvati, \nbut elsewhere (e.g. in 10,17,7-10) she appears to be deified , as =\r\nif \nthose RSis had only heard about her. The other Vedic Samhitas and \nBrah=\r\nmanas do not refer to her physical form, but regard her as goddess. \nShe is=\r\n not merely a river there.\n\nAt the isolating stage of the Aryan speech, not=\r\nhing was known by its \nname. There were only clauses to mention a thing. If=\r\n there was a river, \nit could be refer to as &quot;it flows&quot;. Though the river, =\r\nlater called \nSarasvati, might have been flowing very mightily at that time=\r\n, an Indus \ntext simply says: Sa  (nipple) ra (speed) Sa (end), meaning &#39;fr=\r\nom the \nmountain it flows and stops on the way&#39;. There is also a clause  Sa=\r\n ra \nSa gha which seems to say : the waters flowing from the mountain will =\r\n\nstop. Though the river might have been flowing from the time immemorial,\ni=\r\nt was seen slowing down after the rainy season, and it was destined to \nsto=\r\np late\n=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\nMy own recent work and approach\n\nCopyright Kedarnath 2=\r\n010\n\nI dont like mysteries or anything remotely connected with it in \nHindu=\r\nism. What on earth are the seals and strange images and glyphs? \nThere are =\r\npots, jars, horns and impossible quadrupedes. strange \ncombinations of glyp=\r\nhs. There has been work and more done on the subject\nof the seals, I believ=\r\ne for hundreds of years without anything \nconclusive.\n\nThere are two reason=\r\ns why mysteries can remain &quot;mysteries&quot; - (1) \nProfessionals ganging up to t=\r\nry and keep the truth under the carpet for\na  variety of reasons. This coul=\r\nd be region, language, race, religion\nand  political or simple and pure cus=\r\nsedness. (2) People having better\nthings  to do. The seekers of truth and t=\r\nhose that dont like dichotomies\nhave a  strange uneasiness when they have t=\r\no face it.\n\nThe only thing any Hindu can do when facing dichotomy is to do =\r\ndecide \n&quot;doing it yourself&quot;. This is by definition, a matter of being alone=\r\n in a\ncrowd. And that is not a matter for discomfort to the Hindu, is it? A=\r\nny \ndichotomy there can be resolved by remembering the gurus of the world \n=\r\nmay give &quot;prasad&quot; but chew it you have to, alone. Neither the guru nor \nany=\r\n body can do it for you. Nor would you like it if they did.\n\nArtefacts with=\r\n images of jars, fish signs, one horned heiffer (eka \nshru~ggi), sprouts se=\r\nedlings, rimless wide pots are about 74% of the \ntotal and remaining have a=\r\nn interesting  variety of images of crabs, \nscorpions, ligatured animals, l=\r\nions, boars etc. This, in toto is the \nfinds of archeologists. Whether the =\r\nabove are any kind of language is \nthe crux of the issue.. It is lso a matt=\r\ner of debate and conferences and\npolitics and societal divides in Hindus an=\r\nd foreign &quot;scholars&quot;  having a\nhey day.\n\nI would be the last person to go d=\r\nelving into language and grammars of \neither Sanskrit or Tamizh or Telugu t=\r\no understand the artefacts and get \nbogged down. My simple question would b=\r\ne , &quot;If so much effort has gone \ninto decipherment - how much would have go=\r\nne into cipherment&quot;. And why? \nDid the creators of the artefacts want their=\r\n children to go crazy in \ntheir own times looking at pots and fish and stra=\r\nnge ligatures by any \nstandards at any time? I dont think that civilization=\r\n however weird \nwould do that. This is like teaching an innocent child that=\r\n a cat is \nactually a dog and dog is an alligator. And crabs are things to =\r\nplay \nwith.\n\nYet they are there. So, there is message and sombody went thro=\r\nugh a lot \nup trouble. Forgetting that they gave a lot more trouble than th=\r\ney took \nin creating the artefacts, who in today&#39;s world does that? The ans=\r\nwer is\nthe language teacher in any school and particularly grammar. They do=\r\n \nthat for gerunds, yowels, aorists, fricatives, sibiliants, oxymorons and\n=\r\nother tiring things for people of any age.\n\nThe paradox of language is that=\r\n it is so easy for a child to speak a non\nnative language but so difficut f=\r\nor it to learn the grammar of  its own \nmother tongue. If I, as a child alo=\r\nng with all classmates and the \nstudent body as whole disliked the subject =\r\ndo I have any reason to \nexpect that a child in the past or future to jump =\r\nwith joy for the \ngrammar class to begin. Looking back, if I really had my =\r\nway and not \nbribed in some way, it would have taken more than a pair of ox=\r\nen to have\ndragged me into the class.\n\nIn all likelihood, this has always b=\r\neen the case. The job of the \nteacher, as always has been to teach. It is s=\r\ntandard practice for \nteachers at all times to make difficult to teach subj=\r\nects with help of \nteaching aids.  And that becomes my master key for inves=\r\ntigation.\n\nOf all languages Sanskrit is the most researched from since earl=\r\niest \ntimes. vyAkarNa or grammar of Sanskrit is vedanga or part of the veda=\r\n \nitself. And there is sacredness attached to it. This, in my mind is more\n=\r\nthan enough reason for the creators of the artefacts to have taken the \ntro=\r\nuble. And the trouble they have taken is for children of their own \ntimes, =\r\nposterity and history. Since that makes me comfortable to think \nabout, I c=\r\nan proceed to go ahead with comfortable research. My current \nproblem is to=\r\n dichotomy of trying to run with the hare and hound. This \nis just as impos=\r\nsible as the images in the artefacts.  So, the approach \nis take up a Sansk=\r\nrit Grammar book.  Whitneys ought to do fine. A PDF \nfile of this now ancie=\r\nnt and not in copyright domain had all its word by\nword text extracted out =\r\nand put into ordinary spreadsheets.\n\nWhitney uses approximately, 17,00 sans=\r\nkrit words among about 70, ooo \nunique english words to exlain Sanskrit gra=\r\nmmar and amon these are \nmatches for &quot;jar&quot;, &quot;pot&quot;,  &quot;fsh&quot;, &quot;claw&quot; etc. The =\r\ngrammar category where\nit has been used is noted and synonyms for the Engli=\r\nsh for synonyms in \nSanskrit from Monier Williams dictionary are compiled.\n=\r\n\nregards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
