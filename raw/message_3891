One story relates to the o=\r\npening of the Kali Yuga or Dark Age of mankind. Kali, who personifies the s=\r\npirit of this age, went to see Lord Brahma, to take his leave before descen=\r\nding to the earth to inaugurate and rule during the Kali Age. As he walked =\r\nnaked into the presence of Lord Brahma, he was holding his tongue with his =\r\nleft hand, and his penis in this right hand. Brahma looked at him, and aske=\r\nd what was the significance of this unusual posture? Kali related that he d=\r\nid not understand it himself, but when he had gone into the presence of Lor=\r\nd Shiva to take his leave, he had announced that he was going to earth to h=\r\nave domain over all mankind. Shiva only laughed when he said this, and had =\r\ninformed him that he would have domain over most men, but not over the man =\r\nwho held his tongue\n and kept hold of his penis. Brahma also had to laugh, =\r\nand told Kali that what Shiva had meant was that the man who kept a firm ho=\r\nld on his tongue and penis was not as likely to get into trouble as were me=\r\nn who did not do so. Then it was Kali&#39;s turn to laugh, and he said, ``Don&#39;t=\r\n worry. I will find some way to make them let go.&#39;&#39; And with many he has, b=\r\nut the Age of Darkness is not dark to all men who have sought and found the=\r\n light of wisdom, no matter how dimly it burned.\n\n\n--- On Thu, 4/3/10, vedi=\r\nc_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus\nTo: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 7:24 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Namaste Rajarshi,\n\n\n\nNara=\r\nsimha aptly worte:\n\n\n\n&gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter how much =\r\none has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how=\r\n &gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences &gt;one =\r\nhad, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt;of the tim=\r\ne, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still fall. \n\n\n\nI le=\r\narnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s message.

There may not be anything wrong, i=\r\nf a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many follo=\r\nwers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and=\r\n does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Bra=\r\nhmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.\n\nI whol=\r\ne heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful =\r\nin his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual=\r\n matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature i=\r\nn society. He really was a Saadhu.\n\n\n\nThere is a big difference between fal=\r\nl of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar=\r\n didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment fo=\r\nr us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front o=\r\nf the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blo=\r\nw to faiths of general public.\n\n\n\nI am not specific on Satyananda here beca=\r\nuse i do not know if it is really true.\n\n\n\nIf the footage is right, then i =\r\nfancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear=\r\n Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corru=\r\nption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.\n\n\n\n&gt; Further, in t=\r\nhis age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and \n\n\n\nYou hav=\r\ne spoken the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then say ev=\r\nen 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very ela=\r\nvated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains =\r\nof sexual desires.\n\n\n\nFinally, i would say that its high time for Big names=\r\n and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of  Vimal=\r\nananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical and men=\r\ntal Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )\n\n=\r\n\n\nIt reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n\n&quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tya=\r\nachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nUtpal   \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami =\r\nNityananda.

But in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru will change.=\r\n Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature w=\r\nill teach in the best possible way.

The world toda=\r\ny is many times more tempting then say even 100 years back. It is better to=\r\n be a married person (Even for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if com=\r\nes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nFinall=\r\ny, i would say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Spir=\r\nitual Masters start taking a leaf out of  Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s b=\r\nold approach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of th=\r\ne* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nIt reminds me of San=\r\nt Tukaaram&#39;s famous line&lt;BR&gt;\n&quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule=\r\n&quot;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nBest Regards,&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\nUtpal   &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n--- In &lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofoll=\r\now&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; I too believe we should give th=\r\ne benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.

Tehelka=\r\n, which did the sting operation,=C3=82=C2=A0is a VERY questionable organiza=\r\ntion.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether S=\r\nwami Nityananda was not practising say some sexual ritual?&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonabl=\r\ne good one, has sex with someone?&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; We live in=\r\n such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY adva=\r\nnced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who =\r\nmight have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would=C3=82=C2=A0proba=\r\nbly=C3=82=C2=A0 not be able to remain so when born in thid age=C3=82=C2=A0i=\r\ns a simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different =\r\nfrom other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have be=\r\ncome so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep=\r\n hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steepe=\r\nd in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I co=\r\nnsider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of struggl=\r\ne to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityana=\r\nnda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea=\r\n of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her gur=\r\nu and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In=\r\n this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas fo=\r\nr some years. &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Bet=\r\nween me and You, there is only me.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Take away the me, so only You r=\r\nemain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &l=\r\nt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &=\r\nlt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritu=\r\nal gurus&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;A rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40=\r\nyahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40=\r\nyahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Date: Thursday=\r\n, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; Namaste KK,&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; No matter ho=\r\nw genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Paramaham=\r\nsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine, it i=\r\ns only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

Take your mind off god for a secon=\r\nd and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god=\r\n 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?&lt;BR&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; The most important thing is to surren=\r\nder to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a dedicated servant forever. =\r\nThere may be some members of this group who make good progress in the comin=\r\ng years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating=\r\n them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, followin=\r\ng, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the=\r\n midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, =\r\nego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and on=\r\ne falls in the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benef=\r\nit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his tea=\r\nchings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if =\r\nthe greatest liar says sky is blue.
