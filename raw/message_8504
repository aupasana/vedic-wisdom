One is=\r\n the Temple dedicated to Lord Surya in Arasavilli and the second one is Sur=\r\nyanarayana Koil ( One of the Navagraha temples of tamilnadu) . \n\nThe specia=\r\nlity of the Arasavilli Surya temple is that on Ratha Saptami day the rays o=\r\nf the sun fall directly on the sanctum sanctorum. The speciality of the Sur=\r\nyaNarayana Koil one is that on the Tamil new year day the rays of the sun d=\r\nirectly fall on the idol.\n\nSimilarly there are a few more temples. The anci=\r\nent Rishis possessed the wisdom to construct such temples . Even though the=\r\n stars are moving and the earth slightly changing its axis tilt, till to th=\r\nis day these temples demonstrate this practical sight.\n\nThe presence of suc=\r\nh temples only demonstrates the level of skill of the ancients ...it does n=\r\not prove that the stars are not rotating or lack of need of a ayanamsha or =\r\nbeeja samskara in SSS.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Thanks for writing this mail for me.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0In 1999 a Light had appeared in my Puja Room for several minutes an=\r\nd then I had very unexpectedly chance to visit Sri Nathdwara for several da=\r\nys which was a very happy experience.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a very difficult physical=\r\n pain and despite having several times extraordinary spiritual experiences,=\r\n it has not been resolved. Yesterday was one of those days and i was very u=\r\npset due to pain. About midnight I was saying to Divine Lord who reside in =\r\nNathdwara that You do not care and similar things.

Now if the Stars were moving why woul=\r\nd they have placed this wondow as such. I am wondering, because the temple =\r\nCreators are much more smarter than all the Panchang makers collectively as=\r\nsembled together .\n&gt; \n&gt; Some one please answer this one.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Bh=\r\naskar.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
