Only this set a person\nworking o=\r\nr thinking. But I said, &quot;How can it be so? The vasanas must be with\none&#39;s S=\r\nelf and can never remain away from the Self. If, as you say, the\nvasanas be=\r\n contained in the brain and the Heart is the seat of the Self, a\nperson who=\r\n is decapitated must be rid of his vasanas and should not be\nreborn. You ag=\r\nree that it is absurd. Now can you say that the Self is in the\nbrain with t=\r\nhe vasanas? If so, why should the head bend down when one falls\nasleep? Mor=\r\neover a person does not touch his head and say `I&#39;. Therefore it\nfollows th=\r\nat the Self is in the Heart and the vasanas are also there in an\nexceedingl=\r\ny subtle (Difficult to detect or grasp by the mind or analyse)\nform.\n\n\n&quot;Whe=\r\nn the vasanas are projected from the Heart they are associated with the\nLig=\r\nht of the Self and the person is said to think. The vasanas which lie\nimbed=\r\nded in an atomic condition grow in size in their passage from the heart\nto =\r\nthe brain. The brain is the screen on which the images of the vasanas are\nt=\r\nhrown and it is also the place of their functional distribution. The brain\n=\r\nis the seat of the mind, and the mind works through it.&quot; So then this is\nwh=\r\nat happens.\n\n\nWhen a vasana is released and it comes into play, it is assoc=\r\niated with the\nlight of the Self. It passes from the heart to the brain and=\r\n on its way it\ngrows more and more until it holds the field all alone and a=\r\nll the vasanas\nare thus kept in abeyance for the time being. When the thoug=\r\nht is reflected\nin the brain it appears as an image on a screen. The person=\r\n is then said to\nhave a clear perception of things. He is a great thinker o=\r\nr discoverer.\nNeither the thought that is extolled as being original, nor t=\r\nhe thing, nor\nthe country which is claimed to be a new discovery, is really=\r\n original or\nnew. It could not manifest unless it was already in the mind. =\r\nIt was of\ncourse very subtle and remained imperceptible, because it lay rep=\r\nressed by\nthe more urgent or insistent thoughts or vasanas. When they have =\r\nspent\nthemselves this thought arises and by concentration the Light of the =\r\nSelf\nmakes it clear, so that it appears magnificent, original and revolutio=\r\nnary.\nIn fact it was only within all along. This concentration is called sa=\r\nmyamana\nin the Yoga Sastras. One&#39;s desires can be fulfilled by this process=\r\n and it\nis said to be a siddhi . It is how the so-called new discoveries ar=\r\ne made. Even\nworlds can be created in this manner. Samyamana leads to all s=\r\niddhis. But\nthey do not manifest so long as the ego lasts. Concentration ac=\r\ncording to\nyoga ends in the destruction of the experiencer (ego), experienc=\r\ne and the\nworld, and then the quondam desires get fulfilled in due course. =\r\nThis\nconcentration bestows on individuals even the powers of creating new\nw=\r\norlds.\n\nIt is illustrated in the Aindava Upakhyana in the Yoga Vasishta and=\r\n in the\nGanda Saila Loka in the Tripura Rahasya. Although the powers appear=\r\n to be\nwonderful to those who do not possess them, yet they are only transi=\r\nent. It\nis useless to aspire for that which is transient. All these wonders=\r\n are\ncontained in the one changeless Self. The world is thus within and not=\r\n\nwithout. This meaning is contained in verses 11 and 12 - Chapter V of Sri\n=\r\nRamana Gita &quot;The entire Universe is condensed in the body, and the entire\nb=\r\nody in the Heart. Thus the Heart is the nucleus of the whole Universe.&quot;\nThe=\r\nrefore Samyamana relates to concentration on different parts of the body\nfo=\r\nr the different siddhis. Also the Visva or the Virat is said to contain\nthe=\r\n cosmos within the limits of the body. Again, &quot;The world is not other\nthan =\r\nthe mind, the mind is not other than the Heart; that is the whole\ntruth.&quot; S=\r\no the Heart comprises all. This is what is taught to Svetaketu by\nthe illus=\r\ntration of the seed of a fig tree. The source is a point without\nany dimens=\r\nions. It expands as the cosmos on the one hand and as Infinite\nBliss on the=\r\n other. That point is the pivot. From it a single vasana starts,\nmultiplies=\r\n as the experiencer `I&#39;, experience, and the world. The\nexperiencer and the=\r\n source are referred to in the mantra . Two birds,\nexactly alike, arise sim=\r\nultaneously.\n\nWhen I was staying in the Skandasramam I sometimes used to go=\r\n out and sit on\na rock. On one such occasion there were two or three others=\r\n with me\nincluding Rangaswami Iyengar. Suddenly we noticed some small moth-=\r\nlike\ninsect shooting up like a rocket into the air from a crevice in the ro=\r\nck.\nWithin the twinkling of an eye it had multiplied itself into millions o=\r\nf\nmoths which formed a cloud and hid the sky from view. We wondered at it a=\r\nnd\nexamined the place from which it shot up. We found that it was only a\npi=\r\nnhole and knew that so many insects could not have issued from it in such\na=\r\n short time. That is how ahankara (ego) shoots up like a rocket and\ninstant=\r\naneously spreads out as the Universe. The Heart is therefore the\ncentre.\n\nA=\r\n person can never be away from it. If he is he is already dead. Although\nth=\r\ne Upanishads say that the jiva functions through other centres on\ndifferent=\r\n occasions, yet he does not relinquish the Heart. The centres are\nsimply pl=\r\naces of business (vide Vedanta Chudamani). The Self is bound to the\nHeart, =\r\nlike a cow tethered to a peg. The movements are controlled by the\nlength of=\r\n the rope. All its wanderings centre around the peg. A caterpillar\ncrawls o=\r\nn a blade of grass and when it has come to the end, it seeks another\nsuppor=\r\nt. While doing so it holds on with its hind-legs to the blade of\ngrass, lif=\r\nts the body and sways to and fro before it can hold another.\nSimilarly it i=\r\ns with the Self. It stays in the Heart and holds other centres\nalso accordi=\r\nng to circumstances. But its activities always centre round the\nHeart.\n\nSou=\r\nrces:\n\n1) Arunachala Ramana&#39;s Volume1 Book\n2) http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ra=\r\nmana_maharshi/books/tw/tw616.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=\r\n=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e68deb06d66027048856be39\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;When I was on the Hill, Nayana (Kavyakantha Ganapathi Muni) once argued =\r\nthat the brain was the seat of the vasanas, because it consisted of innumer=\r\nable cells in which the vasanas were contained and illuminated by the light=\r\n of the Self which projected from the heart.
