But a fan ma=\r\ny continue to turn for a while. A small fan may turn slowly and for a short=\r\n while, while a bigger fan may turn longer and faster, after electricity is=\r\n turned off. What a gyani does *after* self-realization varies from one gya=\r\nni to another.\n \nA self-realized Janaka may rule a kingdom, a self-realized=\r\n Arjuna may fight a battle, a self-realized Vasishtha may become a rajaguru=\r\n, a self-realized Vivekananda may tour the world and teach vedanta, another=\r\n self-realized yogi may remain hidden in a cave in Himalayas, and another s=\r\nelf-realized yogi may live like a fool begging outside a temple. What a sel=\r\nf-realized person does is dependent on the previous history of that soul an=\r\nd what Nature expects from one. As one&#39;s individual Ego and individual Will=\r\n efface, one becomes an instrument of nature, like a dry leaf floating in t=\r\nhe air.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough rishis and gods such as Shiva and Vi=\r\nshnu are liberated, their amshas still come down to earth now and then to a=\r\nffect important changes, in accordance with the will of Nature and Natural =\r\nOrder (niyati). They retain their identity till the end of the creation cyc=\r\nle and yet are ever liberated.\n \nI am quoting a relevant writeup from messa=\r\nge 438 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup titled &quot;Rishis&quot;:\n \n*        *        *\n \n=\r\nAll that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the powe=\r\nr of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and a=\r\nll is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or=\r\n Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided conscious=\r\nness is known as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality, where there =\r\nare many different objects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that=\r\n went through some modification and manifestation. It is known as &quot;manifest=\r\ned Brahman&quot;. Both are Brahman only.\n \nNormally, living in the domain of dua=\r\nlity without being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near t=\r\no impossible. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the unde=\r\nrlying oneness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality w=\r\nithout experiencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of dualit=\r\ny is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of =\r\noneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality an=\r\nd no objectification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is t=\r\nhe advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;=\r\n.\n \nHowever, maharshis have described higher states. It is possible to be i=\r\nn oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time=\r\n. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects o=\r\nf duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) =\r\nof all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or=\r\n repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the sen=\r\nses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and=\r\n find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain in a state wh=\r\nere there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object is possible.\n =\r\n\nSuch a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, S=\r\nhirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also experi=\r\nenced it.\n \nRishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are=\r\n always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of=\r\n duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcome=\r\ns attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much =\r\ndo anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, =\r\nit means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for p=\r\nersonal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implem=\r\nents the wish of nature through one&#39;s actions, which are performed without =\r\nany attachment or personal identification. One who has a personal ego can d=\r\no limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. On=\r\ne who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are de=\r\nsired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can change the co=\r\nurse of history of nations and planets.\n \nA rishi in this state may engage =\r\nin various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no att=\r\nachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.\n \n=\r\nIf one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman=\r\n forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unm=\r\nanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he wi=\r\nll freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such =\r\na rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as a process runn=\r\ning in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task.=\r\n Even if the computer process has finished all the initialization and early=\r\n work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again.=\r\n Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process of over=\r\ncoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a Vivekananda is =\r\nborn from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overco=\r\nme the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an=\r\n ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.\n \nThus, a liber=\r\nated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with the forc=\r\ne of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nature perfo=\r\nrming actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego driving t=\r\nhose actions.\n \nBTW, Ramakrishna specifically said six of his disciples wer=\r\ne ever liberated.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe full message can be read at:\n=\r\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438\n&quot;Rishis&quot;\n \n*      =\r\n  *        *\n \n&gt; ..spiritual Guru of Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa..\n \nVasis=\r\nhtha, Viswamitra and Rama were all gyanis.

One of them is wrong (or per=\r\nhaps both!). Another good saint \n&gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnati=\r\non of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said \n&gt; &gt; that he identified a particular=\r\n young man as the reincarnation of Swami \n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was =\r\nsurrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty \n&gt; &gt; disciples of a very hig=\r\nh caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they nearly \n&gt; &gt; moulded the d=\r\nirection of spiritual India for the next century. None of the \n&gt; &gt; claimant=\r\ns of rebirthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the \n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nill.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is a powerful and logically correct observation by Nar=\r\nasimha. Anyone who \n&gt; &gt; claims to be Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada, MUST BE asso=\r\nciated and surrounded by a \n&gt; &gt; bunch of ATLEAST 15/20 very high caliber sa=\r\ndhakas.=C3=82  These very high caliber \n&gt; &gt; sadhakas=C3=82 who will surroun=\r\nd a reborn Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada will each be like \n&gt; &gt; spiritual stalwa=\r\nrts in their own rights, like each of Ramakrishna and Ma \n&gt; &gt; Sarada&#39;s disc=\r\niples were (Swami Brahmananda, Swami Premananda, Swami Sivananda \n&gt; &gt; etc e=\r\ntc) when they had=C3=82 incarnated. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So unless this condition is m=\r\net, (which Ramakrishna himself had specified in his \n&gt; &gt; last birth), most =\r\nof the Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada reincarnation-claimants have \n&gt; &gt; to be dis=\r\n-qualified. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some people have an impression that if and when Ramak=\r\nrishna and Ma Sarada and \n&gt; &gt; Swamiji reincarnate, they would have an assoc=\r\niation with the Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; Mission. This is, in my opinion, an incorr=\r\nect assumption. When Lord Krishna was \n&gt; &gt; born, he did not spend his time =\r\ntrying to find out where is Ayodhya since he \n&gt; &gt; was=C3=82 also=C3=82 Lord=\r\n Rama is his=C3=82 past life. Similarly,=C3=82 these souls (Ramakrishna and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Ma=C3=82 Sarada and their disciples)=C3=82 are of such high caliber t=\r\nhat they do come back \n&gt; &gt; when it is designed and needed for them to come =\r\nback and perform some strong \n&gt; &gt; objectives and set in motion a spiritual =\r\nimpulse in this land based on the \n&gt; &gt; necessities of the specific desh-kaa=\r\nl-patra. Therefore what they do will be \n&gt; &gt; based purely on the zeitgeist =\r\n- spirit of the times - when they incarnate.=C3=82  For \n&gt; &gt; all one knows,=\r\n Ramakrishna may not incarnate as a simple rustic villager any \n&gt; &gt; more, b=\r\nut rather=C3=82 as a well-educated,=C3=82 city-bred individual with the pra=\r\nctical \n&gt; &gt; intelligence of ten Chanakyas who might end up changing the pol=\r\nitical and \n&gt; &gt; spiritual future of this land for centuries to come, which =\r\nis what the necessity \n&gt; &gt; of the present=C3=82 times really are. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n We already have an overdose of Swamis and Babas and Mas and Bhagwans and t=\r\nheir \n&gt; &gt; ashrams and their teeming millions as followers. What we need is =\r\nsomeone who=C3=82 may \n&gt; &gt; or may not have an ashram, who may or may not po=\r\nse as a Guru in the traditional \n&gt; &gt; sense, who may or may not be a glib ta=\r\nlker (as so many of the Babas and Mas are \n&gt; &gt; these days), but who has the=\r\n necessary might and power to affect or initiate \n&gt; &gt; changes in this land =\r\nwhich would be of an irrevocable nature.=C3=82  It is time for a \n&gt; &gt; 1000 =\r\nyears of history to change. And only a soul of Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada&#39;s \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; caliber can do it. Anyone lesser, would only fizz out=C3=82 with time.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Not that=C3=82 they (Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C3=82 Swamiji) w=\r\nill find the work to be \n&gt; &gt; easy at all. For startes, the dunces would be =\r\nin confederacy against them. When \n&gt; &gt; Vivekanada, before he became world f=\r\namous, had gone to Kasi, he was bitterly \n&gt; &gt; opposed by the &#39;scholarly&#39; pa=\r\nndits of the city on various issues. Then a young \n&gt; &gt; not-yet-famous Vivek=\r\nananda got angry and decided he will leave Kasi and never \n&gt; &gt; return to th=\r\nat city untill he &quot;falls on society like a thunderbolt&quot;. Well, that \n&gt; &gt; is=\r\n precisely what he did. He fell on Indian society like a thunderbolt, after=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; which those very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, asking him to come and=\r\n grace \n&gt; &gt; their city! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So let us keep our fingers crossed and no=\r\nt=C3=82 focus on emtpy speculations, rather \n&gt; &gt; wait for the most interest=\r\ning coming=C3=82 decade to unfold in all its=C3=82 sound and fury.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, w=\r\nhat would be your name and religion and nationality\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Name can chang=\r\ne on rebirth. Though religion usually stays the same, it CAN \n&gt; &gt; change. N=\r\nationality can of course change too. Job, skills, external nature, \n&gt; &gt; loo=\r\nks, gender, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can all change=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; from birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Basically, the seed of one&#39;s new birth =\r\nis formed at the time of one&#39;s death. As \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s connection is severed w=\r\nith the body, the last desires/thoughts/ponderings \n&gt; &gt; of the mind become =\r\nthe seed for the next life. Nature chooses for one a future \n&gt; &gt; course tha=\r\nt allows one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; prev=\r\nious karmas and debts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one is able to not entertain ANY desire =\r\nas one element after another \n&gt; &gt; evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one become=\r\ns liberated. All the spiritual sadhana \n&gt; &gt; we do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; when we see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nhall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If I and you like each ot=\r\nher and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, \n&gt; &gt; they will start o=\r\nff taking a liking to each other. If I and you dislike each \n&gt; &gt; other and =\r\nyour rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they will start off \n&gt; &gt; disli=\r\nking each other. This will happen without either being consciously aware of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; who one was and who the other person was, in the last life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nInstead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and so person is =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so person is a rebirth of Param=\r\nahamsa \n&gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reborn perso=\r\nn may not look like the old person or do similar work or have \n&gt; &gt; much *ex=\r\nternal* similarity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; one. After all, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna had thou=\r\nsands \n&gt; &gt; of wives. Rama was a great warrior and killed Ravana in the bigg=\r\nest war of his \n&gt; &gt; times. Krishna was a key player in the biggest war of h=\r\nis time, but did not take \n&gt; &gt; a weapon at all. The game can be diffent in =\r\neach coming..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When it comes to recognizing the rebi=\r\nrth of a great soul, it can become a trap.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna explicitly =\r\ntold Sarada Mata that he would be back after 100 years \n&gt; &gt; and that everyb=\r\nody else who came with him would have to come back with him. When \n&gt; &gt; Sara=\r\nda Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did not have a choice! Eve=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once more. =\r\nThe Master \n&gt; &gt; said I am to come back once more with him&quot;. When questioned=\r\n &quot;you have to come \n&gt; &gt; back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied,=\r\n &quot;souls like that have great \n&gt; &gt; power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ramak=\r\nrishna said that people would get \n&gt; &gt; liberated en masse during his next c=\r\noming and that would be the last opportunity \n&gt; &gt; for a long time to come.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of Ra=\r\nmakrishna \n&gt; &gt; since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another=\r\n good saint \n&gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. S=\r\natya Sai Baba said \n&gt; &gt; that he identified a particular young man as the re=\r\nincarnation of Swami \n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada=\r\n Mata and more than twenty \n&gt; &gt; disciples of a very high caliber and differ=\r\nent aptitudes. Together, they nearly \n&gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritua=\r\nl India for the next century. None of the \n&gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are=\r\n surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the \n&gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, =\r\nthere can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It is not =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themselves and of cou=\r\nrse ego is \n&gt; &gt; the root of delusion!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, is it necessary to =\r\nrecognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X \n&gt; &gt; and Y are differen=\r\nt and play a different game? A small discussion on this point \n&gt; &gt; vis-a-vi=\r\ns Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though ex=\r\nternal factors like nationality, religion, name, job, looks, gender etc \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; can change, some internal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who one =\r\nlikes, \n&gt; &gt; who one dislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, e=\r\ntc, may remain \n&gt; &gt; essentially the same.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For example, suppose raj=\r\nput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim emperor Akbar \n&gt; &gt; (as said by Vim=\r\nalananda). One was a Hindu and the other was a Muslim. However, \n&gt; &gt; both w=\r\nere very brave, unafraid of death, inherently spiritual, had a refined \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous connections with =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised when his mother was hi=\r\nding at a \n&gt; &gt; rajput household, before moving to Delhi. Despite being a Mu=\r\nslim, he actually \n&gt; &gt; helped the Hindu causes (to the extent possible at t=\r\nhat time) by putting an end \n&gt; &gt; to barbaric practices like killing defeate=\r\nd Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in \n&gt; &gt; conquered places. He promoted a=\r\ncceptance of other faiths, canceled pilgrimage \n&gt; &gt; taxes on Hindus and eve=\r\nn came up with his own religion of humanity towards the \n&gt; &gt; end of his lif=\r\ne by integrating various religions. In one life, he tried to save \n&gt; &gt; Indi=\r\na from invading barbarians. In another, he was born as a cultured man amid =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; barbarians and tried to save India by changing the ways of his own peo=\r\nple.
