Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; We tell a young student to study well and get good sc=\r\nores in examinations. We tell him that he should go to so and so institutio=\r\nn (e.g. IIT, IISc, , REC, IIM etc). But we know that going to IIT or gettin=\r\ng 90% score in exams is NOT the goal of education. The goal of education is=\r\n to understand the subject well and have a good career. It is possible to g=\r\net 90% score without understanding well and it is possible to go to IIT and=\r\n not understand the subject well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, the goal of spiritual sad=\r\nhana is to get better control over mind, overcome the internal enemies as m=\r\nuch as possible and become liberated. But, we tell people to do so and so r=\r\nituals, follow so and so procedures/formulas, go to so and so temple etc.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Some formulas were created so that there is some structure to sadhana. =\r\nBut there is nothing absolute about those formulas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, if your gurus=\r\n told you the formula of n times japam, n/10 times homam, n/100 times tarpa=\r\nna etc and you want to follow it, please do so. No harm in it. Some people =\r\nbelieve that such a procedure gives &quot;siddhi&quot; in a mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, ple=\r\nase note that there are many people who did purascharanas using such formul=\r\nas and did not really get any &quot;siddhi&quot; in the mantra. On the other hand, th=\r\nere are people who did not stick to those formulas and yet found god throug=\r\nh the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opinion, you can do just japam with a mantra witho=\r\nut worrying about 1/10th count homam, 1/100th count tarpana etc. Or you can=\r\n also do a mantra entirely in homam without any japam or tarpana. Choose on=\r\ne practice and do it until your mind is so absorbed in it that your mind is=\r\n chanting that mantra sub-consciously when it is free (like some people hum=\r\n catchy songs when they are free).\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding the =\r\nastrological formulas for evaluating the impact of a mantra, I would like d=\r\nisown those concepts originally taught by Pt Sanjay Rath and shared by me i=\r\nn my astrology classes. There are many technicalities, but many many corrup=\r\ntions in the way knowledge is preserved. Most rules and technicalities of m=\r\nantra shashtra apply to people who do prayogas to get specific material res=\r\nults (and naturally those rules have been intentionally corrupted by Nature=\r\n in preparation of deepening Kali).\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that a mantra done f=\r\nor spiritual progress works based on your mental visualization of the mantr=\r\na and its deity and the latent forces of conditioning in your mind. All the=\r\n house calculations based on the numbers of letters and number of words are=\r\n irrelevant. Moreover, a veda mantra like Gayatri mantra can be done by any=\r\none without worrying about technicalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding adding &quot;Om&quot; or &quot;O=\r\nm Bhur bhuvas suvah&quot; or Om bhuh om bhuvah om suvah om mahah..&quot; etc, there a=\r\nre many standard approaches. I suggest using what you were taught by your g=\r\nurus and not worrying too much about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal as=\r\nked about count vs time. Counts sometimes force people to speed things up. =\r\nIn my humble opinion, it is fine or even better to set a time limit (e.g. o=\r\nne hour, two hours etc) and do japam for that time irrespective of the coun=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://Sar=\r\naswatiFilms.org \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 1/20/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; From: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: =\r\nRepost:Manishji&#39;s savitur gayatri sadhana procedure\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, January 20, 2010, 11:47 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Narasimha=\r\ngaru, \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thank you for such a nice explanation. Even with not main=\r\ntaining Brahmacharya, I could see significant progress in terms of my contr=\r\nol of temper etc. when I did Gayatri Japam in the past. Did not know the si=\r\ngnificance of Brahmacharya then (in future I will practise with Brahmachary=\r\na) . But the way I did was it was one a lakh purascharana (daily 1000-3000 =\r\ntimes) for a period of two months and then I did a homam to complete the da=\r\nsamsa in homam. For the homam, however, I have called about 10 people (Grih=\r\nastas / Brahmacharis altogether) and we all did chant the mantra while I pe=\r\nrformed the homam. This is how our Sharmaji instructed us to do. So, is a D=\r\nasamsa homam, satamsa for tarpanam, sahasramsa for marjanam and finally das=\r\namsa of shasramsa for feeding the number of brahmins (so basically, for a l=\r\naksha Gayatri, 10 brahmins must be fed, to finish the ritual of purascharan=\r\na) . This is how I thought the big japams must be done. Can you shed more l=\r\night on\n&gt;  this? \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Also, Gayatri mantra is a 24 syllable mantra s=\r\ntarting with tatsavitur.. .., but if the vyahritis are added it becomes a 3=\r\n0 letter mantra (om bhur bhu va ssu vah=C2=A0). How should this be practise=\r\nd? 30, I suppose strengthens the 6th house, whereas the 24 strengthens the =\r\n12th house, according to your explanation? Sorry for digressing into astrol=\r\nogy ! (but they are tightly integrated here and could not avoid this questi=\r\non). Please tell me if my interpretation is right and also please tell me w=\r\nhich approach is better. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 1/20/10, Naras=\r\nimha P.V.R.

Lik=\r\ne that, do for 3 stretches of 100 days each.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if needs no br=\r\neak, one can do 300 days in a row too. But, keeping brahmacharya (abstinenc=\r\ne) may be difficult for some people and hence the suggestion of the break.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; For success in any sadhana, brahmacharya is very important. Restraint =\r\nfrom sex and control of anger and short-temper will help one avoid leakage =\r\nof shakti (purifying energy). Everytime one experiences lust, anger etc, on=\r\ne loses some shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every factor contributes a little to success. Bea=\r\nrd is useful. The tradition of growing beard exists in many religions and i=\r\nt is not without a reason. We discussed this sometime back.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one is =\r\nliving a lifestyle where one avoids\n&gt;  contact with any tempting situations=\r\n altogether (e.g. living in a remote monastery), beard may or may not add m=\r\nuch value. But, if one is living a lifestyle where one comes in contact wit=\r\nh tempting situations regularly (e.g. living in the modern world with a fam=\r\nily and job and a TV), beard can be very useful. As I said earlier when we =\r\ndiscussed this, beard is not the complete solution but a small part of the =\r\nsolution. Just as a railing on the side of a hill road may stop a slowly mo=\r\nving car from sliding off the hill at night but be unable to stop a fast mo=\r\nving car out of control, similarly a beard can help a person with decent co=\r\nntrol over the mind to retain control in some tricky situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Trimm=\r\ning beard is ok.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; If one indeed does 1000 times G=\r\nayatri (or any mantra for a couple of hours) everyday for one year while ma=\r\nintaining brahmacharya,\n&gt;  \n&gt; while following the simple rules of same plac=\r\ne, same time everyday and facing the same direction, one will certainly mak=\r\ne good progress. Brahmacharya is one key thing and sitting still with an er=\r\nect back, neck and head with the eyes closed is the other thing. The probab=\r\nility of mind becoming still is almost zero if the body is not still. If th=\r\ne body can be kept very still, there is a chance that mind will also become=\r\n still for a moment. If the mind is still for even a moment, it will cause =\r\ngreat bliss. As mind gets more used to being still, it will become still mo=\r\nre often and for longer times.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person=\r\nality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(De=\r\nvata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity co=\r\nmmanding a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or =\r\nbe it that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is cruc=\r\nial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself,=\r\n so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolu=\r\ntion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 acco=\r\nrding to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your =\r\nShakti and deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKa=\r\nli, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( P=\r\nrovided you have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhak=\r\na joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Mu=\r\nni goes to a separate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Attackin=\r\ng such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of th=\r\ne attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pata=\r\nn comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;  Sha=\r\nkti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bla=\r\nck magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nomebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nleft, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not be free of identification wi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are those which are generally termed=\r\n as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join the same spirits\n&gt;  which =\r\nthey have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, th=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sad=\r\nhak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his prev=\r\nious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only=\r\n in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra=\r\n are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; According to=\r\n me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an e=\r\nasy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, d=\r\no 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayat=\r\nri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same\n&gt;  place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Same=\r\n direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha o=\r\nr Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mi=\r\nnd and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole =\r\nprocedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality before and =\r\nafter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, =\r\nso do some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is p=\r\nhysically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies some of the concepts =\r\nwhich were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmanish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a\n&gt;  clarification from me if=\r\n you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The INTERNET now has a=\r\n personality.
