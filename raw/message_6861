It has been a long standin=\r\ng wish of mine to do homam regularly. However there are some practical prob=\r\nlems. \n\n1 Can I do a homam inside the house? I am wondering if the smoke wo=\r\nuld raise the fire alarm etc. In summer, though it is terribly hot here, I =\r\ncan still afford to open the windows. In winter this is next to impossible.=\r\n I am not worried abt my home catching fire, but I am worried abt the fire =\r\nsafety alarm. The leasing office levies hefty fines for violating fire safe=\r\nty rules.\n\n2 Do you know any place in US where I can find a small homa kund=\r\na and other necessary items? \n\nshubham bhavatu\n\nRamnath\n\n\n"}}
