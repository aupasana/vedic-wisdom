Although i am not able en=\r\nough to answer your query. but I want to remind you story of Churning of oc=\r\nean. Please remember that I may be wrong so please ignore if you think so.\n=\r\n\nWhen ocean was churned, by devas and devatas, by placing Meru parvat on ba=\r\nck of Kurmavtar. First thing which came out was &#39;halahal&#39;. The poison.\n\nThi=\r\ns terrified both Gods and demons, halahal was so toxicating that the whole =\r\nworld began trembling. Then Lord Shiva came to rescue and because of compas=\r\nsion Lord Shiva swallowed the poison. Although the poison was stuck, no whe=\r\nre to go. So it didnt harmed either Shiva or Srishti.\n\nAfter that other rat=\r\nnas and ultimately amrita came out.\n\nIMHO, same is happening to you. You ne=\r\ned to request to Lord Shiva to swallow this poison so that your srishti is =\r\nspared. As you know, Lord shiva rules tamas guna, and meditates on kailash =\r\nparvat, coldest place. He is sitting with his eyes closed. \n\nYou also need =\r\nto do the same. Swallow this poison. neither let it enter your stomach nor =\r\nlet it come out. Simply close your eyes and be cool. Means accept this pois=\r\non, and also accept it that this is reality. You can not change it. Bad thi=\r\nngs happen to every one. After you accept, you need to ignore it. close you=\r\nr eyes toward these. if you do not swallow and ignore this poison, this poi=\r\nson may harm and derail you from your sadhna.\n\nAfter Shiva swallowed posion=\r\n, he felt extreme burning sensation. you may also feel the same. that burni=\r\nng sensation was relieved by drinking milk. Milk signifies love and knowled=\r\nge.\n\nI may have committed many mistakes in this message. please pardon me f=\r\nor mistakes. i hope senior and able members will rectify my mistakes.\n\nKind=\r\n Regards\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks for your response.

Most of them are premonitions of bad \n&gt; &gt;ev=\r\nents(fire,train derailment,murder,kidnapping etc) going to happen around th=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;world. The fear tension that gropes around a person when he is kidnap=\r\nped or \n&gt; &gt;murdered etc runs through my body.
