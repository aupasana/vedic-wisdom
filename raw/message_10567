Then it is highly unlikely th=\r\nat I will, again in that life, have knowledge about mantras etc. People lar=\r\ngely do not even believe in mantras, even many so called modern Hindus do n=\r\not believe that mantras can cause spiritual and worldly benefits. And I am =\r\nvery sure that it is their own karma. Plus mantras, shastras are getting mo=\r\nre and more corrupt, altered day by day and good books on these subjects ar=\r\ne also being fewer and fewer. So if I am born after 100, 200 or 500 or 1,00=\r\n0 years, it is highly unlikely that I will be blessed chanting mantras agai=\r\nn.\n\nBut I have a strong desire for doing mantras and Jyotish every birth. S=\r\nince we know that births are based on desire, can my strong desire lead my =\r\nnext births in such a direction that I can do mantras in next birth also?\n\n=\r\nPlus, what can I do to make sure that I will come to know about Vedas, Vedi=\r\nc mantras etc. in the next birth? If this desire continues all my life and =\r\nall my life I do mantras and homam regularly, will it be enough to bless me=\r\n with the same type of knowledge (and opportunity) in the next birth also? =\r\nI just want to make sure that I get to know about mantras, homam etc. in ne=\r\nxt birth and esp. from a good, authentic source.\n\nThanks\nTanvir\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0029_01D00EE4.EA54C220\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: &#39;Arial&#39;; COLOR: #800080; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Namaste Narasi=\r\nmha ji and everyone.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I have a question about next life.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/S=\r\nTRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;I actually feel very lucky and blessed to k=\r\nnow about and chant \ndifferent Sanskrit mantras, stotrams, namavali etc. Al=\r\nso I feel myself lucky \nfrom most for being able to read Vedic horoscope to=\r\n some degree.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRON=\r\nG&gt;Suppose I do enough good karma for being born next time as a human. \nThen=\r\n it is highly unlikely that I will, again in that life, have knowledge abou=\r\nt \nmantras etc. People largely do not even believe in mantras, even many so=\r\n called \nmodern Hindus do not believe that mantras can cause spiritual and =\r\nworldly \nbenefits.
