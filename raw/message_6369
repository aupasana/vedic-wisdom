Today, by =\r\ncreationist, people generally mean someone who accepts that God, or some ot=\r\nher intelligent being or beings, has something to do with the origin of lif=\r\ne and the universe, with the order and complexity that we observe around us=\r\n. So I accept that. Until fairly recently, when people used the term creati=\r\nonist, they generally meant a Biblical creationist. So although I am a crea=\r\ntionist, my ideas are inspired by my studies in the Vedic literature. There=\r\nfore some people call me a Vedic creationist. I prefer being called a Vedic=\r\n creationist over being called a Hindu creationist. The word Hindu does not=\r\n appear in the ancient Sanskrit writings of India. It is a term that came i=\r\nnto use a few hundred years ago.\n\n\nhttp://www.thedailybell.com/2366/Michael=\r\n-Cremo-on-Forbidden-Archeology-Our-Billion-Year-Old-Human-History-and-the-S=\r\npiritual-Satisfaction-of-the-Vedas.html\n\n\n\n\n"}}
