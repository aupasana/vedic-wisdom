He does mention about his\n&gt; &gt; prevoius =\r\nbirth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also \n&gt; confirmed\n&gt; &gt; the same=\r\n thing. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized \nsaint \n&gt; too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and \n&gt; Naamdev=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and also many other saints too. The initiation he got on the \nbank \n&gt; =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has described very\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\nccurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. \nHe \n&gt; had\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a \nfantastic\n&gt; &gt; =\r\norator. His followers have done a very good job of putting up \nthe \n&gt; web\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; site and sharing the information for free both audio and books.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Chiti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, \n&gt; Ramakrishna\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; may have taken birth as more than one person and in future may \ntake\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n more births.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name othe=\r\nrs use \npardon \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manife=\r\nst from time \nto \n&gt; time\n&gt; &gt; After reading this and other books, I feel tha=\r\nt each one of us \nhas \n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; inner guru along with our atma and this inne=\r\nr guru in \nconjunction \n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; our accumulated or sanchit sankaras give=\r\n us visions of these \n&gt; mahatmas\n&gt; &gt; or help us attach or attract to a Sain=\r\nt or some aspects of the \n&gt; saint\n&gt; &gt; more than others. This inner guru is =\r\nthe same in all humam \nbeings \n&gt; but\n&gt; &gt; manifests uniquely based on each p=\r\nerson. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also believe that one needs to get initiated by a Guru w=\r\nho is\n&gt; &gt; present in physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There are many instances of other forms of inititations like\n&gt; &gt; initi=\r\nation in dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms \nof\n&gt; &gt; initiati=\r\nons though very important are very rare or uncommon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After reading=\r\n Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up \nin \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; mind about =\r\nhim.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have guided =\r\nmany\n&gt; &gt; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the \n&gt; book\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; about it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after \n&gt; that=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of \n&gt; givi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; spirtual talks? It seems unusual.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have also read somewher=\r\ne that once a person reaches a spiritual\n&gt; &gt; state, he cannot remain in hum=\r\nan body for more than few days, \nwas \n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; the case?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; May be =\r\nothers who have read this book can share more light.\n&gt; &gt; I do recommend to =\r\nseekers of spirutuality to read this book if \none \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; time, it is av=\r\nailable for free to download as a pdf book on his \n&gt; web site.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri=\r\n Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment and\n&gt; &gt; upliftme=\r\nnt, a lot of his information is wellknown.

There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to \n&gt; Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off=\r\nice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teleph=\r\none\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. \n&gt;=\r\n Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 \nshri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was=\r\n always \n&gt; talking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by d=\r\nay. There was a weekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA=\r\n. He was singing devotional songs \n&gt; created \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was =\r\nweeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 =\r\nto 12 youngsters were attending this \nweekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Satu=\r\nrday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was \nof \n&gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then=\r\n. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after \nduty \n&gt; hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea =\r\nshore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest ha=\r\nve come to my home and my wife is remembering \nme. \n&gt; My \n&gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go \n&gt; now=E2=80=9D.=\r\n -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call hi=\r\nm. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a \n&gt; pl=\r\nane \n&gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much i=\r\nmpressed \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day =\r\nI had to go to Dwarka \nby \n&gt; Bus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go throu=\r\ngh bus, as bus tire will be \npunctured. \n&gt; Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus statio=\r\nn but bus did not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the w=\r\nay. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe th=\r\nat he had some \nsuper \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishande=\r\nv worship only. I was \n&gt; attracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I though=\r\nt, I should also be disciple of \n&gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It=\r\n was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I \n&gt; surrendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at =\r\nMr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I \n&gt; prayed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow \n&gt; his \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at =\r\n6.10 \n&gt; morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from =\r\n7 am I \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in =\r\nthe morning that I \n&gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurude=\r\nv. My wife was \nannoyed \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =EF=\r\n=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a \n&gt; hasty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decisio=\r\nn?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. \n&gt; =\r\nHe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who =\r\ncan guide \n&gt; us, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Di=\r\nxa from Shri Ram \nSharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri=\r\n Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as peop=\r\nle in general \n&gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confus=\r\ned. I thought-- yes I have \n&gt; taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the in=\r\nfluence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told m=\r\ne that Thakur was \n&gt; telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before acc=\r\nepting him. I also \n&gt; decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur.
