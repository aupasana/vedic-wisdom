Sometimes the Indian Store will ca=\r\nrry a specialized base of granite or other stone to act as Homam Kunda base=\r\n\n\n2) If the above is not available, try putting a regular Homam Kunda in be=\r\ntween two bricks or tiles or you can even put a copper plate underneath the=\r\n homam.  \n\n3) Under the Homam Kunda and the base or copper plate for added =\r\nprotection keep silver foil to catch material which drops out by mistake an=\r\nd to protect carpet\n\n4) Dry coconut alone produces least smoke.  Hawan Sama=\r\ngri and Hawan Wood are good but they will create smoke so if you plan to us=\r\ne the latter make sure you have adequate ventilation.  If you live in a col=\r\nd place and the rooms are closed then dry coconut may be best\n\n5) With dry =\r\ncoconut, smoke only comes in the end when the coconut is fully burned by th=\r\ne Homam Agni.  By experience you will know when that is about to happen and=\r\n just before then you can take the Homam Kunda and place it in a place outs=\r\nide.  I live in a place which gets lots of snow around the year so I take t=\r\nhe Homam Kunda to the outside patio just before it extinguishes and gives o=\r\nut maximum smoke\n\nRegards\n\nVeenu\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Padma=\r\nja Sunchu &lt;padmaja.sunchu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namasthe\n&gt; \n&gt; Some of mine on the=\r\n first experience -\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

I planned to do the homam weekly on ever=\r\ny sunday and finished\n&gt; &gt; two weeks so far.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Here is how it went.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1st Homam : Was extremely nervous on whether I will be able to sucuss=\r\nfully\n&gt; &gt; complete my long cherished dream of performing Ganapathi homam. c=\r\nommitted\n&gt; &gt; lot of mistakes in mantras ,did not say Svahaa at the right pl=\r\naces, lighting\n&gt; &gt; fire etc may be because of my nervousness probably , bur=\r\nnt my finger while\n&gt; &gt; putting ahuti into the fire (surprisingly unlike mos=\r\nt of the other burn\n&gt; &gt; wounds , this did not last for more than 3 hours.. =\r\nusually a burn would stay\n&gt; &gt; for more than 2-3 days...and also i realised =\r\nthat i had burnt my finger only\n&gt; &gt; when my wife pointed it to me.. i assum=\r\ne this is a good sign :) ).. I\n&gt; &gt; sincerely prayed during the Homam conclu=\r\nsion to be forgiven for all the\n&gt; &gt; mistakes commited during the homam..\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2nd Homam: This time I was very relaxed and took my owm time to make =\r\nsure\n&gt; &gt; that I dont make any mistakes.. the homam fire burnt peacefully an=\r\nd I did\n&gt; &gt; not hurt myself..I was told by my wife that the room was full o=\r\nf smoke which\n&gt; &gt; made breathing difficult and we even had couple of neighb=\r\nours at our\n&gt; &gt; doorsteps enquiring about the smoke. But again surprisingly=\r\n I never felt the\n&gt; &gt; slightest of discomfort even though I was nearest to =\r\nthe homam...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So as told by many members in the group , its only pra=\r\nctice that makes one\n&gt; &gt; perfect.. I am very happy that I have come across =\r\nthis group and under ur\n&gt; &gt; guidance I am sure eveybody will be benefited i=\r\nn sadhana through homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Girish Sundaram\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
