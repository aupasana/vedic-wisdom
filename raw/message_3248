The specific person I hav=\r\ne in mind is Pandit Gopi Krishna (http://www.om-guru.com/html/saints/gopi.h=\r\ntml), the most well known person in modern times to have raised his Kundali=\r\nni, and documented it. In his book, it is clearly indicated that at one poi=\r\nnt, he was virtually at the point of death and was saved when he ate (proba=\r\nbly several times - maybe even consistently after that) some Kashmiri meat =\r\ndish. I dont have the book in front of me, but he had indicated that at tha=\r\nt stage of development, he could barely eat a few spoonfuls of rice and som=\r\ne milk (in the entire day), after which he was immediately enveloped in som=\r\ne sort of searing pain related to Kundalini. But upon eating the Kashmiri m=\r\neat dish, the pain subsided, his appetite increased, and he was quickly on =\r\nthe road to recovery. You might dismiss his level of spiritual development,=\r\n but if you simply read the link about his experiences, it might make you t=\r\nhink twice about that conclusion..\n\n Separately, I have heard from some &quot;en=\r\nlightened&quot; Buddhist types, who didnt know anything about Gopi Krishna, also=\r\n say the same thing. \n\n I&#39;m only throwing in this information into the mix =\r\n- I havent formed a strong opinion myself..\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pvr108&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; I have been extremely busy at work for a while now and will continue to =\r\nbe, working long hours everyday. I just saw a few mails from the vegetarian=\r\nism thread. Just a few quick points.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Self-i=\r\ndentification of human beings and animals with body and body parts is much =\r\nmuch stronger and denser than that of plants and trees. Self-identification=\r\n of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is pluc=\r\nked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very =\r\nsubtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a huma=\r\nn being, the emotion experienced is much stronger. Even after death, an ani=\r\nmal may identify with the body and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The kaarmik de=\r\nbt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the animal&#39;s mind conside=\r\nrs as a part of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaar=\r\nmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits of a plant or a tree=\r\n or killing bacteria.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As long as we live in a physical body, creation=\r\n of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we=\r\n create newly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; You are what you eat. Our bo=\r\ndy and various chemicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Meat is highly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It inc=\r\nreases ego and identification with body and makes spiritual progress more d=\r\nifficult. After all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly at=\r\ntached to its body, the quality of body attachment will become denser in on=\r\ne. This is not conducive to spiritual progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; It is possible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and yet remai=\r\nned fully saattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a person. One w=\r\nanting to overcome identification with the body and make spiritual progress=\r\n, is better off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, greens, gr=\r\nains etc with mild spices).\n&gt;  \n&gt; If a meat-eating person stops eating meat=\r\n and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for protein) for seve=\r\nral months, while trying to read spiritual literature and trying to make sp=\r\niritual progress, one will see that it makes a big difference.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked d=\r\neer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misguided prop=\r\naganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes from class=\r\nics or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nSwami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to=\r\n be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat. I=\r\nt is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;     =\r\n              http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a diffe=\r\nrence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
