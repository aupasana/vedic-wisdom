Vedic \n&gt; philosophy is\n&gt; right handed and tantaric philosophy is left handed.\n\nAll tantrik philosophy is NOT left handed. There are right handed \ntantras as well as left handed tantras. You are totally off the mark.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Correct procedure of performing a tamasik homa is that native collect \n&gt; wood of\n&gt; some tamasik tree such as babool, kikar then tantarick must arrange \n&gt; all tamasik\n&gt; offering such a mensulation blood, flesh, fish, alchoal, some kind of \n&gt; tamasik\n&gt; oil etc. It is also essential that sadhak must be of tamasik \n&gt; temperament must\n&gt; consume alcohol, meat himself. He must have very active sex life. Now \n&gt; such a\n&gt; native must choose mantras of tamasik deity and perform this homa in \n&gt; the middle\n&gt; of night when tamo guna is maximum and he must face south direction.\n\nDo you consider Rudra, Durga and Chandi as &quot;taamasik deities&quot;? If I want \nto worship Rudra with Rudra Namaka Prasna (from YajurVeda) or Durga with \nDurga Sooktam (from RigVeda) or Chandi with Devi Sooktam (from RigVeda), \nare you suggesting that I should do all of the above???!\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe above is utter nonsense.\n\nFirst of all, those who want to understand the gunas composing deities, \nhumans and demons should read Yoga Vaasishtham. Vasishtha defines a 3x3 \nmatrix of gunas and places various kinds of deities, humans and demons \nin that. His description removes a lot of misconceptions on &quot;tamasik \ndeities&quot; etc.\n\nSecond of all, the above is saying that the only way to worship some \nfierce deities (let me use this term instead of tamasik deities) is \nthrough vaama maarga (left-handed path). That is nonsense. Left-handed \npath is for those who are already so pure that even meat, fish, alcohol \nand sex do not distract one&#39;s focus from god and from the deep \nrealization that &quot;sarvam khalvidam brahma&quot;. It is not for all. As Robert \nSvoboda correctly says at the beginning of &quot;Aghora: At the left hand of \ngod&quot;, most people who are attracted to this path for the kick are doomed \nto fail and those who are pure enough for it are not attracted to it.\n\nFierce deities such as Rudra, Durga, Chandi etc can be worshipped in a \nsaattwik manner also and THAT is better for MOST people.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Narashima is very quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik \n&gt; literature\n&gt; and tamasik purans\n\nFirst of all, I quoted Vishnu Dharmottara Purana and Agni Purana! If \nAgni (Fire!) Purana is not an acceptable reference for homam, I wonder \nwhat is!\n\nSecond of all, the notion that some puranas are saattwik, some are \nrajasik and some are tamasik, was conjured by people who could not \nreconcile apparent contradictions within different puranas. If one \nunderstands the Upanishadic essence correctly, all contradictions fall \nin place and all puranas are meaningful.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Sattvik way of pleasing lord shiva is offering sattvik things to shiva \n&gt; lingam.\n\nIs Shiva a sattwik deity or a taamasik deity? If he is a taamasik deity, \nI thought your theory was that he should not be worshippe in a saattwik \nmanner! If he is a saattwik deity, what was your problem with a saattwik \nhomam to him? You lectured on the taamasik methods above!\n\nI see no consistency in your views and all I can see is stubborn \nmisconceptions.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; He is foolishly creating a new bread of homa where sattavic way are \n&gt; employed\n&gt; to perform homa of a tamasik deity. What he is teaching is not homa \n&gt; but a\n&gt; complete disaster.\n\nOn saattwik, raajasik and taamasik worships, see what Krishna says in \nBhagavad Gita. Just because you consider Rudra to be tamasik, worship of \nRudra for spiritual progress does not become taamasik. Just because we \nconsider Vishnu to be saattwik, worship of Vishnu for the death of an \nenemy does not become saattwik. Nature of worship is decided based on \nthe desires, attitude and state of mind. See what Krishna teaches.\n\nWe do not cater to those who want to do homam for taamasik purposes, no \nmatter which deity. We cater to people worshipping various deities for \nmostly saattwik purposes, viz fulfilling dharmik desires at the material \nlevel and progressing spiritually. So the procedure we teach IS \ninvariable saattwik.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spiritual practices should be \n&gt; followed\n&gt; under the guidance of a bonafide guru. A native without a capable guru \n&gt; is\n&gt; like god without power.\n\nThose who want a physical guru can think of me or my guru Dr Manish \nPandit as gurus for the homam procedures taught by us in free manuals. \nIf you are doing something wrong because of my instruction, I am willing \nto take on the karma and suffer the consequences.\n\nThe original purohit and the original guru of Veda is Agni, the Fire. If \nyou do not have a capable guru, take Agni as the guru, worship him \neveryday or every weekend and surrender to him. He will do the job of a \nguru and transform you. Anybody who says that is not possible does not \nknow the power of Agni! Fire ritual is not my creation. It was the \nfavorite sadhana of rishis and many cultures benefited from it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Arun Yadav&quot; &lt;aruninthecity@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Jai Shree Ram,\n&gt;\n&gt; Shree A K Kaul Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s nice that you participate but try to understand the context only \n&gt; then you can bring something productive to the discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a way to perform spiritual sadhana which bring prosperity and \n&gt; happiness to the individual and to the people concerned. As a matter \n&gt; of fact all sadhanas are aimed towards strengthening the basic laws of \n&gt; nature. If a native with his deeds be able to strengthen these law he \n&gt; will be benefited and will rise in life.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are primary two way of doing any sadhana, one is sattavic and \n&gt; other is tamasik also known as right handed and left handed paths. \n&gt; Vedic philosophy is right handed and  tantaric philosophy is left \n&gt; handed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Correct procedure of performing a sattavic homa is that native \n&gt; collects dry mango tree wood since mango karaka is surya and thus is \n&gt; considered as most sattvic tree. Then native must arrange absolutely \n&gt; pure cow ghee. It is well known who sattavic cow ghee is; its many \n&gt; times pure then normal buffalo ghee. Then one collects other offering \n&gt; of absolutely sattavic in nature. It is also essential that sadhak \n&gt; must be of sattavic temperament and not accustomed to vices such as \n&gt; lying, cheating, consuming alcohol etc. If native is a brahmachari \n&gt; then it is very favorable. Now native must choose mantras of sattavic \n&gt; gods such as soma, agni, prajapati, indra, savitura etc. This homa \n&gt; must be is performed early in the morning since during this time \n&gt; sattva guna is maximum. Native should face east direction from where \n&gt; sun rises as sun is the harbinger of sattva guna. In the similar \n&gt; fashion many more rule exists which when followed correctly will \n&gt; result in a homa which will leave its everlasting impression on the \n&gt; native and will bring tremendous auspicious results.\n&gt;\n&gt; Correct procedure of performing a tamasik homa is that native collect \n&gt; wood of some tamasik tree such as babool, kikar then tantarick must \n&gt; arrange all tamasik offering such a mensulation blood, flesh, fish, \n&gt; alchoal, some kind of tamasik oil etc. It is also essential that \n&gt; sadhak must be of tamasik temperament must consume alcohol, meat \n&gt; himself. He must have very active sex life. Now such a native must \n&gt; choose mantras of tamasik deity and perform this homa in the middle of \n&gt; night when tamo guna is maximum and he must face south direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; These are some of very general rules of correctly performing both left \n&gt; handed and right handed homas. As a matter of fact, some rules are so \n&gt; cryptic and esoteric that native will only understand these as the \n&gt; merit of many lifetimes. These rules are kept as secret of utmost \n&gt; importance and only disciples of those traditions can come any closer \n&gt; to these rules. Kashmari tantrism is highly developed tradition and as \n&gt; you belong to this cult, you must be well aware about these delicacies \n&gt; of your tradition.\n&gt;\n&gt; Narashima is very quick to give reference of shiva homa in tantrik \n&gt; literature and tamasik purans; better if he can read these literatures \n&gt; more deeply and try to understand correct procedure to performing \n&gt; tamasik homa.\n&gt;\n&gt; He is foolishly creating a new bread of homa where sattavic way are \n&gt; employed to perform homa of a tamasik deity. What he is teaching is \n&gt; not homa but a complete disaster. Either he is deliberately mixing \n&gt; both left and right handed paths or he is intellectually week to \n&gt; differentiate between the two. Whatever is the reason, but he must \n&gt; stop doing this catastrophe. Based on his faith and believes he should \n&gt; either choose left or right handed path. He has no right to mix both \n&gt; of them and thus creating a recipe of disaster. Think about those poor \n&gt; soles that have been mentally, emotionally and spiritually harmed by \n&gt; performing this stupidity.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sattvik way of pleasing lord shiva is offering sattvik things to shiva \n&gt; lingam. This is most appropriate and beneficial way to receive \n&gt; blessings of lord shiva. For the same purpose millions of temples have \n&gt; been erected all over India.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Arun\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, AK Kaul &lt;jyotirved@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shri Arun Yadav ji,\n&gt;&gt; Jai Shri Ram!\n&gt;&gt; You appear to be eating a long yarn about a simple point that &quot;Lord \n&gt;&gt; Shiva is\n&gt;&gt; never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. Not a single\n&gt;&gt; scriptural reference could be found out where nativity performs Shiva \n&gt;&gt; homa\n&gt;&gt; to please lord Shiva&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; Since I was born and brought up in Kashmir, where Shiva is \n&gt;&gt; ishta-devata of\n&gt;&gt; most of Kashmiri Pandits, I can assure you that you are absolutely \n&gt;&gt; wrong in\n&gt;&gt; this respect!\n&gt;&gt; Even for those whose Ishta-Devata may not necessarily be Shiva (as in \n&gt;&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; case, since my ishta-devi is Maharjnya Bhagavati--known as\n&gt;&gt; ksheerabhavani---a cent per cent vegetarian goddess! at Tulamula---- \n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; Kashmir) on every Mahashivaratri, every Kashmiri Pandit performs \n&gt;&gt; certain\n&gt;&gt; homas, which are known as &#39;bali-vaishva-deva-yajnya&quot; etc..\n&gt;&gt;  And that is certainly prescribed in the sahstras!\n&gt;&gt; The following attachment in Hindi/Devanagri script about Shivaratri \n&gt;&gt; Puja in\n&gt;&gt; Kashmir will give you a very clear picture as to what I mean.\n&gt;&gt; All one can say is that to please Shiva (or any other deity for that\n&gt;&gt; matter!) it is not necessary to perform a homa as even a japa of &quot;Om \n&gt;&gt; Namah\n&gt;&gt; Shivaya&quot; mantra will yield the same---or maybe even better--results, \n&gt;&gt; if done\n&gt;&gt; with vishvas and bhakti, but that does not mean that homas cannot be\n&gt;&gt; performed for Shiva.\n&gt;&gt; Personally, I am most impressed by the shloka of the Gita (I do not \n&gt;&gt; remember\n&gt;&gt; the exact references!) that says, &quot;*patram pushpam phalam toyam yo me\n&gt;&gt; bhaktya prayachhati, tad-aham uphritam ashnaami bhaktya \n&gt;&gt; prayatatmanah&quot; * which\n&gt;&gt; means something like, &quot;If I am offered even a leaf or flower or \n&gt;&gt; fruits or\n&gt;&gt; water with love and devotion, I definitely EAT all those things as \n&gt;&gt; they have\n&gt;&gt; been offered with love&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; Need I say anything more!\n&gt;&gt; Jai Shri Ram!\n&gt;&gt; A K Kaul\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Arun Yadav&quot; &lt;aruninthecity@&gt; \n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; Jai Shree Rama,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear List,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I usually talk about the degeneration of intellect in kali yuga. In \n&gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; yuga\n&gt;&gt; tamo guna exists in predominance and sattva exists in very marginal \n&gt;&gt; potency.\n&gt;&gt; As\n&gt;&gt; is it impossible to see anything in darkness, people in kali yuga \n&gt;&gt; engage\n&gt;&gt; themselves in all kind of stupid and foolish things since these their\n&gt;&gt; intellect\n&gt;&gt; is blinded by the kalyugi darkness.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Things like erecting huge buildings which are destined to be \n&gt;&gt; shattered and\n&gt;&gt; ruined by natural calamities are being considered as object of pride. \n&gt;&gt; Even\n&gt;&gt; people feel proud to create weapons which are capable of destroying \n&gt;&gt; whole\n&gt;&gt; humanity within fractions of seconds.\n&gt;&gt; If one wants to be proud of anything be proud of an achievement which \n&gt;&gt; is not\n&gt;&gt; destined to be devastated by eternal time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; People are digging deep into earth to set free all evil sprits \n&gt;&gt; sleeping in\n&gt;&gt; deep\n&gt;&gt; realms of hell and using it as fuel as the cost of bringing hell on \n&gt;&gt; earth.\n&gt;&gt; To\n&gt;&gt; compensate for the loss these people have come up with a solution of \n&gt;&gt; wearing\n&gt;&gt; black, consuming alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee, chocolate and other \n&gt;&gt; such\n&gt;&gt; products.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Degenerated intellect has bring us to verge in the history that some \n&gt;&gt; people\n&gt;&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; promoting SHIVA HOMA since years and no one of these so called \n&gt;&gt; intellectual,\n&gt;&gt; scholars and people with wisdom (if anyone left) is coming forward \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; asking to\n&gt;&gt; stop this irreligious practice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s very unfortunate that people with no knowledge and understanding \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; divinity are promoting their irreligious believes without doing any \n&gt;&gt; research\n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; ancient Indian scriptures and gullible people are easily falling \n&gt;&gt; pray, more\n&gt;&gt; pathetic is that no one is coming forward and say that stop this \n&gt;&gt; nonsense.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Shiva is never ever pleased with homa of any kind or any type. \n&gt;&gt; Not a\n&gt;&gt; single\n&gt;&gt; scriptural reference could be found out where nativity performs Shiva \n&gt;&gt; homa\n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; please lord Shiva. However there are many references in purans that \n&gt;&gt; Lord\n&gt;&gt; Shiva\n&gt;&gt; was not invited to fire sacrifice conducted by Duksha Prajapati.\n&gt;&gt; Why is it so?\n&gt;&gt; It is so because lord Shiva will be accompanied by his ganas who are \n&gt;&gt; nothing\n&gt;&gt; but\n&gt;&gt; demons and evil sprits and presence of anything impure will destroy \n&gt;&gt; the fire\n&gt;&gt; sacrifice. Things which are pure and sacred in nature are to be \n&gt;&gt; offered into\n&gt;&gt; homam pit since it is believed that these things will ultimately \n&gt;&gt; reach\n&gt;&gt; devtas in\n&gt;&gt; heaven and nothing impure is ever offered to homam pit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Shiva didn&#39;t live in heaven; by performing fire sacrifice one in \n&gt;&gt; try to\n&gt;&gt; send lord shiva to heaven. It is lethal, catastrophic mistake and \n&gt;&gt; will\n&gt;&gt; destroy\n&gt;&gt; equilibrium of the cosmos.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lord Shiva lives in Kalasha parvata and the only way to reach it to \n&gt;&gt; try to\n&gt;&gt; offer\n&gt;&gt; flowers, raw milk, fruits and sweets to shiva lingam. Performing\n&gt;&gt; rudrabhishakam\n&gt;&gt; is the only correct way to please lord shiva.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even in Ramayana lord Rama tries to please lord Shiva by worshiping \n&gt;&gt; to Shiva\n&gt;&gt; lingam. Why didn&#39;t he perform homa?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shiva homa is absolute nonsense. I condemned it completely. All those \n&gt;&gt; who\n&gt;&gt; perform such irreligious practice will be INSULTED AND REJECTED BY \n&gt;&gt; EVERYONE.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is good if someone is promoting vedic tradition of homam but \n&gt;&gt; before doing\n&gt;&gt; so\n&gt;&gt; one must properly read religious scripture to understand that which \n&gt;&gt; deity\n&gt;&gt; can be\n&gt;&gt; pleased by performing homa. One should also understand that since \n&gt;&gt; pure cow\n&gt;&gt; ghee\n&gt;&gt; is not easily available and it&#39;s rare to find any people with fully\n&gt;&gt; activated\n&gt;&gt; Pingala nadi; any homam will not yield satisfactory results. Purity \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; material\n&gt;&gt; offered into homa and purity of the person performing the homa is \n&gt;&gt; essential.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If a person accustomed to alcohol, lying, cheating if perform homa \n&gt;&gt; will only\n&gt;&gt; experience malefic results same is true if homam is performed with\n&gt;&gt; adulterated\n&gt;&gt; butter.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If a person not corrupted by vice perform homam with pure cow ghee \n&gt;&gt; and tries\n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; please deities living in heaven such as indra, varuna, soma, agni, \n&gt;&gt; prajapati\n&gt;&gt; etc\n&gt;&gt; then such a native is equivalent(or will soon become) to demigods.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Same is true for a brahmachari or a yogi who perform internal homam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is said in all scriptures that all spiritual practices should be \n&gt;&gt; followed\n&gt;&gt; under the guidance of a bonafide guru. A native without a capable \n&gt;&gt; guru is\n&gt;&gt; like\n&gt;&gt; god without power.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One should consider himself as luck if he is able to save himself \n&gt;&gt; from self\n&gt;&gt; titled kalyugi gurus. Just remember that one who comes to you is not \n&gt;&gt; a true\n&gt;&gt; guru. Don&#39;t fall pray to marketing.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Its rare fortune, that native found a true guru. Before that one \n&gt;&gt; should\n&gt;&gt; build a\n&gt;&gt; fort strong enough so that one not fall prey to kalyugi gurus.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Arun\n\n"}}
