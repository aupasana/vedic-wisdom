There will be some works that do not represent their fin=\r\nal/full understanding.\n=A0\n(3) The Truth is sufficiently captured by Veda a=\r\nnd Upanishad. That way, there is no need for any additional works. Though p=\r\neople cannot comprehend them and need someone to comment on them, nobody ca=\r\nn capture the Truth more perfectly than Veda and Upanishad. So, what ends u=\r\np happening is that one focuses on a small part of the Truth captured by th=\r\nem and explains it in the desa-kala-patra of one&#39;s times.\n=A0\nShankaraka wr=\r\note commentaries on the ageless Truths of Upanishad, as per his desa-kala-p=\r\natra. Now, people can&#39;t understand even his commentary as it was meant. So =\r\nthere are further commentaries on his commentaries, based on OUR desa-kala-=\r\npatra!\n=A0\n(4) The goal of a master is often not to write something perfect=\r\n (if so, Veda and Upanishad are already there), but to write something more=\r\n direct and useful to one&#39;s audience. Every master may come with a mission =\r\nand focus on that mission. Adi Shankara&#39;s primary mission was to stop the a=\r\ndvance of Buddhism and show how tenets of Buddhism are contained in Vedanta=\r\n.\n=A0\n(5) If one thinks (like a learned friend of mine does) that every wor=\r\nd of Adi Shankara is gospel and perfect truth, I invite them to read his co=\r\nmmentary on &quot;Ishavasyopanishad&quot; (aka &quot;Ishopanishad&quot;). One can certainly vie=\r\nw it as the great Shankara tying himself in knots! THAT upanishad really ch=\r\nallenges the simplified main message Shankara chose to drive home in THAT i=\r\nncarnation!\n=A0\nContrast it with how Sri Aurobindo does justice to that key=\r\n Upanishad!\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality R=\r\nesources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n--------\n=A0=A0\n\n=A0\n\nOn Thu, Oct=\r\n 11, 2012 at 5:26 PM, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n=A0\nDear Utpal, \n=A0\n&lt;&lt; \nIt may=\r\n require a LOT to reject philosophy of giant such as adi Shankara and yet s=\r\nome one may not be able to reject afterall. &gt;&gt; \n\nPhilosophy is pure rationa=\r\nl thought. Spirituality on the other hand is experiential. One can sit in a=\r\nn armchair and contemplate on philosophy, but the same is not possible in c=\r\nase of spirituality. These two are different. Philosophy gives a logical fr=\r\namework of understanding something. There could be philosophy of science, a=\r\n philosophy of ethics, a philosophy of spirituality, a philosophy of episte=\r\nmology (the investigations into the process of acquiring knowledge) etc. \n\n=\r\nThat Sri Adi Shankara was a fantastic spiritual giant, I have no doubt (whi=\r\nch I have already stated in my previous email. Vibhuti of God). I am also s=\r\nure that the very presence of such a man of such spiritual stature would ha=\r\nve naturally drawn masses towards him.=A0 It happens with all great persona=\r\nlities. They have a magnetism which extends=A0 way beyond after their death=\r\n. \n\nHowever, to understand, appreciate, criticize, debate, analyses, compar=\r\natively-evaluate any philosophy of any individual is not that difficult and=\r\n is a valid rational process. \n\nWhile future is always uncertain, but chanc=\r\nes look remote for me that I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sr=\r\ni Adi Shankara&#39;s Mayavada - as is understood and propagated by his follower=\r\ns - which I had studied when I was first trying to get a grasp of Hindu phi=\r\nlosophy. It a nice, compact and easily understandable philosophy. Possibly =\r\none the chief reasons why most=A0 intellectuals like his Adwaitha apart fro=\r\nm being attracted by his personality. It is easier to debate from Sri Shank=\r\nara&#39;s stand-point. At that time I liked it. Later as I got acquainted mysel=\r\nf with more varieties of Hindu philosophy, I found others more comprehensiv=\r\ne and covering more essential points and using a very, if I may use this ph=\r\nrase, a bottom-up=A0 approach to understanding reality, while Sri Shankara&#39;=\r\ns philosophy is a very top-down approach, with a greater thrust on the top =\r\nand an indeterminate leftover in the bottom. Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, Ramanujac=\r\nharya&#39;s Visistha-adwaitha,\n Vallavacharya&#39;s Suddha Adwaitha - so many varie=\r\nties of philosophy. \n\nI have a personal view about judging philosophy. For =\r\neverything that one giant has said, there is always another one who has sai=\r\nd exactly the opposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a differ=\r\nent view-point, differing with all the previous ones. And each of these gia=\r\nnts have spoken with the utmost conviction of their own realizations of tru=\r\nths. So personality and stature of the philosopher should play no role in a=\r\nn objective analysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and statu=\r\nre of a mathematician is of no use in=A0 judging the correctness of a mathe=\r\nmatical theory.=A0 Spiritually, the reality is same (and it maybe a very=A0=\r\n complex reality). But philosophically each have differences which cannot t=\r\nhe ignored. In such an intellectual climate, in my personal opinion, it is =\r\nfair enough to discard one philosophy for another, after a thorough and det=\r\nailed contemplation of the pros and cons. \n\nFrom a spiritual view-point all=\r\n this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spiritual giant one chooses to han=\r\ng on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort is engaged, surely progress=\r\n will happen in time. But philosophy is a another matter. \n\n[To make my sta=\r\nnd clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some strange miracle of Go=\r\nd, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me, I would have no q=\r\nualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him and asking for his b=\r\nlessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable. Yet I will still not=\r\n be agreeable to the philosophy he propagated during the time he lived.] \n\n=\r\n-Best=A0 Regards \n=A0Rajarshi \n\n\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabudd=\r\nhayah | \nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n\n\n_____________=\r\n______________________\n\nFrom: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; \nTo: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 10:32 PM \nSubje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought \n\n=A0 Dear Rajarshi, \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Yet, I have equa=\r\nlly no qualms in rejecting his philosophy&lt;&lt;&lt; \n\nactually &quot;rejecting&quot; may not=\r\n be the right word you probably mistakenly used.

Does the deities have e=\r\nven less =C2 ability on \n&gt; earth plane.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She needs no visa, but neit=\r\nher does She interfere without a genuine cause or a genuine call. Everythin=\r\ng is Her world, then why is there ugliness, crime, evil things? Who creates=\r\n the Asuras, if not She? And it is She herself who gave them the liberty to=\r\n act as per their freewill. This world is a play of forces and a democracy =\r\nof opportunities. Every impulse, however Divine or anti-Divine in aim, is g=\r\niven a chance to run its course and actualize itself in the Universe. THAT =\r\nis Her Divine Compassion! That is why She is THE GREATEST Mother. She is mo=\r\nther to the Great Gods as much to the Danavas and Daityas, and Rakshasas an=\r\nd Bhutas and Pretas and other corrupt human being and what not. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now c=\r\noming to your question on the phrase &quot;higher deities having less ability&quot;. =\r\nI think I have not been able to explain clearly, since in the last mail I w=\r\nas merely writing in the context of that discussion. Let me try here. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n There are three basic layer of this Universe. The physical, the astral or =\r\nsubtle layer, and the causal (karana jagat) layer. In this subtle layer, wh=\r\nich lies superimposed on our own physical plane, there is a whole wide worl=\r\nd of all possible forces, just like in our own world. It is a layer which i=\r\ns created out of force of pranashakti. This force of pranashakti in humans =\r\nbeings is what causes all emotive movements on the consciousness - joy, hap=\r\npiness, love, passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgust, lust, attachment=\r\ns etc etc. These are also capable of influencing the thinking mind is us. N=\r\now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik sadhana, is to crea=\r\nte a formation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti through the aid of =\r\nrepeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you think carefully, yo=\r\nu will realize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a pranapratisthapana r=\r\nitual before starting. The sadhaka used the force of his/her=A0 own \n&gt;=A0 p=\r\nranashakti to infuse life into a subtle formation of the deity. Once this p=\r\nrocess is successfully done, this sublte formation of the deity which exist=\r\ns in the subtle plane, has a life of its own. It can then guide the sadhaka=\r\n through the path and eventually, one day lead him/her to the real abode of=\r\n the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond this astral plane). If a perso=\r\nn is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti, and make it identify/create s=\r\nuch an astral formation of the deity, it becomes an even more powerful forc=\r\ne. It is, from our limited human perspective, as much a powerful entity as =\r\nwe may imagine, yet it is often not the actual Deity yet. Exactly the same =\r\nthing has been described by Sri Vimalananda in the Aghora books, if you rea=\r\nd carefully.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; When a sadhaka has been able to associate with suc=\r\nh an astral formation of the deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path=\r\n provided the sadhaka also is trying to work hard and sincerely to reach th=\r\ne causal planes (the real spiritual planes of existence where the real forc=\r\ne of the Deity originates). The difference, if you ask, between this astral=\r\n formation of the deity and the real deity is that, the former is neither b=\r\nound nor capable by itself of causing a complete and total transformation o=\r\nf the average human nature without a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas=\r\n, if one reaches the plane of the Great Gods, which is where the real deity=\r\n exists, one cannot avoid being transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. An=\r\nd what kind of a transformation will it be? One that will reflect to the wo=\r\nrld as a greater and genuine humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divin=\r\ne at ALL time and unfailingly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man=\r\n - lust,=A0\n anger, \n&gt;=A0 jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace,=\r\n calm, detachment, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of t=\r\nhe consciousness. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to=\r\n another person, will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which =\r\nwill automatically calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals =\r\nETC. THAT is the authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of t=\r\nhe great deities. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the =\r\ncausal planes of existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, whi=\r\nch is created by the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case =\r\nmaybe, is often not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformatio=\r\nn in a sadhaka. That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can=\r\n&#39;t=C2=A0 get me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or br=\r\ning me fame or any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral for=\r\nmations of=A0 the\n deities \n&gt;=A0 can very easily do all these things in the=\r\n physical world - but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you th=\r\ne must authentic and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one =\r\naim and destination of all genuine sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Since this astral plane i=\r\ns the way it is, therefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep actively workin=\r\ng on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, genuine internal surren=\r\nder (when that happens one accepts all life-situations without the slightes=\r\nt grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealousy etc. (all that is uni=\r\nversally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless these changes are aff=\r\nected at least to some degree in the mind and emotions of the sadhaka, one =\r\nis simply not ready to reach the higher planes of God and benefit from them=\r\n spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution there is a ga=\r\np between experience and realization. Only repeated experiences *may* lead =\r\nto realization. One off experiences create a force no doubt, but in time it=\r\n fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and conditioning=\r\n of the sadhaka. \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is not your \n&gt; theory. You have tak=\r\nen it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certain \n&gt; person reach a stage =\r\nin their spiritual path, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=C2 c=\r\nomplete truth, when in fact it is=C2 far from truth. \n&gt; Once=C2 I saw in a =\r\narticle that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who spoke \n&gt; Gita completely f=\r\norgot it after few minutes or so. I could not believe \n&gt; what I was reading=\r\n. Then my respect for this yogi went down the drain.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You surety is =\r\nincorrect. There were certain events which happened in the last one and hal=\r\nf years which made me sit down and rethink my own understanding of spiritua=\r\nlity. At about the same time I started worshiping a specific personality of=\r\n the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, the more would thought=\r\ns pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is imperfect and =\r\nhas serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find out what was w=\r\nrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking. First questi=\r\non I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mind could grasp=\r\n some outlines of certain answers and processes and truths. But it was stil=\r\nl not exceptionally clear. \n&gt; \n&gt; I had first read Sri Aurobindo when I was =\r\nin college. I could not go beyond the first two pages. They were bouncers g=\r\noing one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gave me a book of Sri A=\r\nurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and rest I rejected, partly du=\r\ne to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arrogance. Never opened any of hi=\r\ns writing since then. This year, as my sadhana was going on and as I was in=\r\nstinctively trying to correct the flaws in my understanding, one day while =\r\nmeditating I had an inner thought in the form of an image, which told me th=\r\nat I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very specific manner. The =\r\nimage was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly pressing on my conscio=\r\nusness. I opened his book again, and read it in the prescribed manner and t=\r\nhis time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was struggling to understand =\r\nall this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get a proper hang of, I =\r\nwas able to=A0 understand \n&gt;=A0 from his writings with much deeper clarity.=\r\n=C2=A0 Many of my own experiences made more sense to me. Many sentences of =\r\nAghora books too made amply sense in a new light. I read 40 - 45 % of his w=\r\nritings. Then something in me told me to stop at a certain point of his wri=\r\ntings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % I will have to first make more sp=\r\niritual progress. Otherwise the rational mind will distort the information.=\r\n So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firmly 3 years ago, now came back to =\r\nsit on my consciousness like a blazing sun. \n&gt; \n&gt; The line that you mention=\r\n, is from one of the earlier writings of Sri Aurobindo on the historical pr=\r\noblem of the Mahabharta. In the Mahabharata, there is an incident which com=\r\nes later on, after the great war and when Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdo=\r\nm happily, when Arjuna asks Sri Krishna to repeat the words he had spoken a=\r\nt the beginning of the war (The Gita) once more since he has forgotten them=\r\n, and Sri Krishna says, the time has passed away (it was a special time whe=\r\nn the Gita was spoken), he cannot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; once again. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Sri Krishna was the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was on=\r\ne of his Gurus, for during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 =\r\ndays Swami Vivekananda would appear before him daily and instruct him on th=\r\ne various layers of the mind, which he was not aware of till then. Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda had already left his physical body by then. It was in the writing=\r\ns of Sri Aurobindo that he mentioned about the left and right hemisphere of=\r\n the brain and their difference in functionality, and their connection to s=\r\npirituality, about 30 years before medical science confirmed the same. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Right from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry, to pushing hi=\r\ns own spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (which he describ=\r\nes in different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuously by the Ad=\r\nesha of Sri Krishna. He would literally hear the voice of Krishna speaking =\r\nto him, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, the Di=\r\nvine Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. Anyway, my point=\r\n is not to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of spirituality. I have=\r\n benefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefit.=\r\n There are so many sadgurus who have come to India, each with their unique =\r\nperspectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individually try and fin=\r\nd whose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotional makeup, and help u=\r\ns to progress on the path. \n&gt; \n&gt; Though I now have a very deep respect for =\r\nSri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his critics and his bli=\r\nnd-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood the depth of h=\r\nis teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a function of their own e=\r\ngos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genuine understandi=\r\nng or appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be understood accuratel=\r\ny or even slightly without sincere sadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; Disclaimer---- M=\r\ny thinking is \n&gt; very different due to Darshan and=C2 Grace of Divine Mothe=\r\nr & Divine \n&gt; Lord. Nobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or follow =\r\nthe \n&gt; leader.Thanks.&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I at-least will never feel unhappy if you dis=\r\nagree. There are \n&gt; many saints, many philosophies, many paths, not everyon=\r\ne is bound to \n&gt; like every path.=C2=A0 Disagreement is perfectly ok. Becau=\r\nse someone \n&gt; disagrees with me or those whom I agree with, does not mean I=\r\n like him \n&gt; any less. I try to keep my=C2=A0 emotional side (where respect=\r\n, love, \n&gt; dislike, hatred, anger, passions exist) separate from my thinkin=\r\ng mind. \n&gt; It is very much possible, through practice, for a man to disasso=\r\nciate \n&gt; his rational-mind from the emotional-mind. So have no fears that y=\r\nour \n&gt; disagreement is going to make me like you any less or any more. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The problem with the emotional part of our being is that it jumps up at a=\r\nppearances, running ahead to grasp the truth rather than waiting patiently =\r\nfor the truth to arrive in all its aspects and dimensions, and in the proce=\r\nss it distorts the truth and then reacts to that distorted image. For examp=\r\nle, recently in some social forums I posted a comment that I found the Tant=\r\nrik Adwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though th=\r\ne Adwaitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-selling supporters. Immediately so=\r\nme friends of mine on Twitter and otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion=\r\n that I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and tried best to make me &quot;see the =\r\ntruth&quot; by such grandiose statements that=C2=A0 Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39;=\r\n on Adwaitha and everything else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was =\r\nmaking an egoistic denouncement. Both of which are million light-years away=\r\n from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti \n&gt;=A0 (manifes=\r\ntation) of God, that much I am certain. His compositions are so brilliant t=\r\nhat it can&#39;t be sufficiently appreciated in words. Yet, I have equally no q=\r\nualms in rejecting his philosophy. And because I am not bound to accept his=\r\n philosophy, does not mean I respect or love him any less than any other gr=\r\neat saint.=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; If you disrespect a man, and specially a saint, and =\r\nthen start disliking him too with a passion, you are creating strong negati=\r\nve karmas. But if you can disagree with someone without losing respect or l=\r\nove for the person, in an objective manner, you reap very little karmic eff=\r\nects. That is why Lord Krishna too advices us to become more detached in li=\r\nfe. \n&gt; \n&gt; In conclusion, Narasimha is totally correct. Many things cannot b=\r\ne sufficiently expressed in words without causing some distortion. \n&gt; \n&gt; -R=\r\negards \n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE m=\r\nAmabuddhayah | \n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ________________________________ \n&gt;=A0 From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihar=\r\ni@...&gt; \n&gt; To: &quot; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt; vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM \n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: A thought \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai, \n&gt; =\r\nHow are you doing?

Once=C2 I saw in a article that Aurobindo =\r\nsaid that Divine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it after few minutes=\r\n or so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yo=\r\ngi went down the drain. \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her=\r\n Protection and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of our human percep=\r\ntion.

Otherwise it=\r\n does not help. And the only parameters of judgement is to objectively see =\r\nwhat changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is=\r\n are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; The field of experience=\r\ns - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it can be genuine an=\r\nd plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in itself. Most spiritual peopl=\r\ne have never gone in depth trying to analyse and understand these things pr=\r\noperly, but some pattern is observable.=C2=A0 Not all experiences are what =\r\nthey seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of experien=\r\nces, not being able to adequately determine which is genuine and which is n=\r\non-genuine. This is the world of astral \n&gt;=A0 plane, driven by the overlapp=\r\ning shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being.=\r\n In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (over=\r\nlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=C2=A0 is p=\r\nossible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation i=\r\nn this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of=\r\n varies character and hue who can very easily create an expereince for a sa=\r\ndhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/aura=\r\n of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him=\r\n/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, the lower extreme of =\r\nwhich causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driven =\r\nby attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy=\r\n, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the oth=\r\ner extreme this layer can, if=A0\n properly \n&gt;=A0 channalized as is done in =\r\ngenuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda and manif=\r\nest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path. \n&gt; \n&gt; In a nutshell=\r\n, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only to the extent that it h=\r\nelps to modify and transform your waking surface personality. That is the o=\r\nnly true test. Rest all the range of experiences that come from this realm,=\r\n and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this realm, are just sou=\r\nnd and fury without substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the writings of Sri Aurobindo, he c=\r\nalls it the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumerable yogis who ha=\r\nve got swept away by the light and sound of this realm. One sure-shot way t=\r\no cross this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross this some day, is t=\r\no hang on tightly to the fundamentals. \n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards \n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto=\r\n mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM =\r\n\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi, =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

There will be some works that do not represent their fi=\r\nnal/full understanding.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(3) The Truth is sufficiently captured=\r\n by Veda and Upanishad. That way, there is no need for any additional works=\r\n. Though people cannot comprehend them and need someone to comment on them,=\r\n nobody can capture the Truth more perfectly than Veda and Upanishad. So, w=\r\nhat ends up happening is that one focuses on a small part of the Truth\n cap=\r\ntured by them and explains it in the desa-kala-patra of one&#39;s times.&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;Shankaraka wrote commentaries on the ageless Truths of Upanishad, as=\r\n per his desa-kala-patra. Now, people can&#39;t understand even his commentary =\r\nas it was meant. So there are further commentaries on his commentaries, bas=\r\ned on OUR desa-kala-patra!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(4) The goal of a master is often n=\r\not to write something perfect (if so, Veda and Upanishad are already there)=\r\n, but to write something more direct and useful to one&#39;s audience. Every ma=\r\nster may come with a mission and focus on that mission. Adi Shankara&#39;s prim=\r\nary mission was to stop the advance of Buddhism and show how tenets of Budd=\r\nhism are contained in Vedanta.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(5) If one thinks (like a learn=\r\ned friend of mine does) that every word of Adi Shankara is gospel and perfe=\r\nct truth, I invite them to read his commentary on &quot;Ishavasyopanishad&quot; (aka =\r\n&quot;Ishopanishad&quot;). One can certainly view it as the great Shankara\n tying him=\r\nself in knots!

There could be =\r\nphilosophy of science, a philosophy of ethics, a philosophy of spirituality=\r\n, a philosophy of epistemology (the investigations into the process of acqu=\r\niring knowledge) etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That Sri Adi Shankara was a fantastic spiritu=\r\nal giant, I have no doubt (which I have already stated in my previous email=\r\n. Vibhuti of God). I am also sure that the very presence of such a man of s=\r\nuch spiritual stature would have naturally drawn masses towards him.&nbsp; =\r\nIt happens with all great personalities. They have a magnetism which extend=\r\ns&nbsp; way beyond after their death. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, to understand, appre=\r\nciate, criticize, debate, analyses,\n comparatively-evaluate any philosophy =\r\nof any individual is not that difficult and is a valid rational process. &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;While future is always uncertain, but chances look remote for me that=\r\n I would find Mayavada more attractive. It was Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Mayavada =\r\n- as is understood and propagated by his followers - which I had studied wh=\r\nen I was first trying to get a grasp of Hindu philosophy. It a nice, compac=\r\nt and easily understandable philosophy. Possibly one the chief reasons why =\r\nmost&nbsp; intellectuals like his Adwaitha apart from being attracted by hi=\r\ns personality. It is easier to debate from Sri Shankara&#39;s stand-point. At t=\r\nhat time I liked it. Later as I got acquainted myself with more varieties o=\r\nf Hindu philosophy, I found others more comprehensive and covering more ess=\r\nential points and using a very, if I may use this phrase, a bottom-up&nbsp;=\r\n approach to understanding reality, while Sri Shankara&#39;s philosophy is a ve=\r\nry top-down approach, with a\n greater thrust on the top and an indeterminat=\r\ne leftover in the bottom. Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, Ramanujacharya&#39;s Visistha-ad=\r\nwaitha, Vallavacharya&#39;s Suddha Adwaitha - so many varieties of philosophy. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a personal view about judging philosophy. For everything tha=\r\nt one giant has said, there is always another one who has said exactly the =\r\nopposite. And a third and forth one who came up with a different view-point=\r\n, differing with all the previous ones. And each of these giants have spoke=\r\nn with the utmost conviction of their own realizations of truths. So person=\r\nality and stature of the philosopher should play no role in an objective an=\r\nalysis of the philosophy. Just like the personality and stature of a mathem=\r\natician is of no use in&nbsp; judging the correctness of a mathematical the=\r\nory.&nbsp; Spiritually, the reality is same (and it maybe a very&nbsp; comp=\r\nlex reality). But philosophically each have differences which cannot the ig=\r\nnored. In such an\n intellectual climate, in my personal opinion, it is fair=\r\n enough to discard one philosophy for another, after a thorough and detaile=\r\nd contemplation of the pros and cons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a spiritual view-point a=\r\nll this is utterly meaningless. Which ever spiritual giant one chooses to h=\r\nang on to, if sincere faith, reverence and effort is engaged, surely progre=\r\nss will happen in time. But philosophy is a another matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[To mak=\r\ne my stand clearer, let me say hypothetically that IF by some strange mirac=\r\nle of God, Sri Adi Shankara were to come and stand infornt of me, I would h=\r\nave no qualms about falling at his feet and bowing down to him and asking f=\r\nor his blessings, for his spiritual stature is unquestionable.

In thi=\r\ns subtle layer, which lies superimposed on our own physical plane, there is=\r\n a whole wide world of all possible forces, just like in our own world. It =\r\nis a layer which is created out of force of pranashakti. This force of pran=\r\nashakti in humans beings is what causes all emotive movements on the consci=\r\nousness - joy, happiness, love,\n passion, rage, fear, anger, hatred, disgus=\r\nt, lust, attachments etc etc. These are also capable of influencing the thi=\r\nnking mind is us. Now the core philosophy of sadhana and specially Tantrik =\r\nsadhana, is to create a formation of the deity using ones own prana-shakti =\r\nthrough the aid of repeated rituals and procedures and mantras etc. If you =\r\nthink carefully, you will realize that every idol, ever homa agni needs a p=\r\nranapratisthapana ritual before starting. The sadhaka used the force of his=\r\n/her&nbsp; own &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; pranashakti to infuse life into a subtle form=\r\nation of the deity. Once this process is successfully done, this sublte for=\r\nmation of the deity which exists in the subtle plane, has a life of its own=\r\n. It can then guide the sadhaka through the path and eventually, one day le=\r\nad him/her to the real abode of the deity which is the karana-jagat (beyond=\r\n this astral plane). If a person is able to awaken his/her Kundalini shakti=\r\n, and make it\n identify/create such an astral formation of the deity, it be=\r\ncomes an even more powerful force. It is, from our limited human perspectiv=\r\ne, as much a powerful entity as we may imagine, yet it is often not the act=\r\nual Deity yet. Exactly the same thing has been described by Sri Vimalananda=\r\n in the Aghora books, if you read carefully.=C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Whe=\r\nn a sadhaka has been able to associate with such an astral formation of the=\r\n deity, it can guide the sadhaka along the path provided the sadhaka also i=\r\ns trying to work hard and sincerely to reach the causal planes (the real sp=\r\niritual planes of existence where the real force of the Deity originates). =\r\nThe difference, if you ask, between this astral formation of the deity and =\r\nthe real deity is that, the former is neither bound nor capable by itself o=\r\nf causing a complete and total transformation of the average human nature w=\r\nithout a proactive help of the sadhaka. Whereas, if one reaches the plane o=\r\nf the\n Great Gods, which is where the real deity exists, one cannot avoid b=\r\neing transformed in mind, emotions, body etc. And what kind of a transforma=\r\ntion will it be? One that will reflect to the world as a greater and genuin=\r\ne humility, sense of deep surrender to the Divine at ALL time and unfailing=\r\nly, a complete withdrawal of lower nature of man - lust,&nbsp; anger, &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp; jealousy, greed, covetousness - an abiding peace, calm, detachmen=\r\nt, mental-illumination, genuine compassion, a widening of the consciousness=\r\n. Such an individual, even if he/she just sits down next to another person,=\r\n will exude a silent strong peace and unselfish love which will automatical=\r\nly calm the minds and disturbed emotions of lesser mortals ETC. THAT is the=\r\n authentic, unhindered flow of the Divine Power of any of the great deities=\r\n. This comes even if one deity is properly realized in the causal planes of=\r\n existence. But the astral formation of the same deity, which is created\n b=\r\ny the force of our own pranashakti or Kundalini as the case maybe, is often=\r\n not capable of affecting this kind of a total transformation in a sadhaka.=\r\n That is why it is limited. It is not limited because it can&#39;t=C2&nbsp; get=\r\n me a better job or a nice pay hike or cure some diseases or bring me fame =\r\nor any such material benefit if I so ask of it - the astral formations of&n=\r\nbsp; the deities &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; can very easily do all these things in the =\r\nphysical world - but it is limited because it cannot by itself give you the=\r\n must authentic and persistent spirituality of the higher planes, the one a=\r\nim and destination of all genuine sadhana. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Since this ast=\r\nral plane is the way it is, therefore it&#39;s extremely important to keep acti=\r\nvely working on ourselves to increase detachment, objectivity, genuine inte=\r\nrnal surrender (when that happens one accepts all life-situations without t=\r\nhe slightest grudge), humility, control of anger, lust, jealousy\n etc. (all=\r\n that is universally accepted as spiritual qualities). For unless these cha=\r\nnges are affected at least to some degree in the mind and emotions of the s=\r\nadhaka, one is simply not ready to reach the higher planes of God and benef=\r\nit from them spiritually. Moreover, at every stage of spiritual evolution t=\r\nhere is a gap between experience and realization. Only repeated experiences=\r\n *may* lead to realization. One off experiences create a force no doubt, bu=\r\nt in time it fritters away, or worst, gets distorted by the impurities and =\r\nconditioning of the sadhaka. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;I am sure this is no=\r\nt your &lt;br&gt;&gt; theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times w=\r\nhen certain &lt;br&gt;&gt; person reach a stage in their spiritual path, others t=\r\nhink whatever this guy is uttering is=C2 complete truth, when in fact it is=\r\n=C2 far from truth. &lt;br&gt;&gt; Once=C2 I saw in a article that Aurobindo said=\r\n that Divine Lord who spoke &lt;br&gt;&gt; Gita completely forgot\n it after few m=\r\ninutes or so. I could not believe &lt;br&gt;&gt; what I was reading. Then my resp=\r\nect for this yogi went down the drain.&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; You surety=\r\n is incorrect. There were certain events which happened in the last one and=\r\n half years which made me sit down and rethink my own understanding of spir=\r\nituality. At about the same time I started worshiping a specific personalit=\r\ny of the Divine Mother, and the more I meditated on Her, the more would tho=\r\nughts pour into my mind that my understanding of spirituality is imperfect =\r\nand has serious flaws. I tried, using my own meditations to find out what w=\r\nas wrong or rather imperfectly understood, what needed rethinking. First qu=\r\nestion I asked myself was, what is the aim of spirituality? My mind could g=\r\nrasp some outlines of certain answers and processes and truths. But it was =\r\nstill not exceptionally clear. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I had first read Sri Aurob=\r\nindo when I was in college. I could not go beyond the\n first two pages. The=\r\ny were bouncers going one mile over my head. Three years ago someone gave m=\r\ne a book of Sri Aurobindo. I could understand say 10 percent, and rest I re=\r\njected, partly due to ignorance and partly due to egoistic arrogance. Never=\r\n opened any of his writing since then. This year, as my sadhana was going o=\r\nn and as I was instinctively trying to correct the flaws in my understandin=\r\ng, one day while meditating I had an inner thought in the form of an image,=\r\n which told me that I should start reading Sri Aurobindo but in a very spec=\r\nific manner. The image was very clear in my inner-eye, and thoroughly press=\r\ning on my consciousness. I opened his book again, and read it in the prescr=\r\nibed manner and this time it made a LOT of sense to me. What I was struggli=\r\nng to understand all this year, whose outline I could grasp yet not get a p=\r\nroper hang of, I was able to&nbsp; understand &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; from his writi=\r\nngs with much deeper clarity.=C2&nbsp; Many of\n my own experiences made mor=\r\ne sense to me. Many sentences of Aghora books too made amply sense in a new=\r\n light. I read 40 - 45 % of his writings. Then something in me told me to s=\r\ntop at a certain point of his writings, for digesting the rest of the 60 % =\r\nI will have to first make more spiritual progress. Otherwise the rational m=\r\nind will distort the information. So I stopped. He whom I had rejected firm=\r\nly 3 years ago, now came back to sit on my consciousness like a blazing sun=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The line that you mention, is from one of the earlier w=\r\nritings of Sri Aurobindo on the historical problem of the Mahabharta. In th=\r\ne Mahabharata, there is an incident which comes later on, after the great w=\r\nar and when Yudhisthira was ruling the kingdom happily, when Arjuna asks Sr=\r\ni Krishna to repeat the words he had spoken at the beginning of the war (Th=\r\ne Gita) once more since he has forgotten them, and Sri Krishna says, the ti=\r\nme has passed away (it was a special\n time when the Gita was spoken), he ca=\r\nnnot repeat the &quot;exact words&quot; once again. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sri Krishna was=\r\n the main Guru of Aurobindo. Even Swami Vivekananda was one of his Gurus, f=\r\nor during the time when Sri Aurobindo was in jail, for 15 days Swami Viveka=\r\nnanda would appear before him daily and instruct him on the various layers =\r\nof the mind, which he was not aware of till then. Swami Vivekananda had alr=\r\neady left his physical body by then. It was in the writings of Sri Aurobind=\r\no that he mentioned about the left and right hemisphere of the brain and th=\r\neir difference in functionality, and their connection to spirituality, abou=\r\nt 30 years before medical science confirmed the same. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Rig=\r\nht from getting out of jail, to settling in Pondicherry, to pushing his own=\r\n spiritual experiences further into states of Sahaja (which he describes in=\r\n different terminology), etc etc, he was guided continuously by the Adesha =\r\nof Sri Krishna. He would\n literally hear the voice of Krishna speaking to h=\r\nim, instructing him to do this or do that. Krishna was his Guru, the Divine=\r\n Mother beyond all manifestation, was his destination. Anyway, my point is =\r\nnot to try and sell Sri Aurobindo&#39;s perspective of spirituality. I have ben=\r\nefited from it, but not necessary that everyone else will also benefit. The=\r\nre are so many sadgurus who have come to India, each with their unique pers=\r\npectives and ideas and philosophies. Each must individually try and find wh=\r\nose ideas gel properly with our mental and emotional makeup, and help us to=\r\n progress on the path. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Though I now have a very deep resp=\r\nect for Sri Aurobindo, I maintain a safe distance from both his critics and=\r\n his blind-admirers. Both of them, in my opinion, have misunderstood the de=\r\npth of his teachings. Both their love and their hatred is a function of the=\r\nir own egos, like it was mine 3 years ago, and not based on any genuine und=\r\nerstanding or\n appreciation. In spirituality, no Sadguru can be understood =\r\naccurately or even slightly without sincere sadhana. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;&lt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is &lt;br&gt;&gt; very differen=\r\nt due to Darshan and=C2 Grace of Divine Mother &amp; Divine &lt;br&gt;&gt; Lord. =\r\nNobody should feel unhappy If I do not agree or follow the &lt;br&gt;&gt; leader.=\r\nThanks.&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I at-least will never feel unhappy if you=\r\n disagree. There are &lt;br&gt;&gt; many saints, many philosophies, many paths, n=\r\not everyone is bound to &lt;br&gt;&gt; like every path.=C2&nbsp; Disagreement is =\r\nperfectly ok. Because someone &lt;br&gt;&gt; disagrees with me or those whom I ag=\r\nree with, does not mean I like him &lt;br&gt;&gt; any less. I try to keep my=C2&n=\r\nbsp; emotional side (where respect, love, &lt;br&gt;&gt; dislike, hatred, anger, =\r\npassions exist) separate from my thinking mind. &lt;br&gt;&gt; It is very much po=\r\nssible, through practice, for a man to disassociate &lt;br&gt;&gt; his rational-m=\r\nind from\n the emotional-mind. So have no fears that your &lt;br&gt;&gt; disagreem=\r\nent is going to make me like you any less or any more. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Th=\r\ne problem with the emotional part of our being is that it jumps up at appea=\r\nrances, running ahead to grasp the truth rather than waiting patiently for =\r\nthe truth to arrive in all its aspects and dimensions, and in the process i=\r\nt distorts the truth and then reacts to that distorted image. For example, =\r\nrecently in some social forums I posted a comment that I found the Tantrik =\r\nAdwaitha far more appealing than Sri Adi Shankara&#39;s Adwaitha, though the Ad=\r\nwaitha of Adi Shankara has many hard-selling supporters. Immediately some f=\r\nriends of mine on Twitter and otherwise, jumped to the false conclusion tha=\r\nt I have disrespected Adi Shankara, and tried best to make me &quot;see the trut=\r\nh&quot; by such grandiose statements that=C2&nbsp; Shankara is the &#39;final word&#39; =\r\non Adwaitha and everything else must be necessarily lesser. Or that I was\n =\r\nmaking an egoistic denouncement. Both of which are million light-years away=\r\n from the truth. That Sri Adi Shankara was a special Vibhuti &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n (manifestation) of God, that much I am certain. His compositions are so br=\r\nilliant that it can&#39;t be sufficiently appreciated in words. Yet, I have equ=\r\nally no qualms in rejecting his philosophy. And because I am not bound to a=\r\nccept his philosophy, does not mean I respect or love him any less than any=\r\n other great saint.=C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; If you disrespect a man, and=\r\n specially a saint, and then start disliking him too with a passion, you ar=\r\ne creating strong negative karmas. But if you can disagree with someone wit=\r\nhout losing respect or love for the person, in an objective manner, you rea=\r\np very little karmic effects. That is why Lord Krishna too advices us to be=\r\ncome more detached in life. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In conclusion, Narasimha is t=\r\notally correct. Many things cannot be sufficiently expressed in\n words with=\r\nout causing some distortion. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -Regards &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2 Rajars=\r\nhi &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam man=\r\nyantE mAmabuddhayah | &lt;br&gt;&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[=\r\n7:24] &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ________________________________ &lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; To: &quot; vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sent:=\r\n Thursday, 11 October 2012 12:21 AM &lt;br&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re=\r\n: A thought &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Rajarshi Bhai, &lt;br&gt;&gt; How are you doing? About 2=\r\n00 hundred years ago, a man made a theory of creation in France. When Napol=\r\nean asked where is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. It makes=\r\n things complicated. &lt;br&gt;&gt; So is there a place for Divine Mother and Her=\r\n Love or Grace or Protection in your theory. Is=C2 this\n intermediate zone =\r\nas you say is created by Her and part of Her creation=C2 or by=C2 somebody =\r\nelse.=C2&nbsp; Does=C2 She needs some visa to go there if she is=C2 not the=\r\n Creater.=C2 As you say all higher deity are there but less in ability. Doe=\r\ns the deities have even less =C2 ability on earth plane. &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; I am sure this is not your theory. You have taken it from yogi Au=\r\nrobindo. Many times when certain person reach a stage in their spiritual pa=\r\nth, others think whatever this guy is uttering is=C2 complete truth, when i=\r\nn fact it is=C2 far from truth. Once=C2 I saw in a article that Aurobindo s=\r\naid that Divine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it after few minutes =\r\nor so. I could not believe what I was reading. Then my respect for this yog=\r\ni went down the drain. &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Divine Mother, Her Love,=\r\n Her Grace Her Protection and other Eternal Divine Beings are outside of ou=\r\nr human perception. They only allow us to know about\n Themselves what They =\r\nwish to. For me there is a=C2 difference between a yogi and devotee.=C2&nbs=\r\np; A devotee rises due to Grace of Divine Mother or their Ishtdav. where as=\r\n a yogi rises after a lot of huff and fuff, and they get stuck everywhere. =\r\nI am sure there are only=C2 devotee in this group. They may be doing haven =\r\nor japa or other devotional work. &lt;br&gt;&gt; So nobody should=C2 feel any sor=\r\nt of fear or pressure even for one second because there is no such hocus po=\r\ncus zone to cross and there is Grace of Divine Mother on all Her children. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks &lt;br&gt;&gt; LaxmiNarayan &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking =\r\nis very different due to Darshan and=C2 Grace of Divine Mother &amp; Divine=\r\n Lord.

Otherwise it does not help. And the only p=\r\narameters of judgement is to objectively see what changes are happening in =\r\nour surface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equan=\r\nimous, etc etc. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The field of experiences - visions, sight=\r\ns, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some of it can be genuine and plenty non-genui=\r\nne. It is a complex study in itself. Most spiritual people have never gone =\r\nin depth trying to analyse and understand these\n things properly, but some =\r\npattern is observable.=C2&nbsp; Not all experiences are what they seem to b=\r\ne. Many yogis have lost themselves in this jungle of experiences, not being=\r\n able to adequately determine which is genuine and which is non-genuine. Th=\r\nis is the world of astral &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; plane, driven by the overlapping s=\r\nhealths of pranamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being. In T=\r\nantrik terminology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlappi=\r\nng and not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything=C2&nbsp; is pos=\r\nsible here. Every higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation in =\r\nthis realm, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings of v=\r\naries character and hue who can very easily create an expereince for a sadh=\r\naka to delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an experience/aura o=\r\nf a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a seeker and use him/h=\r\ner for its own advantage. It is a whole\n wide world, the lower extreme of w=\r\nhich causes, in a normal human being, a cementing of a surface ego driven b=\r\ny attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-conscious ambitions, jealousy,=\r\n lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppressed) etc etc and at the othe=\r\nr extreme this layer can, if&nbsp; properly &lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; channalized as i=\r\ns done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine Ananda=\r\n and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path. &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only t=\r\no the extent that it helps to modify and transform your waking surface pers=\r\nonality. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of experiences that=\r\n come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from th=\r\nis realm, are just sound and fury without substance. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In t=\r\nhe writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, which has =\r\ndestroyed innumerable yogis who\n have got swept away by the light and sound=\r\n of this realm. One sure-shot way to cross this realm, and all sadhakas wil=\r\nl have to cross this some day, is to hang on tightly to the fundamentals. &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -Regards &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2 Rajarshi &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | &lt;br&gt;&gt; param bhAwamajAnan=\r\nto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;ve=\r\ndic_pathak@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&gt; Sent: =\r\nTuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM &lt;br&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thou=\r\nght &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Rajarshi, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!
