Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Manoj,\n&gt;  \n&gt; In addition to fire, gods can be invoked in water a=\r\ns well as idols or any objects in general. In fact, gods can be invoked and=\r\n worshipped in one&#39;s breathing. Gods can be worshipped without any external=\r\n invocation also, as they have an indwelling presence always. However, exte=\r\nrnal worship in fire gives the best results and useful for progressing for =\r\nmost sadhakas in the beginning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kurukshetra is the land of BhagavadGi=\r\nta and you are blessed to be from that sacred land. I and my guru spent a c=\r\nouple of days at Kurukshetra for shooting a documentary movie on Krishna&#39;s =\r\nhistoricity in May 2008. That whole region is filled with some powerful and=\r\n strange spiritual energy. We had a couple of really nice homams and medita=\r\ntion sessions in Kurukshetra. I loved the place.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Particularly, one Ch=\r\nandi homam we did in the night atop a small hill in Kurukshetra (Karna ka t=\r\neela) was very nice. An old yogi and his grandson lived there and did sadha=\r\nna everyday. They belonged to Naath pantha and were Gorakshaanaath (Gorakhn=\r\nath) followers. When we were climbing the hill in the afternoon, Manish tol=\r\nd me we probably had a rina there and might end up doing something there. W=\r\nhen we found these yogis, we talked to them for a while. Just when leaving,=\r\n Manish saw their havan kund where they do a havan everyday. Manish asked t=\r\nhem it would be alright if we do Chandi homam in that havan kund that night=\r\n. They welcomed us under the condition that we would not call any dark ener=\r\ngies, as they were worshippers of Narayana. We told them we would call Maha=\r\nlakshmi in fire and they consented. We went back later that night with all =\r\nmaterials and did a Chandi homam. The place had around 10 dogs. They were b=\r\narking loud before, but they all came and sat around the homam once fire st=\r\narted. Surprisingly, the dogs just sat around the fire without any sounds o=\r\nr barking for a whole 2 hours. It was Manish, I, that old naath panthaa yog=\r\ni and a bunch of dogs that sat around the havan kund for 2 hours.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unt=\r\nil we invoked the Mother, it was very silent except for our soft voices. Bu=\r\nt the moment we invoked the Mother in fire, there were strange noises all a=\r\nround us on the hill and in the valley. Suddenly, so many birds and flies s=\r\ntarted making various noises. The effect of transitioning from such silence=\r\n to such an animated state all around us was quite strange and eerie. That =\r\nanimated state continued for a few minutes. Also, when we offered bali at t=\r\nhe end of homam, suddenly all the dogs got up and started running together =\r\ntowards the southwestern direction while jumping up now and then, as though=\r\n they were chasing somebody.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There was no electricity there. The ONLY=\r\n light in the vicinity was homam fire. There were so many mosquitos all aro=\r\nund us and biting us continuously. We did not eat anything since noon and i=\r\nt was 10:30 pm when we finished. Still, it was so nice. Like I said, there =\r\nis something ethereal about the air of Kurukshetra. Though I only spent onl=\r\ny a couple of days there, I have fond memories of that place.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: mano=\r\nj sharma \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Saturday, June 13=\r\n, 2009 12:42 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Pitri Tarpana Question (Re:=\r\n &quot;Vishnu Sahasra Naama Homam&quot;..)\n&gt; \n&gt;         JAI MAA\n&gt; \n&gt;         Narsimha=\r\n ji & others\n&gt; \n&gt;         Namaskar\n&gt; \n&gt;         i am sharing one thing, but=\r\n don&#39;t want to disturb you.\n&gt;         my native village is in Kurukshetra a=\r\nnd there is a water pond in almost every village the elders told us that yo=\r\nu can worship or meditate any devta or devi standing in these ponds, your s=\r\npiritual progress will magnifying by many folds. one day a old village pris=\r\nt also told that when the fire homa is not possible due to rain (in our tra=\r\ndition the homa done in open) then you can invoke the deva in water and per=\r\nform the ahuti in it.\n&gt; \n&gt;         thanks\n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Sat, 13/6/09,=\r\n Narasimha P.V.R.

Not so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri=\r\n tarpana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;           *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;           The thoughts of the minds=\r\n around us do have a subtle impact on our mind. When too many depressed, sa=\r\nd or frustrated people are around you, it will have a negative effect on yo=\r\nu. Similarly, when some peaceful and blissful people or elevated souls are =\r\naround you, it will have a positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the mi=\r\nnds around you does have an impact on you.\n&gt; \n&gt;           This is particula=\r\nrly true with respect to the minds of people who have genetic/kaarmik links=\r\n/debts with you. When minds of such people are in great distress or great e=\r\nxcitement, it has an impact on your mind.\n&gt; \n&gt;           If a deceased ance=\r\nstor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some strong desires and unable to =\r\nprogress to a higher loka or be reborn, his thoughts and desires will have =\r\nan impact on your mind.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Thus, we invest our mental energy pr=\r\naying for their relief. While offering balls of solid food (shraaddha) on s=\r\npecial occasions, pray that the ancestor may get an appropriate body again =\r\nto fulfil remaining desires. While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pray tha=\r\nt the ancestor&#39;s desires may be satisfied and the ancestor may be overcome =\r\nthe weaknesses. By praying for helping an ancestor, you are indirectly help=\r\ning yourself, by removing a powerful negative influence on your mind and ge=\r\ntting rid of some weaknesses.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Unfortunately, the extremely s=\r\nimple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of fashion today. However, so many peo=\r\nple will benefit tremendously if they do it atleast once every month if not=\r\n daily. Vimalananda says that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is only o=\r\nne ritual he can perform.\n&gt; \n&gt;           *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;          =\r\n Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used to perform a fire ritual and a=\r\n water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Rituals use external symbols to induce in=\r\nternal changes. These two rituals are really important and useful rituals.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;           A small comparison of homam and tarpana is reproduced from v=\r\nedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:\n&gt; \n&gt;           ------------ --------- ----=\r\n-\n&gt;           One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devat=\r\nas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the mediu=\r\nm is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whet=\r\nher watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horosco=\r\npe.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           In homam, devatas come in fire and burn your =\r\nblocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free yo=\r\nu from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited fr=\r\nom them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful=\r\n or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is stil=\r\nl having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the=\r\n connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. =\r\nYou can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that =\r\nancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new body, the th=\r\noughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consciousnes=\r\ns in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad kar=\r\nmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are very i=\r\nmportant sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n&gt;            \n&gt;           Devatas=\r\n are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identification is to wh=\r\nat is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on your individual so=\r\nul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser forms of cons=\r\nciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-identification is=\r\n with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You may note that Sun =\r\nand Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrolog=\r\ny. Fire and water are the natural media for them respectively.\n&gt;           =\r\n \n&gt;           Devas and pitris have different ways of working and influenci=\r\nng us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all of u=\r\ns and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in =\r\nfire and satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n&gt;           -------=\r\n----- --------- -----\n&gt; \n&gt;           Best regards,\n&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n-------\n&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ homam\n&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana\n&gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/=\r\nvedic- wisdom\n&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. ho=\r\nme.comcast. net\n&gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org\n&gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- \n&gt;            \n&gt;           --- In JyotishGrou=\r\np@ yahoogroups. com, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt;\n&gt;           &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;           &gt;  \n&gt;           &gt; Thanks fo=\r\nr this valuable manual.
