As a matter of fact, it was taught to Dharmaraja by \nBheeshma while the latter was of bed-ridden, lying on a bed of arrows!\n\nNormally, it is difficult to concentrate on mantra when one is physical not \nfeeling well or perfect. If one keeps up one&#39;s sadhana even when one is not \nwell and even when the body simply does not want to do any sadhana, sadhana \nat such times is far more useful to one&#39;s progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;harikishan1962&quot; &lt;harikishan1962@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, March 11, 2009 1:01 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Vishnu Sahasranama Homam\n\n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;suvarnatejas&quot; &lt;suvarnatejas@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First of all, thanks to Shri Narasimha and Shri Utpal\n&gt;&gt; for responding to my queries on how he manages to find time.\n&gt;&gt; The details are very inspiring, I hope our intellects get\n&gt;&gt; turned the right way similarly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; While we eagerly wait for a formal document on the potent Vishnu \n&gt;&gt; Sahasranama Homa Prayoga manual from Shri Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt; I wonder why we cannot do it based on  the text itself. Namely, the \n&gt;&gt; Sahasranama already has the Dhyana Sloka and other preliminaries which \n&gt;&gt; are by now very well known to most of us. So isn&#39;t it a simple matter of \n&gt;&gt; using these, doing the prana prathistha of Lord Narayana or Lord Krishna \n&gt;&gt; and then using each verse for one offering to the fire?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is also a detailed anga nyaasa procedure available here\n&gt;&gt; http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/shivkuma/personal/music/vishnu-sahasranamam-meanings.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; if one wishes to do these.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Any comments?\n&gt;&gt;  Namaskaram,\n&gt;   As you said prana prathistah  of  &quot;Narayan&quot; for Homa every day, i didn&#39;t \n&gt; read  anywhere, But  i know that starting  day of &quot;Uttarayan&quot; that is the \n&gt; next day of Makara Sankranti, 13th or 14th  of January of every year, &quot;The \n&gt; Narayana yagnam&quot; is conducting by DR.Vedavyas, at Rajahmundry, duddukuru \n&gt; venkateswara swamy temple past 45 years, i had listened that many mircles \n&gt; happened, i too tried to attend the yagna, but its not happened,\n&gt; But i am doing HOMA or YAGNA every day morning and evening starts at 5AM \n&gt; and 5PM. That i feel my stomach is homa gund, and reading vishnu \n&gt; shasranamas along with purva phittika and uttara phittika for the time of \n&gt; 29mint 30 sec. say exact 30mint, and i go to Dhyana with &quot;Asthaksari \n&gt; mantra&quot; as long as i concentrate, cause i can not move my hands and lggs, \n&gt; and  i am a bedridden, they are not in my control, only i can move my hand \n&gt; fingers. All i do this on my bed only, i don&#39;t know its correct or not? If \n&gt; any thing wrong in this please let me know.\n&gt; In my search of learning of Astrology i found Guru Narasimha ji, and i \n&gt; convinced his teachings of Astrology,\n&gt; And i request you to tell me about &quot;Vishnu sahasra nama prayoga HOMA&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanking YOU all.\n&gt; Namaskaram Narasimha ji,\n\n\n"}}
