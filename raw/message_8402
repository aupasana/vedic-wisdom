I tried today, and boy, it was hard...failed=\r\n mostly, to be honest.\n&gt; \n&gt; But every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Amma=\r\nchi, Sivananda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was =\r\nobsessed with this Name business. That means, there must be something to it=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; I really want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed wit=\r\nh the Name. I firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, and=\r\n the Name helped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long story,=\r\n but basically, I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like I=\r\n was dying...and it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Name =\r\n&quot;Keshava please help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesus =\r\nout of me, and each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; i=\r\nt&#39;s the only thing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in deep =\r\nsh*t (pardon my language), the Name alone is reliable.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I&#39;m trying=\r\n to say, is I want to devise some practical ways to get serious about this =\r\nsadhana. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sivananda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and e=\r\nspecially of Purascharana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syll=\r\nables in the mantra. Eg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24=\r\n lakh repetitions). He went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling wo=\r\nuld result in Darshan of God in physical form, face to face. That would be =\r\ngreat! Really wanted to do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that=\r\n, at the rate of 12 hours japa a day, every single day from now on, it woul=\r\nd take me till age 83 to finish this. :( \n&gt; \n&gt; But hey, I decided to make a=\r\n start anyway, and began my my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya=\r\n mantra, in January this year, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with m=\r\ny mind wandering most of the time (hard core people do hundreds of rounds w=\r\nith proper concentration daily). I&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to say the ma=\r\nntra loudly or in a barely audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradually=\r\n improving but very difficult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna t=\r\nake me till October 2013 to finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3=\r\n month break (and do 7 rounds a day), and then start another Purascharana. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, two things help me get my 11 rounds of japa done every day wh=\r\nen I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thought I&#39;d mention it, if anybody&#39;s interested, j=\r\nust in case it&#39;s helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; One is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to =\r\nmy ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the phone. While doing this, I stick my hand in =\r\nmy pocket and count the japa on my fingers. I get a couple of rounds done d=\r\nuring my working day this way (I check carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s list=\r\nening). Also while stuck in traffic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my=\r\n hands-free ear pieces on, and pretend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phon=\r\ne and do a couple of rounds. \n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing that I find useful (now =\r\nplease excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toilet japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a =\r\nround or two of japa at work, I excuse myself for a few minutes and lock my=\r\nself up in a toilet cubicle. I then very very quietly mutter the mantra to =\r\nmyself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving, no sound audible, in case anybody hea=\r\nrs). I do about 2 sessions of this a day. This allows me to complete my 11 =\r\nrounds a day, on days when my working hours are long. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know this sou=\r\nnds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention this for anyone else whose work life=\r\n interferes with their japa. At least, it provides a solution to doing a bi=\r\nt of japa at work.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybody else has any thoughts/suggestions, on ho=\r\nw to repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly share. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best wishes, and Om N=\r\namo Narayanaya, \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
