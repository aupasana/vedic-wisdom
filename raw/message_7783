These are all simple foods that are digeste=\r\nd by body easily. \n\nPlan your meals for fasting day in advance, so that you=\r\n know your options beforehand.\n\nKnow your auyvedic body type, Like vata bod=\r\ny type gets disturbed a lot. I am vata and simply could not tolerate comple=\r\nte fast (even fruit only diet). I stick to simple food now and increased de=\r\nvotion/prayer on these special days.\n\nMain thing on Ekadashi, Pradosha, Poo=\r\nrnima is what you put in your mind and heart not just in your body. \n\nFor &quot;=\r\nreduce weight&quot; Increase your metabolism Walking daily. read some ayurvedic =\r\ntips on webs. \n\nOne of my relatives went from being a fat 40yr old to looki=\r\nng absolute stud of 25yr. He eats smaller portion every 3/4hrs. Initially E=\r\nats 3/4 stomach only (absolutely no overstuffing). Last meal he takes at 7-=\r\n8pm. \n\nhope it helps\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;shankar789&quot; &lt;shankar789@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I tried fruits.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understo=\r\nod your message.

When lot of his disciples were seen missing from th=\r\ne daily devotional services, Srila Bhakti Siddhantha Saraswati Thakur (Sril=\r\na Prabhupada&#39;s Guru Maharaj) found out that most of them were lying down in=\r\n the noon. He asked them to eat khichdi (grains are not allowed on ekadasi,=\r\n still he insisted) and go ahead with the daily devotional services. He tol=\r\nd them it is essential to realize that fasting is important for devotional =\r\nservice, but it is not bigger than devotional service.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Prasad\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shankar789=\r\n&quot; &lt;shankar789@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am trying to do fasting for sadhana pu=\r\nrposes. I tried fasting on Ekadasi and could not stand missing any meal. Si=\r\nnce I failed on Ekadasi day, I attempted on Pradosham day and ended up eati=\r\nng at 1 am, since I was not able to sleep. Again I tried on Full Moon day a=\r\nnd ended up in failure. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thankful if any one offers tips for f=\r\nasting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
