&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Members\n&gt; \n&gt; I was re r=\r\neading this thread on the light of something I had come \n&gt; across very rece=\r\nntly. This is regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was \n&gt; reading a book on his l=\r\nife and various incidents connected to him  \n&gt; observed by other saints and=\r\n his brother disciples.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was the sp=\r\niritual son of \nThakur. \n&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thak=\r\nur used to say he \n&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had rei=\r\nncarnated on \n&gt; this plane.\n&gt; \n&gt; During his stay in various monastaries of =\r\nthe Ramakrishna Mission, \n&gt; often other monks used to send new initiates to=\r\n Rakhal Maharaj for \n&gt; hios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea amo=\r\nng the \ndisciples \n&gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Mahara=\r\nj will never \n&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his \n&gt; blessings =\r\nand said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a \n&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing t=\r\nhis suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you \n&gt; people always come asking =\r\nfor Brahmacharya? Was does not any one \n&gt; come to me asking me to give him/=\r\nher God? Isn&#39;t God the final aim \nof \n&gt; everything.. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible =\r\nfor someone who cannot maintain brahmacharya to \nreach \n&gt; God? I am puzzled=\r\n...\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Someone \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n else may have to first overcome his lust even to have a vision \nof \n&gt; the =\r\ndeity. \n&gt; &gt; What is good for goose is not good for gander. In general, it i=\r\ns \n&gt; good to try \n&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Several =\r\n&quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken under his wings \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa and transformed into spiritual giants. \n&gt; Swami \n&gt; &gt; Vivek=\r\nananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college \n&gt; students \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; when they met Ramakrishna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to overcome lust a=\r\nt all. Several of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; disciples also struggled with it in=\r\nitially and overcame lust \nwith \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic=\r\n human instinct and not at all \neasy \n&gt; to kill \n&gt; &gt; completely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nn the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the \n&gt; mind. Se=\r\nt a \n&gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that \n=\r\n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; maintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming \n&gt; t=\r\nhe basic \n&gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, w=\r\nhat i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires =\r\nbut remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make t=\r\nhe desire come back later. \n&gt; But, if one \n&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, th=\r\ney never end!!  This is the nature \nof \n&gt; desire. \n&gt; &gt; Whether one desires =\r\nmoney or knowledge (of anything other than \n&gt; Self) or \n&gt; &gt; physical pleasu=\r\nres, the desire will never end no matter how much \n&gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rem=\r\noving desire from the root often requires suppressing the \n&gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; te=\r\nmporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is \n&gt; that just \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing \n&gt; desires, =\r\nbut do \n&gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep \n&gt; =\r\nworking on it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for braha=\r\nmcharya is if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also =\r\ndo it , \nif\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is t=\r\nhe right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and b=\r\nrahmacharya is \n&gt; one thing. \n&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome=\r\n ego and not become \n&gt; attached to \n&gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to on=\r\ne&#39;s actions and possessions \nand \n&gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is th=\r\ne most fundamental thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual pr=\r\nogress. They all come \n&gt; together! One \n&gt; &gt; person may develop detachment t=\r\no actions and possessions and \n&gt; brahmacharya \n&gt; &gt; may become easy as a res=\r\nult. One person may achieve brahmacharya \n&gt; first and \n&gt; &gt; detachment may b=\r\necome easy as a result and come later. Various \n&gt; signs of \n&gt; &gt; spiritual p=\r\nrogress come almost together, but the exact order can \n&gt; change from \n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nerson to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability \n&gt; to get \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; something. It may be possible to work it out from another angle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n-\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jag=\r\nannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Origi=\r\nnal Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; Namaste sir\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i know you are lot busy but sin=\r\nce i couldn;t ask this question \non a\n&gt; &gt; public forum as it may probably o=\r\nffend others.\n&gt; &gt; If you have time ,if you could please reply.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I w=\r\nas thinking this for many days\n&gt; &gt; that as mentioned in recent thread on br=\r\nahamcharya,\n&gt; &gt; it was important to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to a=\r\nsk \nthat\n&gt; &gt; even vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming lust \n=\r\nthough\n&gt; &gt; he had his deity with him from the very early in life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhow can normal college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a\n&gt; &gt; deity=\r\n obtain this goal.\n&gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for f=\r\new months but\n&gt; &gt; after that i am not able to hold it ,\n&gt; &gt; and even if i m=\r\naintain some physical chastity it refuses to go \nout\n&gt; &gt; of mind\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; M=\r\noreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; &gt; suppress =\r\ndesires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it comp=\r\nletely from my mind\n&gt; &gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practi=\r\nce of \n&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progr=\r\ness in maintaing\n&gt; &gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt =\r\nridden.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya i=\r\ns if\n&gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you can also reply on V=\r\nEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my\n&gt; &gt; identity from this that woul=\r\nd be appreciable\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if what i worte offended you please delete this m=\r\nail\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
