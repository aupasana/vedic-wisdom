He is an ocean of bliss, knowledge, and mer=\r\ncy. He is the captain of your soul. He is the fountain of joy. He removes a=\r\nll your troubles, sorrows, and obstacles. He shows you the right divine pat=\r\nh.\n\nHe tears your veil of ignorance. He makes you immortal and divine. He t=\r\nransmutes your lower, diabolical nature. He gives you the rope of knowledge=\r\n, and takes you up when you are drowning in this ocean of Samsara (cycle of=\r\n birth and death). Do not consider him to be only a man. If you take him as=\r\n a man, you are a beast. Worship your Guru and bow to him with reverence.\n\n=\r\nGuru is God. A word from him is a word from God. He need not-teach anything=\r\n. Even his presence or company is elevating, inspiring, and stirring, His v=\r\nery company is self-illumination. Living in his company is spiritual educat=\r\nion. Read the Granth-saheb (the holy scripture of the Sikh religion). You w=\r\nill come to know the greatness of the Guru.\n\nMan can learn only from man, a=\r\nnd hence God teaches through a human body. In your Guru, you have your huma=\r\nn ideal of perfection. He is the pattern into which you wish to mould yours=\r\nelf. Your mind will readily be convinced that such a great soul, is fit to =\r\nbe worshipped and revered.\n\n\n\n"}}
