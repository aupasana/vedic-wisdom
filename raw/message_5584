Swami Rama in his other books a=\r\nlso has mentioned a similar thing. As you might be aware Swami rama was bro=\r\nught up the sadhus since a very early age and later on had very high experi=\r\nences with Mahavatar babaji.\n\nSwami rama always held the Guru in very high =\r\nesteeem but often noticed the disciples just took to blind worship of the g=\r\nuru instead of striving for internal change. It is a very valid path if the=\r\n disciple can offer himself completely that if the guru commands him to cut=\r\n off his head ...the disciple should do so in a twinkling of an eye. But mo=\r\ndern rational thinking disciples only have maybe 20% of the bhakti and ofte=\r\nn put on a show of bhakti.This kind of bhakti is very dangerous ..in fact i=\r\ns detrimental to progress.\n\nSwami Rama like Swami Vivekananda and Yogananda=\r\n was a man of action and he often gave a call to rise oneself through one&#39;s=\r\n own efforts.\n\nThe analogy of the Guru being a boat and need to respect the=\r\n guru instead of worshipping the guru flows from the same philosophy.\n\nIf o=\r\nne can offer oneself in the fire of devotion completely like a moth smitten=\r\n by fire as Vimalananda says in the aghora books like a forlon lover torn b=\r\ny intense passion for the diety or guru ....he/she does not need any more r=\r\nituals /understanding or procedures.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Sri Narasimha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. In Living with Himalayan Masters book, Swam=\r\ni Rama compare Guru with a boat that helps one crossing the river, also say=\r\ns that we need to respect the guru and need not or rather not worship the g=\r\nuru, logical!!?? In the Contrast we all do worship the gurus such as Rama K=\r\nrishna, Shirdi Saibaba etc. Confused :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
