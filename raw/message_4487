In China, he is known as the Loving or Friendly One. He is\n&gt; based o=\r\nn an eccentric Chinese Ch&#39;an (Zen) monk who lived over 1,000 years\n&gt; ago an=\r\nd has become a significant part of Buddhist and Shinto culture. Because\n&gt; o=\r\nf this monk&#39;s benevolent nature, he came to be regarded as an incarnation\n&gt;=\r\n of the bodhisattva who will be Maitreya (the Future Buddha). His large\n&gt; p=\r\nrotruding stomach and jolly smile have given him the common designation\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nLaughing Buddha.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was truly a great zen master and legend has a gre=\r\nat story which is so\n&gt; inspirational for all of us.\n&gt; \n&gt; The jolly good sai=\r\nnt that he was used to go from one place to the other. He\n&gt; went to the Tow=\r\nn Square and soon people gathered around him. He was so funny\n&gt; looking and=\r\n always smiling that people used to crowd around him.\n&gt; \n&gt; He would then di=\r\nstribute sweets and small toys to all children who had\n&gt; gathered around hi=\r\nm. Then keep his bag down, look to the sky and just start\n&gt; laughing. He us=\r\ned to laugh madly and he was not interested whether other\n&gt; laughed or not.=\r\n Soon his laughter used to be contagious and all who had\n&gt; gathered would s=\r\ntart to laugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; The whole town used to laugh and laugh.After sometime h=\r\ne would pick the bag,\n&gt; which he had kept down, smile to all, and go to the=\r\n next town. All his life\n&gt; he did only this action and it was said that man=\r\ny people attained Nirvana,\n&gt; enlightenment just through this process.Hence =\r\nhe was called as the laughing\n&gt; Buddha because Buddha is someone who is enl=\r\nightened and laughter was his\n&gt; unique method. Never before him or never af=\r\nter him such a simple aspect was\n&gt; used to achieve what all humans strive f=\r\nor-moksha or enlightenment.\n&gt; \n&gt; He would rarely speak and once when he was=\r\n asked to describe his method he\n&gt; told, that he gave sweets to children to=\r\n symbolically that the more you\n&gt; give, the more comes to you. Thereby he u=\r\nnveiled the secret of &quot;Giving with\n&gt; joy&quot;. Children are said to be GOD beca=\r\nuse they represent the GOD Nature,\n&gt; which is always, be in Present time, s=\r\nmiling and joyful, ego less, and most\n&gt; important is without judge mental m=\r\nind.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bag represented problems that all humans encounter. We are mi=\r\nstaken that\n&gt; when we have problems, that GOD only gave you a problem and t=\r\nhe rest are so\n&gt; happy. The problems appear big because we are associated w=\r\nith it- calling it\n&gt; as &quot;My Problem&quot;. Look at a funny phenomenon, if anyone=\r\n comes to you with any\n&gt; problem of theirs and seek solutions or advice, wh=\r\nat you do. You tell them\n&gt; so many solutions so easily as though you are an=\r\n expert in all the fields in\n&gt; the Universe. However big the others problem=\r\ns are you can solve it so\n&gt; easily, you are a master solver of problems. Bu=\r\nt then what happens to your\n&gt; own problems. Hmm Hmm it is impossible to fin=\r\nd any solution.\n&gt; \n&gt; This happens only because of your attachment and assoc=\r\niation with the\n&gt; problem.So laughing Buddha said, simple keep your problem=\r\n down (symbolically\n&gt; keeping the bag down) means &quot;Disassociate with your P=\r\nroblem&quot;, &quot;Separate form\n&gt; it&quot; and yes just Laugh. What else can one do? Thi=\r\nnk and thank GOD that you\n&gt; only have such a small problem as compared to s=\r\no many others. Whether you\n&gt; laugh or cry the problem is going to be there =\r\nright. So why not laugh at it.\n&gt; Therein is the magic and mind you no small=\r\n magic, it is huge, apply it to\n&gt; realize about the power of laughter.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n On laughing your whole internal chemistry changes and thereby the body\n&gt; p=\r\nroduces certain enzymes that are only released in a state of laughter. The\n=\r\n&gt; problem now looks too tiny and as you pick it (symbolically he picks back=\r\n\n&gt; the bag before going to the next place) the problem is solved.\n&gt; \n&gt; Such=\r\n a great zen master was Hotei or Laughing Buddha. So next time you look\n&gt; a=\r\nt the statue of &quot;laughing Buddha&quot; associate with that great teaching he\n&gt; g=\r\nave all of us, the power of laughter. Each time you see the Laughing Buddha=\r\n\n&gt; and if it reminds you to laugh, a great work has been done.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whole l=\r\nife Hotei lived in Laughter. And when the time came to pass away, he\n&gt; knew=\r\n he had to give up his life at an appropriate time. He called his\n&gt; discipl=\r\nes and said that after he passes away, they should immediately burn\n&gt; his b=\r\nody. The disciples were surprised because there was no tradition of\n&gt; burni=\r\nng in Zen. But they followed the master wishes. And as they lit fire to\n&gt; h=\r\nis body, &quot;Fire Works and Crackers&quot; started flying all over.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hotei was =\r\nso great that just before he died he hid a lot of crackers and\n&gt; rockets in=\r\n his clothes. So there also he created such laughter by the\n&gt; suddenness of=\r\n the situation.So Hotei not only lived in laughter all through\n&gt; his life, =\r\nhe also died in laughter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us all learn from the great zen master t=\r\nhat &quot;It is our birth right to\n&gt; laugh&quot; and &quot;No matter what happens we shoul=\r\nd come back to laughter&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sources:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)\n&gt; http://knol.google.com/k/=\r\nsuresh-padmanabhan/the-secret-of-the-laughing-buddha/2nqmhj0tby0on/5#\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budai\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
