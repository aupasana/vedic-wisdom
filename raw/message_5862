G. Krishna Warrier\nPublished by The Theosophical Publ=\r\nishing House, Chennai\n\nThe body is fivefold in nature (the five elements), =\r\nexisting in the five,\ndepending on the six (tastes of food), connected with=\r\n the six qualities\n(kama etc.,), seven Dhatus, three impurities, three Yoni=\r\ns (of excretion) and\nfour kinds of food.\n\nWhy say =E2=80=98Fivefold in natu=\r\nre ?=E2=80=99 The five elements Earth, Water, Fire, Wind\nand Ether. In this=\r\n body, whatever is hard is of Earth, liquid is water, warm\nis fire, whateve=\r\nr moves about is air and space-enclosed is ether. The\nfunction of the Earth=\r\n is to support, water is to consolidate (digestion\netc.,). Fire is to see, =\r\nwind is for moving, Ether is to give space (for\nvital functions).\n\nThe eyes=\r\n are used in seeing form, ears for sound, tongue for taste, the skin\nand no=\r\nse for touch and smell respectively; genital for pleasure, Apana is\nfor eva=\r\ncuation (of bowels). The person cognises through the intellect, wills\nwith =\r\nthe mind and speaks with the tongue.\n\nThe six-fold support is the six taste=\r\ns (of food): sweet, acid, salty,\npungent, bitter and astringent.\n\n8. The em=\r\nbryo lying (in the womb) for (a day) and night is a confused mass;\nafter se=\r\nven days it becomes a bubble; after a fortnight, a mass and in a\nmonth, it =\r\nhardens. In two months develops the region of the head; in three\nmonths, th=\r\ne feet; in the fourth, belly and hip; in the fifth, the backbone;\nin the si=\r\nxth, nose, eyes and ears; in the seventh the embryo quickens with\nlife and =\r\nin the eighth month, it becomes complete.\n\n9. By the dominance of the fathe=\r\nr=E2=80=99s semen, the child becomes male; the\nmother=E2=80=99s =E2=80=93 f=\r\nemale. When equal, a eunuch. If, at the time of impregnation,\nthe parents a=\r\nre agitated, the child will be blind, crippled, hunch-backed or\nstunted in =\r\ngrowth. If the couple have vital-air-trouble, the semen enters in\ntwo parts=\r\n resulting in twins.\n\n10. In the eighth month, in conjunction with the five=\r\n vital airs the Jiva\ngets the capacity to know its past affairs (of past bi=\r\nrths), conceives of\nthe imperishable Atman as Om, through perfect knowledge=\r\n and meditation.\nHaving known Om he sees in the body the eight Prakritis de=\r\nrived from it the\nfive elements, mind, intellect and ego and the sixteen ch=\r\nanges [see\nPrasnopanishad].\n\n11. The body becomes complete in the ninth mon=\r\nth and remembers the past\nbirth. Actions done and not done flash to him and=\r\n he recognises the good and\nbad nature of Karma.\n\n19. Why is the body so ca=\r\nlled ? It has three fires: the Kosthagni ripens all\nthat is eaten; the Dars=\r\nanagni helps one see colour etc., the Jnanagni is the\nmind which helps perf=\r\norm good and bad deeds.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.org/108upanishads/garb=\r\nha.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636164b298e9da4049ced352d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Translated by Dr. A.
