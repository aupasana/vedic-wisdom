When you know ahead that the \nmoney will be misused, do not give to that person. When you do not know, \ntake a chance and give it.\n\nIf you donate with pride and ego, the negative effect of the bad deeds done \nwith that money are increased. If you donate without pride and thinking that \ngod is using you to give god&#39;s money to god, then the negative effects of \nthe bad deeds done with that money are minimized.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 05, 2009 3:18 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Which is a big sin/karma\n\n\n&gt; Namaskaram Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have once heard from one of your Astrology classes (mo3 files) that when \n&gt; you donate money to the beggars you might get bad karma (becasue of the \n&gt; misuse of that money by them), i have stopped  giving money to all those \n&gt; road side beggars now.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, in my mind i&#39;m having a bad feeling for not giving them money \n&gt; whenever i see them asking me for alms. Again the thought of accruing \n&gt; unnecessary karma..is stopping me. Can you plese clarify which is a big \n&gt; sin / karma of these two. (karma of not giving alms to those beggars vs \n&gt; getting karma of their misuse).\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Krishna Kanth\n&gt;\n&gt; P.S: I totally agree with your point of the bad karma becuase of misuse of \n&gt; the money we donate, but this is putting in a fix with the thought that \n&gt; probably i&#39;m not able to help the really needy guys (i typically only use \n&gt; to give money to very disabled and elderly people).\n\n\n"}}
