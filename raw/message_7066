By no more than this instructio=\r\nn, the fortunate one\nattains tranquillity. 16.3\n\nHappiness belongs to noone=\r\n but that supremely lazy man for whom even opening\nand closing his eyes is =\r\na bother. 16.4\n\nWhen the mind is freed from such pairs of opposites as, &quot;I =\r\nhave done this,&quot;\nand &quot;I have not done that,&quot; it becomes indifferent to meri=\r\nt, wealth,\nsensuality and liberation. 16.5\n\nOne man is abstemious and avers=\r\ne to the senses, another is greedy and\nattached to them, but he who is free=\r\n from both taking and rejecting is\nneither abstemious nor greedy. 16.6\n\nSo =\r\nlong as desire, the state of lack of discrimination, remains, the sense\nof =\r\nrevulsion and attraction will remain, which is the root and branch of\nsamsa=\r\nra. 16.7\n\nDesire springs from usage, and aversion from abstension, but the =\r\nwise man is\nfree from the pairs of opposites like a child, and becomes esta=\r\nblished. 16.8\n\nThe passionate man wants to eliminate samsara so as to avoid=\r\n pain, but the\ndispassionate man is free from pain and feels no distress ev=\r\nen in it. 16.9\n\nHe who is proud about even liberation or his own body, and =\r\nfeels them his\nown, is neither a seer nor a yogi. He is still just a suffer=\r\ner.16.10\n\nIf even Shiva, Vishnu, or the lotus-born Brahma were your instruc=\r\ntor, until\nyou have forgotten everything you cannot be established within. =\r\n16.11\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nHe who is content, with purified senses, and alwa=\r\nys enjoys solitude, has\ngained the fruit of knowledge and the fruit of the =\r\npractice of yoga too.\n17.1\n\nThe knower of truth is never distressed in this=\r\n world, for the whole round\nworld is full of himself alone. 17.2\n\nNone of t=\r\nhese senses please a man who has found satisfaction within,just as\nNimba le=\r\naves do not please the elephant that has acquired the taste for\nSallaki lea=\r\nves. 17.3\n\nThe man is rare who is not attached to the things he has enjoyed=\r\n, and does\nnot hanker after the things he has not enjoyed. 17.4\n\nThose who =\r\ndesire pleasure and those who desire liberation are both found in\nsamsara, =\r\nbut the great-souled man who desires neither pleasure nor\nliberation is rar=\r\ne indeed. 17.5\n\nIt is only the noble-minded who is free from attraction or =\r\nrepulsion to\nreligion, wealth, sensuality, and life and death too. 17.6\n\nHe=\r\n feels no desire for the elimination of all this, nor anger at its\ncontinui=\r\nng, so the fortunate man lives happily with whatever sustinence\npresents it=\r\nself. 17.7\n\nThus fulfilled through this knowledge, contented, and with the =\r\nthinking mind\nemptied, he lives happily just seeing, hearing, feeling, smel=\r\nling, and\ntasting. 17.8\n\nIn him for whom the ocean of samsara has dried up,=\r\n there is neither\nattachment or aversion. His gaze is vacant, his behaviour=\r\n purposeless,and\nhis senses inactive. 17.9\n\nSurely the supreme state is eve=\r\nrywhere for the liberated mind. He is neither\nawake nor asleep, and neither=\r\n opens nor closes his eyes. 17.10\n\nThe liberated man is resplendent everywh=\r\nere, free from all desires.\nEverywhere he appears self-possessed and pure o=\r\nf heart. 17.11\n\nSeeing, hearing, feeling, smelling, tasting, speaking, and =\r\nwalking about,\nthe great-souled man who is freed from trying to achieve or =\r\navoid anything\nis free indeed. 17.12\n\nThe liberated man is free from desire=\r\ns everywhere. He neither blames,\npraises, rejoices, is disappointed, gives,=\r\n nor takes. 17.13\n\nWhen a great-souled one is unperturbed in mind, and equa=\r\nlly self-possessed\nat either the sight of a woman inflamed with desire or a=\r\nt approaching death,\nhe is truly liberated. 17.14\n\nThere is no distinction =\r\nbetween pleasure and pain, man and woman, success\nand failure for the wise =\r\nman who looks on everything as equal. 17.15\n\nThere is no aggression nor com=\r\npassion, no pride nor humility, no wonder nor\nconfusion for the man whose d=\r\nays of samsara are over. 17.16\n\nThe liberated man is not averse to the sens=\r\nes nor is he attached to them. He\nenjoys hinself continually with an unatta=\r\nched mind in both success and\nfailure. 17.17\n\nOne established in the Absolu=\r\nte state with an empty mind does not know the\nalternatives of inner stillne=\r\nss and lack of inner stillness, and of good and\nevil. 17.18\n\nA man free of =\r\n&quot;me&quot; and &quot;mine&quot; and of a sense of responsibility, aware that\n&quot;Nothing exist=\r\ns,&quot; with all desires extinguished within, does not act even in\nacting. 17.1=\r\n9\n\nHe whose thinking mind is dissolved achieves the indescribable state and=\r\n is\nfree from the mental display of delusion, dream, and ignorance. 17.20\n\n=\r\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nPraise be to That by the awareness of which delusion its=\r\nelf becomes\ndream-like, to that which is pure happiness, peace, and light. =\r\n18.1\n\nOne may get all sorts of pleasure by the acquisition of various objec=\r\nts of\nenjoyment, but one cannot be happy except by the renunciation of ever=\r\nything.\n18.2\n\nHow can there be happiness, for one who has been burnt inside=\r\n by the\nblistering sun of the pain of thinking that there are things that s=\r\ntill need\ndoing, without the rain of the nectar of peace? 18.3\n\nThis existe=\r\nnce is just imagination. It is nothing in reality, but there is\nno non-bein=\r\ng for natures that know how to distinguish being from nonbeing.\n18.4\n\nThe r=\r\nealm of one&#39;s self is not far away, nor can it be achieved by the\naddition =\r\nof limitations to its nature. It is unimaginable, effortless,\nunchanging, a=\r\nnd spotless. 18.5\n\nBy the simple elimination of delusion and the recognitio=\r\nn of one&#39;s true\nnature, those whose vision is unclouded live free from sorr=\r\now. 18.6\n\nKnowing everything as just imagination, and himself as eternally =\r\nfree, how\nshould the wise man behave like a fool? 18.7\n\nKnowing himself to =\r\nbe God, and being and non-being just imagination, what\nshould the man free =\r\nfrom desire learn, say, or do? 18.8\n\nConsiderations like &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I =\r\nam not this&quot; are finished for the yogi\nwho has gone silent realising &quot;Every=\r\nthing is myself.&quot; 18.9\n\nFor the yogi who has found peace, there is no distr=\r\naction or\none-pointedness, no higher knowledge or ignorance, no pleasure an=\r\nd no pain.\n18.10\n\nThe dominion of heaven or beggary, gain or loss, life amo=\r\nng men or in the\nforest, these make no difference to a yogi whose nature it=\r\n is to be free\nfrom distinctions. 18.11\n\nThere are no religious obligations=\r\n, wealth, sensuality, or discrimination\nfor a yogi free from such opposites=\r\n as &quot;I have done this,&quot; and &quot;I have not\ndone that.&quot; 18.12\n\nThere is nothing=\r\n needing to be done or any attachment in his heart for the\nyogi liberated w=\r\nhile still alive. Things things will last just to the end of\nlife. 18.13\n\nT=\r\nhere is no delusion, world, meditation on That, or liberation for the\npacif=\r\nied great soul. All these things are just the realm of\nimagination.18.14\n\nH=\r\ne by whom all this is seen may well make out it doesn&#39;t exist, but what is\n=\r\nthe desireless one to do? Even in seeing it he does not see it. 18.15\n\nHe b=\r\ny whom the Supreme Brahma is seen may think &quot;I am Brahma,&quot; but what is\nhe t=\r\no think who is without thought, and who sees no duality? 18.16\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00235447143cc9080104a9f72f00\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAshtavakra said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;My son,=\r\n you may recite or listen to countless scriptures, but you will not be esta=\r\nblished within until you can forget everything. 16.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You may,=\r\n as a learned man, indulge in wealth, activity, and meditation, but your mi=\r\nnd will still long for that which is the cessation of desire, and beyond al=\r\nl goals. 16.2&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Everyone is in pain because of their striving to ach=\r\nieve something, but noone realises it.
