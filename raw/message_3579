It is said in\nthe Bhagavat that Avadhuta  made twenty-four Gurus.\n\nThe kite was one of them. In a certain place some fishermen were catching\nfish, a kite swooped down and snatched a fish. Seeing the kite with the fish\nin its claw, hundreds of crows flew after him and began to caw, making a\ngreat noise.\n\nIn whatever direction the kite flew, the crows followed. When he flew to the\nsouth, they pursued him; when he flew to the north, they were after him, and\nhe found no peace in any direction. At last the kite dropped the fish. Then\nthe crows flew after the fish and the kite rested calmly on the branch of a\nhigh tree.\n\nHe thought within himself: &quot;That fish was the cause of all this trouble. Now\nthat I no longer have it, I am happy and in perfect peace.&quot; The Avadhuta\nlearned from this kite that as long as a man is attached to worldly objects,\nso long he has toil, cares, anxiety, unrest and unhappiness. When attachment\nis gone, all works end, and then comes peace. But work without attachment is\ngood; it does not bring unrest.
