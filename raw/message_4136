Normally, the mind is active and jubili=\r\nant when Moon is strong! So, we can perform activities involving creativity=\r\n and focus when Moon is strong, i.e. on Full moon days.\n\nif a person enjoys=\r\n doing sadhana, since Mind is already in joyfull state, it would perhaps co=\r\noperate easily.\n\nNo moon day on the other hand is very conducive to severe =\r\nsadhana where sadhaka may experiance situations akin to death of mind. A jo=\r\nyful person is unlikely to submit self to death where as a person in sorry =\r\nstate may renounce the world more easily.\n\nConjuction of Moon with Rahu, Ke=\r\nthu, Mandi, etc. are also good for sadhana.\n\nHow ever, the time of the sadh=\r\nana matters only after we achieve a state where we deserve some experiances=\r\n. As long as we long for them, we won&#39;t be ready for them!\n\nBest regards,\nV=\r\nijay\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste:\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought New Moon day is suppose to be good for =\r\nmeditation/sadhana, as new\n&gt; moon phenomenon is taken as the symbol of the =\r\nmerger of the mind (moon) with\n&gt; the soul (sun). This state of existence is=\r\n called amohavasam (a life bereft\n&gt; of all desires), and hence the name Ama=\r\nvasi.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand during Pournami, moon has power to to excite (=\r\ne.g., tides)\n&gt; and make people run berserk !\n&gt; \n&gt; But I do know Guru Pourna=\r\nmi is considered as very auspicious.

Therefore choosing different\n&gt; &gt; times=\r\n for meditation may make a difference. I have not heard that full moon\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmeditation is particularly useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Under western astrology, there a=\r\nre certain planetary aspects that enhance\n&gt; &gt; various activities. These var=\r\ny according to the planets and angles involved.\n&gt; &gt; Meditation may fall int=\r\no this category. Again, these times may or may not\n&gt; &gt; have to do with full=\r\n moon cycles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether the masses are becoming less spiritual is not=\r\n something to which I\n&gt; &gt; can attest, yet I believe that belief in the reli=\r\ngion of science, as\n&gt; &gt; epitomied by Scientific American, helps to lessen m=\r\nodern people&#39;s belief in\n&gt; &gt; traditional ways. The publishers of that magaz=\r\nine have an agenda, which is\n&gt; &gt; to diminish people&#39;s belief in traditions =\r\nand to separate them from living\n&gt; &gt; according to traditional calendars and=\r\n schemes of time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards, Jacques\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Wed, 7/4/10, vem=\r\nparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;*wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: vemparlar=\r\namkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Full Moon ef=\r\nfect on Meditation\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Received: Wedne=\r\nsday, 7 April, 2010, 4:33 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha ji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hav=\r\ne read the advice of many spiritual masters and other seers say that\n&gt; &gt; an=\r\n full moon meditation is very beneficial . Also related to this is the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nquestion of how do planets really affect us , Vimalananda in the aghora\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n books says it is through the rasa or food that is ingested by us.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI know science does not yet possess the right tools to measure this\n&gt; &gt; phe=\r\nnomena and einstein&#39;s grand search for a unified filed theory and the\n&gt; &gt; u=\r\nniversal particle is still ongoing and might take ages for modern science\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to understand the workings of even a commonplace phenomena like gravitat=\r\nion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However a simple test like admission rates in a mental aslyum =\r\nshould hold\n&gt; &gt; up to proof if the moon is truly having a effect on humans.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.scientif icamerican. com/article. cfm?id=3Dlunacy- and-=\r\nthe-full-\n&gt; &gt; moon&lt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=3Dlunac=\r\ny-and-the-full-moon&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This article in the scientific american fi=\r\nnds no such correlation. ..also\n&gt; &gt; there have been many studies in the pas=\r\nt some for and some against this\n&gt; &gt; correlation effect but none of them fo=\r\nund a strong evidence.... And always\n&gt; &gt; there is the risk of mistaking cor=\r\nrelation as causation in any experiment.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is just out of curiosit=\r\ny that am asking this question...Does astrology\n&gt; &gt; matter at all for a ser=\r\nious sadhaka. Can not any day /time or hour be picked\n&gt; &gt; for worship. If t=\r\nhe relationship with the deity is truly personal why should\n&gt; &gt; one even co=\r\nnsider the nava grahas in the ritual worship. I increasingly find\n&gt; &gt; that =\r\nastrology is only serving to discourage the masses rather than pointing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n them in the direction of worship of divinity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope you could throw=\r\n some light on this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
