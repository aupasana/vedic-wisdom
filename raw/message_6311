Fire=\r\n is Sun&#39;s representative on earth. The more people doing \n&gt; fire ritual and=\r\n giving back to Sun god, the better it is for maintaining \n&gt; our world smoo=\r\nthly. The more the merrier.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even starting a fire, sitting in front of =\r\nit with reverence and a sense \n&gt; of sacredness, making a few offerings to f=\r\nire even without any words and \n&gt; meditating in front of fire, is sufficien=\r\nt and conducive to spiritual \n&gt; progress. The steps we use in fire ritual a=\r\nre designed to promote that \n&gt; sense of sacredness and reverence and focus.=\r\n Feel free to use the steps \n&gt; that make sense to you. But the key is to ha=\r\nve the sense of sacredness \n&gt; and reverence for fire, the belief that god i=\r\ns in fire and devotion to \n&gt; god. If that is there to some extent to start =\r\nwith, fire will amplify it \n&gt; and increase it in the long run.\n&gt; \n&gt; For Nar=\r\nasimha homam, use &quot;kShrAM&quot; as beeja, &quot;kShrIM&quot; as shakti and \n&gt; &quot;kShraum&quot; as=\r\n keelaka. Use &quot;kShrAM&quot;, &quot;kShrIM&quot;, &quot;kShrUM&quot;, &quot;kShraiM&quot;, \n&gt; &quot;kShrauM&quot;, &quot;kShra=\r\nH&quot; as the six syllables for Anganyasa and repeat for \n&gt; Karanyaasa. There a=\r\nre many mantras that can be used for the pradhaana \n&gt; homam. Examples are &quot;=\r\nOM namo naarasiMhaaya&quot;, &quot;OM namo bhagavate \n&gt; naarasiMhaaya&quot;, &quot;OM ugraM vIr=\r\naM...&quot;, Narasimha Karavalamba stotra, \n&gt; Narasimha&#39;s 108 names, Narasimha&#39;s=\r\n 12 names given by Prahlada etc. Use \n&gt; the one you feel attachment to.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Yes, Chaturdasi is mostly on Sunday in the west and Monday in India. Do \n=\r\n&gt; it when Chaturdasi tithi is active.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;=\r\n ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, May 12, 2011 at 6:03=\r\n AM, truraja4real wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hari Om Shri Narasimha ji and others,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I finally did my first homam in the fire pit I purified and painted to \n&gt;=\r\n match the 3 gunas.

I know the beej mantra=\r\n is \n&gt; kshraum but I am not sure if we can use that in all of anganyas and =\r\n\n&gt; karanyas ?\n&gt; We should observe this vrat on Sunday in the West, correct?=\r\n and would \n&gt; the best time for homam be in the twilight when Lord Narasing=\r\nha \n&gt; appeared?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
