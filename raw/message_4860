For unmarried women, we use father&#39;s gotra.\n(2) Yes, you repeat with g=\r\notra and name changed.\n \nPitri tarpana and homam are two very useful ritual=\r\ns. In homam, you are reaching out to beings that strongly identify with sou=\r\nl (Sun, fire). In pitri tarpana, you are reaching out to beings that strong=\r\nly identify with mind (Moon, water). Though homam can be done to pitris (th=\r\ney have a soul too) and tarpana can be done to devas (they have a mind too)=\r\n, homam to devas and tarpana to pitris is the most important.\n \nIf one of t=\r\nhe ancestors has some blocking karmas and his/her mind got stuck due to tho=\r\nse desires, that can affect one&#39;s mind due to the kaarmik debt. When water =\r\n(mind) with sesame seeds (blocking karmas) is released through certain chak=\r\nras in the palm with thoughts of freeing an ancestor filling the mind, it c=\r\nan free one&#39;s mind from the effects of the blocking karmas by that ancestor=\r\n. Pitri tarpana is a very simple ritual that can help considerably.\n \nBest =\r\nregards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n \n---- Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;=\r\n wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Rao Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am referring to the Pitru Tarpa=\r\nna manual you have written and made available \n&gt; online. You have a section=\r\n in that manual for custom mantras for specific \n&gt; ancestors who may be dea=\r\nd such as fathers mother or mothers father etc. Within \n&gt; those specific ma=\r\nntras, the gotras need to be mentioned. When the deceased \n&gt; ancestor is a =\r\nwoman, what should the gotra be....is this the gotra of the family \n&gt; she i=\r\ns married in (if married) or is this the gotra of the family she was born \n=\r\n&gt; in?\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, if there are more than one person of a certain relatio=\r\nn who is dead, \n&gt; does the mantra for this relation have to be repeated tho=\r\nse many times? For \n&gt; example, if there 2 Mothers brothers who have past aw=\r\nay, should I repeat the \n&gt; specific mantra for Mothers Brother twice (one f=\r\nor each who has past away).\n&gt; \n&gt; If you remember me sir....back in Feb, we =\r\nhad a few email exchanges with respect \n&gt; to the weekly havan that I perfor=\r\nm based on your manual.
