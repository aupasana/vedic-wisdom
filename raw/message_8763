Hmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to b=\r\ne performing some kind of Agni karya at your home regularly.\n\nMyself: Yes (=\r\nI was actually very surprised by this pointed question because I had not to=\r\nld anybody about the havan I did at home)\n\nPrashNa conductor: There are cer=\r\ntain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samit=\r\nh materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.\n\nMyself: Yes I am us=\r\ning Til (sesame seeds).\n\nPrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleas=\r\nt a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n\nMyself: Ok. And what is =\r\nthe dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n\nPrashNa conductor: Do you do requir=\r\ned Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra =\r\nthat you use for your regular japa?\n\nMyself: What?... Required Japa? Is the=\r\nre a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n\nPr=\r\nashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is =\r\nfor every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified =\r\nfor one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recit=\r\nations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n\nMyself: =\r\nDoesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book=\r\n - as everybody in this group is already familiar with that book series)\n\nP=\r\nrashNa conductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanti=\r\nng. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to f=\r\nollow it strictly.\n\nThe conversation went onto several other things. Subseq=\r\nuently I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciti=\r\nng that mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per =\r\nthe above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual p=\r\nrogress since. \n\nWhether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with =\r\nme or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to p=\r\nerform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qual=\r\nification&quot; for the ahuti.\n\nRegards,\nAshutosh\n\n\n"}}
