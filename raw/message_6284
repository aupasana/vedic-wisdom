From their point of view, those\nac=\r\ntions have results, because in their view the sage is embodied.\n\nBut this i=\r\ns only in some stray contexts. More emphatically in many places\nthe Vedanta=\r\ns support the teaching of the sages.\n\n646 The vedantic text, =E2=80=98The p=\r\nleasant and unpleasant effects [of actions] do\nnot affect the sage, who dwe=\r\nlls bodiless as the Self,=E2=80=99 shows the\nunfruitfulness of the actions =\r\nof the sage.\n\nThis is also confirmed by the following from the Yoga Vasisht=\r\nam.\n\n647 Even when a sage=E2=80=99s body is cut or burnt, there is no swerv=\r\ning from his\nreal nature, just as jaggery [raw, brown sugar] does not lose =\r\nits natural\nsweetness even when powdered or boiled over fire.\n\nA practical =\r\ninstance of this occurred when Bhagavan, who had cancer of the\nleft arm, fi=\r\nnally submitted to an extensive operation, which was insisted\nupon by the s=\r\nurgeons and doctors sent for by the ashram authorities.\nBhagavan did not ha=\r\nve any anaesthetic, and the operation lasted for nearly\nthree hours.If he f=\r\nelt the pain, he did not show it.\n\nLater, when asked about the pain, he quo=\r\nted the verse from the Yoga\nVasishtam whose meaning has been given above.\n\n=\r\nThere were other instances in his life which showed his unlimited power of\n=\r\nendurance of pain. The Bhagavad Gita has this line: =E2=80=98Remaining wher=\r\nein, he\nis not shaken [from his natural state] even by great pain.=E2=80=99=\r\n\n\nAll this would suffice to show that the sage is really bodiless, that he =\r\nis\nthus truly asanga, unattached, as the Self is said to be in the Upanisha=\r\nds.\n\nThis raises the question of the apparent distinction between the two k=\r\ninds\nof deliverance spoken of: deliverance with the body and deliverance wi=\r\nthout\nthe body, the former being supposed to be the state in which the body=\r\n\ncontinues to live, and the latter after the body=E2=80=99s death. To this =\r\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s\nanswer is given in the following verse.\n\n648 In conformi=\r\nty with the beliefs of the ignorant, two kinds of deliverance\nare stated, o=\r\nne with the body [jivanmukti] and another without the body\n[videhamukti]. R=\r\neally, no free one has a body. All deliverance is bodiless.\n\nWhat is meant =\r\nis that though the body remains alive, the sage is unattached,\nbecause his =\r\ncausal body, which is ignorance, has been destroyed. Without\nthis, there is=\r\n nothing to connect the real Self, which the sage is, with the\nsubtle and t=\r\nhe gross bodies.\n\nNow the question of the prarabdha karma is resumed.\n\n649 =\r\nThe power of the prarabdha karma extends only to the body; it does not\naffe=\r\nct the Self. Since his body has been surrendered to prarabdha by the\nsage, =\r\nhow can he be affected by the karma?\n\n650 =E2=80=98The sage, having given o=\r\nver his body to prarabdha karma, remains in his\nown state without the sense=\r\n of =E2=80=9Cmineness=E2=80=9D in the body.=E2=80=99 Thus, the great Guru\nS=\r\nankara has shown the truth of this in his Manisha Panchakam.\n\nThe truth tha=\r\nt the real Self is unattached is further elucidated.\n\n651 If it is said tha=\r\nt the subtle body of the sage survives, [the answer is\nthat] since the caus=\r\nal body consisting of ignorance has been extinguished,\nhow can there be att=\r\nachment of the sage [the Self] to the subtle body?\n\n652 Since Brahman is un=\r\nattached, so is the sage, who also appears to be in\nsamsara, like the sky. =\r\nHence, the changes in the body and in the mind do not\ntouch the sage.\n\n653 =\r\nThe sage, who is wide-awake in his own natural state [as the Self], is\nsaid=\r\n to be like one soundly asleep in a carriage. The body is likened to a\ncarr=\r\niage, and the ten sense organs are likened to the horses [of the\ncarriage].=\r\n\n\n654 The sleeper in the carriage does not know anything about the going, t=\r\nhe\nstopping and the unyoking of the horses [of the carriage]. Just so, the =\r\nsage\nwho is asleep [to the world] in the carriage, the body, does not know =\r\nits\nchanging conditions.\n\n655 But the sage, being immersed in his natural s=\r\namadhi, is seen by the\nignorant as if he were doing actions and going throu=\r\ngh various [bodily or\nmental] conditions. Seeing these, the undiscriminatin=\r\ng ones are confused.\n\n656 It appears to the ignorant that he has three dist=\r\ninct states, sleep,\nsamadhi and bodily activities, and the ignorant one thi=\r\nnks that these are\ndistinct from one another.\n\n657 But the sage is always t=\r\nhe same. His state is one of eternal samadhi.\nThis samadhi [of his] is not =\r\nin any way hindered in the least by actions,\nnor are actions hindered in th=\r\ne least by the samadhi.\n\nSamadhi is the state of awareness of the Self alon=\r\ne.\n\nIf the sage remains in samadhi all the time, how can actions be perform=\r\ned?\nThe answer is given in the verses that follow:\n\n658 There are two thoug=\r\nht-free samadhis. One is called kevala, the other is\ncalled sahaja [natural=\r\n]. By attaining kevala one does not become a sage. He\nalone is a sage who i=\r\ns firmly established in sahaja.\n\nThese two are further distinguished and ex=\r\nplained in the verses that follow.\n\n659 The kevala samadhi mentioned here i=\r\ns one that comes to a yogi by the\nmind going into latency. For him, it is w=\r\nell known that there are two\ndistinct states, samadhi [introvertedness] and=\r\n coming back [to the common\nwaking of samsara].\n\nIt has been shown before t=\r\nhat mental quiescence is of two kinds: latency and\ncomplete and final extin=\r\nction, and that the latter alone leads to sagehood.\nThis makes all the diff=\r\nerence, as shown below.\n\n660 The yogi=E2=80=99s mind, in his samadhi, remai=\r\nns latent with all its vasanas.\nAfter remaining for a very long time, it is=\r\n brought out to samsara by a\nvasana.\n\n661 When he is thrown out from the sa=\r\nmadhi, he resumes samsara just where he\nleft it, just as an anaesthetised p=\r\nerson [on recovering consciousness]\nresumes an activity left unfinished bef=\r\nore.\n\nThis was illustrated by Bhagavan by the story of a yogi. He had awake=\r\nned\nfrom samadhi and being thirsty asked his disciple to bring water to dri=\r\nnk.\nBut before the water was brought he again went into samadhi and remaine=\r\nd in\nit for about three centuries, during which the Muslim raj came and wen=\r\nt and\nwas superseded by the British raj. When he awoke, he called out, addr=\r\nessing\nhis disciple who had long since died, =E2=80=98Have you brought wate=\r\nr?=E2=80=99\n\n662 The yogi, returning in this way to samsara, again enters s=\r\namadhi with\neffort. But the sage, being established in the natural state [s=\r\nahaja\nnirvikalpa samadhi] neither loses it nor gets it back [but remains in=\r\n it\nuninterruptedly].\n\n663 The sage never comes back to samsara. Samadhi is=\r\n his natural state.\nThere is no moment when he is without samadhi. Hence it=\r\n is called sahaja\n[natural].\n\nThis samadhi is different from the kevala of =\r\nthe yogi in that it does not\nprevent the sage being seemingly active in the=\r\n world while remaining in his\nsamadhi.\n\n664 The sage, remaining uninterrupt=\r\nedly in his natural state of samadhi,\nnever swerving from it as a jivan muk=\r\nta, is able to be active in the world,\njust as the sages of old such as Sri=\r\n Sankaracharya did.\n\n665 The yogi, while he is immersed in his kevala samad=\r\nhi, is unable to do\nany work. When he comes out of the samadhi, then he doe=\r\ns work, and is\nsubject to ignorance.\n\n666 The yogi is not equal to the task=\r\n of teaching the truth of the real Self\n[and the sadhana for realising it] =\r\nto disciples. The sage alone, remaining\nalways, unswervingly, in the suprem=\r\ne state, is perfectly competent to teach\nand guide disciples.\n\n667 If this =\r\nsahaja samadhi is not accepted, it will follow that the sacred\nbooks, such =\r\nas the Gita etc. are false. Sacred books are authoritative for\nthe aspirant=\r\ns to deliverance, since they are filled with the teachings of\nsages.\n\n668 I=\r\nt is the succession of sages that preserves the correct tradition of\nthe sc=\r\nience of right awareness of the real Self for the benefit of the\naspirants =\r\nto deliverance.\n\n669 The final proof is one=E2=80=99s own experience of the=\r\n truth, wherein doubts can\nno more arise. Until such experience is attained=\r\n, the utterances of the\nsages are authority for the aspirants.\n\nThe differe=\r\nnce between the two kinds of nirvikalpa [thought-free] samadhis\nwas explain=\r\ned by Bhagavan as follows.\n\n670 The sage [who is in sahaja samadhi] is like=\r\n the river that has joined\nthe ocean and become merged in it. The yogi in t=\r\nhe kevala state is like a\nbucket let down into a well by means of a rope ti=\r\ned to it.\n\n671 The bucket, when drawn up by the rope, comes out of the well=\r\n. Just so\nthe mind immersed in kevala samadhi is pulled out of it by vasana=\r\ns back to\nsamsara.\n\n672 Thus it has been shown by the most holy one that th=\r\ne sage in the natural\nsamadhi has no activity. But though by nature the sag=\r\ne is no actor, yet he\nis also a great actor, without being attached [or bou=\r\nnd].\n\nThe sage has the whole potency of God in doing his appointed work, an=\r\nd hence\nthere is no limit to his power, because, being egoless, the divine =\r\npower\nworks through his subtle and gross bodies.\n\nThe great blessing that d=\r\nisciples and devotees of the sage derive from\nassociating with him is next =\r\nexpounded.\n\n673 What is called association with the holy [satsang] is assoc=\r\niation with a\nsage. The term sat [truth, reality] means Brahman, and the sa=\r\nge is identical\nwith that.\n\n674 It must not be doubted, =E2=80=98Since all =\r\nalike are Brahman, what is there\nspecial in the sage?=E2=80=99 In others, t=\r\nhe real [Brahman] is eclipsed by the ego,\nbut in the sage Brahman shines in=\r\n its fullest effulgence.\n\n675 In the company of sages, attachment vanishes,=\r\n and with attachment,\nillusion. Freed from illusion, one attains stability,=\r\n and thence liberation\nwhile yet alive. Seek therefore the company of sages=\r\n.\n\n676 Not by listening to preachers, nor by study of books, nor by meritor=\r\nious\ndeeds nor by any other means can one attain that supreme state, which =\r\nis\nattainable only through association with the sages and the clear quest o=\r\nf\nthe Self.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml\n\n-- =\r\n\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d50e1e1d904a2d68bc5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;M=\r\nARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;645 The statement in revelation =\r\nthat prarabdha karma survives is only in conformity with the view of the ig=\r\nnorant.

Hence, the changes in the body and in the mind do not touch the=\r\n sage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;653 The sage, who is wide-awake in his own natural sta=\r\nte [as the Self], is said to be like one soundly asleep in a carriage. The =\r\nbody is likened to a carriage, and the ten sense organs are likened to the =\r\nhorses [of the carriage].&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;654 The sleeper in the carriage does not =\r\nknow anything about the going, the stopping and the unyoking of the horses =\r\n[of the carriage]. Just so, the sage who is asleep [to the world] in the ca=\r\nrriage, the body, does not know its changing conditions.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;655 But th=\r\ne sage, being immersed in his natural samadhi, is seen by the ignorant as i=\r\nf he were doing actions and going through various [bodily or mental] condit=\r\nions. Seeing these, the undiscriminating ones are confused.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;656 It =\r\nappears to the ignorant that he has three distinct states, sleep, samadhi a=\r\nnd bodily activities, and the ignorant one thinks that these are distinct f=\r\nrom one another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;657 But the sage is always the same. His state is o=\r\nne of eternal samadhi. This samadhi [of his] is not in any way hindered in =\r\nthe least by actions, nor are actions hindered in the least by the samadhi.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Samadhi is the state of awareness of the Self alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the=\r\n sage remains in samadhi all the time, how can actions be performed? The an=\r\nswer is given in the verses that follow:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;658 There are two thought-f=\r\nree samadhis. One is called kevala, the other is called sahaja [natural]. B=\r\ny attaining kevala one does not become a sage. He alone is a sage who is fi=\r\nrmly established in sahaja.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;These two are further distinguished and=\r\n explained in the verses that follow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;659 The kevala samadhi mention=\r\ned here is one that comes to a yogi by the mind going into latency. For him=\r\n, it is well known that there are two distinct states, samadhi [introverted=\r\nness] and coming back [to the common waking of samsara].&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;It has bee=\r\nn shown before that mental quiescence is of two kinds: latency and complete=\r\n and final extinction, and that the latter alone leads to sagehood. This ma=\r\nkes all the difference, as shown below.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;660 The yogi=E2=80=99s mind,=\r\n in his samadhi, remains latent with all its vasanas. After remaining for a=\r\n very long time, it is brought out to samsara by a vasana.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;661 When=\r\n he is thrown out from the samadhi, he resumes samsara just where he left i=\r\nt, just as an anaesthetised person [on recovering consciousness] resumes an=\r\n activity left unfinished before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This was illustrated by Bhagavan b=\r\ny the story of a yogi. He had awakened from samadhi and being thirsty asked=\r\n his disciple to bring water to drink. But before the water was brought he =\r\nagain went into samadhi and remained in it for about three centuries, durin=\r\ng which the Muslim raj came and went and was superseded by the British raj.=\r\n When he awoke, he called out, addressing his disciple who had long since d=\r\nied, =E2=80=98Have you brought water?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;662 The yogi, return=\r\ning in this way to samsara, again enters samadhi with effort. But the sage,=\r\n being established in the natural state [sahaja nirvikalpa samadhi] neither=\r\n loses it nor gets it back [but remains in it uninterruptedly].&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;663 The sage never comes back to samsara. Sa=\r\nmadhi is his natural state. There is no moment when he is without samadhi. =\r\nHence it is called sahaja [natural].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This samadhi is differen=\r\nt from the kevala of the yogi in that it does not prevent the sage being se=\r\nemingly active in the world while remaining in his samadhi.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;664 The=\r\n sage, remaining uninterruptedly in his natural state of samadhi, never swe=\r\nrving from it as a jivan mukta, is able to be active in the world, just as =\r\nthe sages of old such as Sri Sankaracharya did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;665 The yogi, while =\r\nhe is immersed in his kevala samadhi, is unable to do any work. When he com=\r\nes out of the samadhi, then he does work, and is subject to ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;666 The yogi is not equal to the task of teaching the truth of the real=\r\n Self [and the sadhana for realising it] to disciples. The sage alone, rema=\r\nining always, unswervingly, in the supreme state, is perfectly competent to=\r\n teach and guide disciples.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;667 If this sahaja samadhi is not accep=\r\nted, it will follow that the sacred books, such as the Gita etc. are false.=\r\n Sacred books are authoritative for the aspirants to deliverance, since the=\r\ny are filled with the teachings of sages.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;668 It is the succession =\r\nof sages that preserves the correct tradition of the science of right aware=\r\nness of the real Self for the benefit of the aspirants to deliverance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;669 The final proof is one=E2=80=99s own experience of the truth, wherei=\r\nn doubts can no more arise. Until such experience is attained, the utteranc=\r\nes of the sages are authority for the aspirants.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The difference bet=\r\nween the two kinds of nirvikalpa [thought-free] samadhis was explained by B=\r\nhagavan as follows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;670 The sage [=\r\nwho is in sahaja samadhi] is like the river that has joined the ocean and b=\r\necome merged in it. The yogi in the kevala state is like a bucket let down =\r\ninto a well by means of a rope tied to it.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;671 The bucket, when dra=\r\nwn up by the rope, comes out of the well. Just so the mind immersed in keva=\r\nla samadhi is pulled out of it by vasanas back to samsara.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;67=\r\n2 Thus it has been shown by the most holy one that the sage in the natural =\r\nsamadhi has no activity. But though by nature the sage is no actor, yet he =\r\nis also a great actor, without being attached [or bound].&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The sage =\r\nhas the whole potency of God in doing his appointed work, and hence there i=\r\ns no limit to his power, because, being egoless, the divine power works thr=\r\nough his subtle and gross bodies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The great blessing that disciples =\r\nand devotees of the sage derive from associating with him is next expounded=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;673 What is called association with the holy [satsang] is associa=\r\ntion with a sage. The term sat [truth, reality] means Brahman, and the sage=\r\n is identical with that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;674 It must not be doubted, =E2=80=98Since =\r\nall alike are Brahman, what is there special in the sage?=E2=80=99 In other=\r\ns, the real [Brahman] is eclipsed by the ego, but in the sage Brahman shine=\r\ns in its fullest effulgence.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;675 =\r\nIn the company of sages, attachment vanishes, and with attachment, illusion=\r\n. Freed from illusion, one attains stability, and thence liberation while y=\r\net alive. Seek therefore the company of sages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;676 Not by li=\r\nstening to preachers, nor by study of books, nor by meritorious deeds nor b=\r\ny any other means can one attain that supreme state, which is attainable on=\r\nly through association with the sages and the clear quest of the Self.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\ndavidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.davidg=\r\nodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt; \n&lt;div style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; MARGIN: 0p=\r\nx 0px 0.75em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 87%=\r\n; MARGIN: 0px 0px 0.75em; COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); LINE-HEIGHT: 1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0=\r\n =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=\r\n=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cdf6d50e1e1d904a2d68bc5--\r\n\n"}}
