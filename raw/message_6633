Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsana homam ...\n\n\nIn the past, I have asked exactly the same question.\n\nIf you are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are\ndoing homa), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If\nyou are doing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of\nthe guilt factor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this\nmail may be of some limited value. I have studied several\nsandhyAvandana, aupAsana and homa manuals.\n\nMany traditions split sandhyAvandana into two parts: (a) purificatory\nrites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrate with homa, do\nhoma between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with the mArjana etc\nhardly takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. After the purnahuti\netc, you can do the second part of sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)\nstarting with the AvAhana. Spend as much time in this meditation as\nyou can. Then, you can do the upasthAna etc, which will add another 2\nminutes or so. Consider skipping all the elaborate nyAsas, and the\nrepeated prAnAyAmas.\n\nReally speaking, everything important is already there in the homa\nmanual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; procedure, you can pull in a\nfew veda mantras if you choose to. But, it really isn&#39;t necessary.\n\nIf you look at aupAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha&#39;s\nmanual is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a\nsuperset of aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more relevant\nfor our modern lifestyle, and you don&#39;t need to add anything to it.\nFrankly, I basically follow Narasimha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in\nthe sankalpa. They are that similar. The fire in which you do\n&quot;upAsana&quot; is &quot;aupAsana&quot;.\n\nbhavadiiyaH,\n\n     ajit\n\n"}}
