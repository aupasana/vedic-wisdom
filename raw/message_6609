If I may comment , from my own limited =\r\nintellect and knowledge- Sri Lalitha, Sri Chandika etc are limited concepts=\r\n of the unlimited divine. As the Devi says in the Chandi- &#39;Ekai vasi jagad =\r\nyatra dvitiya ka mama paraa &#39;. She Herself is beyond concepts and beyond th=\r\ne ability of our consciousness to comprehend &#39;jnananam chinmayatita&#39;. They =\r\ntake our mind from the limited concept, to ultimately dissolve in the unlim=\r\nited.\n&gt; \n&gt; The concept of the Ishta Devatha in bhakti and in the path as ta=\r\nught by my Gurus is that the Ishta devatha is the para devatha or the all p=\r\nervading parabrahman for each practitioner. This is borne out by the variou=\r\ns Atharva-Sheersham in which the Devatha of the atharva sheersham is consid=\r\nered to be the all pervading para-brahman. If Lalitha is your Ishta devatha=\r\n or upasana devatha, then every other devatha( and creation itself) by defi=\r\nnition is Her emanation and so it is for Chandi, Maha Ganapathy, Shiva, Sur=\r\nya, Narayana etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the south there is an unwarranted fear of &#39;ugra =\r\ndevatha&#39; and also there is a historic influence of certain Shri-kula paramp=\r\nara. In the east, Kali-Kula is more influential.. These are what I would pe=\r\nrsonally consider desha-achara or kula-achara. Having said this, there are =\r\nlots of Kali, Durga,Bhadrakali temples in every southern state, so I feel t=\r\nhat these acharas are of relatively recent origin. \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this is at =\r\nleast a little bit useful..\n&gt; \n&gt; Jaya Devi Durge.\n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Sri PVRji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While I truly enjoy your brilliant posts, with every=\r\n post of yours, I get really disappointed that my questions never got your =\r\nattention in the recent past.

For a quick recap,=\r\n I repost them here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Durga SapthaSathi does not talk about Lalith=\r\naDevi or Bhandasura. In which purana do they appear and what is the basis? =\r\nI know it comes in Brahmanda purana, but my question is if Lalitha Form is =\r\nsuperior to Durga form or any confusion like that.

Ida nadi (lunar channel) is the=\r\n channel of the soothing \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; comfort of feeling. The mantra you do an=\r\nd the praanaayaama you do may \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; have a small impact on which channe=\r\nl tends to open more, but the primary \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; influence will be your basi=\r\nc attitude and aptitude. Ida nadi is more \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; likely to open in a hum=\r\nble, emotional and relaxed person. Pingala nadi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; is more likely to=\r\n open in a logical, analytical and intelligent person. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, targ=\r\neting a nadi with praanaayaama and mantra does not add much \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; value=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra tends to open up Pingala more. Shiva ma=\r\nntras (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Panchakshari) tend to open Ida more. However, it also=\r\n depends on how you \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; visualize your god. For example, does Shiva s=\r\ntand for a relaxed mahayogi \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; in bliss to you or the fiery Rudra of=\r\n destruction?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mor=\r\neover, the goal is not to make shakti flow through Ida or Pingala \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n anyway. The goal is that shakti flows through Sushumna nadi in the \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; middle. All the higher worlds and deities in them lie within Sushumna \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; nadi. Depending on the nature of mantra and your nature, Ida or Pin=\r\ngala \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; may open more and some vaayu may be flowing through it. But,=\r\n when \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini gets awakened oneday, Sushumna may also open and =\r\nKundalini may \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; shoot up through Sushumna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many =\r\npeople referring to Kundalini in higher chakras/nadis are actually \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; talking about the flow of vaayus there. Most people talking about \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Kundalini have not experienced Kundalini itself in higher chakras.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini shakti is one&#39;s self-awareness. Shakti meeting Shiv=\r\na is a \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; metaphor for individual self-awareness (shakti) merging in=\r\n cosmic self \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (Shiva). A vaishnava may also view it as a Gopi meet=\r\ning Krishna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Shak=\r\nti will not rise unless one&#39;s awareness of physical body disappears. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; The instruction of some teachers to focus on a particular chakra or a \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; particular body part to force Kundalini to rise is not wise. As lo=\r\nng as \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you think &quot;I am the body. Inside this body, there is a chak=\r\nra or a body \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; part. I will focus on that part inside this body&quot;, y=\r\nour self-awareness \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; is unlikely to rise above the physical body. I=\r\nn other words, your \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini is stuck in the mooladhara chakra c=\r\norresponding to the \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; physical realm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Wanting Ku=\r\nndalini to rise to X or Y chakra is unproductive. It never \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; happen=\r\ns that way. Whenever I had expected or anticipated something, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; not=\r\nhing happened. Things happened spontaneously only when my mind was \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; nearly empty and the focus on mantra/god became so intense that it \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; filled my mind. In fact, when I first experienced a Kundalini rise, I \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; did not even know much about Kundalini and chakras and considered =\r\nall \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; those concepts as dirty Tantrik ideas that I wanted to do hav=\r\ne nothing \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; to do with. Only after experiencing did I understand wh=\r\nat it was \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; intellectually. Thus, intellectual analysis of Kundalin=\r\ni and chakras and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; trying to manipulate them is unnecessary and, i=\r\nn fact, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; counter-productive. If you want Kundalini to rise, do not=\r\n even think in \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; terms of Kundalini and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini rises when and only when =\r\nyour self-awareness rises above the \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; physical body. The key is to =\r\nforget that you are the body. The key is to \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; NOT think that you ar=\r\ne (or you are not) the body. The key is to forget \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; about the body =\r\ncompletely. The key is to immerse the mind so deeply in \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; the mantr=\r\na/deity that you forget everything else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And then patien=\r\nce. By being in a hurry that your Kundalini should rise, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you will=\r\n only ensure that Kundalini remains in Mooladhara forever. As I \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\naid, stop thinking in terms of shakti and chakras, if shakti were to \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; really rise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n                http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;                       Twi=\r\ntter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Than=\r\nk you for answering my questions.
