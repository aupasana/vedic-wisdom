However, I have=\r\n some questions and comments. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 1. While I have no doubt about yo=\r\nur point that castes are portable and not determined by birth is a very val=\r\nid one and hard to argue about, example of Vishwamitra is a far better one =\r\nthan that of Valmiki! The reason being, as Sri Chaganti Koteshwara Rao, an =\r\neminent scholar in his 42 day Ramayana Pravachanam says, Valmiki is not a t=\r\nribal by birth but he is Son of Prachetana, a brahmin of Bharadwajasa Gotra=\r\n and his name was Agni Sarma! How he became a hunter and eventually became =\r\na great sage is a different story but I believed that he=C2=A0was not a sud=\r\nra by birth, based on his lectures. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 2. Also he goes on to say t=\r\nhat his Disciple Bharadwaja is not the same as the Bharadwaja of Saptarishi=\r\n set! Agni Sarma himself (Valmiki&#39;s original name) is of Bharadwajasa Gotra=\r\n, according to him! It is quite possible that even in olden days, different=\r\n people shared the same name! I would like to hear your views on this. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; I am completely in agreement that homam is a very powerful sadhana=\r\n and ever since I started doing it daily ( from the last fifteen days), I c=\r\nan see that my confidence in handling everything has increased manifold! I =\r\nam just doing Ganapathi homam along with Sandhya vandanam and I find this p=\r\nractise a pretty beautiful one. But I am not able to control my anger at al=\r\nl! I am very short tempered person and cannot tolerate delays and keep yell=\r\ning at my kids and wife a lot! I am not seeing that homam is helping me the=\r\nre, but I just enjoy the ritual itself and keep thinking that my clarity is=\r\n increasing because of this. I had quite a few material setbacks but keep t=\r\nhing that my bad karma is getting burnt and never doubted the positive effe=\r\ncts of homam for a minute! Please let me know if my thinking is right!\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/21/11, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] RE=\r\n: Non Brahmin,Completed 108 Ganapathi Homams --Dont you think this is Guru =\r\nKrupa?\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, July 21, 2011, =\r\n2:01 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Srinivas,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I am gla=\r\nd you are doing homam and overcame drinking, smoking etc. It is very inspir=\r\ning and can inspire others too to overcome weaknesses. Overcoming external =\r\nweaknesses such as drinking, smoking, drugs etc and internal weaknesses suc=\r\nh as lust, anger, jealosy etc, is the true sign of one&#39;s progress with a sa=\r\ndhana. You are definitely on the right path and keep going!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As V=\r\nimalananda says, nature conspires to help one who truly wants to learn and =\r\ndo a sadhana!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As some people have al=\r\nready pointed out, one&#39;s varna is decided by one&#39;s aptitude and attitude. V=\r\nalmiki must&#39;ve been a great brahmin in previous lives, but some karmas made=\r\n him take birth as a shoodra and eventually his original samskaras took ove=\r\nr and he became a brahmin, a rishi and a maharshi. He even taught brahma jn=\r\nana to Bharadwaja, one of the saptarshis!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, if one is d=\r\nrawn to fire, does homam over a period of time and overcomes some weaknesse=\r\ns, obviously strong samskaras are present from previous lives. If they are =\r\nallowed to dominate, one will make progress. One becomes a true brahmana wi=\r\nth sadhana. As one realizes true knowledge internally, one may even become =\r\nworthy of teaching spiritual knowledge to others, including brahmanas by bi=\r\nrth!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Not only non-brahmins from Indi=\r\na, but people not born in India/Hinduism are doing homam regularly. Some of=\r\n them are (will be) making great progess too. As a result, a strong Brahmin=\r\n (true!) class will be established across the world and that will increase =\r\ndharma on earth.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Just yesterday night, one Russian origin CS pro=\r\nfessor from Canada who was in Boston as a visiting scholar at MIT came to m=\r\ny house and learned homam. He did Ganapathi homam at my house with my help =\r\nand plans to do it in Canada. He has Jupiter in Pisces in 12th house and I =\r\ngot a nice feeling when he was doing homam. There were also several good om=\r\nens, making me think he is relatively well-prepared for sadhana.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n A dirty golden vessel is more valuable than a brightly shining copper vess=\r\nel that is gold-plated! You just need to clean the former..\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This homam movement is in nascent stages yet. Once a=\r\n critical mass of sadhakas accumulates and people start making progress, it=\r\n will spread like a wildfire. There is no hurry and there is need to feel p=\r\nressure, for these things happen due to the will of higher beings. We are a=\r\nll merely instruments.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I tend to think that there are blessings =\r\nof some great saints/yogis behind this. When we did Shata Chandi homam at C=\r\nhennai in March 2006, we casually selected a muhurta for the sankalpa of th=\r\ne week-long ritual, so that maha-poornahuti happens on an Ashtami day. It w=\r\nas during this week that Manish received a command from the divine Mother t=\r\no spread homam. When I and Manish took the sankalpa at the temple on the fi=\r\nrst day, it was Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s lunar birthday and it was within =\r\n5 min from the exact time when the angle between Sun and Moon matched that =\r\nat his birth. When I started daily homam about 5-6 months later, as a precu=\r\nrsor to publishing the manuals a few months later, there was another coinci=\r\ndence. It was exactly 120 lunar years since Ramakrishna left his physical b=\r\nody. Moreover, I had a vision of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa a day before Manis=\r\nh had the vision of divine Mother, during that week of Shata Chandi at the =\r\nKali temple in Chennai. I\n&gt;  am not attached to forms and I rarely get visi=\r\nons.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Several months before that, in late 2005, I had an interest=\r\ning dream that actually felt real (i.e. not like a dream). In the dream, th=\r\nere was a strong and pleasant naad (buzz) that used to accompany my Kundali=\r\nni rises through sushumna during those days. It was dark and there was a hu=\r\nge fire. I was sitting in front of the fire. A person with a powerful perso=\r\nna, whom I had never seen before, sat in front of me. He was teaching me so=\r\nme yoga involving fire and what yoga means etc. He taught several things in=\r\n Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into Manish. Then shakti came down, naad sto=\r\npped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, and I was aware of my body lying on bed. The face of t=\r\nhe person I saw was vivid in my mind. I did not know who it was. I mentione=\r\nd this dream to Manish a week or two later. He said he did not know who it =\r\nwas, but asked me a week later to check out the photo of a specific yogi. W=\r\nhen I did a search on the internet, I found a photo (apparently the only ph=\r\noto\n&gt;  available of that yogi). It looked very close to what I saw in my dr=\r\neam, except that the person in my dream seemed like a slightly younger vers=\r\nion of that photo. This was a famous yogi from the parampara of Mahavatar B=\r\nabaji. As I had never seen his photo before that or read much about that li=\r\nneage or their teachings, his coming in my dream was strange. Also, teachin=\r\ng me some yoga involving fire was strange, because homam movement did not s=\r\ntart then and I was not thinking of fire or fire ritual at all.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nThere are some signs like this, which make me think that we are being used =\r\nas instruments in a big &quot;project&quot; designed by some great yogis in higher re=\r\nalms. It seems to me like this project has an important purpose and will he=\r\nlp MANY people in their quest for god, in the coming decades and centuries.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; On Thu, Jul 21, 2011 at 4:42 AM, srin=\r\nivas wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 Hi: \n&gt; \n&gt; I am a non Brahmin, fortunately I c=\r\name across Homam manuals/videos in internet.
