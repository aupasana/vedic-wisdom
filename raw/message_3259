It is understandable if\nhe says Rama is an ideal m=\r\nan but hard to believe that such a great\nperson claims Rama is not God. Tem=\r\npted to ask him what really is the\ndefinition of God which differentiates R=\r\nama from Krishna?\n&gt;\n&gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and ch=\r\narged/heated\ndebate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, t=\r\nhese are\nall theoritical/theological debates - nothing to do with actual\nsp=\r\nirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I was getting\nagitated an=\r\nd it would have affected our friendship.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Whenever his opinion is as=\r\nked on anything, he will only mention that\nwhat he can support using logic.=\r\n Therefore he never generally discusses\nspirituality with anyone per se. He=\r\n will discuss and debate scriptures\nusing exact quotations etc, (theology)=\r\n=C2 but not about mysticism or\nsadhana or anything which=C2 needs a belief =\r\nsystem. That is why most\npeople know him only as a very rational, massively=\r\n knowledgeable and\nuncorruptable=C2 human being.=C2 =C2 They have no clue a=\r\nbout his\nmeditations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual an=\r\nd\ngenerally would not discuss God in public.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Therefore our discussi=\r\non was also on those aspects which can be proved\nor disproved theologically=\r\n=C2 - 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki\nRamayana=C2  2) Is it wrong if people=\r\n consider him as God=C2 .. 3) The\nmerits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasida=\r\nsji.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debated from a\nspiritu=\r\nal point if it is right or wrong=C2 - but his personal opinion\nis that one =\r\nshould try to follow the way of life shown by Sri Rama\nrather than worshipp=\r\ning him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine\nweapons. He could have=\r\n destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of\nan eye, right from the p=\r\nlace where he was=C2 located when he first\nheard the news of Sita&#39;s abducti=\r\non, but Rama did not do so and instead\nchose the hard way of destroying Rav=\r\nana - the human way. So as per my\nfriend, it is more important to emulate R=\r\nama&#39;s ideas than to worship\nRama.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Man=\r\nas, from a literary angle, a\nhodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging fro=\r\nm Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An\nauthor&#39;s paradise (since many rules of compositio=\r\nn has been flouted) but\na critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there=\r\n which equates women\nwith animals or something similar. He believes that wa=\r\ns introduces in\nthe text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his ow=\r\nn lust.\nTherefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women.\nFu=\r\nrther, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the\npurpose of=\r\n his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea\nway of life.=\r\n Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was\nmaximum ability of =\r\nGod on this plane. Nothing can be more God than\nKrishna was on this plane, =\r\nso he thinks.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disag=\r\nree.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One request, if you can speak to him=\r\n about his thought on Food habits,\nit&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I have been out =\r\nof touch with him since August, been busy myself. But\nwill ask him. However=\r\n I don&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because as I\nexplained above, he rar=\r\nely discusses/debates anything from a purely\nspiritual angle.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; It wa=\r\ns only by chance that I found out one day about his meditations\netc and the=\r\nn he confirmed them when asked.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I have seen him debating with Vegan=\r\ns - purely from a scientific point\nof view - about why there is no harm in =\r\nhaving regulated amounts of meat\n(not red meat).\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; But I say, as Nara=\r\nsimha said, this person should not be taken as an\nideal regarding food=C2  =\r\nhabits.

I met him about two years back. What first attracted=\r\n me to=C2 \ntowards him was his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=\r\n=C2 when\nit comes to=C2 honestly.=C2 If someone were to put a gun to his he=\r\nad\nand ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C2 lie, like sun rises in\nthe=\r\n west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too!\nHe ha=\r\ns actually never ever=C2 spoken even a single lie in his whole\nlife, big or=\r\n small. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him\nthat Indian la=\r\nnguages are richer than English, he believed his teacher.\nLater someone els=\r\ne told him English is more comprehensive language and\nthe world cannot do w=\r\nith it. He got confused. Since that day, he bought\nhimself two thick fat di=\r\nctionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten\nyears every day he spend one=\r\n hour reading the English dictionary and\n&gt; one hour reading the Hindi dicti=\r\nonary apart from reading=C2 up\nvolumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2 =\r\nWhen I asked him why, he\njust said it is because he wanted to be=C2 equally=\r\n adept at both the\nlanguages so that one day he can take a really detached =\r\nview to judge\nthe truth about=C2 which is more comprehensive language! As I=\r\n said, he\nhas an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the t=\r\nruth\nabout anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worke=\r\nd\nin different fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not\n=\r\nlast for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English,\nBenga=\r\nli, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is\nlearning Tami=\r\nl. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he\nwas in college, h=\r\ne considered himself an atheist. While applying for a\njob he had kept the p=\r\nlace makered for religion as blank. When the clerk\nwho was supposed to take=\r\n the forms saw that blank space, he asked\n&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hin=\r\ndu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.\nSeeing this, my friend snatched the form =\r\nfrom the clerk and tore it up\nright there. Because, he considered himself a=\r\nn atheist and writing Hindu\nin the form would have been a lie.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; So t=\r\nhis gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his\nfriends, whoeve=\r\nr knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One day, long back, he was=\r\n going to office for some urgent meeting.\nHis way to office passed by a Kri=\r\nshna temple. As he was passing by\nin=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a str=\r\nange urge to go into the\ntemple. He says he still does not know why he went=\r\n inside the temple,\nbut he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next =\r\nwhen he sees his\nwatch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge o=\r\nf how the time\nwent. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went=\r\n into the\ntemple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time with=\r\nout any\nmovement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my fri=\r\nend\nhad no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in\nd=\r\neep sleep.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2 =\r\nthat he got\nvisions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infac=\r\nt most\npeople who know him also do not know these things. But once he was i=\r\nn\nsamadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact\ns=\r\name place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2  Only his wife\nand =\r\nclose relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when\never he s=\r\nits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When\nsomeone asked=\r\n him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as\nif the whole univ=\r\nerse orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the\nstars, the planets, the=\r\n animals, men, women, children, the wind, the\nwater, the space, smaller tha=\r\nn the atom and bigger than everything. It\ncannot be accurately desribed.=C2=\r\n He considers Sri Krishna to be God\nand=C2 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.Th=\r\nat is why he does not like the\nRamacharit Manas because he thinks it elevat=\r\ned Sri=C2 Rama to the\n&gt; level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmi=\r\nki Ramayana was to\nshow Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2 not a God.The differen=\r\nce he says is\nthat, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinar=\r\ny man can\nand should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emul=\r\nated by\nordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2 can try to lead=\r\n his\nlife like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely\nstat=\r\ning his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least,\nand adv=\r\nises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say,\nhe is not =\r\nan atheist any more.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Later he had once=C2 mentioned he knew the rel=\r\nation he had with all\nthe people around him in his past lives. His mother h=\r\ne says, was his\ndaughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of =\r\ntime on\ndifferent internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2 wit=\r\nh\nthose in=C2 the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and\neverything=\r\n with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion,\netc etc. His =\r\nidea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will\nbe the future of=\r\n this country.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; He is am omnivorous person.

Tempted to ask him what real=\r\nly is the definition of God which differentiates Rama from Krishna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated=\r\n debate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are all=\r\n theoritical/theological debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. =\r\nFinally he stopped the debate because I was getting agitated and it would h=\r\nave affected our friendship. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever his opinio=\r\nn is asked on anything, he will only mention that what he can support using=\r\n logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spirituality with anyone per=\r\n se. He will discuss and debate scriptures using exact quotations etc, (the=\r\nology)=C2&nbsp;but not about mysticism or sadhana or anything which=C2&nbsp=\r\n;needs a belief system. That is why most people know him only as a very rat=\r\nional, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable=C2&nbsp;human being.=C2&nb=\r\nsp;=C2&nbsp;They have no clue about his meditations or anything. He never p=\r\nrojects himself as spiritual and generally would not discuss God in public.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore our discussion was also on those aspec=\r\nts which can be proved or disproved theologically=C2&nbsp;- 1) Is Rama a Go=\r\nd as per Valmiki Ramayana=C2&nbsp; 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as=\r\n God=C2&nbsp;.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no=\r\n&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot b=\r\ne debated from a spiritual point if it is right or wrong=C2&nbsp;- but his =\r\npersonal opinion is that one should try to follow the way of life shown by =\r\nSri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all =\r\ndivine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blin=\r\nk of an eye, right from the place where he was=C2&nbsp;located when he firs=\r\nt heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead ch=\r\nose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend,=\r\n it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary ang=\r\nle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. =\r\nAn author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but=\r\n a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women wi=\r\nth animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the tex=\r\nt because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he e=\r\nnded up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that i=\r\nf Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes wa=\r\nste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to b=\r\ne worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Noth=\r\ning can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree.=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food hab=\r\nits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have been out of touch wit=\r\nh him since August, been busy myself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw whether he will respond.

He is married, lives in =\r\nDelhi and has a son as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before I tell you an=\r\nything more=C2&nbsp;about his spiritual life=C2&nbsp;that I know, let me sa=\r\ny=C2&nbsp;line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him ab=\r\nout two years back. What first attracted me to=C2&nbsp; towards him was his=\r\n impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2&nbsp;when it comes to=C2&nb=\r\nsp;honestly.=C2&nbsp;If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him t=\r\no just say a simple, harmless=C2&nbsp;lie, like sun rises in the west, he w=\r\nould not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually =\r\nnever ever=C2&nbsp;spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small=\r\n. When he was in his school, once his teacher told him that Indian language=\r\ns are richer than English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told=\r\n him English is more comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it=\r\n. He got confused. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictiona=\r\nries, one English, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one hour =\r\nreading the English dictionary and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one hour reading the Hindi dicti=\r\nonary apart from reading=C2&nbsp;up volumes of Hindi and English literature=\r\n.=C2&nbsp;When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=\r\n=C2&nbsp;equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can take a =\r\nreally detached view to judge the truth about=C2&nbsp;which is more compreh=\r\nensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude when it comes=\r\n to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a Phd is math=\r\nematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to education to jo=\r\nurnalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks and writes flu=\r\nently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. No=\r\nw he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When=\r\n he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a =\r\njob he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk who=\r\n was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space, he asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my f=\r\nriend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, m=\r\ny friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up right there. Becau=\r\nse, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu in the form would ha=\r\nve been a lie. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; So this gives a basic idea of the=\r\n man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama o=\r\nf Kaliyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day, long back, he was going to o=\r\nffice for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple=\r\n. As he was passing by in=C2&nbsp;his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange u=\r\nrge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went insid=\r\ne the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when h=\r\ne sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how =\r\nthe time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into =\r\nthe temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without an=\r\ny movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend ha=\r\nd no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sl=\r\neep.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it w=\r\nas there=C2&nbsp;that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much a=\r\nbout these, infact most people who know him also do not know these things. =\r\nBut once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation sea=\r\nt, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C2&nb=\r\nsp; Only his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe n=\r\nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samad=\r\nhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feel=\r\ns as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the s=\r\ntars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, =\r\nthe space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be a=\r\nccurately desribed.=C2&nbsp;He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=C2&nbsp;=\r\nLord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not like the Ramacharit M=\r\nanas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2&nbsp;Rama to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; level of=\r\n a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama=\r\n as an ideal man,=C2&nbsp;not a God.The difference he says is that, an idea=\r\nl man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to=\r\n become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One c=\r\nannot become Krishna, but one=C2&nbsp;can try to lead his life like Rama. I=\r\n have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he =\r\ndoes not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not tru=\r\nst most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later he had once=C2&nbsp;mentioned he knew the re=\r\nlation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mother =\r\nhe says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of=\r\n time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2&nb=\r\nsp;with those in=C2&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and=\r\n everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, et=\r\nc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be th=\r\ne future of this country.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He is am omnivorous per=\r\nson. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had not asked his permi=\r\nssion before mentioning him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2=\r\n&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS: I would not like this mail to =\r\nbe considered as a part of the debate.
