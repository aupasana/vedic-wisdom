Unlike you all who =\r\nare determined to give yourselves to the Lord I am not ready for extreme le=\r\nvel of spirituality.I like praying god but don&#39;t want to commit saying that=\r\n I don&#39;t want any riches,any happiness etc. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t want to go fo=\r\nr something in an extreme level and later face the wrath of God. So my ques=\r\ntion is I believe purnahuti is the part where one surrenders completely and=\r\n gives this commitment. I want to call god in fire pray, meditate keep it s=\r\nimple. As fire is the most auspicious form I am tempted to pray God in that=\r\n medium. So can I skip the purnahuti section. Do I need to make any changes=\r\n in sankalpam? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; &gt; Pratima\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Shri Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is just wonderful !!!=\r\n How awesome, just get goosebumps thinking about it :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope =\r\npeople realize this and stop thinking that after doing homam they will star=\r\nt getting all kinds of material benefits.
