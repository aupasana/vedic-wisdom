Samadhi literally=\r\n means\nconcentration and focus of awareness. In its normal state, mind is\nv=\r\nibrating with too many thoughts and notions. In any state of samadhi,\nmost =\r\nof these thoughts and notions disappear and mind achieves a high\ndegree of =\r\nfocus.\n&gt;\n&gt; The focus can be on a physical object perceived through senses (=\r\ne.g.\nan idol or the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle object perceive=\r\nd\nby the subtle perception (a deity or the subtle vibration of a mantra).\nT=\r\nhe focus can be on the gross/subtle object or on the act of perceiving\nthe =\r\nobject or on the perceiver (all the three exist within one&#39;s\nconsciousness =\r\nas three different things). One&#39;s self-awareness can\nidentify with one obje=\r\nct and focus its attention on another object (&quot;I\nam Rajarshi with so and so=\r\n qualities and I am aware of Bhairava with so\nand so qualities&quot;). Or, one&#39;s=\r\n self-awareness can identify with that\nobject (&quot;I am Bhairava with so and s=\r\no qualities&quot;). Please note that all\nthese samadhis are within the field of =\r\nduality. There is still a sense\nof &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot;, i.e.=\r\n there is differentiation.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; The next state is what most people=\r\n refer to as samadhi. This is a\nstate where mind is absorbed in non-dual Se=\r\nlf, i.e. without any\ndifferentiation. When there are no notions of &quot;this is=\r\n I&quot; and &quot;this is\nthe rest&quot;, there are no thoughts, no opposites and there i=\r\ns only\nSat-Chid-Ananda (the bliss of just being).\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, let me=\r\n come to what Vimalananda says!\n&gt;\n&gt; The non-dual Self is Shiva (or Purusha =\r\nor Narayana). The field of\nduality is Shakti (or Prakriti or Narayani). Tho=\r\nugh one may normally\nthink that Shiva and Shakti are different, are they re=\r\nally different?!\n&gt;\n&gt; Because of our notion that Shiva and Shakti are differ=\r\nent, we can\neither be with Shakti or with Shiva at a time but not with both=\r\n at the\nsame time. A yogi who has objectification and the sense of &quot;this is=\r\n I&quot;\nand &quot;this is the rest&quot; is in the domain of Shakti. When one overcomes\no=\r\nbjectification and reaches non-dual samadhi, one is in the domain of\nShiva.=\r\n When one leaves that state and one&#39;s egosense (&quot;this is I&quot; and\n&quot;this is th=\r\ne rest&quot;) returns, one will *leave* the domain of Shiva and\nre-enter the fie=\r\nld of Shakti. One is prone to be deluded by duality\nagain! That is what Vim=\r\nalananda is saying.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one can be with Shiva *and* Shakti at the *same =\r\ntime*, then one is\nthen not enamored or deluded by any aspect of Shakti. Wh=\r\nen a small\naspect of Shakti enamors/deludes one (&quot;this is I&quot;, &quot;that is beau=\r\ntiful&quot;,\n&quot;that is ugly&quot;, &quot;I like that&quot; etc), one is unable to perceive the e=\r\nntire\nfield of Shakti. This is just like a person tied to a rock in the oce=\r\nan\nnot being able to swim the entire ocean. When one is not bound by any\nob=\r\nject in the field of Shakti and not attracted or repelled by anything,\nthen=\r\n one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all space-time\ncombinations. This =\r\nis possible only if one has perfect mastery over\nShakti. That comes only wh=\r\nen one has zero attachment to anything in the\nfield of Shakti. That comes o=\r\nnly when one is with Shiva enough and\neventually becomes like Shiva. If a y=\r\nogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays\nin it for a long time and happens to co=\r\nme back to the field of duality,\nthen one may become like Shiva and work wi=\r\nth Shakti with zero attachment\nand perfect mastery. One is aware of the ent=\r\nire field of duality - all\nspaces and times - and yet unattached to anythin=\r\ng. That is because one\nperceives the underlying non-dual Self even as sense=\r\ns perceive various\nobjects of duality.\n&gt;\n&gt; For most people, this is out of =\r\nbounds. One either experiences\nnon-dual samadhi for a short duration and ca=\r\nnnot sustain it longer and\ncomes back to be deluded by duality again, or on=\r\ne stays in non-dual\nsamadhi for a long time and does not come back (like a =\r\nsalt doll that\ngoes to survey the depth of ocean melting in the ocean, to b=\r\norrow words\nfrom Ramakrishna Paramahamsa). Exceptions like Ramakrishna Para=\r\nmahamsa\nor Sai Baba, who spent enough time in non-dual samadhi and yet came=\r\n back\nto live in the world, are so rare in this age.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me p=\r\nut this in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in\nmoolaadhaara, our s=\r\nelf-awareness identifies with the physical body and\nis aware of the physica=\r\nl world around us. As Kundalini goes to various\nplaces in the subtle body (=\r\nthere are thousands of nadis and chakras!),\none is aware of various realiti=\r\nes that are out there in this universe.\nFor example, one world (realm of aw=\r\nareness) may be reverberating with\nthe sound of a particular beejaakshara a=\r\nnd filled with a particular\nlight and every being in that world may be a sm=\r\nall particle in that\nlight reverberating with that sound. Like that, there =\r\nare many worlds\nout there (within us) and one can enter a samadhi through a=\r\nny of them,\nwhen Kundalini reaches a corresponding place.\n&gt;\n&gt; When Kundalin=\r\ni reaches sahasrara, one&#39;s self-awareness is with Shiva.\nShakti loses herse=\r\nlf to Shiva and there is no objectification that is\nthe hallmark of Shakti.=\r\n If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower\nchakra, one&#39;s self-awarenes=\r\ns is again deluded by duality. However, if\nshakti comes back from sahasrara=\r\n to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva,\nthen one is aware of duality and non=\r\n-dual Self at the same time. One\nlives as a liberated sage, using the body =\r\nas an instrument to fulfil the\nwill of Nature (since there is no longer any=\r\n individual will).\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish\ntextbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri\nTarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;\n------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- hramalingam@... wrote:\n&gt; &gt; The=\r\n Samadi is nothing but killing the mind and the entire thought\nprocess\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThis will answer all your questions\n&gt; &gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Re=\r\nliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1\nNetwork.

B=\r\nut all the while you continue to\nfunction\n&gt; &gt; effectively in this time, spa=\r\nce and causality.

Moreover, it is tough\nto capture\n&gt; &gt; some of t=\r\nhese ideas in words, as words convey slightly different\nmeaning to\n&gt; &gt; diff=\r\nerent people, based on their life experiences and\npredispositions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nYes, there is no formula that ensures self-realization in a certain\namount =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; time and it comes to one through the grace of God. However, grace of=\r\n\nGod does\n&gt; &gt; not come to just about anyone - it comes to one who is *ready=\r\n* to\nreceive it.\n&gt; &gt; One becomes ready to receive it, through the effort pu=\r\nt in this life\nand all\n&gt; &gt; previous lives, to overcome weaknesses and condi=\r\ntioning. So effort\nand sadhana\n&gt; &gt; are not useless. The effort we are talki=\r\nng about here is not effort\nto acquire\n&gt; &gt; something, but effort to give up=\r\n something.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though it is not incorrect, the view that things are gi=\r\nven only by\nGod&#39;s grace\n&gt; &gt; can, when misunderstood, promote inaction. God&#39;=\r\ns grace does not come\nto a lazy\n&gt; &gt; person doing nothing and waiting for Go=\r\nd&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace does\nnot work\n&gt; &gt; arbitrarily. God&#39;s grace comes to =\r\none who has perfect surrender to\nGod. Perfect\n&gt; &gt; surrender does not come a=\r\nutomatically. Though effort and sadhana do\nnot\n&gt; &gt; guarantee perfect surren=\r\nder in a certain amount of time, they do\nbring it\n&gt; &gt; eventually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever one does it is based on past karmas only\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nuits of past karmas decide one&#39;s current situation and constrain\none&#39;s curr=\r\nent\n&gt; &gt; karmas (actions). But they do not completely decide one&#39;s current\nk=\r\narmas. One&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; current karma is in one&#39;s hands (within the constraints).\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, one can ask: Does one have a free will that acts or does=\r\n\nan\n&gt; &gt; all-pervading shakti act through one? I am quoting a small portion\n=\r\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; vedic-wisdom message 5009\n&gt; &gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom/message/5009) below:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All pervading shakti works through all=\r\n of us and expresses through\nall of our\n&gt; &gt; desires, actions and knowledge.=\r\n But then, some universal rules of\naction and\n&gt; &gt; reaction govern how this =\r\nworks. Under the push of one&#39;s own previous\nkarmas, one\n&gt; &gt; is placed in si=\r\ntuations that are conducive to certain desires,\nactions and\n&gt; &gt; awareness. =\r\nThe current karmas in those situations may further modify\nthe\n&gt; &gt; momentum =\r\nof the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though one&#39;s\ncurrent\n&gt; &gt; desi=\r\nres, actions and awareness are actually the work of the all\npervading\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nhakti, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It depends on how we look\nat it a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; how we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in=\r\n\na small\n&gt; &gt; cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges water in =\r\na cup\nin freezing\n&gt; &gt; weather are all Ganges water, they are different too.=\r\n One is more,\none is less,\n&gt; &gt; one is warm and one is icy. Similarly, the w=\r\nork of all pervading\nshakti is\n&gt; &gt; different when expressed through differe=\r\nnt vessels (people) in\ndifferent\n&gt; &gt; situations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As long as one act=\r\nually feels internally (despite what one may say\nor pretend\n&gt; &gt; externally)=\r\n that one&#39;s desires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s own,\none is\n&gt; &gt; perfor=\r\nming karmas and is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions.\nOnly when the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; realization that it is all the work of the all pervading shakti\nbecomes=\r\n full and\n&gt; &gt; completely internalized, does one become free from the cycle =\r\nof\nactions and\n&gt; &gt; reactions. Until then, all pervading shakti acts through=\r\n one to give\nappropriate\n&gt; &gt; reactions to actions one thinks one is perform=\r\ning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum tota=\r\nl of previous\nkarmas, whose\n&gt; &gt; fruits one will have to face.

Tendulkar may score a century\nw=\r\nith a terrible\n&gt; &gt; &gt;backache, but we should not walk out to bat with a back=\r\nache and\nshould try to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;healthy.

The goal of all\nsadhan=\r\na -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;meditation, japam, homam, bhajan, service to others etc - is\ninter=\r\nnal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;transformation.

First close the window or stop the wind. Similarly,\npraanaay=\r\naama\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental purity, if mind=\r\n\n(room) is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;attached to the objects perceived by senses (window).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one reads scriptures and teachings of saints, c=\r\nontemplates on\nthem,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;constantly analyzes inner motives behind various =\r\nactions by oneself\nand tries to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;change one&#39;s own thinking slowly, this=\r\n process of contemplation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;introspection will augment one&#39;s externa=\r\nl sadhana (such as\nmeditation, japam,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;homam, bhajan, service etc) and =\r\npurifies one faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, it is useles=\r\ns to think in terms of Kundalini,\nawakening Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and raising Kund=\r\nalini. Such thoughts are almost guaranteed to\neither block\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini f=\r\nrom rising or from reaching the highest it can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini shakt=\r\ni is essentially a symbol of one&#39;s own\nself-awareness. Though\n&gt; &gt; &gt;one is t=\r\nhe infinite Self (Purusha), one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited\nobject in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nfield of duality (Shakti) springing in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why\nKundalin=\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; &gt;shakti is worshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti). This\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;self-awareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is\nso =\r\nand so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;person and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That =\r\nis\nwhy Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhulok=\r\na or physical\nrealm). As\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras =\r\n(other lokas or realms\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt;awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who one i=\r\ns gets refined. When\nKundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt;reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true=\r\n Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shak=\r\nti at so\nand so point\n&gt; &gt; &gt;in this body. It should now rise to so and so po=\r\nint in this body&quot;,\nit will focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt;and limit one&#39;s self-awareness to the=\r\n *physical body* and hence\none&#39;s Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt;will remain in moolaadhaara=\r\n! For Kundalini to truly rise, one needs\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt;completely forget about th=\r\ne physical body and stop thinking in\nterms of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, *=\r\nvery few* people actually experience Kundalini in\nhigher chakras,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;thou=\r\ngh many talk about it. Kundalini is in Moolaadhaara chakra or\natmost\n&gt; &gt; &gt;S=\r\nwadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even advanced and awakened\nones. When pr=\r\naana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;vaayu flows in some higher chakras, that too can result in a\npowe=\r\nrful\n&gt; &gt; &gt;experience. Some may mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want a good score in the examination, study well. Stop\n=\r\nthinking too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt;about (and anticipating) the examination and focus o=\r\nn the subject\ninstead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about ku=\r\nndalini, forget\nabout chakras,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;forget about the body even. Do sadhana,=\r\n do sadhana and do sadhana.\nRead\n&gt; &gt; &gt;scriptures and teachings of great sai=\r\nnts. Instead of looking\nexternally and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;judging others, observe your ow=\r\nn actions and thoughts, analyze what\nis driving\n&gt; &gt; &gt;them and consciously t=\r\nry to eliminate wrong motives that stem from\nfalse ego,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;adharma and ar=\r\nishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness,\njealosy),\n&gt; &gt; &gt;i.e. p=\r\nut to use the knowledge of scriptures and the teachings of\nsaints.

Samadhi literally=\r\n means concentration and focus of awareness. In its normal state, mind is v=\r\nibrating with too many thoughts and notions. In any state of samadhi, most =\r\nof these thoughts and notions disappear and mind achieves a high degree of =\r\nfocus.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The focus can be on a physical object perceived thr=\r\nough senses (e.g. an idol or the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle ob=\r\nject perceived by the subtle perception (a deity or the subtle vibration of=\r\n a mantra). The focus can be on the gross/subtle object or on the act of pe=\r\nrceiving the object or on the perceiver (all the three exist within one&#39;s c=\r\nonsciousness as three different things). One&#39;s self-awareness can identify =\r\nwith one object and focus its attention on another object (&quot;I am Rajarshi w=\r\nith so and so qualities and I am aware of Bhairava with so and so qualities=\r\n&quot;). Or, one&#39;s self-awareness can identify with that object (&quot;I am Bhairava =\r\nwith so and so qualities&quot;). Please note that all these samadhis are within =\r\nthe field of duality. There is still a sense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is th=\r\ne rest&quot;, i.e. there is differentiation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; The next state is what most people refer to as samadhi. This is a stat=\r\ne where mind is absorbed in non-dual Self, i.e. without any differentiation=\r\n. When there are no notions of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot;, there ar=\r\ne no thoughts, no opposites and there is only Sat-Chid-Ananda (the bliss of=\r\n just being).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now, let me come to w=\r\nhat Vimalananda says!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The non-dual Self is Shiva (or Purus=\r\nha or Narayana). The field of duality is Shakti (or Prakriti or Narayani). =\r\nThough one may normally think that Shiva and Shakti are different, are they=\r\n really different?!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Because of our notion that Shiva and S=\r\nhakti are different, we can either be with Shakti or with Shiva at a time b=\r\nut not with both at the same time. A yogi who has objectification and the s=\r\nense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot; is in the domain of Shakti. When=\r\n one overcomes objectification and reaches non-dual samadhi, one is in the =\r\ndomain of Shiva. When one leaves that state and one&#39;s egosense (&quot;this is I&quot;=\r\n and &quot;this is the rest&quot;) returns, one will *leave* the domain of Shiva and =\r\nre-enter the field of Shakti. One is prone to be deluded by duality again! =\r\nThat is what Vimalananda is saying.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one can be with Shi=\r\nva *and* Shakti at the *same time*, then one is then not enamored or delude=\r\nd by any aspect of Shakti. When a small aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes on=\r\ne (&quot;this is I&quot;, &quot;that is beautiful&quot;, &quot;that is ugly&quot;, &quot;I like that&quot; etc), on=\r\ne is unable to perceive the entire field of Shakti. This is just like a per=\r\nson tied to a rock in the ocean not being able to swim the entire ocean. Wh=\r\nen one is not bound by any object in the field of Shakti and not attracted =\r\nor repelled by anything, then one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all s=\r\npace-time combinations. This is possible only if one has perfect mastery ov=\r\ner Shakti. That comes only when one has zero attachment to anything in the =\r\nfield of Shakti. That comes only when one is with Shiva enough and eventual=\r\nly becomes like Shiva. If a yogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays in it for =\r\na long time and happens to come back to the field of duality, then one may =\r\nbecome like Shiva and work with Shakti with zero attachment and perfect mas=\r\ntery. One is aware of the entire field of duality - all spaces and times - =\r\nand yet unattached to anything. That is because one perceives the underlyin=\r\ng non-dual Self even as senses perceive various objects of duality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For most people, this is out of bounds. One either experiences no=\r\nn-dual samadhi for a short duration and cannot sustain it longer and comes =\r\nback to be deluded by duality again, or one stays in non-dual samadhi for a=\r\n long time and does not come back (like a salt doll that goes to survey the=\r\n depth of ocean melting in the ocean, to borrow words from Ramakrishna Para=\r\nmahamsa). Exceptions like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Sai Baba, who spent en=\r\nough time in non-dual samadhi and yet came back to live in the world, are s=\r\no rare in this age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me put this=\r\n in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in moolaadhaara, our self-awa=\r\nreness identifies with the physical body and is aware of the physical world=\r\n around us. As Kundalini goes to various places in the subtle body (there a=\r\nre thousands of nadis and chakras!), one is aware of various realities that=\r\n are out there in this universe. For example, one world (realm of awareness=\r\n) may be reverberating with the sound of a particular beejaakshara and fill=\r\ned with a particular light and every being in that world may be a small par=\r\nticle in that light reverberating with that sound. Like that, there are man=\r\ny worlds out there (within us) and one can enter a samadhi through any of t=\r\nhem, when Kundalini reaches a corresponding place.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When Ku=\r\nndalini reaches sahasrara, one&#39;s self-awareness is with Shiva. Shakti loses=\r\n herself to Shiva and there is no objectification that is the hallmark of S=\r\nhakti. If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower chakra, one&#39;s self-aw=\r\nareness is again deluded by duality. However, if shakti comes back from sah=\r\nasrara to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva, then one is aware of duality a=\r\nnd non-dual Self at the same time. One lives as a liberated sage, using the=\r\n body as an instrument to fulfil the will of Nature (since there is no long=\r\ner any individual will).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish t=\r\nextbook,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that mak=\r\ne a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- hramalingam@... wro=\r\nte: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The Samadi is nothing but killing the mind and the entire=\r\n thought process&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This will answer all your questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Network=\r\n.

What is the use of these spurting samadh=\r\nis, anyway? Fine you go off into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a trance, but when you drop =\r\nback down to earth, you are just as you were before. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That sor=\r\nt of samadhi is always seperate from the normal waking &#39;you&#39;. I think it &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; is much better to retain consciousness on this plane even while=\r\n you shift your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; main focus to other realities. Here I am play=\r\ning chess with you, but as I play I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can go to America to chec=\r\nk how your parents are doing, or I can visit Patala &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; (the unde=\r\nrworld), or the planet Venus, or my Guru Maharaj, or whatever I please, &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and still sit here acting as if I know nothing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To be truly aware you have to know what is happen=\r\ning far away today, what had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; happened here long ago, and what=\r\n is going to happen anywhere in the cosmos &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; during the coming =\r\ndecades. But all the while you continue to function &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; effective=\r\nly in this time, space and causality. Awareness on all levels at all &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; times - THAT sort of enlightenment has some use.&quot; - (Vimalananda) A=\r\nghora III The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; law of Karma.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rega=\r\nrds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You are not incorrect, but not fully correct. Moreover, it is=\r\n tough to capture &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; some of these ideas in words, as words conv=\r\ney slightly different meaning to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; different people, based on t=\r\nheir life experiences and predispositions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, =\r\nthere is no formula that ensures self-realization in a certain amount of &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; time and it comes to one through the grace of God. However, gra=\r\nce of God does &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not come to just about anyone - it comes to on=\r\ne who is *ready* to receive it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One becomes ready to receive =\r\nit, through the effort put in this life and all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; previous live=\r\ns, to overcome weaknesses and conditioning. So effort and sadhana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; are not useless. The effort we are talking about here is not effort to=\r\n acquire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something, but effort to give up something.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though it is not incorrect, the view that things are giv=\r\nen only by God&#39;s grace &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; can, when misunderstood, promote inact=\r\nion. God&#39;s grace does not come to a lazy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person doing nothing=\r\n and waiting for God&#39;s grace. God&#39;s grace does not work &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; arbit=\r\nrarily. God&#39;s grace comes to one who has perfect surrender to God. Perfect =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; surrender does not come automatically. Though effort and sadh=\r\nana do not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; guarantee perfect surrender in a certain amount of=\r\n time, they do bring it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; eventually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; whatever one does it is based on pa=\r\nst karmas only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fruits of past karmas decide one&#39;=\r\ns current situation and constrain one&#39;s current &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karmas (actio=\r\nns). But they do not completely decide one&#39;s current karmas. One&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; current karma is in one&#39;s hands (within the constraints).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, one can ask: Does one have a free will that acts=\r\n or does an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; all-pervading shakti act through one? I am quotin=\r\ng a small portion from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; vedic-wisdom message 5009 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All pervading shakti works through all of us and express=\r\nes through all of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, actions and knowledge. But the=\r\nn, some universal rules of action and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reaction govern how thi=\r\ns works. Under the push of one&#39;s own previous karmas, one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is =\r\nplaced in situations that are conducive to certain desires, actions and &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; awareness. The current karmas in those situations may further mo=\r\ndify the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; momentum of the push (reaction) from previous action=\r\ns. Though one&#39;s current &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, actions and awareness are ac=\r\ntually the work of the all pervading &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; shakti, they are also on=\r\ne&#39;s work in a way. It depends on how we look at it and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; how we=\r\n abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in a small &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges water in a c=\r\nup in freezing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; weather are all Ganges water, they are differe=\r\nnt too. One is more, one is less, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one is warm and one is icy.=\r\n Similarly, the work of all pervading shakti is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; different when=\r\n expressed through different vessels (people) in different &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; si=\r\ntuations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As long as one actually feels internal=\r\nly (despite what one may say or pretend &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; externally) that one&#39;=\r\ns desires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s own, one is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perfor=\r\nming karmas and is bound to receive their kaarmik reactions. Only when the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; realization that it is all the work of the all pervading shakt=\r\ni becomes full and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; completely internalized, does one become f=\r\nree from the cycle of actions and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reactions. Until then, all =\r\npervading shakti acts through one to give appropriate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reactio=\r\nns to actions one thinks one is performing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In astrological terms, horoscope is the sum to=\r\ntal of previous karmas, whose &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; fruits one will have to face. T=\r\nhey show the circumstances faced by one. They do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not and cann=\r\not determine what actions one engages in, though certain actions are &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; more likely in certain circumstances.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; De=\r\nstiny is the sum total of the reactions to the actions committed by one&#39;s f=\r\nree &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; will. Today&#39;s actions of free will become destiny tomorro=\r\nw (i.e. on a future &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; date or in a future life).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; ---- hramalingam@... wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Samadi state is not like g=\r\netting a degree by hardwork It comes to certain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;people by=\r\n the Grace of GOD Till GOD or Soul decides to reveal the Samadi state &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;whatever one does it is based on past karmas only&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Ramanapatham&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Relia=\r\nnce Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Network.

However, we &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;cann=\r\not compare ourselves with special beings and we should follow rules and &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;austerities laid out in tradition. Tendulkar may score a cen=\r\ntury with a terrible &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;backache, but we should not walk out=\r\n to bat with a backache and should try to be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;healthy. Aft=\r\ner all, we may not be able to score runs well even when in perfect &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;health!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, it must be realized that external rules =\r\nare only meant as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;*catalyst* in enabling internal trans=\r\nformation. The goal of all sadhana - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;meditation, japam, h=\r\nomam, bhajan, service to others etc - is internal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;transfo=\r\nrmation. If the internal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;to work.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If a room has a window outside of which there=\r\n is heavy wind that is constantly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;blowing a lot of dirt i=\r\nnto the room, sweeping the room with a broom does not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;eli=\r\nminate dirt. First close the window or stop the wind. Similarly, praanaayaa=\r\nma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;is not enough to purify the nadis and give mental puri=\r\nty, if mind (room) is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;attached to the objects perceived b=\r\ny senses (window).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If one reads scriptures and teachings of saints, co=\r\nntemplates on them, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;constantly analyzes inner motives beh=\r\nind various actions by oneself and tries to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;change one&#39;s =\r\nown thinking slowly, this process of contemplation and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;in=\r\ntrospection will augment one&#39;s external sadhana (such as meditation, japam,=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;homam, bhajan, service etc) and purifies one faster.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; By the way, it is useless to think in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kunda=\r\nlini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and raising Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost guar=\r\nanteed to either block &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini from rising or from reac=\r\nhing the highest it can.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini sha=\r\nkti is essentially a symbol of one&#39;s own self-awareness. Though &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;one is the infinite Self (Purusha), one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited obje=\r\nct in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;field of duality (Shakti) springing in Self as =\r\n&quot;self&quot;. That is why Kundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;shakti is worshipped as a f=\r\norm of the divine Mother (Shakti). This &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;self-awareness is=\r\n normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is so and so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;person and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That is why K=\r\nundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (b=\r\nhuloka or physical realm). As &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Kundalini awakens and rises=\r\n to other chakras (other lokas or realms of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;awareness), o=\r\nne&#39;s understanding of who one is gets refined. When Kundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at =\r\nso and so point &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;in this body. It should now rise to so an=\r\nd so point in this body&quot;, it will focus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;and limit one&#39;s s=\r\nelf-awareness to the *physical body* and hence one&#39;s Kundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kundalini to truly rise, one needs t=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;completely forget about the physical body and stop thin=\r\nking in terms of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, *very=\r\n few* people actually experience Kundalini in higher chakras, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;though many talk about it. Kundalini is in Moolaadhaara chakra or atmo=\r\nst &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;Swadhishthana chakra in most yogis, even advanced and =\r\nawakened ones. When praana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;vaayu flows in some higher cha=\r\nkras, that too can result in a powerful &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;experience. Some =\r\nmay mistaken it for Kundalini.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you want a good score in the examina=\r\ntion, study well. Stop thinking too much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;about (and antic=\r\nipating) the examination and focus on the subject instead. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about kundalini, forget about chak=\r\nras, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;forget about the body even. Do sadhana, do sadhana a=\r\nnd do sadhana. Read &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;scriptures and teachings of great sai=\r\nnts. Instead of looking externally and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;judging others, ob=\r\nserve your own actions and thoughts, analyze what is driving &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;them and consciously try to eliminate wrong motives that stem from fals=\r\ne ego, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;adharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger, greed, delu=\r\nsion, wantonness, jealosy), &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;i.e. put to use the knowledge=\r\n of scriptures and the teachings of saints.
