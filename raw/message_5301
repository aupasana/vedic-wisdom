This is what the Swami had to say\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; Be strong=\r\n, my young friends; that is my advice to you. You will be nearer to Heaven =\r\nthrough football than through the study of the Gita.\n&gt; \n&gt;  These are bold w=\r\nords; but I have to say them, for I love you. I know where the shoe pinches=\r\n. I have gained a little experience. You will understand the Gita better wi=\r\nth your biceps, your muscles, a little stronger.You will understand the mig=\r\nhty strength of Krishna with your muscles a little stronger.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is t=\r\nhe great fact: Strength is life, weakness is death. Strength is felicity, l=\r\nife eternal, immortal; weakness is constant strain and misery: Weakness is =\r\ndeath.\n&gt; To succeed, you must have tremendous perseverance, tremendous will=\r\n. `I will drink the ocean, says the preserving soul, `at my will mountains =\r\nwill crumble up.&#39; Have that sort of energy, that sort of will, work hard, a=\r\nnd you reach the goal.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Ravana ,Lord Rama , Krishna , Jaya ,Vijaya.=\r\n..Rama Krishna Paramahamsa, Vimalananda.\n&gt; \n&gt; How can one judge them when t=\r\nhey are not on the same level as these great souls. To even understand the =\r\nGita the Swami advocated a strong mind in a strong body to understand the m=\r\nighty strength of Lord Krishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; Does this not mean we are better off d=\r\noing our Sadhana instead of trying to figure out the mysteries of the Metap=\r\nhysical stories.My intention is not to say stories are irrelevant, my inten=\r\ntion is only to say when one&#39;s energies are limited why not use them toward=\r\ns sadhana each second. \n&gt; \n&gt; At the end of the day if one is not steeped in=\r\n that level of consciousness he or she might not experience the metaphysica=\r\nl story within himself and might not grasp the inner meaning and then the s=\r\ntory no longer is true for them..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kish=\r\nore\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
