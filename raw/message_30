If that is possible then sata chandi \npath can be completed =\r\neven in one day. But I remember you did that in \nChennai over a period of 1=\r\n0 days or so. In this case did the person \n(I think you) who took the sanka=\r\nlp to complete the sata chandi path \nstayed in the temple from start to end=\r\n?\n\nI understand from my experience that without mother&#39;s wish such a \nthing=\r\n is not possible but do people invoke mother&#39;s protection in \nsome way besi=\r\ndes choosing an auspicious time (as you did)\n\nThanks and with my best regar=\r\nds\nSwadhin\n\n\n\n"}}
