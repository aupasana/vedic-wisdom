However, his pronunciation is unbelievably terrible. I have seen several westerners who do a far far better job with the pronunciation of Chandipath as well as other Sanskrit hymns. His pronunciation is particularly bad.\n \nOf course, pronunciation may not matter to some and, if so, please ignore my mail. But, in case it matters, I must say that his pronunciation is unbelievably terrible and not a good starting point for learners.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI am basing my judgment on listening to the first few verses of &quot;Chapter 4&quot; at\n \nhttp://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/shree_maa_chandi_path_audio_classes\n \nAfter listening to two verses, I simply could not continue listening.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; where they have conducted the most Chandi Homas in all over USA.\n \nThey seem to have done a Sahasra (1000) Chandi homa over a period of 1000 days and they seem to be still doing Chandi homam on every Sunday. That is excellent.\n \nHowever, it is not possible to know where most Chandi homas were done in USA.\n \nAt my house, we do 3 Chandi homas per day (one by myself and two by two other sadhakas). I myself have done about 1200 Chandi homas here. In a neighboring town 10 miles from here, a priest from India has been doing 10 Chandi homas per day for the last 2 months and plans to finish 1000 Chandi homas in August. He is doing it as a private sadhana, but without a private sankalpa and for peace and dharma in the world.\n \nLike this, there may be several sadhakas doing intense sadhana with Chandi homam that we may not know about.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn any case, numbers do not matter. Manish once told me, &quot;Narasimha, numbers do not matter. What one needs is one homam where one experiences Her in oneself and not twenty homas where nothing happens. These days, I cannot properly finish even one Chandi homam. Once I am in the 4th or 5th chapter, I go into a trance and I cannot continue anymore. I stay like that for many hours and cannot finish the homam.&quot;\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Respected Shree Maa has a ashram in Napa Valley, a couple hour drive from bay area.
