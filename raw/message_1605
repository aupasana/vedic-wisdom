It just continues the cycle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But what is the b=\r\nig deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continue which eve=\r\nr path one choses, dharma or adharma.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Without discharging one&#39;s d=\r\nharma, Nature will not allow one to attain moksha. Moksha (liberation) is a=\r\nttained when one is free from desires, attachments, attractions and aversio=\r\nns. As long as there are some karmik debts that need to be settled, Nature =\r\nwill keep some attractions and some aversions alive in the person and keep =\r\none away from liberation. Thus, there is a big difference between following=\r\n dharma and not following dharma. While following one&#39;s dharma does not gua=\r\nrantee liberation, not following one&#39;s dharma does guarantee not getting li=\r\nberated and keeps liberation further away.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The key to making spir=\r\nitual progress is to follow one&#39;s dharma, without identifying with the acti=\r\nons too much. If one fulfils one&#39;s dharma but identifies with the actions s=\r\ntrongly (i.e. has the sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot; and feels proud), that creat=\r\nes new karmas and new bondage. Any action or thought performed with a sense=\r\n of &quot;I&quot; involved in it causes new karmas and new bondage. Each such action =\r\nkeeps one further away from liberation.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Of course, it is difficul=\r\nt to perform actions without a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;. So, to start with,=\r\n atleast remove an action and its doership from your thoughts once the acti=\r\non is finished. Keep the sense of doership while you do it (because it help=\r\ns you do it better), but remove it from your mind once the action is comple=\r\nte. Normally we cling on to the doership of an action for a long time and t=\r\nhat creates a strong self-identification.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As an example, suppose =\r\nyou build a temple. You may do it with a sense of &quot;*I* am doing some import=\r\nant work&quot; while the building work is going on, because that thought and res=\r\nultant attachment motivates you overcome problems. But, once the temple is =\r\nfinished, learn to say &quot;krishnaarpanamastu&quot; (surrendered to the Lord) and t=\r\nhink no more of it as your work or your &quot;achievement&quot;. If people praise you=\r\n for the great thing you have done, learn to not dwell on it mentally and n=\r\not feel proud. There may be no need to demonstrate your humility by lecturi=\r\nng or saying something, but, you can just smile and keep your mind from dwe=\r\nlling on that compliment and feeling proud.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We cling on to our go=\r\nod and bad actions for too long, by thinking of them (&quot;I did it&quot;) for too l=\r\nong. If we learn to cut off doership in the mind once the action is finishe=\r\nd, that is a great starting point. The next step is to not have the sense o=\r\nf &quot;I am doing it&quot; even as one is doing it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one engages in acti=\r\nons without attachment and without a sense of ownership/doership, one stops=\r\n accumulating new karmas (new burden). As that happens, one&#39;s conscience be=\r\ncomes stronger and tells one of one&#39;s dharma clearer and louder. That enabl=\r\nes one to unload the existing karmik burdens (perform correct dharma) witho=\r\nut picking up new burdens (no new actions with self-identification). That t=\r\nakes one closer to liberation.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thus, I emphasize detached action.=\r\n Being able to engage in action with very little (or no) attachment and sen=\r\nse of doership is more important and urgent than finding out what one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma is and discharging it.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that i=\r\ns what his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked him to do\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Not every &quot;guru&quot; will=\r\n have a perfect idea of what one&#39;s dharma is. As I said, &quot;If one&#39;s guru is =\r\nan elevated soul with a clear insight into one&#39;s inner core, such a guru ca=\r\nn give perfect guidance&quot;. After all, one&#39;s dharma depends on what actions o=\r\nne engaged in in the past lives while identifying with the actions, what ka=\r\nrmik debts were created and what mental conditioning was created. Those thi=\r\nngs can be known with certainty only by a guru who is self-realized.\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a terrorist is doing a suicide att=\r\nack he may just be doing his dharma.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; That is theoretically possib=\r\nle, but very unlikely. One who kills tens or hundreds or thousands of peopl=\r\ne with a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;, &quot;I am taking revenge&quot;, &quot;I am punishing t=\r\nhem&quot;, &quot;I will go to heaven because of it&quot; is doing an action with a strong =\r\nself-identification. Whether this act is expected from one by Nature as a r=\r\nesult of previous karmik debts to the victims or not is unknowable, but wha=\r\nt we can know for sure is that this person has created new karma and new de=\r\nbts. Any action performed with self-identification causes new karma, new de=\r\nbts and new bondage. The bondage will pull him in a future life into situat=\r\nions where one will be paid those debts back.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, the article of Robert Svoboda given earlier can also be acc=\r\nessed at the following &quot;tiny&quot; URL (thanks to Kishore for creating it):\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; http://tinyurl.com/dblc6a\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): ht=\r\ntp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------- \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: rajarshi na=\r\nndy \n&gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Tuesday, April 07,=\r\n 2009 1:21 AM\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Nice article on dharma by R=\r\nobert Svoboda\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         I read Svoboda=\r\n&#39;s article and I had a few question. Theoritcal but relevant.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n    He has given the idea of of terrorists. When a terrorist is doing a sui=\r\ncide attack he may just be doing his dharma. That is what he maybe drawn to=\r\n as per his perceptions, that is what his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked him to do,=\r\n and that is what his ideals/principles/books maybe asked of him to do. So =\r\nfrom teh point of view of dharma, how can he be blamed? Therefore, the stat=\r\nement taht &quot;Dharmo rakshati rakshitah..&quot;, does not make sense. How is his d=\r\nharma protecting him? What is he getting in return, other than a bag load o=\r\nf strong karmas to fend off at a later date, when he may not even be aware =\r\nwhy he has this karmas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Can there is conflicting Dharmas f=\r\nor one person? Or more important vs less important dharma? Swadharma should=\r\n be situational. Sant Tulsidas&#39;s  broader dharma may have been realizing Ra=\r\nma, but as a husband, his dharma should have been to keep his wife happy. S=\r\no ideally, I don&#39;t think we can ever full perform every dharma that is expe=\r\ncted of us. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         I believe the reason this idea of Dharma was =\r\nexistent in ancient times, was mostly because nature has created various ki=\r\nnds of people, each with varying tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort o=\r\nf approxiamtion, or the best way to tell men that we are all different and =\r\nyet we are not incorrect in anyway. This is much better than the new ages p=\r\nhilosophies which outright deny reality and claim everything and everyone i=\r\ns born equal. It is not so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         The word religion is a 13 cent=\r\nury invention and, etymologically, and inherently competitive in nature. Un=\r\nlike Dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Also, as Narasimhaji&#39;s mail shows correctly, =\r\nfollowing Dharma is no gaurantee of anything, least of all Moksha. It just =\r\ncontinues the cycle. But what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, it =\r\nwould any way continue which ever path one choses, dharma or adharma. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;         A much better way of conduction life, I feel, is maknig a ment=\r\nal note of Karma. To know teh simple truth that that which goes out will co=\r\nme back to you and that, if you had not been bad at some point, nothing bad=\r\n will ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a life =\r\nbased on and being on the right side of karma, is much easier and profitabl=\r\ne  than trying to find that elusive dharma which anyway won&#39;t help one in t=\r\nhe long run.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Just my feeling on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n    -Regards\n&gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Nar=\r\nasimha P.V.R.

Right action varies from person to person, from time t=\r\no time \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what na=\r\nture expects from you, \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; which in turn is based on who you h=\r\nave been in the past, what actions you \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; did in the past whi=\r\nle identifying with the action, who you affected in the \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; pa=\r\nst (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n           &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumul=\r\nated until \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; If, based=\r\n on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n        &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one=\r\n&#39;s mental \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pers=\r\non to spread the message of \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; uniformity of all religions, t=\r\nhat becomes one&#39;s dharma.

The time then was such that there was too much weight \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremen=\r\ndous \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destro=\r\nyed to a great extent, \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the to=\r\nne for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; it was his dharma=\r\n to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; respe=\r\ncted were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th centu=\r\nry as one of \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yog=\r\nananda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; previous life, according to Ra=\r\nmakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; new time and=\r\n place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; =\r\naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n           &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and =\r\nservice to \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to,=\r\n as per what Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; said), his dharma based on the ti=\r\nme and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; The tricky question is: How =\r\ndoes one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Some=\r\n people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;           &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Thoug=\r\nh the concept \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism =\r\nfor a long time, the concept of \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; caste mobility was very mu=\r\nch there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; killing birds.=\r\n He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts of=\r\nf with the varna \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; of father, because that is what one is ex=\r\nposed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; develops in life, one gets o=\r\nne&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Thu=\r\ns, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;           &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not jus=\r\nt 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; the world. Each person has individual dharm=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very ve=\r\nry very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; enough, one will *know* =\r\none&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; mind t=\r\nhat tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n      &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, =\r\nwe get \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; We shoul=\r\nd make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\n        &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, bu=\r\nt doing \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importa=\r\nnce is to engage in \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; actions without identification. *That*=\r\n alone ensures that we are not \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.=\r\ne. not increasing the load. We should not build \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; too much a=\r\nttachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n&gt; &gt;          =\r\n &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the g=\r\niven \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-ide=\r\nntification with the \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; action as possible. When the action i=\r\ns finished, we should leave the result \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; to god. We should n=\r\not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; work=\r\n&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousnes=\r\ns slowly. \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper a=\r\nnd tell our dharma clearer. \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; There is a positive feedback h=\r\nere. This will slowly enable us to see our \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma clearly =\r\nand follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; =\r\nThe bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense o=\r\nf \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engage=\r\ns in action with \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n         &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; In deciding=\r\n one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt; &gt;          =\r\n &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One c=\r\nan \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given=\r\n to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritu=\r\nal master, one can take the words of \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; the master to determi=\r\nne one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; W=\r\nhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna wh=\r\no clarified his \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; and wanted to renounce t=\r\nhe world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n          &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n         &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is,=\r\n what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can=\r\n err in the judgment of what \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s gur=\r\nu is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; one&#39;s inne=\r\nr core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Bottomline is tha=\r\nt I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; de=\r\nclare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;           &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thu=\r\nmbrules to find \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can ref=\r\nine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; dharma by increasing inte=\r\nrnal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; sadhana (=\r\nlike homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \n&gt; &gt;           =\r\n&gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding =\r\nof \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;          =\r\n &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Do=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt;        =\r\n   &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;           &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast=\r\n. net\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.=\r\nSriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;           &gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yaho=\r\no.co. in&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n  &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n       &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;=\r\n&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is =\r\nvery personal.\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how ca=\r\nn we approach\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; Does it has to d=\r\no something with vedas and upanishads\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; reg=\r\nards\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;&gt; jitender\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
