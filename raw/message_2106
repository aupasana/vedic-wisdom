I am reproducing extract from Narasimha&#39;s message regarding Sans=\r\nkrit grammar. One important thing which has come to my mind is that, becaus=\r\ne it is Visarga, in Sanskrit scripts, it is denoted by : and=A0NOT by =A0&#39;H=\r\na&#39; akshar written in devanagari.=A0that shows that there is some important =\r\ndifference in pronunciation and=A0the sound should not be made explicitly a=\r\ns Ha but one should let=A0go the air=A0while pronouncing it. =A0it is diffe=\r\nrent thing that=A0apparently it sounds=A0like Ha.=A0=A0\n&gt; &gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo=\r\n yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; as &quot;:&quot; and=\r\n notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You are\n&gt; &gt; suppose=\r\nd to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation\n&gt; &gt; of =\r\n&quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsupposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, mak=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; it &quot; naha &quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is =\r\nadded to\n&gt; &gt; the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is pr=\r\nonounced\n&gt; &gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, respect=\r\nively\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce i=\r\nt as\n&gt; &gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in t=\r\nhe 3\n&gt; &gt; words.\n***\n&gt; I also need confirmation about Vighneshwara whom we w=\r\norship as remover of obstacles being &gt;the creator of obstacles as well.\nFir=\r\nst time i thought about Vigneshwara in line with what you mentioned. if we =\r\nsplit the word which are joined then it is Vigna + Ishwara =3D God of Obsta=\r\ncle. it can very well mean that the God who controls obstacles. now if we d=\r\nerive meaning that Ganapati (Vigneshwara) is the controller of Obstacles th=\r\nen what you mentioned seems quite correct because the one who controls obst=\r\nacle has the power to put forth the obstacle as well as remove it.=A0\n&gt; Fur=\r\nthermore, is there some significance of the trunk turned to the right as op=\r\nposed to the left &gt;or the middle?\n=A0\nI do not know WHY but It is a popular=\r\n opinion in Maharashtra and Gujarat (may be in the other places as well) th=\r\nat=A0Murti or picture of Ganapati having Right Sided trunk are very active =\r\n(Live) and hence they should be handled with extreme care. i mean, the idol=\r\n or picture should never remain without Pujan etc... Generally people are a=\r\nfraid of keeping such a idol in their homes because they feel that if they =\r\nare no able=A0to properly worship the idol then some kind of misfortune wil=\r\nl befall on them. Other thing is that, there is=A0also belief that if the i=\r\ndol is properly propitiated then=A0it can give great fortune.\nit is not out=\r\n of place to mention here that about a year back somebody gave me a Ganapat=\r\ni idol having Right side trunk. i kept it in my small puja place. i think i=\r\n hardly ever worship the idol but when i started Homam i used to keep the i=\r\ndol in the homam. although i knew the above belief, i was never afraid of m=\r\nisfortune. afterwards i came to Mumbai for vacation and i bought another id=\r\nol of metal. now i had (still have) 2 idols and i used to keep only metal i=\r\ndol (with left side trunk) but i had some kind of guilt feeling that i am n=\r\not able to keep the earlier one idol so i decided to give the metal idol to=\r\n one of my colleagues who was going to shift to a new house. i gave them th=\r\ne idol but they were little hesitant and gave me back. i asked my Guru abou=\r\nt it and he asked to keep both the idols in the Homam and i started doing t=\r\nhat. now during my Homam,=A0there are both Ganapati present, one with Right=\r\n=A0side trunk and one with left side. one who is ready to\n punish and the o=\r\nne who just let go like visarga :).\nbut truly speaking, my fear=A0for such =\r\nthings have almost gone. No trepidation by whatever beliefs.
