People =\r\nbelonged to different varnas based on their aptitude and served different p=\r\nurposes in society. It wasn&#39;t a rigid system, but a flexible and mobile sys=\r\ntem based on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a child may get=\r\n exposed to what father does and may have a good chance of developing aptit=\r\nude for such work, one would by default get father&#39;s varna at birth. But, a=\r\ns one grows up and one&#39;s vasanas (conditioning from past lives) develop, on=\r\ne may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a varna different fr=\r\nom father&#39;s.\n\nFor example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but became =\r\na braahmana and became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born as a shoodra an=\r\nd lived by hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a maharshi later=\r\n.\n\nNo matter where one is born and how one was brought up, anyone who is in=\r\nterested in knowledge and liberation and not interested in money or power o=\r\nver others, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an orthodox brahmin fami=\r\nly, if one is deeply interested in money or power and authority over others=\r\n, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not superior and anothe=\r\nr varna is not inferior. People of different varnas serve different purpose=\r\ns. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias, mistrust, fights and =\r\nkillings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate consequence of deepening=\r\n Kali.\n\nWhat I am saying is not accepted in mainstream society today becaus=\r\ne we are deeply into Kali yuga. But, when the Mother decides, social notion=\r\ns can change quickly. In fact, we are going through a phase of huge global =\r\ntransformation. Political, economoic, social and religious structures of th=\r\ne world will be redefined during the coming decades and will remain valid f=\r\nor many centuries. \n\nBTW, when the divine Mother appeared before my guru in=\r\n March 2006 and gave a command to spread a simple homam ritual in the world=\r\n for the coming times, her clear directive was to not differentiate based o=\r\nn caste, creed, class and race. We encourage anybody who desires to worship=\r\n any god in fire for spiritual progress to perform homam on a regular basis=\r\n using the homam manuals at the homam website (see below).\n\n&gt; Also if a per=\r\nson born in low cast is that mean he will receive less grace of\n&gt; GOD & a p=\r\nesron who belongs to high cast has abundance of it. \n\nRather than caste, en=\r\nvironment in which one grows up does have a role (and caste does sometimes =\r\ninfluence the family environment in India). One born in a family (brahmana =\r\nor otherwise) that worships god everyday is exposed to that notion. One bro=\r\nught up in a family that cares a little about god or morality and pursues m=\r\noney or power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that notion. So the religio=\r\nus/spiritual aspects of the environment in which one grows up do play a rol=\r\ne. However, if one has strong vasanas, they will eventually take hold. One =\r\nwill meet people who make those vasanas flourish and those vasanas take con=\r\ntrol.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writing=\r\ns,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil=\r\nms.org \nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n\n---- sudhir junonikar &lt;sudhirjunonik=\r\nar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Namaste all gurujanas\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Since chil=\r\ndhood i am wandering to have answers to my question, they seems to be fooli=\r\nsh to scholars like you but as lay man I am carrying it with me.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n Our society is discriminated in to various cast, does our veda support thi=\r\ns cast system?\n&gt; =C2=A0If we consider that doshas/papam=C2=A0is associated=\r\n=C2=A0if we make such =C2=A0discrimination then why it is not taken in to a=\r\nccount.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Since thousand&#39;s of years=C2=A0 people are treated badly=\r\n=C2=A0even animals=C2=A0were treated well.
