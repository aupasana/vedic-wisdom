I a=\r\nm doing it without revealing your identity.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nf he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt\n&gt; indulge=\r\n himself\n&gt; &gt; mindfully in the deed?&enjoy it,he went only for a reason he i=\r\ns not the\n&gt; karman,atma\n&gt; &gt; cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went =\r\nto the queen&thus he is\n&gt; still as sacred\n&gt; &gt; as ever?\n&gt;\n&gt; Though correct, =\r\nthis is a dangerous notion for most people. True, atma\n&gt; cannot be poluted =\r\nand is beyond desires and actions. But most people do not\n&gt; identify with a=\r\ntma. They identify with a perishable body. So all the talk\n&gt; of &quot;all is atm=\r\na and atma is pure&quot; is just theory.\n&gt;\n&gt; Atma is like an ocean in which wave=\r\ns and rippes arise and move. Ocean does\n&gt; not get shattered when ripples hi=\r\nt each other and stays the same. But\n&gt; bodies, minds and other perishable o=\r\nbjects arising in atma are like waves\n&gt; and ripples arising and moving in o=\r\ncean. They increase, decrease, get\n&gt; shattered etc. One identifying with th=\r\ne ocean of atma is beyond happiness\n&gt; and sadness. One identifying with the=\r\n ripple of a body will experience\n&gt; happiness, sadness etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose one=\r\n is watching a movie and knows that it is not real and just a\n&gt; movie. Stil=\r\nl, when a really scary scene comes, one may be startled. Mere\n&gt; intellectua=\r\nl understanding that it is not real and just a movie, is not\n&gt; enough. It h=\r\nas to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly,\n&gt; intellectually kn=\r\nowing that all this is a play and not real, is not enough.\n&gt; When some real=\r\nly pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL identify\n&gt; with the body=\r\n and experience something.\n&gt;\n&gt; If Shankara was fully enlightened before tha=\r\nt episode (we don&#39;t know that\n&gt; for sure), then the action would not have b=\r\nound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve\n&gt; created a rina. If he experienced some p=\r\nleasure, he would create a new rina\n&gt; to the queen, to various deities (!) =\r\nwho live within one&#39;s consciousness\n&gt; and operate various parts of one&#39;s bo=\r\ndy and mind, and to various beings in\n&gt; his virya who may have been signifi=\r\ncantly affected. He would have to pay\n&gt; those debts back later.\n&gt;\n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; There is nothing absolutely sacred or dirty about any acti=\r\non. It is the\n&gt; intent and attitude of the actor that makes an action sacre=\r\nd or dirty.\n&gt; Self-centered actions are more dirty than selfless actions ge=\r\nared at\n&gt; others. More so, the denser and more selfish one&#39;s conditioning.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but knowing this still he performed his ritua=\r\nls for his mother?did he do\n&gt; &gt; this for love or respect or pity or just to=\r\n balance his runa?\n&gt;\n&gt; Only still ocean does not have any ripples or their =\r\nmovement. Similarly\n&gt; only ummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya =\r\nand before new\n&gt; srishti/creation) does not have any objects and actions wi=\r\nthin it. Atma\n&gt; during a srishti cycle does have many objects within it and=\r\n many actions\n&gt; between them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sittin=\r\ng still in a forest and doing\n&gt; nothing. Various bodies keep doing various =\r\nactions. A realized person\n&gt; identifies with atma and actions by various pe=\r\nople seem to him/her like\n&gt; his/her actions. One does not particularly iden=\r\ntify with what one&#39;s old\n&gt; body specifically does (based on previous moment=\r\num).\n&gt;\n&gt; Nature uses such realized people to set good examples for the worl=\r\nd. So\n&gt; they do engage in some actions. They have no pride or shame, no hap=\r\npiness\n&gt; or sadness and do whatever spontaneously occurs to them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Shank=\r\nara performing last rites for mother would&#39;ve made Mother happy.\n&gt; Moreover=\r\n, it would set an example for future. One&#39;s interaction with the\n&gt; world is=\r\n give & take. We give things to others and take things from them.\n&gt; True re=\r\nnunciation is in renouncing what we take. There is no need to\n&gt; renounce gi=\r\nving. As the prevant notion of sannyasa was to cut off from the\n&gt; world, Sh=\r\nankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Vivekan=\r\nanda and Swami Sivananda took this further. They engaged in a\n&gt; lot of serv=\r\nice for the society, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselves\n&gt; in isolat=\r\nion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. you are &quot;t=\r\naking&quot;\n&gt; something in return of what you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi be=\r\ntter\n&gt; isolate oneself from the world and neither give nor take (except abs=\r\nolute\n&gt; essentials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some leve=\r\nl, it is\n&gt; a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give others.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; The purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some taking is\n&gt;=\r\n unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not on\n&gt; =\r\nwhat you take.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; can one achieve moksha still i=\r\nn family life\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are still not old enough. Focus on your stud=\r\nies for the next 3-4\n&gt; years. But, eventually, you can read &quot;Yoga Vasishtha=\r\nm&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; still iam in silly thoughts....ya can man=\r\n controll his thoughts100%?]\n&gt;\n&gt; Various good and bad thoughts come to mind=\r\n continuously, for it is the\n&gt; nature of mind! As long as one is alive, the=\r\n force that runs one&#39;s\n&gt; existence creates thoughts in the mind. This force=\r\n is based on the momentum\n&gt; from various notions one was exposed to and var=\r\nious desires one\n&gt; entertained, during various lives. It is called &quot;mental =\r\nconditioning&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can it be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one can add=\r\n new notions and\n&gt; new desires to this driving force and the its direction =\r\ncan be slowly\n&gt; refined over time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mind is the problem and mind is the =\r\nkey to the solution as well. Use mind\n&gt; to change the direction of mind.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I don&#39;t know about 100%, but I do not know one can modify one&#39;s thinking\n=\r\n&gt; over time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spiritu=\r\nality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;,\n&gt; if atma is=\r\n in us and atma is the part of akhanda jyoti swaroop[the god-all\n&gt; in one f=\r\nire form] and the man knew that pleasure of the realization like\n&gt; sankara =\r\ndid....\n&gt; if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didn=\r\nt indulge\n&gt; himself mindfully in the deed?&enjoy it,he went only for a reas=\r\non he is not\n&gt; the karman,atma cannot be polluted,realising this sankara we=\r\nnt to the\n&gt; queen&thus he is still as sacred as ever?\n&gt; but knowing this st=\r\nill he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do\n&gt; this for love or re=\r\nspect or pity or just to balance his runa?\n&gt; i have read&#39;&#39;ruaanubandha ruup=\r\nena pasu patni sutaalayah&quot;did he want to\n&gt; balance his runa?or..but still h=\r\ne is a sarvasanghaparityagi...why may he\n&gt; have done it?what may he be tell=\r\ning us through this deed?\n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; [&lt;deleted&gt; can one achieve moksha s=\r\ntill in family life if he really\n&gt; realises atman if the above assumption i=\r\ns true..then how can one realise\n&gt; atman?is it a feeling or a substratum?wh=\r\nat is it made upof?\n&gt; still iam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll hi=\r\ns thoughts100%?]\n&gt; iam extremely sorry...but...i couldnt resist asking you =\r\nfor &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; really sorry for bothering...\n&gt; namaskaram....\n&gt; good night=\r\n...\n&gt; --\n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\r\n--0015173ff30ee0d0c604c1266be2\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&quot;no neurosurgeon/ neurologist can ever find the seat =\r\nof consiousness for that which they are looking for is that which is lookin=\r\ng&quot; Karl Jung.

I am doing it without revealing your identity.&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; if he didnt go to t=\r\nhe queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge himself&lt;br&gt;&gt; min=\r\ndfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he went only for a reason he is not the ka=\r\nrman,atma&lt;br&gt;&gt; cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went to the que=\r\nen&amp;thus he is still as sacred&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as ever?&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Though correc=\r\nt, this is a dangerous notion for most people. True, atma cannot be poluted=\r\n and is beyond desires and actions. But most people do not identify with at=\r\nma. They\n identify with a perishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is =\r\natma and atma is pure&quot; is just theory.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Atma is like an ocean=\r\n in which waves and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not get shattered whe=\r\nn ripples hit each other and stays the same. But bodies, minds and other pe=\r\nrishable objects arising in atma are like waves and ripples arising and mov=\r\ning in ocean. They increase, decrease, get shattered etc. One identifying w=\r\nith the ocean of atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One identifying with=\r\n the ripple of a body will experience happiness, sadness etc.&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;Su=\r\nppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is not real and just a movi=\r\ne. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may be startled. Mere intell=\r\nectual understanding that it is not real and just a movie, is not enough. I=\r\nt has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly, intellectual=\r\nly knowing that all this is a play and not real, is not enough. When some r=\r\neally\n pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL identify with the bo=\r\ndy and experience something.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;If Shankara was fully enlightened be=\r\nfore that episode (we don&#39;t know that for sure), then the action would =\r\nnot have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve created a rina. If he experi=\r\nenced some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to various de=\r\nities (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and operate various parts=\r\n of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may hav=\r\ne been significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;There=\r\n is nothing absolutely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent a=\r\nnd attitude of the actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centere=\r\nd actions are more dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, t=\r\nhe denser and more selfish one&#39;s\n conditioning. &lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; but knowing this still=\r\n he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do&lt;br&gt;&gt; this for love or=\r\n respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Only still ocean do=\r\nes not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only ummanifest atma (=\r\nSelf after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/creation) does not ha=\r\nve any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srishti cycle does have=\r\n many objects within it and many actions between them.&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;Thus, rea=\r\nlizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and doing nothing. Vari=\r\nous bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person identifies with at=\r\nma and actions by various people seem to him/her like his/her actions. One =\r\ndoes not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body specifically do=\r\nes (based on previous momentum).&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;Nature uses\n such realized peop=\r\nle to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some actions. T=\r\nhey have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whatever spontan=\r\neously occurs to them.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Shankara performing last rites for mother =\r\nwould&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for futur=\r\ne. One&#39;s interaction with the world is give &amp; take. We give things =\r\nto others and take things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing wha=\r\nt we take. There is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of sa=\r\nnnyasa was to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (=\r\ne.g. mother) sannyasa.&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda too=\r\nk this further. They engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike ot=\r\nher sannyasis who lock themselves in isolation.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Of course, if the=\r\n act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot;=\r\n something in return of what you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi\n better is=\r\nolate oneself from the world and neither give nor take (except absolute ess=\r\nentials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some level, it is a =\r\ngood idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give others.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n=A0&lt;br&gt;The purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some taking =\r\nis unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not on =\r\nwhat you take.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; can one achieve moksha still in family life&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;You are still not old enough. Focus on your studies for the next 3=\r\n-4 years. But, eventually, you can read &quot;Yoga Vasishtham&quot;.&lt;br&gt;=A0=\r\n&lt;br&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * &lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; still i=\r\nam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll his thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;V=\r\narious good and bad thoughts come to mind\n continuously, for it is the natu=\r\nre of mind! As long as one is alive, the force that runs one&#39;s existenc=\r\ne creates thoughts in the mind. This force is based on the momentum from va=\r\nrious notions one was exposed to and various desires one entertained, durin=\r\ng various lives. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;C=\r\nan it be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one can add new notions and new=\r\n desires to this driving force and the its direction can be slowly refined =\r\nover time.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Mind is the problem and mind is the key to the solutio=\r\nn as well. Use mind to change the direction of mind.&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t=\r\n know about 100%, but I do not know one can modify one&#39;s thinking over =\r\ntime.&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; S=\r\npirituality Resources: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;,&lt;br&gt;=\r\nif atma is in us and atma is the part of akhanda jyoti swaroop[the god-all =\r\nin one fire form] and the man knew\n that pleasure of the realization like s=\r\nankara did....&lt;br&gt;if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if=\r\n he didnt indulge himself mindfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he went only =\r\nfor a reason he is not the karman,atma cannot be polluted,realising this sa=\r\nnkara went to the queen&amp;thus he is still as sacred as ever?&lt;br&gt;\nbut kno=\r\nwing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do this for =\r\nlove or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;br&gt;i have read&#39;&#3=\r\n9;ruaanubandha ruupena pasu patni sutaalayah&quot;did he want to balance hi=\r\ns runa?or..but still he is a sarvasanghaparityagi...why may he have done it=\r\n?what may he be telling us through this deed?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;d=\r\neleted&gt; can one achieve moksha still in family life if he really realise=\r\ns atman if the above assumption is true..then how can one realise atman?is =\r\nit a feeling or a substratum?what is it made upof?&lt;br&gt;\nstill iam in silly t=\r\nhoughts....ya can man controll his\n thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;iam extremely sorry..=\r\n.but...i couldnt resist asking you for &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;really sorry for =\r\nbothering...&lt;br&gt;namaskaram....&lt;br&gt;good night...&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(255,255,255);min-height:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/bl=\r\nockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0015173ff30ee0d0c604c1266be2--\r\n\n"}}
