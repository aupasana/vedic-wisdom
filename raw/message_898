Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to clarify one thing lest I be misunderstood. I am not at\n&gt; all saying\n&gt;&gt; that people should not chant veda mantras. They can. But I am\n&gt; pointing out\n&gt;&gt; that Veda mantras do not work to their potential these days.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I can clarify using an analogy. Imagine that mantras are the\n&gt; weapons used to\n&gt;&gt; protect the mind from enemies (weaknesses). After all, mantra\n&gt; comes from\n&gt;&gt; mana and tra and does mean &quot;that which protects the mind&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If regular mantras are like sticks with which you can beat up\n&gt; enemies, veda\n&gt;&gt; mantras are like powerful guns with which you can shoot with\n&gt; precision.\n&gt;&gt; However, the correct knowledge related to chanting and\n&gt; experiencing veda\n&gt;&gt; mantras is pretty much lost today. Though there are people who\n&gt; possess a lot\n&gt;&gt; of guns, pretty much nobody knows how to shoot a gun. Thus, one\n&gt; who wants to\n&gt;&gt; use a gun will have to use it like a stick and beat the enemy with\n&gt; the gun.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personally, i am in favour of living thru my karmas with\n&gt; consciousness\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rather than appeasing anything/anyone. the grace of\n&gt; consciousness of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; savitur is perhaps what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I do not want to make a personal comment on you, but want to say\n&gt; something\n&gt;&gt; in general.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; People talk about living thru karmas with consciousness, about\n&gt; surrendering\n&gt;&gt; and going through the fruits of karmas with a stable mind etc. But\n&gt; these\n&gt;&gt; things are easier to talk about than to actually do. When the\n&gt; fruit of a\n&gt;&gt; really bad karma strikes, then it will be difficult to maintain\n&gt; the same\n&gt;&gt; attitude and mental stability. One can be shaken. Being able to\n&gt; live through\n&gt;&gt; the fruits of *any* karma with a stable and unpertubed mind is\n&gt; indeed the\n&gt;&gt; goal of all. One can get there only after burning/exhausting\n&gt; several\n&gt;&gt; blocking karmas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; With some sadhana, some tranquility and stability of mind comes.\n&gt; That\n&gt;&gt; enables one to do better and more focussed sadhana. That increases\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; tranquility and stability of mind. That enables one to do even\n&gt; better\n&gt;&gt; sadhana. This slowly picks up and eventually one reaches the state\n&gt; where one\n&gt;&gt; can simply live through the fruits of *any* karma without any\n&gt; impact on the\n&gt;&gt; equanimity and stability of mind. Before that, serious sadhana is\n&gt; needed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 07, 2009 4:00 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: gayatri mantra\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; namaste narasimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thankyou. your words are always very inspiring.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; yes, u are right that what u had recorded was just the humming\n&gt; of ups\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and downs of the mantra to show the intonation. it stuck in my\n&gt; memory\n&gt;&gt; &gt; because it was very different from the mantra i have heard\n&gt; recorded by\n&gt;&gt; &gt; various people.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there may not be any perfect rendering of the mantra in the\n&gt; present\n&gt;&gt; &gt; times...but still one longs for something closer to the real\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thing...whatever that may be.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so the search continues....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personally, i am in favour of living thru my karmas with\n&gt; consciousness\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rather than appeasing anything/anyone. the grace of\n&gt; consciousness of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; savitur is perhaps what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; however, having a very very rudimentary &quot;knowledge&quot; of astrology\n&gt; i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sometimes indulge my imagination in thinking that with a retro\n&gt; mars,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; saturn and mercury my karmas must be rather &quot;jatil&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you mentioned about lord subramanya. carrying the imagination a\n&gt; lttle\n&gt;&gt; &gt; further, i find an echo of lord subramnaya in the krittika\n&gt; nakshatra\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which is the lagna nakshatra. there is also (imaginatively\n&gt; speaking)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perhaps some connection to have jupiter, sun and mars on the\n&gt; adra -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mool (rahu-ketu) axis or guru-soul-karma axis?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Personally, i dont have any god i can visualise while meditating\n&gt;&gt; &gt; though i feel an affinity to shiva sometimes. yesterday while\n&gt; doing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the gayatri mantra i tried to visualise gayatri and for some\n&gt; reason\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that made me think about love and mother.... and that made me\n&gt; cry.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sorry, i may be getting carried away...so i will stop here.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; many thanks once again!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; love and best wishes...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Veda mantras are in a different league compared to other\n&gt; mantras. As\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I said\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; earlier, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of\n&gt; mind on any\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; combination of sounds. When one&#39;s mind repeats the same\n&gt; combination of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sounds over and over again, eventually one&#39;s mind may lose all\n&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts and become absorbed in that combination of sounds. THEN\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences the energy represented by that combination of\n&gt; sounds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Different combinations of sounds have different energies. But\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experiencing\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the energy of any combination of sounds is a better experience\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the mind\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; than the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; thoughts.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; league. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perfectly in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; today&#39;s times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant\n&gt; them, veda\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other\n&gt; mantras and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do not\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; really act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a veda\n&gt; mantra, one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences the energy of a corrupted version and not of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; original veda\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The expression &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the\n&gt; actual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; savitru\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat\n&gt; savitur&quot; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ends\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only\n&gt; hummed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the ups\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and downs to show the intonation. I was instructed to never\n&gt; chant\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Savitru\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my\n&gt; food\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and I get\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever little energy I have from it. In order to continue\n&gt; doing my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in the world, I will need to be selfish with my food. I can\n&gt; share\n&gt;&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; else with the world.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficient\n&gt; to give\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job\n&gt; than\n&gt;&gt; &gt; astrology\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as we understand it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have seen my guru make some interesting mantra suggestions.\n&gt; For\n&gt;&gt; &gt; example, I\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; once mentioned to Manish a friend who visits me often and\n&gt; meditates\n&gt;&gt; &gt; when I\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; do homam. Manish said, &quot;he will not be interested in doing\n&gt; homam by\n&gt;&gt; &gt; himself.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If at all he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; homam. Teach\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will like\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much about\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; person to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Manish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra\n&gt; naama\n&gt;&gt; &gt; stotra is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; person who\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; interested in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can\n&gt; do\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; needs to do.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for\n&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whole\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; year. It will transform his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; person to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he\n&gt; was\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a sishya\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samartha\n&gt; Ramadas\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (considered to be born with  Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to me\n&gt;&gt; &gt; later that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his guru had also advised him in the past to just stick to\n&gt; Hanuman\n&gt;&gt; &gt; chalisa!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Interestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, Manish tells me at other times that he knows nothing\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; says\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct\n&gt; guidance to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get\n&gt; correct\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guidance and he is just a nimitta.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; tune with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature will be able to give far better guidance in spiritual\n&gt; sadhana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; than\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology as we know it today.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -- \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 04, 2009 3:45 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dear narasimha ji and friends,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; namaste!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i understand that the syllables / metre of the mantra is very\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; important. that is why (probably) mantra was passed on from\n&gt; the guru\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody even said that in\n&gt; the end\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it is the metre only that remains in the mantra...and not\n&gt; even the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; words. something like the smile of the cheshire cat remaining\n&gt; even\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alice in the wonderland.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to my consciousness the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gayatri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have been\n&gt; relying on\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the internet. the first thing that kind of took my breath\n&gt; away was\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the layers and layers of meaning attached to each word of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are like\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and\n&gt; then\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; still another and another....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but more importantly (perhaps) is the different ways this\n&gt; mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gets recited. i tried to count the syllables to see whether\n&gt; they\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; added upto 24. they almost did, to my recknoning, but i\n&gt; wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whether om in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it\n&gt; probaly\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is, but i want to be sure.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the words\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which\n&gt; becomes\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two syllables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables instead of\n&gt; 2.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; rendition.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had posted his\n&gt; rendition\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not been able\n&gt; to find\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me about this.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i would also like to know the importance of the number of\n&gt; syllables\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for different persons\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are sometimes /\n&gt; always\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (?) reflected in the astrological chart. maybe a guru by just\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; looking at a person can know intuitively what is the &quot;right&quot;\n&gt; mantra\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for the person. maybe a good astrologer can also do the same.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and rahu in 8th house and\n&gt; retro\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. These\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; planets aspect all the other planets (jupiter, sun and\n&gt; mercury in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third house).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thankyou!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; love and best wishes,&#39;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vinita\n\n\n"}}
