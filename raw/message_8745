There is nothing hoc=\r\nus pocus about it. This is very\n&gt; real and happens to many excellent sadhak=\r\nas.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not that She does not love such a person. She loves even the =\r\nrapist,\n&gt; so why not that sadhaka? But She gives results *compatible* with =\r\none&#39;s\n&gt; actions and one&#39;s conditioning and of course opportunities to overc=\r\nome\n&gt; one&#39;s conditioning and engage in better actions. If one uses those\n&gt; =\r\nopportunities, Her Grace flows even more.\n&gt;\n&gt; What Sri Aurobindo said amoun=\r\nts to asking people to use those\n&gt; opporunities. This is not a matter of fe=\r\nar or pressure. This is a matter of\n&gt; being responsible for one&#39;s actions a=\r\nnd attitude and developing perfect\n&gt; surrender.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n It is easy to hide behind mis-conceived understanding of high concepts\n&gt; s=\r\nuch as &quot;divine Grace&quot; and &quot;divine Mother&#39;s Love&quot;. If misunderstood, it can\n=\r\n&gt; simply descend into being another flavor of pseudo-Vedanta and fatalism.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Yes, divine Mother loves all and Her grace flows towards all, but our\n&gt;=\r\n conditioning, attitude and actions do matter. She does not give one which\n=\r\n&gt; is not good for one (and for the world), based on one&#39;s current attitude.=\r\n\n&gt; She gives only when one is ready. Asking one to be better prepared for H=\r\ner\n&gt; grace does not tantamount to &quot;fear or pressure&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *       =\r\n *\n&gt;\n&gt; These notions are not easy to discuss in written words. Even if we a=\r\nre\n&gt; sitting in the same room and talking (i.e. tone and emotion are visibl=\r\ne!),\n&gt; it may be tough. In written words, so much more is lost.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, c=\r\nertain words, concepts and styles of expression trigger some\n&gt; baggage and =\r\nconditoning and may make one love or hate something.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have no solution=\r\n, except for asking people to be more cautious and\n&gt; patient in trying to u=\r\nnderstand what the other person is saying.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding your story of Auro=\r\nbindo saying that Krishna forgot, I am afraid\n&gt; you misunderstood him.

About 200 hundred years ago, a man made a theory of\n&gt; creatio=\r\nn in France. When Napolean asked where is God in it, the guy said,\n&gt; do not=\r\n talk about God. It makes things complicated.\n&gt; So is there a place for Div=\r\nine Mother and Her Love or Grace or Protection\n&gt; in your theory. Is this in=\r\ntermediate zone as you say is created by Her and\n&gt; part of Her creation or =\r\nby somebody else.  Does She needs some visa to go\n&gt; there if she is not the=\r\n Creater. As you say all higher deity are there but\n&gt; less in ability. Does=\r\n the deities have even less  ability on earth plane.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am sure this is =\r\nnot your theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo.\n&gt; Many times when c=\r\nertain person reach a stage in their spiritual path,\n&gt; others think whateve=\r\nr this guy is uttering is complete truth, when in fact\n&gt; it is far from tru=\r\nth. Once I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that\n&gt; Divine Lord who spok=\r\ne Gita completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I\n&gt; could not believe =\r\nwhat I was reading. Then my respect for this yogi went\n&gt; down the drain.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Protection and other Eternal Divin=\r\ne\n&gt; Beings are outside of our human perception. They only allow us to know\n=\r\n&gt; about Themselves what They wish to. For me there is a difference between =\r\na\n&gt; yogi and devotee.  A devotee rises due to Grace of Divine Mother or the=\r\nir\n&gt; Ishtdav. where as a yogi rises after a lot of huff and fuff, and they =\r\nget\n&gt; stuck everywhere. I am sure there are only devotee in this group. The=\r\ny may\n&gt; be doing haven or japa or other devotional work.\n&gt; So nobody should=\r\n feel any sort of fear or pressure even for one second\n&gt; because there is n=\r\no such hocus pocus zone to cross and there is Grace of\n&gt; Divine Mother on a=\r\nll Her children.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Disclaimer---- My thinki=\r\nng is very different due to Darshan and Grace of\n&gt; Divine Mother & Divine L=\r\nord.

And the only parameters of judgement is to\n&gt; object=\r\nively see what changes are happening in our surface, day-to-day\n&gt; conscious=\r\nness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, etc etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; The field of =\r\nexperiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is VAST. Some\n&gt; of it can b=\r\ne genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex study in\n&gt; itself. Most s=\r\npiritual people have never gone in depth trying to analyse\n&gt; and understand=\r\n these things properly, but some pattern is observable.  Not\n&gt; all experien=\r\nces are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost themselves\n&gt; in this jun=\r\ngle of experiences, not being able to adequately determine which\n&gt; is genui=\r\nne and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral  plane,\n&gt; driven b=\r\ny the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of\n&gt; manomayakosha o=\r\nf a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by\n&gt; the overlappi=\r\nng influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to\n&gt; anahata. E=\r\nverything  is possible here. Every higher deity has a\n&gt; corresponding lesse=\r\nr manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability.\n&gt; Similarly there ar=\r\ne endless beings of varies character and hue who can very\n&gt; easily create a=\r\nn expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path.\n&gt; They can even =\r\nfake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme\n&gt; cases, take hol=\r\nd of a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a\n&gt; whole wide w=\r\norld, the lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human\n&gt; being, a cemen=\r\nting of a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams,\n&gt; personal su=\r\nb-conscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing\n&gt; but lust s=\r\nuppressed) etc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if\n&gt; properly  =\r\nchannalized as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make\n&gt; one experi=\r\nence Divine Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing\n&gt; guide to=\r\n the path.\n&gt;\n&gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic =\r\nonly to the\n&gt; extent that it helps to modify and transform your waking surf=\r\nace\n&gt; personality. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of experi=\r\nences\n&gt; that come from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences =\r\nONLY\n&gt; from this realm, are just sound and fury without substance.\n&gt;\n&gt; In t=\r\nhe writings of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, which\n&gt; ha=\r\ns destroyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away by the light and\n&gt; so=\r\nund of this realm.

A life so tra=\r\nnsformed and so away from\n&gt; our average superficial existence, that it beco=\r\nmes a fulfillment on its\n&gt; own. God is not the finish line of a bicycle rac=\r\ne.

A li=\r\nfe so transformed and so away from our average superficial existence, that =\r\nit becomes a fulfillment on its own. God is not the finish line of a bicycl=\r\ne race.
