But, I have few thought I want to put in front of every one: \n\n1. When=\r\n we meet few people, some we like instantly and some we hate. Narasimha onc=\r\ne told me this could be due to karmic debts between people. I would like to=\r\n extend the same to places, form of God/Goddess, template.\n\nI was in Kolkot=\r\na for 5 years. I went to Dakshineswar several times but avoided visiting Ka=\r\nlighat even once. Why? I heard the Kalighat is a red light area and you can=\r\n meet broken with in template premises. Also, I heard, that the temple cont=\r\ninues to have jantu bali and that the temple floor has animal blood flowing=\r\n. These may be exaggerations, but, I had developed a prejudice against the =\r\nKalighat temple.\n\nNow a days, I repent my narrow mindedness.\n\nMy mental con=\r\ndition between 1992-97 did not allow me to even consider going to Kalighat.=\r\n My mental condition now will allow it.\n\nOur experiance may depend on our m=\r\nental condition.\n\n2. To perceive spiritual energy, we may have to have a ka=\r\nrmic relation with that energy. We may need to have matching wavelength to =\r\nrecieve the same.\n\nIf I sit in a place and here to the voices, I will under=\r\nstand messages in Telugu/Hindi/English. How ever, if there is beautiful mes=\r\nsage in Oriya or some other language, I may not perceive (I am not undermin=\r\ning Narasimha&#39;s ability to perceive energy).\n\nGod is omni present. His ener=\r\ngy is present any where and every where. How ever, we do not perceive it ti=\r\nll we are pure and our mental and spiritual conditioning allow it.\n\nIf in a=\r\n place, there is any energy matching our conditioning, we may experience.\n\n=\r\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. =\r\nRao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Before I answer your main qu=\r\nestion, I want to address the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, even that s=\r\npiritual person told him that there is probably\n&gt; &gt; no divine presence insi=\r\nde the idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now my question is, if the idol a=\r\nt the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine\n&gt; &gt; presence why did this pers=\r\non suddenly have such a nice meditation there?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Two points:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) =\r\nOne can have a nice meditation session anywhere. While different places and=\r\n times have some difference in the nature and degree of spiritual energy, o=\r\nne can experience anything anywhere anytime, if the internal factors are co=\r\nnducive.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my=\r\n observation. Please bear in mind that any observation is fallible! It is p=\r\nossible that Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Da=\r\nkshineshwar and I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceiv=\r\ne and observe is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karm=\r\nik debts. The Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But then, wha=\r\nt ever the idol may contain, postive/negative/creative/\n&gt; &gt; destruction, if=\r\n someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that it is\n&gt; &gt; reaching God, i=\r\ns it not enough?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The purpose of an idol is to evoke certain imagery o=\r\nr thought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or for=\r\nm of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form get=\r\ns &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on, his mind can be focused on t=\r\nhat specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol. Though w=\r\ne think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected feebly=\r\n and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people&#39;s stron=\r\ng thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a =\r\nrepository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a f=\r\norm of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another per=\r\nson too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, there is some translation involved when thoughts of=\r\n one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This trans=\r\nlation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at=\r\n the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose a fool=\r\nish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess wh=\r\no kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control and makes o=\r\nne successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to =\r\nthat kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you ove=\r\nrcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to hap=\r\npen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a repository of neg=\r\native thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, please note that=\r\n this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a partic=\r\nular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thou=\r\nghts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying =\r\nthere later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration=\r\n of thoughts may be a little higher when an idol serves as a repository as =\r\nopposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, please note that most peopl=\r\ne have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doin=\r\ng when they are praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negati=\r\nve and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts=\r\n. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes c=\r\nonsiderable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in ter=\r\nrible practices without understanding what they are doing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; is Idol =\r\nworship risky?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worsh=\r\nip.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God creates m=\r\nan?\n&gt;  \n&gt; God created man as his replica. But the replica got corrupted wit=\r\nh time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fill the mind with g=\r\nod, so that he can go back to the source and become free from this cycle. B=\r\nut, due to the corruptions/conditioning of the mind, he is not able to crea=\r\nte god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current corru=\r\npt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him an=\r\nd hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pure =\r\nand creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will match the god that c=\r\nreated man in the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free =\r\nfrom the cycle.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I saw people deviating and =\r\nspeaking disrespectfully about respected spiritual leaders of other religio=\r\nns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In general, please remember that saying negative things about peo=\r\nple that one may not have understood fully or correctly is unwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fr=\r\nom time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world to mainta=\r\nin the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in that part =\r\nof the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher bas=\r\ned on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow that person.=\r\n Worse things may have happened if god did not send that person! If some pe=\r\nople following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some level of realizati=\r\non, it means something. Let us not be harsh in judging people we have not m=\r\net physically or otherwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is unhappy because of misdeeds com=\r\nmitted by people claiming to a follow a yogi or spiritual teacher, that may=\r\n be justified. But, Nature will correct things and change the equilibrium f=\r\nrom time and time. Leave things to Nature and do your part by doing sadhana=\r\n. In fact, my firm belief is that we are on the cusp of a big change in the=\r\n equilibrium at many levels.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.hom=\r\ne.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Origi=\r\nnal Message ----- \n&gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, October 08, 2009 2:38 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;         To add to m=\r\ny query, a good number of religions explicitly prohibit idol worship. If th=\r\ne underlying truth is one, how can it be so contradictory? \n&gt; \n&gt;         I =\r\ncan understand that a Idol may contain a presence created by human imaginat=\r\nion which maynot have a divine link. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can=\r\n actually call Mahakali into an Idol.\n&gt; \n&gt;         But then, what ever the =\r\nidol may contain, postive/negative/creative/destruction, if someone prays t=\r\no it with devotion, assuming that it is reaching God, is it not enough? Aft=\r\ner all God is finally tax collecter of prayers. Does not all prayer finally=\r\n reach God, irrespective of whether a divine presence is there or not there=\r\n infront?\n&gt; \n&gt;         I would like to mention a small incident here about =\r\nsomeone I know well. There was a certain individual, who whenever he would =\r\ngo to Calcutta. he would take time out to go and meditate in the hall infor=\r\nnt of the idol at the Kaalighat temple. Once he reached the temple around 8=\r\n pm and sat there trying to mediate for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly be=\r\ncame very focused, he *thought* he saw some deep blue lights (probably just=\r\n his imagination) - but there was a distinct feeling of great joy in him. H=\r\nis mind become without thoughts as if there was no worry in the whole world=\r\n, everything was perfect.  Also a strong, sanguine feeling came into him th=\r\nat he needed to worship the Goddess. As he came out he found that his shoes=\r\n were missing, so he walked more than a kilometer distance bare feet though=\r\n an extremely dirty road but all he felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actual=\r\nly registering in his mind that night, except for an overwhelming joy, as h=\r\ne said later on. Bottomline: a nice spiritual experience.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Some=\r\n months later he ended up meeting a very spiritual person who instructed hi=\r\nm about worshipping the Goddess.  He strongly believes that night at the te=\r\nmple and his meeting with the person was related. Interestingly, even that =\r\nspiritual person told him that there is probably no divine presence inside =\r\nthe idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Now my question is, if the idol =\r\nat the Kaalighat temple did not have a divine presence why did this person =\r\nsuddenly have such a nice meditation there?  Does it mean that finally it i=\r\ns only the devotion of the devotee which counts for spiritual energy inside=\r\n a temple, irrespective of whether the idol has any energy at all?\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n     -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Thu, 8/10/09, rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@...&gt;\n&gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt;           =\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;           Date: Thursday, 8 October, 200=\r\n9, 8:24 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;            \n&gt;                 Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;                =\r\n In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worship risky?

However, eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disappe=\r\nar depends on how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n&gt; \n&gt;      =\r\n             Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, the air th=\r\nere will be filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint=\r\n leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger ther=\r\ne. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   In many fa=\r\nmous temples these days, priests have become commercial and do not have the=\r\n devotion needed. The rituals performed every few years to re-energize the =\r\nidols \n&gt; \n&gt;                   *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;                   It=\r\n is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much divine pres=\r\nence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same time, some =\r\nnot-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n                I was very impressed with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (IS=\r\nKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills i=\r\nn Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of=\r\n spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the idol=\r\n is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the s=\r\name impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;                   There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was tak=\r\nen to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu=\r\n before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of =\r\nthat temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form =\r\nof the divine Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not =\r\nunderstand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my e=\r\nyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzl=\r\ned by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Su=\r\nn. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not=\r\n remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without =\r\nroof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few time=\r\ns, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally dec=\r\nided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 mi=\r\nn and left in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Ta=\r\nmil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n        Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine =\r\npresence across India.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   Apart from the Kaali temple a=\r\nt Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Kris=\r\nhna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj =\r\nis still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 =\r\n  *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;                   Even the middle of a busy road=\r\n in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These western coun=\r\ntries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but =\r\nthere is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a=\r\n good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *som=\r\ne* temples. But some temples are really good.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   If one=\r\n has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, =\r\nI suggest the following:\n&gt; \n&gt;                   Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Pur=\r\ni and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=\r\n and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwarak=\r\na and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hr=\r\nishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central=\r\n India.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   There are many other good places, but the ab=\r\nove come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there =\r\nfor several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritu=\r\nal sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; \n&gt;              =\r\n     Best regards,\n&gt;                   Narasimha\n&gt;                   ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt;       =\r\n            Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ hom=\r\nam\n&gt;                   Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana\n&gt;                   Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;                   Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:=\r\n//vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;                   Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;                   Jyotish writi=\r\nngs: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt;                   S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;          =\r\n         ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ \n&gt; \n&gt;                     ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;           =\r\n          From: Astro Seeker \n&gt;                     To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com \n&gt;                     Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 A=\r\nM\n&gt;                     Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n                Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                           I =\r\nwould like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in toda=\r\ny&#39;s time.
