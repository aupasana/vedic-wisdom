Each one of them. =\r\nThere are in total 84 ghats, of which Dashashwamedha is the most famous and=\r\n most populated. Dont miss the arati of Ma Ganga every evening.\n=C2=A0\nI fe=\r\nlt Kasi to be a generally safe city if can ignore the pandas and random pur=\r\nohits. Just keep walking on the ghats, its a marvellous experience. Every g=\r\nhat is unique and exciting. You will find lots of foreigners too living in =\r\nKasi. One of the best ghats I found was the next to manikarnik ghat. I dont=\r\n recall the name right now, but if you walk from Dashashmedh towards Manika=\r\nrnik ghat, there is a ghat which is a little isolated. There are some struc=\r\ntes made of cement which jut out inside the the Ganges from the ghat. Durib=\r\nng evening, after 6. its generally less populated area. So you can actually=\r\n go and sit on the banks of this ghat and do your japa/meditation. Its wond=\r\nerful. No disturbance at all. I used to do that everday. \nThe name of the d=\r\nasashmedh ghat is so because Brahma himself had done ten ashwamedha yagjas =\r\non this ghat to invite Lord Shiva in Kasi. That is why the name is Das-ashw=\r\namedha which has become Dashasamedha.\n=C2=A0\nIn the kasikhanda, it is descr=\r\nibed that Lord Shiva took Ma Parvati along with him and showed to her what =\r\nis called teh Abhimuktashetra. In the Jaballa Upanished this Abhimuktashetr=\r\na (Kasi - the area between Varuna and Ganga) has been described as the area=\r\n between the two eyebrows of a man. Here Lord Shiva established himself as =\r\nAbhimukteshwara, that is Vishwanath, and recided in Kasi. Immediate hudreds=\r\n of Pashupata Siddhas came into the area in astral bodies and rejoiced in t=\r\nhe glody of Shiva as=C2=A0 the Supreme Lord of pure light.\n=C2=A0\nWhile bat=\r\nhing in the ghats, I would suggest be a little careful because some places =\r\nare very slippery. What you can do is take a boat to teh otehr bank and the=\r\nn take a dip in the water. The boatman can charge you anytring between Rs10=\r\n0 to Rs250 (depending on your bargaining skills).\n=C2=A0\nThen among the tem=\r\nples I would stronly suggest goign to Sankataji Temple. On fridays, the tem=\r\nple gets over crowded, there is a well in the temple called chandra kupa. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThen the famous Durga Kund temple. Inside the temple, apart from teh=\r\n main deity Ma Chandi, there are also three other deities on the sides of t=\r\nhe temple complex. Saraswati, Mahalakshmi and Ma Kali. This is one of the M=\r\nOST unique Ma Kali partimas I have ever seen. She stands in a defiant tone =\r\nwith her head pointed upwards and her tougue jutting out towards the sky. W=\r\nhen I looked at Her, the first thought that came to my mind was to ask for =\r\nforgiveness. All I could say was Ma kshama karo. Do sit infront of her and =\r\npray/meditate/do japa.\n=C2=A0\nThen you can hire a car and visit Vindhyachal=\r\n where there is a famous temple of Ma Vindabashini. This is one of the Shak=\r\nti Pithas. Its about a couple of hours journery from Kasi in the neighbouri=\r\nng district called Mirzapur.\n=C2=A0\nActually there is so much to write abou=\r\nt Kasi, I can go on and on. Just have an open mind from teh time you land i=\r\nn Kasi. Take every experience, good or bad as a gift from the Almighty/Isth=\r\na Devata and you will surely cherish every bit of your stay there.\n=C2=A0\n-=\r\nRegards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava =\r\n- Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Mon, 5/1/09, Amit Trivedi &lt;sonat64@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n\nFrom: Amit Trivedi &lt;sonat64@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] A trip =\r\nto Kasi\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Monday, 5 January, 2009, 9:2=\r\n5 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Rajarshi,\nI was planning to take my parents to Kashi ne=\r\nar Makarsankranti, i.e.,January 15.\nYour post has proven to be very helpful=\r\n to us.\nMay I request any extra bits of your impressions on the Ghats or ot=\r\nher Ashrams which a Devi upasaka( my father-74 Years) would not vibe well w=\r\nith !\n\nMay Bhagwan Vishwanatha bless us all !\n\nHumble regards,\n\nAmit\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n--- On Sat, 1/3/09, rajarshi14 &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom:=\r\n rajarshi14 &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] A trip to Kas=\r\ni\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Saturday, January 3, 2009, 8:09 =\r\nPM\n\nDear All\n\nFirst of all, wish every one of you a very very wonderful and=\r\n \nfullfilling year ahead.\n Last week I had been on a trip to Kasi.

The following are le=\r\nsser know but really powerful \nplaces of worship which I came across during=\r\n my trip last week:\n\n1) Chausat Yogini temple in the Chausat ghat. The temp=\r\nle has one \nidol for the 64 Yoginis and an idol of Ma Kali. \n\n2) Temple of =\r\nLord Shiva as Kedareshwar in Kedar Ghat.

There i=\r\ns a dhuni in the ashram which was \nlit by Kinnaram Baba himself from a fune=\r\nral pyre and has been\n \nburning continuously since then. The deity in Agni =\r\nRudra. Regularly \nwood from the mahasamshan is inserted in the dhuni. Ordin=\r\nary people \nare not allowed to give any ahutis in that fire but one can sit=\r\n \nclose to it and meditate.
