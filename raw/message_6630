You can find the nitya homam(aupasanam and other homams) in the n=\r\nitya karma puja paddhati or nityahnikam published by (among others) Gita Pr=\r\ness Gorakhpur, R S Vadiyar and Sons Palakkad there are also others, but not=\r\n all of them have this component. These books are extensive in terms of sta=\r\nting all karma to be done right from waking up and doing &#39;kara darsanam&#39;. I=\r\nncidentally, householders are also supposed to do daily  homa with havishya=\r\nnnam/grains(boiled) OR unhusked grain.  \n\nNormally, metal is valued in the =\r\norder of gold&gt;silver&gt;copper&gt;bronze&gt;Bell metal&gt;brass&gt;steel/iron. Panchaloha =\r\nand ashtadhatu are used for some specific purposes, not generally available=\r\n so I am not putting it here.\n\nS\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama=\r\n V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello - When I was contemplating of purcha=\r\nsing the copper homa kund, that was small and with no base stand, I asked a=\r\n priest standing next to me and he mentioned Iron one is normally used. Imm=\r\nediately a north indian who was buying other puja stuff too chimed in and s=\r\naid &quot;loha kaa havan kund hota hai&quot; ! \n&gt; So, I purchased Iron homa kund ! Ap=\r\nart from gunas, etc is there a reason why there is a difference of opinion =\r\non which metal kund has to be used ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Does the main homam mantras need=\r\n to be counted? I am doing it by keeping some time limit to it and not coun=\r\nting !\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, I did not find any homam manual that goes along with sa=\r\nndhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsana homam done with d=\r\naily sandhya vandanam of which 10% of mantras are offered to Agni. In fact,=\r\n he mentioned it is the duty of every householder. Would any one here have =\r\nsome article or manual for it ? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again for your time.\n&gt; \n&gt; rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; Prasad\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
