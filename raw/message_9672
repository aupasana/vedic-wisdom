Whether you do spiritual=\r\n sadhana or whether you read a book or whether you party at a disco, those =\r\nenergies do work on your mind. Whether you want to be chanting god&#39;s name o=\r\nr dancing with friends or watching TV at such times is your choice. To look=\r\n at it from a different angle, whether you want to be thinking of god durin=\r\ng a time when energies are conducive to it or during a time when energies a=\r\nre conducive to frivolous/shady activities, is your call.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; But=\r\n there is nothing fundamentally wrong in chanting god&#39;s name or doing spiri=\r\ntual sadhana during night.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My basic thumbrule for a lot of these=\r\n things is, by the way, that you should stay away from something if your mi=\r\nnd has a strong issue with it. Most spiritual practices are mind-games wher=\r\ne you are trying to trick yourself into a state of mind. If mind has a stro=\r\nng negative feeling about something (e.g. doing homam at night or chanting =\r\na mantra without clean clothes or chanting god&#39;s name mentally during certa=\r\nin unclean activities etc), there is no point in trying it. First work on c=\r\nonvincing your mind that it is ok and do it when you feel reasonably comfor=\r\ntable.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spi=\r\nrituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: ilya.suzdalnitski &lt;ilya=\r\n.suzdalnitski@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Friday, Au=\r\ngust 23, 2013 11:36 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Worshipping at night\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve heard from some source that if =\r\nyou do worship gods at nighttime (i.e. after sunset) negative energy (Raksh=\r\nasas) will be attracted to the chanting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is it so?
