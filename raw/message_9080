Shakti is the sum tot=\r\nal of all the beings with various agendas engaging in various karmas and ex=\r\nperiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphala that is commensurat=\r\ne with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another=\r\n being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumu=\r\nlative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rule=\r\ns that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for the=\r\nir delivery.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; At any time, some karmas from one=\r\n&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, som=\r\ne karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the =\r\nrest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way k=\r\narmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of =\r\nkarma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The assig=\r\nnment and ordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one enga=\r\nges in various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people =\r\nenter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and =\r\nsequencing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As one engage=\r\ns in remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may tra=\r\nnsform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynam=\r\nics with other beings (including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle a=\r\ngents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate through other people who act a=\r\ns physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a re=\r\nsult. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed d=\r\nown in order within the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgrade=\r\nd to a higher pool or pushed up in order within the same pool.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behi=\r\nnd it (this is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arra=\r\nnging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people =\r\naround one, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma abo=\r\nut to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karm=\r\naphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However,=\r\n remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that =\r\nit is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but=\r\n you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specifi=\r\nc result, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what ritual=\r\n one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their=\r\n optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their =\r\noptional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often =\r\nmake some difference.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This point is well illustrated=\r\n by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If one =\r\nthinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. =\r\nGod is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those who =\r\npraise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of=\r\n actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially an=\r\nd impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of act=\r\nions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil =\r\npersons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced deliver=\r\ny of fruits to actions using available agents.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The k=\r\narmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and will give th=\r\neir results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some effort=\r\n, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is to not a=\r\ndd more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish actions=\r\n and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and selfless =\r\nactions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are good karma=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pi=\r\npeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current =\r\naction, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastra=\r\ns, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One th=\r\ning is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commens=\r\nurate with the karma itself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; You need only small for=\r\nce to push a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephan=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; --------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;________________________________\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] few questions\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Dear=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a sp=\r\necial elephant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next kin=\r\ng.

Wh=\r\nose karma is this?=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha gives two answ=\r\ners: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citizens, an=\r\nd (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Ever=\r\nything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s =\r\nkarma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s kar=\r\nma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39;=\r\n karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oat=\r\nh. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are a=\r\nctually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amount=\r\n of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually ma=\r\nke an assumption. We assume that there is a person, and separate from the p=\r\nerson are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time =\r\nto time. We then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from =\r\nour karmic pipeline.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;perso=\r\nn&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing=\r\n but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasana=\r\nas are your karmas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, y=\r\nou have changed your karma.

I vaguely remember =\r\nVimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a=\r\n saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, =\r\nParad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; what do this it=\r\nems really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for pl=\r\nanets =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; do they bring forward good karmas or they create new=\r\n ones?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well k=\r\nnown in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;I=\r\nf we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that =\r\npoint Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, t=\r\nhat he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if =\r\nthis is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode fr=\r\nom old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to=\r\n a great extent or it is just our perception that changes?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Thanking =\r\nyou,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Digamber\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
