Th=\r\ne guru was very very\nadvanced, a legend in his own right. And he told the g=\r\nuru you know I\nwanna be on the same level you are and the guru said if you =\r\nwanna be on\nthe same level I&#39;m on, I&#39;ll met you tomorrow at the beach.\n\nSo =\r\nthe young man got there 4 A.M. he was  all ready to rock n&#39; roll.\nHe was dr=\r\nessed properly, but he should have worn shorts. The old man\ngrabs his hand =\r\nand said: How bad do you wanna be successful (basically\nachieve god, have s=\r\niddhi and the like, all references to success from\nhereon now mean uniting =\r\nwith god) ? He said: &quot;Real bad&quot;. He\nsaid: Walk on out in the water. So he w=\r\nalks out into the water. When he\nwalks out to the water he goes waist deep =\r\nand goes like this old man is\ncrazy.\n\nThe young man was thinking , &quot;Hey I w=\r\nanna meet god, achieve siddhi in my\nsadhana, get out of this birth death cy=\r\ncle etc. etc. and this foolish\nold man got me out here swimming. I didn&#39;t a=\r\nsk to be a lifeguard. I\nwanna meet god he got me in water =96 so the old ma=\r\nn said go on a\nlittle further =96 the young man walked out a little further=\r\n =96\nthen the young man was neck deep in water - the young man was thinking=\r\n \nthis old man is crazy =96 everybody calls him a paramhansa, a\nmahapurusha=\r\n, god incarnate but he is definitely crazy. So the old man\nagain said go on=\r\n out a little further =96 the young man went out a\nlittle further, the wate=\r\nr was now right at his mouth =96the young man\nwas now thinking of going bac=\r\nk, this old hack is out of his fucking\nmind. And then the old man said: &quot;I =\r\nthought you said you wanted to\nbe successful?&quot; He said: &quot;I do.&quot; He said: &quot;T=\r\nhen walk a\nlittle further.&quot; Then the old man followed this guy into the wat=\r\ner,\nhe grabbed the young man&#39;s head, and held him down underwater. The old\n=\r\nguy held the young man, till  the young man was about to pass out, the\nyoun=\r\ng guys arms were now splashing the water in desperation, then\nsuddenly the =\r\nguru raised him up. He said: &quot;I got a question for\nyou.&quot; He told the young =\r\nguy, he said: &quot;When you want to succeed\nas bad as you wanna breathe than yo=\r\nu will be successful.&quot;\n(Succeed =3D uniting with god, or seeing god, or ach=\r\nieving supernatural\npowers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjective, upto =\r\nyou.)\n\nI don&#39;t know how many of you all got asthma here in Vedic wisdom? If=\r\n\nyou ever had a asthma attack before, you are short of breath S.O.B,due\nto =\r\nshortness of breath, you start wheezing, &quot;hai, hai, hai&quot; like you\nhave run =\r\n10,000kms in one go, the only thing you are trying to do at\nthat moment dur=\r\ning the attack, is get some air. You don&#39;t care about\nno basketball game, y=\r\nou don&#39;t care about what&#39;s on T.V., you\ndon&#39;t care about nobody calling you=\r\n, you don&#39;t care about a\nparty. The only thing you care about when you tryi=\r\nng to breathe is to\nget some fresh air. That&#39;s it! And when you get to the =\r\npoint where\nall you wanna do is be is successful as bad as you wanna breath=\r\ne then\nyou will be successful. And I&#39;m here to tell you that number one,\nmo=\r\nst of you say you wanna be successful but you don&#39;t want it bad,\nyou just k=\r\nind of want it. You don&#39;t want it bad than you wanna\nparty. You don&#39;t want =\r\nit as much as you want to be cool. Most of you\ndon&#39;t want success as much a=\r\ns you want sleep. &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;\n(Again Success =3D uniting with god, or seeing god=\r\n, or achieving\nsupernatural powers, or siddhi, or whatever, thats subjectiv=\r\ne, upto\nyou.)\nEnd Quote\n\nIgnore the following video , focus on the audio in=\r\n it. with the above\nmodifications.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dnw41UQU=\r\n_J0A\n\nDo all of you remember that Visa call from your perspective\nembassies=\r\n????\nRemember those???\nThe interviews???\nEven if you had slept at 4 in the =\r\nmorning, the night before, you would\nstill wake up and be at the embassy of=\r\nfice at 7, or whenever your\nappointment was.\nHell even if you had high feve=\r\nr 102 or something, you would still reach.\nDo you remember that flight to t=\r\nhe states???\nOhhhh Ammmerrriiiiicaaaaaaa!!!!

But you seem to\nhave =\r\ntime for everything else in life.\n\n\nThen what was the use for all the discu=\r\nssions because once your computer\nis switched off, nothing changes in your =\r\nlife, your mind has made a\nfuddu out of you by foxing you into thinking, &quot;s=\r\nir I have done something\nabout my pitiable state.&quot;\n\nThen you read Mr Nandy&#39;=\r\ns post about the story of &quot;p&quot;, and say what an\neye opener, what excitement,=\r\n what a story!!!!!! But errrrrr=85=85=85=85\nwhat did you do post that???\n\nI=\r\n don&#39;t see people shortening their mall trips, their shopping sprees,\ntheir=\r\n time on the internet but when it comes to a homam, first question\nor thoug=\r\nht is &quot;oh my gawd, it will take that long, let me ask Mr Rao of\nmaking it s=\r\nhorter.&quot; And god is so magnanimous, he allows you to do so.\n\nHell you spend=\r\n more time on buying your kacche, panty, banyan and bras\nrather than on god=\r\n!!!!!! Wah, wah, surely god will be yours.\n\nThen you pick up books, all sor=\r\nt of books read all about other guys\nreaching god, start reading into their=\r\n experiences, start discussing\nabout their high spiritual states and everyt=\r\nhing, and get lost  in\narguing over those discussions. Then post apologies,=\r\n my goodness, the\nnoise. Waste of a human birth, if you were to see the lin=\r\ne waiting for a\nhuman womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; have to stand at the end o=\r\nf this line,\nyou would piss yourself. Some girl after seeing it did, and ha=\r\ns always\nbeen a little urgent with her sadhana ever since then.\n\nI see this=\r\n question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do you find a\nguru????&quot;\nAnd you kn=\r\now everyone, wants a high powered one, not any other will do.\nSee a high po=\r\nwered guru, also requires a good disciple.\nAre you good enough, honestly an=\r\nswer this??? Many will say no, many will\nsay good or not, its the guru&#39;s jo=\r\nb to deal with it etc etc, but are you\nwilling to work on yourself to spare=\r\n the guru some work???? Why would a\nhigh powered one come and teach you??? =\r\nonly after your penance is good\nenough na? otherwise, he/she will be busy i=\r\nn his/her union with god.\n\n\nNow how bad do you want god?\nHow bad do you wan=\r\nt a guru?\n  How bad do you want those spiritual states?\nHow bad do you want=\r\n the darsahn for your beloved?\n\nDon&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time is=\r\n running out, and very soon,\nanother rebirth, again the young age, again th=\r\ne teenage, again the\naffairs, again the hormone spikes, again the degrees, =\r\nagain the sucky\njobs, again confused with life, again the financial nightma=\r\nres, again\nthe heart attacks , again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!=\r\n!!\n\nI&#39;ll end this post with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the\n1940&#39;=\r\ns, had done a bit of penance and you know was highly interested in\ngod , sh=\r\nod and all this stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and\nmet a guy wh=\r\no was proclaimed in the village to be equivalent to lord\nvoldmeort or somet=\r\nhing but on the god side.\n\nSo the guy went to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t=\r\n be taken and asked him\n, i am looking for a guru, the old fella said , for=\r\n what exactly are you\nlooking for a guru??? The business man said, , you kn=\r\now to learn stuff.\nThe old fellow said what are you willing to do for your =\r\nguru??? The\nbusinessman said anything. The old fella said, okay take all yo=\r\nur\nclothes off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy took them off\nrel=\r\nuctantly. then the old fella, told him , wear a patta around your\nneck and =\r\nroam around the town naked. The businessman was aghast, but the\nold fella, =\r\ntold him &quot;anything right???&quot;, the businessman very BADLY\nwanted a guru, so =\r\nhe went and got shoes thrown at him, came back after\nhalf an hour to find t=\r\nhe old fella gone and his clothes gone too. He sat\nthere sobbing, and sobbi=\r\nng and cursing god, that i was the biggest fool\nto come here and trust this=\r\n man. But then as he haid read somewhere, why\nwaste time, he started medita=\r\nting and chanted. 3 hours went by no sign\nof the old man, 4 then 5 but by t=\r\nhe 6th, the old fella reappeared, and\nsaid &quot; here are your clothes, go back=\r\n to your town.&quot;\n\nThe businessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to =\r\nget up, but\ncouldn&#39;t move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that=\r\n finally\nhe has found someone worthy enough to teach.

But you seem to have time for everything else in =\r\nlife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then what was the use for all the discussions because once=\r\n your computer is switched off, nothing changes in your life, your mind has=\r\n made a fuddu out of you by foxing you into thinking, &quot;sir I have done some=\r\nthing about my pitiable state.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you read Mr Nandy&#39;s post about =\r\nthe story of &quot;p&quot;, and say what an eye opener, what excitement, what a story=\r\n!!!!!! But errrrrr=85=85=85=85 what did you do post that??? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t=\r\n see people shortening their mall trips, their shopping sprees, their time =\r\non the internet but when it comes to a homam, first question or thought is =\r\n&quot;oh my gawd, it will take that long, let me ask Mr Rao of making it shorter=\r\n.&quot; And god is so magnanimous, he allows you to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hell you spend=\r\n more time on buying your kacche, panty, banyan and bras rather than on god=\r\n!!!!!! Wah, wah, surely god will be yours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you pick up books, a=\r\nll sort of books read all about other guys reaching god, start reading into=\r\n their experiences, start discussing about their high spiritual states and =\r\neverything, and get lost&nbsp; in arguing over those discussions. Then post=\r\n apologies, my goodness, the noise. Waste of a human birth, if you were to =\r\nsee the line waiting for a human womb, and then realize &quot;I&quot; have to stand a=\r\nt the end of this line, you would piss yourself. Some girl after seeing it =\r\ndid, and has always been a little urgent with her sadhana ever since then.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;I see this question getting asked a lot, that &quot;how do you find a gur=\r\nu????&quot;&lt;br&gt;And you know everyone, wants a high powered one, not any other wi=\r\nll do.&lt;br&gt;See a high powered guru, also requires a good disciple.&lt;br&gt;Are yo=\r\nu good enough, honestly answer this??? Many will say no, many will say good=\r\n or not, its the guru&#39;s job to deal with it etc etc, but are you willing to=\r\n work on yourself to spare the guru some work???? Why would a high powered =\r\none come and teach you??? only after your penance is good enough na? otherw=\r\nise, he/she will be busy in his/her union with god.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now how bad =\r\ndo you want god?&lt;br&gt;How bad do you want a guru?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;How bad do you wan=\r\nt those spiritual states?&lt;br&gt;How bad do you want the darsahn for your belov=\r\ned?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t kind of want it, want it bad, time is running out, and ver=\r\ny soon, another rebirth, again the young age, again the teenage, again the =\r\naffairs, again the hormone spikes, again the degrees, again the sucky jobs,=\r\n again confused with life, again the financial nightmares, again the heart =\r\nattacks , again the death, and again, again. Hai ram!!!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll end th=\r\nis post with an example, a businessman in Delhi in the 1940&#39;s, had done a b=\r\nit of penance and you know was highly interested in god , shod and all this=\r\n stuff. So one day , he had gone to kerala, and met a guy who was proclaime=\r\nd in the village to be equivalent to lord voldmeort or something but on the=\r\n god side.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So the guy went to meet the guy whose name can&#39;t be taken=\r\n and asked him , i am looking for a guru, the old fella said , for what exa=\r\nctly are you looking for a guru??? The business man said, , you know to lea=\r\nrn stuff. The old fellow said what are you willing to do for your guru??? T=\r\nhe businessman said anything. The old fella said, okay take all your clothe=\r\ns off, the businessman was shocked. the suit guy took them off reluctantly.=\r\n then the old fella, told him , wear a patta around your neck and roam arou=\r\nnd the town naked. The businessman was aghast, but the old fella, told him =\r\n&quot;anything right???&quot;, the businessman very BADLY wanted a guru, so he went a=\r\nnd got shoes thrown at him, came back after half an hour to find the old fe=\r\nlla gone and his clothes gone too. He sat there sobbing, and sobbing and cu=\r\nrsing god, that i was the biggest fool to come here and trust this man. But=\r\n then as he haid read somewhere, why waste time, he started meditating and =\r\nchanted. 3 hours went by no sign of the old man, 4 then 5 but by the 6th, t=\r\nhe old fella reappeared, and said &quot; here are your clothes, go back to your =\r\ntown.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The businessman just didn&#39;t want to say anything tried to get=\r\n up, but couldn&#39;t move. The old fella was weeping with joy, stating that fi=\r\nnally he has found someone worthy enough to teach. Somebody who actually wa=\r\nnts it &quot;&lt;b&gt;bad&lt;/b&gt;&quot;.Old fella took the hotshot as his disciple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Punj=\r\nabi fans -----&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Makkah gayan=E2=80=A8&lt;br&gt;Gal mukdi nahin&lt;br&gt;=\r\n=E2=80=A8Paven sau sau jummen padhaiye&lt;br&gt;Ganga gayan&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=A8Gal mukdi=\r\n nahin=E2=80=A8&lt;br&gt;Paven sau sau gothey khaiye&lt;br&gt;Gaya gayan&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=A8Ga=\r\nl mukdi nahin=E2=80=A8&lt;br&gt;Paven sau sau panD padhaiye&lt;br&gt;Bulleh Shah!=E2=80=\r\n=A8&lt;br&gt;Gal taiyon mukdi=E2=80=A8&lt;br&gt;Jadon menu dilon gavaiye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parh p=\r\narh ilm hazaar kitaabaN&lt;br&gt;kadi apne aap nu parhya nahin&lt;br&gt;Jaa jaa wardey =\r\nmandar maseetan&lt;br&gt;kadi mann apne wich wareya nahin&lt;br&gt;Anven larda shaitaan=\r\n de naal bandeya&lt;br&gt;kadi nafs apne naal larya nahin&lt;br&gt;Aakhe peer Bulleh Sh=\r\nah aasmani pharna aeN&lt;br&gt;jehra man wich wasda unhoN pharya nahin&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(ji=\r\nsko samajh mien aye who baakiyon ke liye transalte kare )&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satya Shri=\r\n Akaal&lt;br&gt;Jai mere kaal&lt;br&gt;Nobody&lt;br&gt;P.S.
