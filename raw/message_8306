Five minutes were spent doing th=\r\ne worship of Ganesh, Agni, Divine Mother and Guru. Ten minutes were spent s=\r\naying the mantras of Lakshmi and Narayana while offering ghee. As the fire =\r\nlasted about 25 minutes after I finished making ghee offerings, I just watc=\r\nhed the fire and did japa of Om Namo Narayanaya for this period. I guess I =\r\nwill insert the havan at the start of my japa practice instead of at the en=\r\nd (as previously planned), as it takes a while for the fire to burn itself =\r\nout and I could just say the mantra while this is happening. I enjoyed the =\r\nexperience overall, looking forward to doing more homams. \n\nAparna\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI would like to perform a simple homam at home. I do not have the time to d=\r\no any kind of elaborate homam at home due to work commitments, and because =\r\nI already spend a total 1 hour a day on japa (I do not want to reduce the j=\r\napa). I would like to do a really simple homam procedure that takes no more=\r\n than 10-15 minutes- I would do this after half an hour of my japa practice=\r\n.  \n&gt; \n&gt; In the Vedic wisdom article online, Narasimhaji says that even lig=\r\nhting a clay pot with some sticks and uttering mantras for a few minutes wi=\r\nth genuine devotion will produce results. \n&gt; With this in mind, I have adap=\r\nted Narasimhaji&#39;s homam article to create a 10 minute Lakshmi Narayana homa=\r\nm procedure for myself and wanted to check if this is okay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Light hava=\r\nn fire and then,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Worship Ganesha and pray for removal of any obstac=\r\nles and forgiveness for any mistakes committed during this homam\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Wo=\r\nrship Agni, and request him to taking my offerings to Lakshmi and Narayana =\r\nin a pure form \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Worship the Divine Mother in the form of Durga, Lak=\r\nshmi and Saraswati and ask for guidance in performing this homam, and for f=\r\norgiveness for any mistakes. \n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Worship my Guru Swami Sivananda Saras=\r\nwati of Rishikesh and ask for guidance in performing this homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Re=\r\npeat mantras Om Shri MahaLakshmyai Namaha. Svaha. and Om Namo Narayanaya. S=\r\nwaha. as many times as I can in the ten minutes with devotion, and offering=\r\n ghee while saying Swaha. Greater proportion of homam time is spent on this=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. Thank Ganesh and Agni. Thank Lakshmi and Narayana. Offer prayer t=\r\nhat this homam may be for the welfare of all beings. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know this is a=\r\n much abbrieviated homam version but it would be the best I can do at prese=\r\nnt. \n&gt; \n&gt; Does this sound alright? Please could Narasimhaji comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhanks. \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
