At the end of the pooja, I ask \nall people to meditate with the 12-lettered mantra of Satya Narayana 108 \ntimes. We all chant together in one voice 54 times and then we all chant \nmentally with closed eyes 54 times. Usually, the second half when it is \nmentally chanted is a little more peaceful and blissful.\n\nMental meditation without sound is better. Simultaneous mental meditation by \nseveral sincere people who have their mind focused on god is very good and \nhas a charm of its own.\n\nWhen pooja is done sincerely, it also creates some energy in the place. It \nis a good idea to close eyes, keep the back and neck erect and meditate \nmentally for a few minutes, at the end of pooja. I suggest a small \nmeditation session at the end of rituals such as pooja or homam. When you \nspend some time creating some energy, it is a good idea to let it work on \nyou and clean you up a little bit.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sanjeev_its1989&quot; &lt;sanjeev_its1989@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, February 22, 2009 3:24 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mass Satya Narayana Vratam in Greater Boston and \nNorth Carolina\n\n\n&gt; Dear PVR,\n&gt; It is great to hear that u are doing this great activity. I am in\n&gt; India so i can not attend and enjoy ensuing bliss of the same.\n&gt; It is stated by masters that mass puja provides joy to all.\n&gt; Meditation too can be done together. Solitary Meditation is\n&gt; considered best. My personal experience is also same. One definitely\n&gt; enjoys both, but i feel solitary meditation is better.\n&gt;\n&gt; What is your opinion on above? I think one suits to some and other\n&gt; suits to some other people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; sanjeev\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
