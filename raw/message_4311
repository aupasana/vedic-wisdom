(62)\n=\r\n\nOnly those who are dead to desires for (the pleasures of) the vast delusiv=\r\ne\npanorama of the world will have their life transformed into Siva. There w=\r\nill\nbe no bliss by any means other than the dawn of the pure and fresh\nexpe=\r\nrience of Self. (859)\n\nThe tranquil clarity devoid of mental turmoil is the=\r\n samadhi which is\nessential for Liberation. (Therefore) try earnestly to ex=\r\nperience the\npeaceful consciousness, the clarity of heart, by destroying th=\r\ne deceptive\nturmoil (of mind). (919)\n\nSankalpa (thought) creates the world.=\r\n The peace attained on the destruction\nof sankalpas is the (permanent) dest=\r\nruction of the world. (29)\n\nIf you ask, =E2=80=9CWhat is the benefit of sac=\r\nrificing the innumerable sensual\npleasures and retaining mere Consciousness=\r\n?=E2=80=9D. (we reply that) the fruit of\nJnana is the eternal and unbroken =\r\nexperience of the Bliss of Self. (77)\n\nIf the jiva, who is ever deluded and=\r\n is always suffering from a feeling of\ndeficiency, wants to get rid of all =\r\nhis miseries and to be happy, he need\nonly know the Supreme One, his Lord, =\r\nto be his own Self. (367)\n\nAs consciousness is the real nature of Siva, onl=\r\ny enquiry into consciousness\nis the true worship of Siva. (204)\n\nWhy do you=\r\n still retain the attachment to the mental concepts of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =\r\nand\n=E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 when, you have already offered up all those thin=\r\ngs to your Guru?\n(317)\n\nThe many different religious are appropriate to the=\r\n maturity of each\nindividual, and all of them are acceptable to reality. (3=\r\n42)\n\nTo whatever extent this world is real to that same extent are other wo=\r\nrlds\nreal. Only this much can be said about heaven and hell without giving =\r\nrise\nto arguments. (178)\n\nThose whose egos have died have reached the state=\r\n of immortality. Those\nignorant ones with inflated egos are truly dead. (22=\r\n7)\n\nYou have to accept your own existence even in the state of unconscious =\r\nsleep\nwhere the appearances involving the triputis cease to exist. If you d=\r\no not\naccept the fact of your existence (in sleep), how did that knowledge =\r\ncome to\nyou? (356)\n\nOther than consciousness, the pure clarity in which exc=\r\nellence flourishes,\nthere is no God who is worthy of being worshipped. (417=\r\n)\n\nThe true meaning of namaskaram (obeisance) is the ego bowing its head an=\r\nd\ngetting destroyed at the feet of Guru. (207)\n\nBanish even the thought =E2=\r\n=80=98I am a fir instrument for God=E2=80=99 and remain still\n(summa iru). =\r\n(471)\n\nMere book knowledge about self-enquiry, even though learnt from clea=\r\nr\nscriptures, will be a picture-gourd drawn on a sheet of paper, which cann=\r\not\nbe used for cooking. The superme jnana will arise only out of true enqui=\r\nry\nin the form of attention towards the reality that exists in the heart. (=\r\n531)\n\nSo long as you have not renounced the notion =E2=80=98I am the doer=\r\n=E2=80=99 keep in your\nmind the correct perspective that your responsibilit=\r\nies are yours alone and\nnot that of God. (570)\n\nWhen compared to the Self, =\r\nwhich shines as both the dwelling place and the\ndweller within it, the spac=\r\ne of the physical universe is poor indeed. (426)\n\nFor performing the suprem=\r\ne act of Self-enquiry there is no other auspicious\nday than today. (518)\n\nH=\r\nowever good an action may be, it performing it spoils and destroys your\nequ=\r\nanimity of mind, what is the benefit of it? (574)\n\nWithout the shining ligh=\r\nt of grace, what can the insignificant jives do to\nescape from then net of =\r\ndelusion and gain clarity? (634)\n\nAbidance in Swarupa (one=E2=80=99s own na=\r\nture) means ceasing to exist as a slave to\nGod; it is remaining without eve=\r\nn the thought =E2=80=98I am a slave=E2=80=99 rising; it is\negoless silence,=\r\n utterly still, having no mental movements. The unlimited\nconsciousness tha=\r\nt shines in the state is the (true) consciousness (472)\n\nThe seer and the o=\r\nbject seen are like the rope and the snake.Just as the\nknowledge of the rop=\r\ne which is the substratum will not arise unless the\nfalse acknowledge of th=\r\ne illusory serpent foes, so that realization of the\nself, which is the subs=\r\ntratum will not be gained unless the belief that the\nworld is real is remov=\r\ned.\n\nA humble attitude of mind will give you redemption, transporting you t=\r\no the\nworld of the immortals. Without humility you will drown in the pitch =\r\nof\nhell. (494)\n\nProtect yourself from the mental agitation that stems from =\r\nbeing caught up\nin the net of praise and frame, which only betrays you. (62=\r\n4)\n\nThe power of maya (that which doesn=E2=80=99t exist) is a false, shadow=\r\n-like power,\nwhich is not inherent in the nature of the Self. (597)\n\nSelf-r=\r\nealisation which appears very difficult will be attained very easily\nthroug=\r\nh the power of grace. (512)\n\nTo whatever extent (that) mind-consciousness d=\r\nives within, to that same\nextent will the bliss of the self spring forth an=\r\nd reveal itself. (451)\n\nBecause it appears and disappears just as dreams do=\r\n, the waking state that\nappears to be solid and full of differences is also=\r\n imaginary. (555)\n\nIgnorance is an erroneous superimposition. The infinite,=\r\n blissful\nconsciousness alone is the one existing reality. (547)\n\nIn the gl=\r\norious state wherein the mind has died, even deep sleep will become\nGod-con=\r\nsciousness. (457)\n\nThose who rejoice, having established in Sivam, will not=\r\n pay even the\nslightest attention to these (siddhis) that only cause sorrow=\r\n. (221)\n\nIn the straight path of Swarupa Vichara (enquiry into one=E2=80=99=\r\ns own nature) no\nfear or confusion arises because of the non-dual nature of=\r\n then Self. (393)\n\nEvil desire, a pit that can never be filled, is what plu=\r\nnges you life into\npoverty that cannot be overcome. (371)\n\nDirecting the mi=\r\nnd towards siddhis (supernatural powers) is a stumbling\nblock that inhibits=\r\n progress towards the supreme state of liberation. (222)\n\nO Mind, it is not=\r\n wise on your part to come out. It is best to go within.\nHide yourself deep=\r\n within the heart and escape from the tricks of maya,\nwhich tries to ruin y=\r\nou by drawing you outwards. (187)\n\nHumility and self-restraint are the mark=\r\ns of those transformed and radiant\nbeings who embody the quality of virtue.=\r\n Blemishless Jnanis alone are truly\nvirtuous; others are base-natured. Ther=\r\nefore, to be saved, we should\napproach only those virtuous ones who ever ab=\r\nide in Truth. (332)\n\nThough one has shaken off all vices, renounced all rel=\r\natives, and observed\nall the austerities prescribed by the scriptures, can =\r\none reach eternal\nbliss unless one meets the jnana Guru? (321)\n\n(O Mind), d=\r\no not waste your life in roaming outside, pursuing wonders and\nwallowing in=\r\n enjoyments. To know the self through grace and to abide in this\nway firmly=\r\n in the Heart is alone worthwhile. (188)\n\nHe whose mind has been destroyed,=\r\n having drowned in the non-dual whole\n(advaita-purna), will never be pertur=\r\nbed in this unreal life of duality,\n(because) in that supreme state of Grac=\r\ne, (the state of) Self, which is pure\nconsciousness (unmixed with any adjun=\r\ncts such as =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99), nothing such as\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (t=\r\nhe ego or subject) and =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 (the world or object) exists =\r\nexcept that\n(Self, the pure consciousness =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99). (1117)\n\n=\r\nIt is only due to the delusion which is caused by not learning the Truth of=\r\n\nSelf that jives are suffering. Therefore, always take to the practice of\nJ=\r\nnana =E2=80=93 the inward enquiry =E2=80=9CWho am I that is suffering?=E2=\r\n=80=9D (405)\n\nWhen the delusion which has veiled Self, the Light of Consico=\r\nusness of\nunlimited Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda), is destroyed by the clear enqu=\r\niry =E2=80=9CWho am\nI?=E2=80=9D, one=E2=80=99s own nature will shine forth =\r\ngloriously as the Atmakasha (i.e.\nSpace of self). (402)\n\nThe eternal, unbro=\r\nken, natural state of abiding in the Self is jnana. To\nabide in the Self yo=\r\nu must love the Self. Since God is verity the Self, love\nof the Self is lov=\r\ne of God and that is bhakti. Jnana and Bhakti are thus one\nand the same. (M=\r\naharshi=E2=80=99s Gospel)\n\nMan, the deluded ego-mind, cannot be freed from =\r\nconfusion and fear (of birth\nand death), unless he subdues himself by takin=\r\ng refuge under the protection\nof Grace; for (by any other means), the force=\r\n of past karmas (i.e., vasanas)\nis unconquerable. (300)\n\nThe complete givin=\r\ng up of all (the other three purusharthas) beginning with\ndharma, is the gl=\r\norious state of peace, which is the nature of liberation\n(the fourth purush=\r\nartha, the only true purushartha). (Therefore) completely\ngiving up (all) t=\r\nhought of the others (the three false purusharthas), cling\nonly to Silence,=\r\n the knowledge of the Supreme Self, which is Siva. (Guru\nVachaka Kovai 1204=\r\n)\n\nKnow that the path of jnana and the path of bhakti are inter-related. Fo=\r\nllow\nthese inseparable two paths without differentiating one from the other=\r\n.\n(731)\n\nSever the delusive and sorrow-laden ego by the keen knowledge gain=\r\ned through\nenquiry, (because) the true happiness of peace (santi) cannot pr=\r\nevail except\nin a heart where this knot (granthi) has been uprooted. (844)\n=\r\n\nThat form of the Liberated One =E2=80=93 who is (in truth) intangible like=\r\n the sky =E2=80=93\nwhich appears to men, is really nothing but the reflecti=\r\non of the form of\nhim that sees (that form); it is not real. (130)\n\nThe lea=\r\nvings of the Guru (ucchistam) are just the words uttered by Him, on\nthe str=\r\nength of His own Experience. The eating of the leavings is just\nremaining f=\r\nixed in Unity with Him, in silence. (136)\n\nThe thought =E2=80=98I am this b=\r\nody of flesh and blood=E2=80=99 is the one thread on which\nare strung the v=\r\narious other thoughts. Therefore, if we turn inwards\nenquiring =E2=80=98Whe=\r\nre is this I?=E2=80=99 all thoughts will come to and end and\nSelf-Knowledge=\r\n will then spontaneously shine forth.\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636c5bf5149cd070485e7f610\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In the state where the ego, the=\r\n I-am-the body delusion, has ceased both yoga and bhoga (enjoyment), withou=\r\nt becoming two merge together as one.

(371)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Directi=\r\nng the mind towards siddhis (supernatural powers) is a stumbling block that=\r\n inhibits progress towards the supreme state of liberation. (222)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;O Mind, it is not wise on your part=\r\n to come out. It is best to go within. Hide yourself deep within the heart =\r\nand escape from the tricks of maya, which tries to ruin you by drawing you =\r\noutwards. (187)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Humility and self-restraint are the marks o=\r\nf those transformed and radiant beings who embody the quality of virtue. Bl=\r\nemishless Jnanis alone are truly virtuous; others are base-natured. Therefo=\r\nre, to be saved, we should approach only those virtuous ones who ever abide=\r\n in Truth. (332)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Though one has shaken off all vices, renounced al=\r\nl relatives, and observed all the austerities prescribed by the scriptures,=\r\n can one reach eternal bliss unless one meets the jnana Guru? (321)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;(O Mind), do not waste your life in roamin=\r\ng outside, pursuing wonders and wallowing in enjoyments. To know the self t=\r\nhrough grace and to abide in this way firmly in the Heart is alone worthwhi=\r\nle. (188)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He whose mind has been destroyed, having drowned =\r\nin the non-dual whole (advaita-purna), will never be perturbed in this unre=\r\nal life of duality, (because) in that supreme state of Grace, (the state of=\r\n) Self, which is pure consciousness (unmixed with any adjuncts such as =E2=\r\n=80=98this=E2=80=99), nothing such as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (the ego or subje=\r\nct) and =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 (the world or object) exists except that (Se=\r\nlf, the pure consciousness =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99). (1117)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is o=\r\nnly due to the delusion which is caused by not learning the Truth of Self t=\r\nhat jives are suffering. Therefore, always take to the practice of Jnana =\r\n=E2=80=93 the inward enquiry =E2=80=9CWho am I that is suffering?=E2=80=9D =\r\n(405)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\nWhen the delusion which has veiled Self, the Light of Consic=\r\nousness of unlimited Bliss (Sat-Chit-Ananda), is destroyed by the clear enq=\r\nuiry =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D, one=E2=80=99s own nature will shine forth=\r\n gloriously as the Atmakasha (i.e. Space of self). (402)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The etern=\r\nal, unbroken, natural state of abiding in the Self is jnana. To abide in th=\r\ne Self you must love the Self. Since God is verity the Self, love of the Se=\r\nlf is love of God and that is bhakti. Jnana and Bhakti are thus one and the=\r\n same. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospel)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Man, the deluded ego-mind, cann=\r\not be freed from confusion and fear (of birth and death), unless he subdues=\r\n himself by taking refuge under the protection of Grace; for (by any other =\r\nmeans), the force of past karmas (i.e., vasanas) is unconquerable. (300)&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The complete giving up of all (the =\r\nother three purusharthas) beginning with dharma, is the glorious state of p=\r\neace, which is the nature of liberation (the fourth purushartha, the only t=\r\nrue purushartha). (Therefore) completely giving up (all) thought of the oth=\r\ners (the three false purusharthas), cling only to Silence, the knowledge of=\r\n the Supreme Self, which is Siva. (Guru Vachaka Kovai 1204)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Know that the path of jnana and the path of bhakti are inter-related. Foll=\r\now these inseparable two paths without differentiating one from the other. =\r\n(731)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sever the delusive and sorrow-laden ego by the keen knowledge =\r\ngained through enquiry, (because) the true happiness of peace (santi) canno=\r\nt prevail except in a heart where this knot (granthi) has been uprooted. (8=\r\n44)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That form of the Liberated One =E2=80=93 who is (in truth) int=\r\nangible like the sky =E2=80=93 which appears to men, is really nothing but =\r\nthe reflection of the form of him that sees (that form); it is not real. (1=\r\n30)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The leavings of the Guru (ucchistam) are just the words uttered =\r\nby Him, on the strength of His own Experience. The eating of the leavings i=\r\ns just remaining fixed in Unity with Him, in silence. (136)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The thought =E2=80=98I am this body of flesh and=\r\n blood=E2=80=99 is the one thread on which are strung the various other tho=\r\nughts. Therefore, if we turn inwards enquiring =E2=80=98Where is this I?=E2=\r\n=80=99 all thoughts will come to and end and Self-Knowledge will then spont=\r\naneously shine forth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-=\r\nright:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margi=\r\nn-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=\r\n=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=\r\n=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636c5bf5149cd070485e7f610--\r\n\n"}}
