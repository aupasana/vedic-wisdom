The Kali mantra is very pu=\r\nnishing in a mental tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal with men=\r\ntal hardship without completely giving up/getting angry/stressed.&quot;\n\nMaa Kal=\r\ni is not punishing in any way, it is only our perpetual clinging attachment=\r\n that causes us to wince when we approach her. Think of the skirt of severe=\r\nd arms with the hands still attached which she sports.  Its high fashion in=\r\n the Real World where our relative existence as jivas must meet the Ultimat=\r\ne Existence and fully reckon with the ignorance that we have mistaken for k=\r\nnowledge.\n\nPlease forgive me...i am still a saMsAri caught like a wild anim=\r\nal in the trap of dualistic concepts. &quot; This is good, this is better....&quot;.\n=\r\n\nWarm Regards\n\nAjaya\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostud=\r\nent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n used to meditatively listen to/chant the Savitur Gayatri every morning, an=\r\nd on the weekends, I did a homam also (doing the Savitur Gayatri). Gayatri,=\r\n especially in Homan seems to make things awaken in me, even with a tinge o=\r\nf sexual desire, yet still making me more spiritual. Separately, for the pa=\r\nst few months, I have been having this heavy weight of a depressive feeling=\r\n (due to several events/situations in my life) which just hasnt left me, an=\r\nd even the Gayatri/Homam doesnt relieve except immediately after a Homam fo=\r\nr less than a day. After some reading around and doing some astrology, I fi=\r\nnally arrived at a Kali mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye namah, and I have starte=\r\nd meditating on that every morning, but I still do weekend homams with Savi=\r\ntur Gayatri. But things have changed now. The Kali mantra is very punishing=\r\n in a mental tightness kind of way, yet still helps me deal with mental har=\r\ndship without completely giving up/getting angry/stressed. So I have contin=\r\nued it. Yet the day I do Savitur Gayatri homam, the Gayatri results seems a=\r\n bit weaker - I have no idea why. Also, if I dont meditate on the Kali mant=\r\nra later on in the same day (i.e. if I try to drop a day of doing Kali mant=\r\nra), I get into conflicts much more easily. Is there some kind of conflict =\r\nbetween the two? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
