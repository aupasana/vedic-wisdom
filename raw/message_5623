The impression\nis received only after noting the thing in its=\r\n non-extensive nature, and\nbecomes deeper\non musing over the first impressi=\r\non.]\n\nThere is no distinction noted in the preliminary stage of simple\nillu=\r\nmination. The thing itself is not yet defined, so illumination is said\nto b=\r\ne unqualified.\n\nThe thing becomes defined later on and is said to be such a=\r\nnd such, and so\nand so. That is the perception of the thing after deliberat=\r\nion.\n\nDeliberation is again of two kinds: the one is the actual experience =\r\nand is\nsaid to be fresh, whereas the other is cogitation over the former an=\r\nd is\ncalled memory.The mind always functions in these two ways.\n\nDreamless =\r\nslumber is characterised by the illumination of sleep alone, and\nthe experi=\r\nence continues unbroken for a time, whereas the wakeful state is\ncharacteri=\r\nsed by deliberation repeatedly broken up by thoughts and therefore\nit is sa=\r\nid not to be ignorance.\n\nSleep is a state of nescience, though it consists =\r\nof illumination alone, yet\nit is said to be ignorance for the same reason a=\r\ns a light though luminous is\nsaid to be\ninsentient.\n\n[Note: Pure intelligen=\r\nce is made up of luminosity,but is not insentient like\na flame. It is gleam=\r\ning with consciousness, thus differing from the flame.\nFor intellect\nis evi=\r\ndence as thinking principle. Therefore it is called Absolute\nConsciousness,=\r\n active principle, vibratory movement, all-embracing Self, or\nGod. Because =\r\nof these\npotentialities it creates the universe.\n\nSri Sankara has said in S=\r\noundarya Lahari: Siva owes his prowess to Sakti; He\ncannot even stir in Her=\r\n absence.Siva should not therefore be considered to\nbe a mere inexpressible=\r\n entity depending for His movements upon Maya (like a\nman on his car).\n\nSri=\r\n Sankara continues: Siva is yoked by Thee, Oh Sakti, to His true being.\nThe=\r\nrefore\na blessed few worship Thee as the endless series of waves of bliss, =\r\nas the\nunderlying basis of all that is, as the Supreme Force, maintaining t=\r\nhe\nuniverse, and as the Consort of Transcendence.Thus the identity of Siva =\r\nand\nSakti with each other or with Transcendence is evident.\n\nTheir true sig=\r\nnificance lies in the fact that the universe exists, but not\nseparately fro=\r\nm the primal Reality =E2=80=94 God.Wisdom lies in realising everything\nas S=\r\niva and not in treating it as void.\n\nThe truth is that there is one Reality=\r\n which is consciousness in the\nabstract and also transcendental, irradiatin=\r\ng the whole universe in all its\ndiversity from its own being, by virtue of =\r\nits self-sufficiency, which we\ncall Maya or Sakti or Energy. Ignorance lies=\r\n in the feeling of\ndifferentiation of the creatures from the Creator. The i=\r\nndividuals are only\ndetails in the same Reality.\n\nIn sleep, the insentient =\r\nphase of stupor overpowers the sentient phase of\ndeliberation. But the fact=\r\nor of illumination is ever present and that alone\ncannot become apparent to=\r\n men, in the absence of deliberation.\nTherefore,sleep is said to be the sta=\r\nte of ignorance, as distinguished from\nwakefulness which is conceded to be =\r\nknowledge.]\n\nThis conclusion is admitted by the wise also. Sleep is the fir=\r\nst born from\nTranscendence (vide Ch. XIV, sloka 59),and also called the unm=\r\nanifest, the\nexterior, or the great void.\n\nThe state prevailing in sleep is=\r\n the feeling =E2=80=98There is naught=E2=80=99. This also\nprevails in wakef=\r\nulness,although things are visible. But this ignorance is\nshattered by the =\r\nrepeated upspringing of thoughts. The wise say that the\nmind is submerged i=\r\nn sleep because it is illumining the unmanifest\ncondition. The submersion o=\r\nf mind is not, however, peculiar to sleep for it\nhappens also at the instan=\r\nt of cognition of things.\n\nAll these three states, namely, samadhi, sleep a=\r\nnd the instant of cognition\nof objects, are characterised by absence of per=\r\nturbation.\n\nTheir difference lies in the later recapitulation of the respec=\r\ntive states\nwhich illumine different perceptions.\n\nAbsolute Reality is mani=\r\nfest in samadhi; a void or unmanifest condition\ndistinguishes sleep and div=\r\nersity is the characteristic of cognition in\nwakefulness.\n\nThe illuminant i=\r\ns however the same all through and is always unblemished.\nTherefore it is s=\r\naid to be Abstract Intelligence.\n\nSamadhi and sleep are obvious because the=\r\nir experience remains unbroken for\nsome appreciable period and can be recap=\r\nitulated after waking up.\n\nThat of cognition remains unrecognised because o=\r\nf its fleeting nature. But\nsamadhi and sleep cannot be recognised when they=\r\n are only fleeting.\n\nThe wakeful state is iridescent with fleeting samadhi =\r\nand sleep. Men when\nthey are awake can detect fleeting sleep because they a=\r\nre already conversant\nwith its nature.\n\nBut fleeting samadhi goes undetecte=\r\nd because people are not so conversant\nwith it. O Brahmin! Fleeting samadhi=\r\n is indeed being experienced by all,\neven in their busy moments; but it pas=\r\nses unnoticed by them, for want of\nacquaintance with it.Every instant free =\r\nfrom thoughts and musings in the\nwakeful state is the condition of samadhi.=\r\n\n\nSamadhi is simply absence of thoughts. Such a state prevails in sleep and=\r\n at\nodd moments of wakefulness.\n\nYet, it is not called samadhi proper, beca=\r\nuse all the proclivities of the\nmind are still there latent, ready to manif=\r\nest the next instant.\n\nThe infinitesimal moment of seeing an object is not =\r\ntainted by deliberation\non its qualities and is exactly like samadhi.\n\nThe =\r\nunmanifest state, the first-born of abstract Intelligence revealing\n=E2=80=\r\n=98There is not anything=E2=80=99, is the state of abstraction full of ligh=\r\nt; it is,\nhowever, called sleep because it is the insentient phase of consc=\r\niousness.\nNothing is revealed because there is nothing to be revealed. Slee=\r\np is\ntherefore the manifestation of the insentient state.\n\nBut in samadhi, =\r\nBrahman, the Supreme Consciousness,is continuously glowing.\nShe is the engu=\r\nlfer of time and space, the destroyer of void, and the pure\nbeing (Jehovah =\r\n=E2=80=93 I am). How can She be the ignorance of sleep?\n\nTherefore sleep is=\r\n not the end-all and the be-all.Thus did Janaka teach\nAshtavakra.\n\nSource: =\r\nTRIPURA RAHASYA OR THE MYSTERY BEYOND THE TRINITY Translated by\nSWAMI SRI R=\r\nAMANANANDA SARASWATHI(Munagala S.
