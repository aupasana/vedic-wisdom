I had arranged one Shatchandi Homam at Ambica Temple in=\r\n 2003 wherein \nAcharya of the Homam read 108 Saptashati Stotra path within =\r\n9 days \narranging 3 Brahmins at the temple and on the 10th day a Homam was =\r\n\narranged with 9 Brahmins like Navchandi Homam. This way he read 108 \nSapta=\r\nshati Stotra Path (Pathatmaka)and last Homam with 9 Homatmaka.\nAfter some t=\r\nime one Acharya told me that this was not Shatchandi Homam. \nActually in Sh=\r\natchandi there should be 108 Brahmins at a time and 108 \nYagna-kundas shoul=\r\nd be created.\nSir, what is the right procedure for Shatchandi Homam? \n2. Do=\r\n you refer anybody in South India whom I can call to Gujarat to do \nthis ty=\r\npe of big Homam? This is because in this present time such \nlearned Acharya=\r\ns are rare. Most of the Brahmins are doing path \nstereotype without any lov=\r\ne or devotion here. I have seen some good \npronounces in South Indians.\nDr.=\r\n Ashwin Rawal\n\n\n"}}
