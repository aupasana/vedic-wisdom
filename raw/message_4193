At a very simple level pure sattwa form of manifested=\r\n\nconsciousness (Devi) asks the unmanifest / absolute consciousness\n(Shiva) =\r\nto go to self identification represented by ego and attachment\n(Shumbha and=\r\n Nishumbha) as an envoy with a proposal for them to withdraw\nto avoid confl=\r\nict or if they insist then come to battle and face defeat.\nWhat is the esot=\r\neric significant of this form of the Devi and why is she\ndoing so?\n\n2) In t=\r\nhe 7th chapter both Devi and Kali are mentioned in fighting\nChanda and Mund=\r\na and while the duo are slain by the Devi (Ambika), their\nheads are picked =\r\nup by Kali and brought over to Devi and henceforth Kali\nis said to be calle=\r\nd by the name of Chamunda.  Is a distinction to be\nmade between Devi and Ka=\r\nli here?  If so, then why is Kali named as\nChamunda when she picks up the s=\r\nlain heads of Chanda and Munda only\nwhereas they are actually slain by the =\r\nDevi.\n\nSumeet\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
