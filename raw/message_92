The desires, actions and \nknowledge of each being are caused by the movement of life force within that \nbeing, which is personified as a Female deity. If there is no energy, there \nis no movement of life force and there is nothing to desire or despise, \nnothing to do or avoid and nothing to know or ignore. We just have the \nsingular non-duality and there is no field of duality then. It is the Shakti \nthat gives birth (Mother!) to all desires, actions and knowledge and the \nfield of apparent duality in which all desires, actions and knowledge \noperate.\n\n*        *        *\n\n\nShiva is essentially nirguna Brahman, while Shakti is the energy that causes \na movement in Brahman and gives birth to a field of duality.\n\nWhile Brahman (nondual reality) is ONE and only one, the field of duality \nhas a lot of variety. The field of duality (also known as &quot;maya&quot; or \n&quot;delusion&quot;) has scope for different types of desire, action and knowledge. \nThe energies that cause different desires, different actions and different \naspects of knowledge is personified as different female deities.\n\nYou can also trace all those energies to the primordial energy that is the \nroot of all energies in Brahman. However, at that stage, we are almost \nbeyond names, gunas and depictions.\n\n*        *        *\n\nEven within each person, there are different Energies that cause different \ndesires, actions and knowledge. But there is one root energy that causes a \ndistinct identity in that person. All other energies stem from that energy.\n\nIt is that root energy that creates the entire field of duality in which \nTHAT person operates. This energy is the cause of the self-awareness or \nego-consciousness in that person. This energy (that causes \nego-consciousness) is also called &quot;Kundalini shakti&quot;. Instead of having no \nconcept of self and no objectification and being immersed in the non-dual \nBrahman, due to this shakti, one views a part of Brahman as &quot;self&quot; with \ncertain attributes, certain vasanas (mental conditioning) etc. This energy \ncan either &quot;bind&quot; one to a limited concept of self or &quot;liberate&quot; one with an \ninfinite concept of self. In most people, it is the former.\n\nOne can view this shakti as a microcosmic representation of the Divine \nMother within oneself.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, July 09, 2007 3:48 PM\nSubject: [sivacharya] Re: On Adwaitism, Shiva&#39;s Worship and Different Paths\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt; In both the paths, one overcomes the simple and finite concept of I-ness\n&gt;&gt; with something more infinite.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well said.\n&gt;\n&gt; May I ask another question?\n&gt;\n&gt; Whilst it seems that Shiva is a given constant his\n&gt; partner is depicted in different ways. I have found\n&gt; descriptions and images of Shiva in the company of\n&gt; Shakti, Parvati and Kali. What is the significance of\n&gt; the female  in these various depictions?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Kris\n\n\n"}}
