In  \n&gt; reality, a deity existing microcosmically &quot;inside&quot; you, a deity  \n&gt; existing microcosmically inside me, a deity existing microcosmically  \n&gt; inside someone else and a deity existing &quot;externally&quot; in the  \n&gt; macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and there is absolutely no  \n&gt; difference between all of them! That is essentially the Upanishadic  \n&gt; understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, when you say &quot;inside me&quot;, ask yourself : &quot;what is this I&quot;?  \n&gt; Is it the physical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it the causal  \n&gt; body? When mind entertains the notion that it is a physical body, it  \n&gt; indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks at it as I. When  \n&gt; mind entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it indeed  \n&gt; becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind  \n&gt; entertains the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed becomes  \n&gt; aware of a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally  \n&gt; overcomes all such notions one after the other, it may look at the  \n&gt; supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to  \n&gt; upanishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or  \n&gt; supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside  \n&gt; you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; are just expressions that describe false  \n&gt; notions rather than reality. There is no real you, I and he, but  \n&gt; there is only a supreme cosmic being.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; When you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion that there is a  \n&gt; certain entity called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Narasimha  \n&gt; Rao&quot; etc, these entities exist within your mind, for as long as your  \n&gt; mind can keep those notions alive. When all such false notions are  \n&gt; successfully eliminated, only supreme cosmic being is left for the  \n&gt; mind to focus on.\n&gt;\n&gt; When a conditioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific  \n&gt; person called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot; in a specific body, such a mind is  \n&gt; pre-occupied with so many things that it cannot focus itself on god  \n&gt; perfectly... Due to its pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on  \n&gt; small aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is like a mirror  \n&gt; capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be reflected on 100  \n&gt; mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. It  \n&gt; may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like  \n&gt; that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a different  \n&gt; extent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mind  \n&gt; focuses on internal god and he is limited&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is just a simple way to put things. In reality, the issue is  \n&gt; not internal vs external. The issue is the mind&#39;s ability to  \n&gt; perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupation with other  \n&gt; things comes down and its ability to focus on god goes up, we say  \n&gt; that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a  \n&gt; way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him  \n&gt; internal or external, is infinite and does not become weaker or  \n&gt; stronger. But mind can focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes  \n&gt; stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty  \n&gt; and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun after you  \n&gt; clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He  \n&gt; is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has become  \n&gt; cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirror!  \n&gt; Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in  \n&gt; mirror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and the same!\n&gt;\n&gt; This manner of speaking about internal vs external god and talking  \n&gt; about strengthening internal god is used to simplify things.  \n&gt; Bottomline is that any visualization of god by a mind is limited by  \n&gt; the conditioning, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing  \n&gt; the mind to visualize god, to the best of its ability, on a regular  \n&gt; basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, mind  \n&gt; loses all other pre-occupations and becomes fully absorbed in the  \n&gt; infinite god. Then we say that internal god has become infinite.  \n&gt; This is just a manner of speaking.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to give a small practical example, that is somewhat relevant  \n&gt; and illustrates some concepts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once a couple of priests with a high spiritual caliber were  \n&gt; conducting a Rudraabhishekam. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11  \n&gt; times. A person who worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of  \n&gt; the room. He started to meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his  \n&gt; favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships, he always  \n&gt; considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagines  \n&gt; only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing  \n&gt; Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri  \n&gt; mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self- \n&gt; awareness was modified. He lost the regular awareness of body,  \n&gt; perceived an all-pervading light that he was part of and remained in  \n&gt; a nice spiritual state for a while. When he came back and the pooja  \n&gt; was finished, one of the priests described something unusual that he  \n&gt; &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned towards this  \n&gt; person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw a tall 18-handed  \n&gt; form of Mahalakshmi standing in the place of this person for a  \n&gt; little while.\n&gt;\n&gt; As that person meditated, his senses turned inward and he was  \n&gt; looking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled  \n&gt; his entire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his  \n&gt; distinction of internal and external blurred and he perceived  \n&gt; himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot;  \n&gt; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as the all- \n&gt; pervading light that he was also a part of. However, the priest who  \n&gt; happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified state  \n&gt; and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time  \n&gt; made him see a specific external form rather than an all-pervading  \n&gt; form. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity  \n&gt; in two different ways. One was external and limited. The other was  \n&gt; neither internal nor external (but obtained by looking internally at  \n&gt; first) and unlimited. But, both are the same. They appeared  \n&gt; different to two minds because of the conditioning of those minds  \n&gt; rather than anything else, just as the same Sun may appear different  \n&gt; in two different mirrors!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; No amount of theorization will help one fully understand and  \n&gt; appreciate things like this. The most important thing is to do some  \n&gt; sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a regular basis. No effort  \n&gt; is wasted and eventually gives results when there is critical mass.  \n&gt; Whatever I say, whatever masters have said before and whatever  \n&gt; rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood and appreciated  \n&gt; through direct experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana. Reading  \n&gt; scriptures and mails like this is only a starting point. One has to  \n&gt; engage in some sadhana. Even people like Ramana Maharshi,  \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vivekananda etc did sadhana  \n&gt; for many years, before they realized god...\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------  \n&gt; ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------  \n&gt; ---------\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will  \n&gt; clear that point. You mentioned:\n&gt;\n&gt; The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own  \n&gt; internal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the  \n&gt; limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your  \n&gt; ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing  \n&gt; here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your  \n&gt; pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the  \n&gt; divinity that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By  \n&gt; focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to  \n&gt; project it for focusing better.\n&gt;\n&gt; When we are doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the  \n&gt; deity from within ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is  \n&gt; this where all deities reside(inside) ? I mean if I am focusing on  \n&gt; Mahaganapati, am I just bringing out the energy of Mahaganapati from  \n&gt; inside me or is there one single, universal, omnipotent divinty  \n&gt; called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and I am trying to  \n&gt; invite him into the fire?\n&gt;\n&gt; I remember a line from Vimalananda where he says, initially we  \n&gt; create the deity in the astral body so that this deity (the one we  \n&gt; projected) may lead us to the real deity who exists outside in the  \n&gt; universe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Did I understand the procedure correct? Kindly put down your  \n&gt; thoughts on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 10/9/09, Narasimha PVR Rao&lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Krishna Kanth,\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose god really came to your place in a human form and asked you  \n&gt; to give him some nice food.

A  \n&gt; purified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and  \n&gt; devotion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more  \n&gt; normal person may think various things in mind even when serving  \n&gt; god. There is some self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.\n&gt;\n&gt; The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own  \n&gt; internal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the  \n&gt; limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your  \n&gt; ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing  \n&gt; here.. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your  \n&gt; pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the  \n&gt; divinity that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By  \n&gt; focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to  \n&gt; project it for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you  \n&gt; that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember  \n&gt; that what is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you  \n&gt; that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This limited  \n&gt; divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than  \n&gt; used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes  \n&gt; infinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you  \n&gt; will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some  \n&gt; precautions will help you in the journey.\n&gt;\n&gt; Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in your homam  \n&gt; fire are basically being received in your internal god. If he has  \n&gt; enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own*  \n&gt; focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it.  \n&gt; But that makes him weaker and who knows whether the desire was  \n&gt; worthwhile?!\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may  \n&gt; have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual  \n&gt; progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But,  \n&gt; why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness and being nice.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people  \n&gt; very closely connected to one karmically, like wife, children and  \n&gt; parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s  \n&gt; desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast in a closely  \n&gt; bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significant  \n&gt; drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline:\n&gt;\n&gt; If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their  \n&gt; karmas and their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow  \n&gt; you down, then allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even  \n&gt; if you do not allow specifically, some close people&#39;s karmas and  \n&gt; desires may already be directly affecting your own karmas and  \n&gt; desires and hence slowing you down!\n&gt;\n&gt; Usually, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation  \n&gt; better.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family.  \n&gt; Immediate family includes spouse, children and parents.

For example, there was a gentleman whose last rites was  \n&gt; performed not by his kids, but by one of his foreign students.  \n&gt; Needless to say, the last rites are considered very important ritual  \n&gt; and is a privilege of the children, however, in this case since  \n&gt; there was a karmic connection, the foreign student (whom the  \n&gt; gentleman also considered as one of his spiritual children) ended up  \n&gt; performing the ritual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Narayan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...  \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha garu & Narayan garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskaram.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings  \n&gt; into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was little taken aback by this statement of your&#39;s, because  \n&gt; when is sit to do Homam, my mother and my 2 yr old son would join me  \n&gt; (90% of the times) and i have encouraged them to offer some sesame  \n&gt; seeds along with me in the Homam while i read the Atharvaseersham.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was always under the thought process that, i&#39;m doing Homam and  \n&gt; they are sitting with me and doing some seva to god along with me.  \n&gt; But after reading your e-mail i&#39;m in doubt whether should i ask them  \n&gt; to stop offering in the fire?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is clear from your earlier e-mail about the answer, but  \n&gt; somehow i&#39;m not very comfortable with that statement as my thought  \n&gt; process is still like, God has come to my place and everyone of us  \n&gt; are serving him (as you have put that like in case of an Idol).

What this namboodiri did is the correct way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and worship  \n&gt; it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and  \n&gt; streamline it, depending on how strong your identification is (it  \n&gt; will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that external  \n&gt; fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that  \n&gt; person to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of  \n&gt; karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway  \n&gt; intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of  \n&gt; course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are  \n&gt; ready and willing to face their consequences, but a person with a  \n&gt; strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work  \n&gt; on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be  \n&gt; possible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After  \n&gt; all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small  \n&gt; plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So,  \n&gt; until you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and  \n&gt; free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They  \n&gt; allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and  \n&gt; make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s  \n&gt; internal fire with external fire does such things, it can be  \n&gt; disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this approach  \n&gt; do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong  \n&gt; identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol  \n&gt; for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can..  \n&gt; Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into  \n&gt; you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle  \n&gt; it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with  \n&gt; your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body.  \n&gt; If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without  \n&gt; your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn  \n&gt; various vaasanas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam,  \n&gt; though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard.. Do not  \n&gt; worry about these things and do what you are used to or what you are  \n&gt; more attracted to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for most  \n&gt; people. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher  \n&gt; significance than just touching a body part and saying the letter..  \n&gt; Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is  \n&gt; possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s  \n&gt; subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is  \n&gt; essentially a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) They should be shown in the video. If you cannot get them,  \n&gt; please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra. It will not  \n&gt; block you..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- gisundar &lt;gisundar@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskarams Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am planning to start doing regular Ganapathi homam (once in  \n&gt; a week)starting this Sunday. I had a few queries . Request you to  \n&gt; kindly answer them for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) During some homams performed at my home, I have seen the  \n&gt; Vadhyar (priest) ask my mother to light the homam fire during the  \n&gt; agni invocation. I am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when we  \n&gt; had a namboothiri perform the homam he would light the homam fire  \n&gt; himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam  \n&gt; fire or do it myself ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically the glaam  \n&gt; beejam , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to  \n&gt; touch the heart , then right and left breasts respectively whereas  \n&gt; in the video you have shown it to be heart , navel and below  \n&gt; respctively. Is the beejam , shakthih and kilakam mudras /mantrams  \n&gt; differnet for each diety ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) There are 4 more avhana mudras for suprIto bhava,suprasanno  \n&gt; bhava, varado bhava, sarvAbhIshTaprado bhava. The manual does not  \n&gt; talks about these mudras. Kindly let me know if these are imporatnt  \n&gt; and how to show these mudras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Sundaram\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Importing contacts has never been easier..\n&gt; Bring your friends over to Yahoo!

Is it the physical body? Is it the subtle body?=\r\n Is it the causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it is a physic=\r\nal body, it indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks at it as I. W=\r\nhen mind entertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes =\r\naware of a subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains the notion t=\r\nhat it is a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal body and looks=\r\n it as I. When mind finally overcomes all such notions one after the other,=\r\n it may look at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. Accordin=\r\ng to upanishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or supr=\r\neme cosmic being. Thus, expressions like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;ins=\r\nide him&quot; are just expressions that describe false notions rather than reali=\r\nty.

Due to its pre-oc=\r\ncupations, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very limi=\r\nted way. This is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image =\r\nmay be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and d=\r\nark colored. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken.=\r\n Like that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a different e=\r\nxtent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mind focuses =\r\non internal god and he is limited&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: =\r\n1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;This is just a simple way to pu=\r\nt things.&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;In reality, the iss=\r\nue is not internal vs external. The issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive=\r\n and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupation with other things comes dow=\r\nn and its ability to focus on god goes up, we say that the internal god is =\r\nbecoming stronger. Again, this is just a way of representation. In reality,=\r\n god, whether you call him internal or external, is infinite and does not b=\r\necome weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god =\r\nbecomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty=\r\n and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun after you clean =\r\nthe mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He is the same al=\r\nways. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has become cleaner and brighter. But t=\r\nhere is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirr=\r\nor 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and the external Sun, they are all o=\r\nne and the same!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;This manner of speaking about internal vs extern=\r\nal god and talking about strengthening internal god is used to simplify thi=\r\nngs. Bottomline is that any visualization of god by a mind is limited by th=\r\ne conditioning, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind=\r\n to visualize god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharp=\r\nen its ability to visualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occup=\r\nations and becomes fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that int=\r\nernal god has become infinite.

They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 time=\r\ns. A person who worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. =\r\nHe started to meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Wh=\r\nichever mantra or deity he worships, he always considers everything to be a=\r\nn offering to Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. He=\r\nre also, he was visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was=\r\n offering Gayatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his =\r\nself-awareness was modified. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceiv=\r\ned an all-pervading light that he was part of and remained in a nice spirit=\r\nual state for a while. When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of=\r\n the priests described something unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of th=\r\ne pooja, that priest turned towards this person and was surprised by what h=\r\ne saw. He saw a tall&nbsp;18-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in&nbsp;th=\r\ne place of this person for a little while.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; =\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-h=\r\neight: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;As that p=\r\nerson meditated, his&nbsp;senses turned inward and he was looking internall=\r\ny. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being in his=\r\n visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal and external=\r\n blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (it is=\r\n neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived Mahaalakshmi as=\r\n the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. However, the priest wh=\r\no happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified state and so =\r\nhe noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time&nbsp;made him se=\r\ne a specific&nbsp;external form rather than an all-pervading form. But both=\r\n the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two different ways.=\r\n One was external and limited. The other was neither internal nor external =\r\n(but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But, both are =\r\nthe same. They appeared different to two minds because of the conditioning =\r\nof those minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun may appear d=\r\nifferent in two different mirrors!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-he=\r\night: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font =\r\nsize=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1=\r\n.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22=\r\nem; &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;li=\r\nne-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;No amount of theorization will help one fully understa=\r\nnd and appreciate things like this.

Through your mental focus, you are projectin=\r\ng the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your abi=\r\nlity to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here.. Thou=\r\ngh there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with=\r\n so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can fo=\r\ncus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. =\r\nFire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On practice, the d=\r\nivinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus=\r\n, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside =\r\nyou that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity s=\r\nhould be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnec=\r\nessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desi=\r\nres and other thoughts will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly =\r\nfocus on that divinity. Some precautions will help you in the journey.&lt;br s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;Karmas a=\r\nnd thoughts of people who are making offerings in your homam fire are basic=\r\nally being received in your internal god. If he has enough power (his power=\r\n is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire =\r\nof someone, he may just do it. But that makes him weaker and who knows whet=\r\nher the desire was worthwhile?!&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;br styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire=\r\n, you yourself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the sp=\r\niritual progress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But=\r\n, why let someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?&lt;br style=3D&quot;line=\r\n-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;Thus, this is not a =\r\nmatter of political correctness and being nice.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.=\r\n22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;However, there is already a lot=\r\n of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmica=\r\nlly, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s d=\r\nesires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast in a =\r\nclosely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significant draw=\r\nback to allowing them to share fire.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;Bottomline:&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22e=\r\nm; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;If some people are so close to you=\r\n that you want to allow their karmas and their desires to affect your spiri=\r\ntual progress and slow you down, then allow such people to offer in your ho=\r\nmam fire.

Then offerings in it will kindle your int=\r\nernal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identification i=\r\ns (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that external fir=\r\ne or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to=\r\n your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowe=\r\nd for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or =\r\nparents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the entir=\r\ne world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a pers=\r\non with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and w=\r\nork on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be poss=\r\nible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all, if you =\r\nstart plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. =\r\nIf you guard it and let it grow very&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, until y=\r\nou become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yourself fro=\r\nm the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the=\r\n same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their hom=\r\nam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly ident=\r\nifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does such things, it can be di=\r\nsastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this approach do not und=\r\nerstand much about fire and do not have a strong identification with the fi=\r\nre. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and they do not benefit f=\r\nrom fire as much as one can.. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or=\r\n making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous a=\r\nt worst.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-c=\r\nonverted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you=\r\n make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fir=\r\ne (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a=\r\n strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire wi=\r\nll become strong and burn various vaasanas.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em=\r\n; &quot;&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=\r\n=3D&quot;line-height: 1.22em; &quot;&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods for be=\r\neja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually st=\r\nandard..
