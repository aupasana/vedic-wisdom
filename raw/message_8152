Without a name also, this is a v=\r\nalid mantra. But this is like a \n&gt; compound seed from which several other m=\r\nantras can be created.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. When in doubt, I just think of Narayana Maha=\r\nrshi as the Maharshi of a \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3a. Correct chanting is highly co=\r\nnducive to faster realization of the \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; 3b. I feel very nice list=\r\nening to or chanting.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Well, if this is the case, I am really nobody=\r\n to give you &quot;guidance&quot;. \n&gt; Yet, because you asked, I will give my opinion.=\r\n I think (a) is the best. \n&gt; In fact, doing (c) for a while, then doing (b)=\r\n for a while and finally \n&gt; doing (a) may be a nice formula.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun, Mar 13, 2011 at 12:19 PM, Akshaya wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nank your Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. You mentioned &quot;Om Shrim Hrim Aim&quot; Since it conta=\r\nins 3 beej of 3 \n&gt; aspects of devi is there any need to add any one name of=\r\n devi after this \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I thought mantra had to have a seer bef=\r\nore it qualifies as being a \n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; is there any other good source =\r\non net for understanding and knowing \n&gt; mantras by some realized yogi/guru\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; One source i know is\n&gt; &quot;Meditations from the Tantras&quot; by Paramahamsa S=\r\nwami Satyananda Saraswati \n&gt; listed at http://www.astrojyoti.com/mantras3.h=\r\ntm \n&gt; &lt;http://www.astrojyoti.com/mantras3.htm&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. I know that vedic ma=\r\nntras / gayatri have to have correct \n&gt; pronunciation.\n&gt; \n&gt; a. Is the reali=\r\nsation of mantra hidden in the way its chanted or was \n&gt; this condition set=\r\n to make sure the words of vedas dont change over \n&gt; hundreds of years and =\r\npossibly lead to different literal meaning?\n&gt; \n&gt; b. What are your experienc=\r\nes with listening ghanam of vedic mantras?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. With my limited meditati=\r\non background i reach a state where i can \n&gt; see/feel my mind/thoughts. whi=\r\nch of 3 options i best to stick to.\n&gt; \n&gt; a. If i remain still and let thoug=\r\nht waves pass, it simply remains clear \n&gt; for some time. mental clarity/pea=\r\nce is result\n&gt; \n&gt; b. If i chant &quot;Om&quot; a particular kind of bliss/energy/feel=\r\ning is result.\n&gt; \n&gt; c. If i chant any diety mantra, mind like monkey starts=\r\n to cling on \n&gt; image on god concepts/grace related to god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thankyou f=\r\nor your guidance Narasimha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Akshay\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://www.astrojyoti.com/m=\r\nantras3.htm&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
