The branc=\r\nhes are in the ground and the roots are in\nthe sky. What could be the signi=\r\nficance of this?*\nA: This is a symbol to signify that your origin is the Di=\r\nvinity; the\nconsciousness. That is your root. The mind and all its parapher=\r\nnalia are\nlike the branches. And all the different types of rhythms in life=\r\n, all the\ndifferent emotions, are like the leaves. They don=E2=80=99t stay =\r\npermanently, they\nwither away. If  you are focusing on the leaves, and you =\r\nforget to water\nthe roots, then the tree will not remain.\n\n\nSo, it says, =\r\n=E2=80=98Asvattham enam su-virudha-mulam asanga-sastrena drdhena\nchittva=E2=\r\n=80=99 (BG 15:3). Notice that you are not these different emotions, these\nd=\r\nifferent aspects of life. Feel the distance from all these branches and\nret=\r\nrieve back. That is what it is saying.\n\n\nOtherwise we get so immersed in th=\r\ne outer, that we forget the main root.\nYou need to prune the tree otherwise=\r\n it goes here and there. So prune all\nthat, and know that your origin is so=\r\nmewhere up. Adi Shankaracharya has\nsaid this beautifully, - =E2=80=98My ori=\r\nginal place is in heaven, I have come here\njust for few days; just to have =\r\nfun. Today I have just come for the purpose\nof relaxing, but this is not my=\r\n original place, it is somewhere else.=E2=80=99\n\n\nThe thought itself - My h=\r\nome is somewhere else, I have just come to visit -\ncreates a distance insid=\r\ne you. This world is a transit lounge.\n\n\nYou know, in airports and railway =\r\nstations there are lounges, and in a\nlounge what do you do? You keep your l=\r\nuggage and start eating. You use the\nbathroom and everything, but you don=\r\n=E2=80=99t open your suitcase and hang your\nclothes all over the place. You=\r\n don=E2=80=99t do that in a transit lounge. You keep\nyour things packed.\n\n\n=\r\nSo this world is just a transit lounge. Don=E2=80=99t mistake it to be your=\r\n home.\n\n\n*Q: The Ashtavakra Gita says, =E2=80=98You can go on reading scrip=\r\ntures, but you\nwill get liberation only when you forget the scriptures.=E2=\r\n=80=99 So then what is\nthe purpose of reading the scriptures?*\nA: See, you =\r\nget into a bus, but then you also need to get out of the bus.\nNow if you ar=\r\ngue with me that, =E2=80=98If I have to get out of the bus then why\nshould =\r\nI get into the bus?=E2=80=99 What can I say? You get into the bus from\nsome=\r\nwhere else and you get out from somewhere else. If you have to get out\nof t=\r\nhe bus, why should you get into the bus in the first place - this\nargument =\r\ndoesn=E2=80=99t hold.\n\n\nSo, the scriptures are to make you understand your =\r\nnature, the nature of\nthe universe, the nature of this mind which is stuck =\r\nin small things, and\nto give it a bigger vision.\n\n\nKnowledge is like deterg=\r\nent. See, you put soap on your body but at some\npoint you wash it off as we=\r\nll, isn=E2=80=99t it? Similarly, you have this desire,\n=E2=80=99I want to b=\r\ne liberated=E2=80=99, and that desire takes you away from all other\nsmall d=\r\nesires. But if you keep holding on to that thought, then it will\nalso becom=\r\ne a problem at some point. You have to wash that off as well and\nbecome fre=\r\ne. A point comes when you say, =E2=80=98If I have to get liberation let\nit =\r\nbe, otherwise let thy will be done.=E2=80=99 In that moment you are already=\r\n free.\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n\r\n--047d7b621c74f2329c04cdac4fff\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:0px;padding:0px;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial,He=\r\nlvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;stron=\r\ng style=3D&quot;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://timesofindia.speakingt=\r\nree.in/spiritual-articles/science-of-spirituality/the-world-is-a-transit-lo=\r\nunge&quot;&gt;http://timesofindia.speakingtree.in/spiritual-articles/science-of-spi=\r\nrituality/the-world-is-a-transit-lounge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin=\r\n:0px;padding:0px;color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif=\r\n;font-size:14px;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong style=3D&quot;margin:=\r\n0px;padding:0px&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;margin:0px;padding:0px;color:=\r\nrgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14px;backgro=\r\nund-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;\n&lt;strong style=3D&quot;margin:0px;padding:0px&quot;&gt;Q: In=\r\n the fifteenth chapter of the Gita, there is a description of a tree which =\r\nis upside down.
