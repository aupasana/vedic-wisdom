Goel\n\n\nWhile asking God for monetar=\r\ny gains, a house, education, or a more\nhealthy body is not unethical, we ma=\r\ny be worshipping only a\nself-limiting aspect of the Divine if our mind is f=\r\nastened to our own\ndesires. As we create a wish list of finite objects whil=\r\ne worshipping,\nwe do not try to connect to the One Who is Absolute Truth,\nC=\r\nonsciousness, and Infinite Bliss but apply for the blessings of a\nfinite po=\r\ntency that can fulfill our dreams.\n\nIn Hindu spirituality, this concept bec=\r\nomes explicit as certain\nexpressions of divinity have become culturally ass=\r\nociated with specific\nobjects or gains that they can bestow upon us. While =\r\nthe principal forms\nof God, including Lord Krishna and Lord Shiva, are wors=\r\nhipped selflessly\nby followers as the manifestations of Brahman (the Absolu=\r\nte Reality),\nthe lesser forms (demigods) are traditionally remembered only =\r\nwhen their\nfollowers need a specific object in life. In the Bhagavad Gita, =\r\nLord\nKrishna promises that whenever we desire something due to our ignoranc=\r\ne\nand select a demigod to achieve it, He fixes our faith on the selected\nfo=\r\nrm so that our wishes may be easily fulfilled (VII: 20-21). Along\nthese lin=\r\nes, the thousands of demigods in Hindu mythology, all elements\nof the same =\r\ndivinity, can also be understood as God&#39;s reciprocation\nto our own desires.=\r\n\n\nAs we evolve and learn to connect, our wish list may expand to include\ngo=\r\nodness, some knowledge, some truthful fellow beings to interact with,\nsome =\r\nlove in life, and some desires for &quot;letting go&quot;. This would\nmean that we ar=\r\ne getting closer to God and are on our way to meeting\nHim. Eventually, we m=\r\nay start requesting Him for realization and\ndeliverance from the universe. =\r\nBut only when we approach God with an\nempty wish list, not desiring even li=\r\nberation, can we actually sense the\noriginal inspirations within us that ar=\r\ne a result of a two-way\nconnection with the Almighty.\n\nSimilarly, we can wo=\r\nrship the Divine Energy as the Mother for knowledge,\nwealth, and strength. =\r\nBut it is not until we take refuge in Her by\ntranscending the short-term ob=\r\njectives of life that we worship the\npersonification of the infinite source=\r\n of universal energy and power. We\nneed to learn to transfer the doership o=\r\nf all karma to Her and adore Her\njust for being there for us in order to re=\r\nalize that we all are Her\nfavorite kids.\n\nGod, according to Hindu thought, =\r\nis everywhere -- in you, in me, in all\nmatter, and yet He is beyond the uni=\r\nverse. Accordingly, His availability\nto the individual soul is never a cons=\r\ntraint. Our aim is to surrender to\nGod so that we can experience Him within=\r\n ourselves or call Him for a\nvisit in person. And when we remember God just=\r\n to remember Him, we start\nsurrendering to God. The lack of any material ob=\r\njective during\nremembrance indicates that the devotional foundation of trus=\r\nt, truth,\ncontentment, and an earnest aspiration to meet God has been made.=\r\n This\nis where pure love or Bhakti begins, for the love of God, to exist in=\r\n\nthe heart, requires a permanent erasure of all human inclinations\ntowards =\r\nscheming, passion, and slackness from the mind. On the other\nhand, whether =\r\nwe opt for the `formless&#39; God or a God with\nattributes, large amounts of wo=\r\nrldly knowledge and information about the\nLord may not be necessary to unde=\r\nrstand that God pervades us all.\n\nMoving from duality to the non-dualist sc=\r\nhool of thought, where the\nindividual soul and God are not really separate =\r\nbut appear to be\nseparated due to our own ignorance, our desires remain as =\r\nthe only\nbarrier in our connecting to our Self -- which is God. Because\nign=\r\norance-borne selfish karma, laden with desires, are inept in\ndestroying ign=\r\norance and cause repeated births in the world, any prayer\nto God solely for=\r\n the fulfillment of our own desires does not contribute\nto our awakening. T=\r\nhrough whichever yoga we choose, the introspective\npath of knowledge or the=\r\n emotional path of pure love, when spirituality\npurges the difference betwe=\r\nen the individual soul and the Divine,\nignorance, desires and the feel of s=\r\neparation -- all leave together.\n\nIn spite of the fact that our desires, wh=\r\nich are present when we are\nspiritual beginners, prevent us from worshippin=\r\ng God in His entirety,\nevery prayer slowly and steadily helps us build a pl=\r\natform for our inner\nrise due to the tiny bits of pure love that are often =\r\nunknowingly\npresent in our communications. Even the elementary prayers that=\r\n are\ndirected towards an object of the material world may strengthen our\nha=\r\nbit of applying for a connection to the Divine. And it may not be long\nbefo=\r\nre we turn to the selfless mode of praying to activate selfless\nkarma. Once=\r\n we are in love with God, we are all set; God remembrance\nwith a feel of su=\r\nrrender can desert all our remaining passions to\nconnect us to God eternall=\r\ny.\n\nAbout the Writer\n\nDr. Mukul S.
