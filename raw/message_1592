The time then was such that there was too much=\r\n weight \n&gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight=\r\n. Tremendous \n&gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed =\r\nto a great extent, \n&gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjun=\r\na being a great warrior, \n&gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some pe=\r\nople he deeply loved and \n&gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was h=\r\nis dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the=\r\n 19th century as one of \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yoga=\r\nnanda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , =\r\nhis dharma was different in this \n&gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to re=\r\nnounce material life despite his \n&gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the =\r\nsimple life of a monk and inspire \n&gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life=\r\n of mental detachment and service to \n&gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (wh=\r\nich he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the =\r\ntime and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide w=\r\nhat is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words =\r\nsaying &quot;follow your own dharma \n&gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the l=\r\night of castism. Though the concept \n&gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in=\r\n Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n&gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much=\r\n there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n&gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a b=\r\nrahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerf=\r\nul king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \n&gt; &gt; later. Basically varn=\r\na shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \n&gt; &gt; of father, becau=\r\nse that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; &gt; develops in lif=\r\ne, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, the misi=\r\nnterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n&gt; &gt; dharma f=\r\nrom your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt; enough, one will *kn=\r\now* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt; mind that tell=\r\ns us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; &gt; noise from o=\r\nther parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt; &gt; confused=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and in=\r\ntuition and \n&gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may =\r\nerr, but doing \n&gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; More th=\r\nan following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \n&gt; &gt; acti=\r\nons without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \n&gt; &gt; accum=\r\nulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the giv=\r\nen \n&gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification wi=\r\nth the \n&gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leav=\r\ne the result \n&gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen=\r\n now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfi=\r\ncation through \n&gt; &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our=\r\n consciousness slowly. \n&gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper =\r\nand tell our dharma clearer. \n&gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This w=\r\nill slowly enable us to see our \n&gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without i=\r\nncurring new karmas. This is not easy, \n&gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people =\r\nthink.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharm=\r\na, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one en=\r\ngages in action with \n&gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intel=\r\nlect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt; &gt; Another external input is the words=\r\n of scriptures and learned men. One can \n&gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them.=\r\n A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders=\r\n to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \n&gt; &gt; the master to determ=\r\nine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused=\r\n about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt; &gt; and relatives was=\r\n not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; &gt; dharma. When N=\r\narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt; and want=\r\ned to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; &gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One who is not in tun=\r\ne with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; debts are and w=\r\nhat nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n&gt; &gt; one=\r\n&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or any=\r\nbody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n&gt; &gt; declare that as the dharm=\r\na. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \n&gt; &gt; time to time and fro=\r\nm place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \n&gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s=\r\n dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; dharma by=\r\n increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \n&gt; &gt; sadha=\r\nna (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \n&gt; &gt; attach=\r\nment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\none&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: =\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; i just finished my A=\r\nghora series\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma=\r\n is very personal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we app=\r\nroach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upani=\r\nshads\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jitender\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From Chandigarh to Chennai - find friends all over India.

Sant Tulsidas&#39;s&nbsp; broader dharma may have been reali=\r\nzing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should have been to keep his wife h=\r\nappy. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can ever full perform every dharma that =\r\nis expected of us. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I believe the reason this idea o=\r\nf Dharma was existent in ancient times, was mostly because nature has creat=\r\ned various kinds of people, each with varying tendencies. This idea of Dhar=\r\nma was sort of approxiamtion, or the best way to tell men that we are all d=\r\nifferent and yet we are not\n incorrect in anyway. This is much better than =\r\nthe new ages philosophies which outright deny reality and claim everything =\r\nand everyone is born equal. It is not so.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The word r=\r\neligion is a 13 century invention and, etymologically, and inherently compe=\r\ntitive in nature. Unlike Dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, as Narasimhaj=\r\ni&#39; s mail shows correctly, following Dharma is no gaurantee of anything, le=\r\nast of all Moksha. It just continues the cycle. But what is the big deal in=\r\n continuinng the cycle, it would any way continue which ever path one chose=\r\ns, dharma or adharma. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A much better way of conducti=\r\non life, I feel, is maknig a mental note of Karma. To know teh simple truth=\r\n that that which goes out will come back to you and that, if you had not be=\r\nen bad at some point, nothing bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise o=\r\nrdinary person, following a life based on and being on the right side of&nb=\r\nsp;karma, is much\n easier and profitable&nbsp; than trying to find that elu=\r\nsive dharma which anyway won&#39;t help one in the long run.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Just my feeling on the subject.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Much =\r\nbetter option&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is dangerous to follow someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engaging=\r\n in the right &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to=\r\n person, from time to time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dep=\r\nendent on what nature expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; which in turn is base=\r\nd on who you have been in the past, what actions you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; did in t=\r\nhe past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts =\r\nyou &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; created in the process, and\n what mental tendencies you a=\r\nccumulated until &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If, based on=\r\n one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s men=\r\ntal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spr=\r\nead the message of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes =\r\none&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic=\r\n debts, nature wants a person to spread the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ritual of homam i=\r\nn the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; me=\r\nntal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The dharma o=\r\nf a being may change from one life to\n another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was to=\r\no much weight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved=\r\n of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and=\r\n civilization destroyed to a great extent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yu=\r\nga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it =\r\nwas his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th =\r\ncentury as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Y=\r\nogananda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ram=\r\nakrishna) , his dharma was different in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; new time and pla=\r\nce. He was born to renounce\n material life despite his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; aristo=\r\ncratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service t=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what=\r\n Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place ma=\r\ny be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dh=\r\narma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s wor=\r\nds saying &quot;follow your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dhar=\r\nma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of caste (var=\r\nna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; killing\n birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishw=\r\namitra was a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahm=\r\nana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s apt=\r\nitude. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of father, because that =\r\nis what one is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; develops in li=\r\nfe, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know=\r\n your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are no=\r\nt just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual dha=\r\nrma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very v=\r\nery difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s d=\r\nharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind that tells =\r\nus what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; noise=\r\n from other\n parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; confused.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We should make the best judgm=\r\nent combining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decide what is=\r\n our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne best we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; More than f=\r\nollowing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should n=\r\not build &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should =\r\nengage in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgme=\r\nnt on what our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; situation is), with as lit=\r\ntle attachment and self-identification with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; action as pos=\r\nsible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; to\n god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication=\r\n through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify =\r\nour consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will w=\r\nork sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There is a positive =\r\nfeedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma c=\r\nlearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in =\r\naction with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s\n int=\r\nellect and intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Another external input i=\r\ns the words of scriptures and learned men. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; derive one=\r\n&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words=\r\n of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincer=\r\nely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dha=\r\nrma was and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharm=\r\na, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma. When Na=\r\nrendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay =\r\nin the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and\n does not kno=\r\nw who one is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects fr=\r\nom one can err in the judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s =\r\ninner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybo=\r\ndy) cannot outline a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; declare that as th=\r\ne dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time=\r\n to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understandin=\r\ng of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing var=\r\nious kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and e=\r\nngaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n attachment, one can slowly p=\r\nurify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s individ=\r\nual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;da=\r\nhiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8=\r\n:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; i just finished my =\r\nAghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vima=\r\nlanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody s=\r\nhare views on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jitender&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From Chandig=\r\narh to Chennai - find friends all over India.
