She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n=C2=A0\nFurth=\r\ner, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and comp=\r\nlex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is on=\r\ne going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudish=\r\nness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n=C2=A0\nAll said and d=\r\none, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who live=\r\nd - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sa=\r\ndhus and saints?\n=C2=A0\nAnd finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nitya=\r\nnanda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the id=\r\nea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her g=\r\nuru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. =\r\nIn this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas =\r\nfor some years. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Between me and You, t=\r\nhere is only me.\nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n--- On Thu=\r\n, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Narasimha PVR =\r\nRao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual=\r\n gurus\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26=\r\n AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nNamaste KK,\n\nNo matter how genuine the video may look, let=\r\n us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to co=\r\nnclusions as someone said.\n\n* * *\n\n*Even if* his expose on video is genuine=\r\n, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.
