But not everyone wearing good knee pads is a=\r\n good soccer player and one can play soccer well without knee pads also. In=\r\n 95% of the cases, knee pads make no difference. But, in the 5% cases where=\r\n one falls down, they help one.\n \nSimilarly, one can do several rituals wit=\r\nhout yajnopavitam also. A yajnopavitam along the spine helps in regulating =\r\nthe energy flow. When energy (of self-awareness, aka Kundalini) rises high,=\r\n one can lose self-awareness. A thread touching upper body, especially alon=\r\ne the spine, grounds one&#39;s self-awareness to the body and puts limits on ho=\r\nw fast the energy can rise. However, wearing of a tight upper cloth changes=\r\n the equation.\n \nIn general, yajnopavitam makes no difference most of the t=\r\nimes. In a rare case when energy rises too high too suddenly and one is not=\r\n prepared physically, yajnopavitam can prevent a temporary problem in the n=\r\nervous system.\n \nIn my view, it is fine to do tarpana without a yajnopavita=\r\nm and using a cloth as you describe Kaasi priests doing below.\n \nHowever, I=\r\n suggest wearing a yajnopavita to those who perform homam for spiritual pro=\r\ngress or meditation with any mantra without moving the body much. Such peop=\r\nle may sooner or later experience some movement of energy. Yajnopavitam gro=\r\nunds the energy and regulates its flow. Even if one doing a homam or medita=\r\ntion regularly did not get sacred thread formally, I suggest just getting o=\r\nne and wearing it by oneself. The tradition of getting a sacred thread at u=\r\npanayanam makes sense if serious sadhana starts with Gayatri mantra from th=\r\ne upanayanam day. If someone without upanayanam done and sacred thread give=\r\nn is doing serious sadhana, it is a good idea to keep a sacred thread on. W=\r\nearing an upper cloth that touches body at some points around the spine are=\r\na also serves pretty much the same purpose.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n        Dear N=\r\narasimha garu,\n\n        In the below mail it is mentioned that Yajnopaviita=\r\nm is one of the essential requirements for performing Tarpanam.

In South India, Sraddha is observed as above. =\r\nThis is known as Pratyaabdika Sraddham. It calls for  certain voluntary res=\r\ntrictions and sacrifices on the part of the  karta and  elaborate rituals w=\r\nith Homam and offering of  Vastra, Bhojanam ( as per family tradition)  and=\r\n  decent Dakshina  to the Brahmins who officiate as pitr and visvedeva apar=\r\nt from appropriate  Dakshina to the family or other priest who conducts the=\r\n Shraddha proceedings. Pitr Paksha Sraddha  involves offerings also to Karu=\r\nnika Pitrs  i.e., relatives who died and for whom there were no issues or f=\r\nor whom there is none  willing to perform Shraddha  rites. Pitr Paksha Srad=\r\ndha  is far simpler and less time consuming as compared to annual  Sraddha =\r\n referred to above. In Pitr Paksha Sraddhas  normally 5  Brahmins  of  whic=\r\nh one has to be a priest are required.  One of the brahmins is nominated as=\r\n  Karunika Pitr.  In place of meals as in  Pratyaabdika Sraddham , in  Pitr=\r\n Paksha Sraddhams they are offered rice,dal  and some vegetable like raw  p=\r\nlantain and any other thing as per custom. In USA and other offshore lands,=\r\n very few freelance  priests are available as in India. It is also difficul=\r\nt to get more than one priest at a time, at places where they are available=\r\n, since most of the priests are working for Hindu temples. But the temples =\r\nallow the priest for house visit or for performing rituals in the temple co=\r\nmplex itself. There are prescribed scales of fees for various rituals to be=\r\n paid to the temple. Over and above this one cay pay any gratis amout to th=\r\ne priest. The list of items to be given as danam  to the priest included mi=\r\nlk, curd,ghee,3 varieties of fruits and 2,3 varieties of vegetables in addi=\r\ntion to those listed above.\n\n          Coming to the question as to what ca=\r\nn be done if one is located at a place where no priests are available, one =\r\nshould do at least Pitr tarpanam, if one is accustomed to performing   Tarp=\r\nanams on Amavasya, Sankramanams, Grahana kalams  and all other  Punyakalams=\r\n. Essential requirements for Tarpanam are Yagnopaveetham, Dharbha Grass,Bla=\r\nck til (2,3 grams) and a rice(2 grams).  If one is not performing these pre=\r\nscribed(ordained ) rites, he needs to seek  kshama from  Pitrus on that day=\r\n for non-performance  and at the earliest possible occasions contact a Guru=\r\n or Purohit and seek  advice on remedial actions. It is permissible to perf=\r\norm  Shraddha  on some other occasion. Pl. consult the  Purohit in this reg=\r\nard.  My suggestion is at least feed poor people or Brahmins on the day of =\r\n Shraddha.   Unquestionable faith (shraddha)  is a must in such ceremonies.=\r\n Do not give Dakshina to priest grudgingly. Have faith and belief that the =\r\npitrs  get pleased by doing the prescribed rites.\n          G.Balasubramani=\r\nan\n\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n          From: Shankerprasad Bhatt &lt;ssbhatt79@gmail. com&gt;\n          To:=\r\n USBrahmins@yahoogro ups.com\n          Cc: gita-talk@yahoogrou ps.com\n     =\r\n     Sent: Wednesday, September 2, 2009 12:43:16 PM\n          Subject: [USB=\r\nrahmins] Fwd: [Shakti-L: 10093] Shortage of priests affects annual Pitra Pa=\r\nksh rituals\n\n            \n          Shraddha Paksha is started from this Sa=\r\nturday and we are required to\n          offer prayers for the salvation of =\r\nour family members.When priests are\n          not available all Hindus ough=\r\nt to recite prayers for the liberation of\n          our mother father and o=\r\nther relatives.Besides we ought to recite Bhagv\n          ata Gita and Vish=\r\nnu Sahastra Nama and do some kirtans by remembering\n          them.Go to th=\r\ne temple and offer donations to the temples and its\n          priests\n     =\r\n     I will be sending article on Shraddha ceremony\n\n          S S Bhatt\n\n =\r\n         ---------- Forwarded message ----------\n          From: sri venkat=\r\n &lt;ahvenkitesh@ gmail.com&gt;\n          Date: Wed, Sep 2, 2009 at 2:51 AM\n     =\r\n     Subject: [Shakti-L: 10093] Shortage of priests affects annual Pitra\n  =\r\n        Paksh rituals\n          To:\n\n          Shortage of priests affects =\r\nHindu rites\n\n          http://www.newkeral a.com/nkfullnews -1-103622. html=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           \n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n\n\n\n  No virus found in this incoming message.\n =\r\n Checked by AVG - www.avg.com \n  Version: 8.5.409 / Virus Database: 270.13.=\r\n82/2351 - Release Date: 09/07/09 06:40:00\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0116_01CA30DA.D4AFDF60\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3603&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY b=\r\ngColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;As usual, I am cc&#39;ing my answer to your question \nanonymously, so =\r\nthat others also benefit.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;For people who play socce=\r\nr, knee pads are helpful \nin avoiding knee injuries.

I am =\r\nusing rubber band \n        sometimes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks and Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&l=\r\nt;deleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- \n        On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 9/4/09, G Balasubramanian &lt;I&gt;&=\r\nlt;gbsub@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n        wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n        &lt;BLOCKQUOTE \n   =\r\n     style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,2=\r\n55) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: \n          G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] \n          Fw: [USBrahmins] Fwd: [Shakti-L: 10093=\r\n] Shortage of priests affects \n          annual Pitra Paksh rituals&lt;BR&gt;To: =\r\n\n          viprasamhitha@...&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, September 4, 200=\r\n9, \n          7:24 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv769403664&gt;&lt;SPAN style=\r\n=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n          &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n          =\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n          &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: arial,helveti=\r\nca,sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT \n          size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n         =\r\n &lt;DIV \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: arial,helvetica,san=\r\ns-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;DIV \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; BORDER-LE=\r\nFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman,new york,times,s=\r\nerif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n          face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;----- Forwarded Message ----&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; G Balas=\r\nubramanian \n          &lt;gbsub@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n          style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; USBrahmins@yahoogro \n          ups.co=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; \n          Thurs=\r\nday, September 3, 2009 9:46:08 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIG=\r\nHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [USBrahmins] Fwd: \n          [Shakti-L: 1=\r\n0093] Shortage of priests affects annual Pitra Paksh \n          rituals&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: arial,hel=\r\nvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;Dear Friends,&lt;BR&gt;For general information=\r\n I would like to submit \n          that&nbsp;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: ita=\r\nlic&quot;&gt; Shraddha&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; is \n          required &nbsp; to be performed n=\r\not only&nbsp; during&nbsp; &lt;SPAN \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Pi=\r\ntr Paksha&nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;but also on the \n          respective anniversary &lt;S=\r\nPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Thithi&nbsp; \n          &lt;/SPAN&gt;in the resp=\r\nective anniversary &lt;SPAN \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Paksha and=\r\n respective&nbsp;&nbsp; \n          anniversary month of one`s father and mo=\r\nther,if&nbsp; they are not \n          alive.&lt;/SPAN&gt; In South India, Sraddha=\r\n is observed as above.

In USA and other offshore lands, very \n          few fr=\r\neelance&nbsp; priests are available as in India. It is also \n          diff=\r\nicult to get more than one priest at a time, at places where they \n        =\r\n  are available, since most of the priests are working for Hindu \n         =\r\n temples. But the temples allow the priest for house visit or for \n        =\r\n  performing rituals in the temple complex itself. There are prescribed \n  =\r\n        scales of fees for various rituals to be paid to the temple. Over a=\r\nnd \n          above this one cay pay any gratis amout to the priest. The li=\r\nst of \n          items to be given as &lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;da=\r\nnam&nbsp; \n          &lt;/SPAN&gt;to the priest included milk, curd,ghee,3 variet=\r\nies of fruits \n          and 2,3 varieties of vegetables in addition to tho=\r\nse listed \n          above.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Coming to the question as to what can be=\r\n done if one is \n          located at a place where no priests are availabl=\r\ne, one should do at \n          least&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt; Pit=\r\nr tarpanam, &lt;/SPAN&gt;if one is \n          accustomed to performing &nbsp; &lt;SP=\r\nAN \n          style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Tarpanams on Amavasya, Sankraman=\r\nams, \n          Grahana kalams&nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;and all other&nbsp; &lt;SPAN \n    =\r\n      style=3D&quot;FONT-STYLE: italic&quot;&gt;Punyakalams.
