You don&#39;t have to explicitly try to extinguish it. \n\nDoi=\r\nng homam in US or other cold countries, can be tricky. Firstly I suggest us=\r\ning copra as it doesn&#39;t produce much smoke. Secondly, after you&#39;re comforta=\r\nble with the homam content and fire management, you will be able to optimiz=\r\ne on the copra usage and reduce the smoke further. Using camphor can also p=\r\nroduce much smoke, so use it sparingly. Ensure, you raise the window&#39;s a bi=\r\nt, so that there&#39;s circulation in the house. However, please ensure that wi=\r\nnd is not blowing in the direction of smoke alarm, as this would cause it t=\r\no raise the alarm. For example, once I performed Ganesha Homam with windows=\r\n close as it was very cold outside, by the end of it the room got stuffier,=\r\n and when I opened the windows a bit in both the rooms, the wind caused all=\r\n the smoke in one direction, passing the smoke alarm causing it to go off! =\r\n\n\nOnce the homam is over, you can go ahead and place the kundam in the balc=\r\nony, provided there&#39;s no fire in it. So, please wait the fire to die and th=\r\nen move it outside, as we don&#39;t want to attract any attention. People in we=\r\nstern continent are not aware of fire rituals, and can freak out on seeing =\r\nfire. So. when you perform homam in the night, please ensure some light is =\r\non, otherwise if the lights are off, then one can see the flames from outsi=\r\nde the apartment, causing some people to call the fire department. We certa=\r\ninly dont want to get into such a situation!\n\nToo much of clarified butter =\r\n(ghee) can also cause too much smoke. The ghee has to be poured the right a=\r\nmount. It would also help, if you could clean up the homa kundam so that yo=\r\nu start empty. This also reduces smoke. Also proficiency in estimating the =\r\namount of ghee for a size of copra to keep the fire going (including turnin=\r\ng at the right moment) all helps reducing the residual smoke effect. \n\nSo, =\r\nwith more practice you will get a better idea on all the above parameters. =\r\nOthers may add their experience. If you have any more questions, please fee=\r\nl free to ask.\n\nFinally, I would like to mention, that the smoke from the h=\r\noma kundam is very therapeutic in nature and offers a lot of benefits. See =\r\nmy other mail on it.\n\nHope this helps.\nRegards\nNarayan \n\n\n"}}
