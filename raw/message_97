I am guessing your name from the email ID. If I am addressing you \nincorrectly, I am sorry.\n\n&gt;&gt; Many thanks for both replies which give a slightly\n&gt;&gt; differing perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not a slight but a a huge difference whether you consider shakti\n&gt; as providing liberation from the fetters (as in the agamas) or as\n&gt; being the cause and embodiment of ahamkara, i.e. avidya and delusion.\n&gt; (as in vedanta) To be exact it is an 100% percent opposite view.\n\nThe Shakti that binds one also liberates one. She is the one who puts a veil \nand she is the one who removes it. Thus, the vedantic view is not &quot;100% \nopposite&quot;, but it actually encompasses the view you mention and captures \nadditional aspects of Shakti ignored in the view you mention.\n\nThough She is referred to as &quot;vidya avidya swarupini&quot; (embodiment of all \nknowledge and ignorance), one may be comfortable worshipping certain aspects \nof Her and ignore others. Agamas are selective and offer a limited picture \nfor practical utility, while vedanta is comprehensive and offers the big \npicture.\n\nI maintain that what you referred to as &quot;vedanta viewpoint&quot;, i.e. the \nteachings of maharshis, is actually the big picture that covers the essence \nof everything. Because it is very complex to understand and appreciate, some \ngreat teachers have taken limited aspects of the big picture and elaborated \nthem so that more people can understand and appreciate it and make progress.\n\nThus, I suggest that seemingly different viewpoints of different religious \ntraditions originated from the same teachings of maharshis.\n\nInstead of approaching these view points with a &quot;this OR that&quot; attitude, I \nsuggest approaching them with a &quot;this AND that&quot; attitude. The teachings of \nmaharshis are the key in synthesizing everything.\n\nIf you are convinced that the teachings of vedanta and the teachings of \naagamas are totally different and that there is no commonality, then we can \nrespectfully agree to disagree.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message 2 ----- \nFrom: &quot;mahahradanatha&quot; &lt;mahahradanatha@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, July 12, 2007 12:25 PM\nSubject: [sivacharya] On Shakti and Brahman (Re: On Adwaitism...)\n\n\n&gt; --- In sivacharya@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimha and Mahahradanatha,\n&gt;&gt; Many thanks for both replies which give a slightly\n&gt;&gt; differing perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not a slight but a a huge difference whether you consider shakti\n&gt; as providing liberation from the fetters (as in the agamas) or as\n&gt; being the cause and embodiment of ahamkara, i.e. avidya and delusion.\n&gt; (as in vedanta) To be exact it is an 100% percent opposite view.\n&gt; But too realise this is maybe also only possible when the Ahamkara is\n&gt; absent and  the blessing of anugraha shakti and shiva present in the\n&gt; jiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; You can get futther insight into the basics of shaiva darshana here:\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.bhagavadgitausa.com/primer_in_saiva_siddhanta.htm\n\n----- Original Message 1 ----- \nFrom: &quot;mahahradanatha&quot; &lt;mahahradanatha@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, July 12, 2007 6:04 AM\nSubject: [sivacharya] On Shakti and Brahman (Re: On Adwaitism...)\n\n\n&gt;I think it is necessary to remark that this exposition of yours is\n&gt; based on the vedanta philosophy and only about 10% of all shaivas are\n&gt; vedantins, the overwhelming majority has been and is following the\n&gt; authority of the agama which differs considerably from the vedanta\n&gt; viewpoint.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the agamas shakti is carrying out  fivefold activity of shiva and\n&gt; as the actor cannot be discerned from the act shakti is therefore non\n&gt; differnt from shiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; The cause of maya (delusion) is avidya, (lack of knowledge) the cause\n&gt; of avidya is ahamkara (ego).\n&gt;\n&gt; In the Agama Shakti is not the cause of maya or duality nor is shiva\n&gt; it is a natural law that gives rise to ahamkara and avidya,\n&gt; attachment aversion etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; If out of his fivefold activity he  decides to veil his nature,\n&gt; shakti appears as if she is deluding, if shiva decides to unveil his\n&gt; nature this act  appears in a form of shakti bestowing  his grace\n&gt; and  knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; These rhytmic acts of unveiling and veiling his nature are a natural\n&gt; phenomena like our heartbeat or breath, symbolised by the sound of\n&gt; his damaru.\n&gt;\n&gt; That is why one needs only to return to ones own nature,and be\n&gt; content, one cannot add or subtract anything from what is and all\n&gt; that exists verily is only shiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; Following a natural cause delusion apears in the mind and will fall\n&gt; of the mind on its own accord by  that shakti (act) of grace of\n&gt; shiva, (the actor and the act being one as said before)\n&gt;\n&gt; Qualification to realise the union of Shiva Shakti  in  this way (of\n&gt; the agama) is not reached by ones own effort it will appear by the\n&gt; act of the shakti alone in the field of consciousness no human effort\n&gt; (of the ahamkara) whatsoever can generate it on the contrary.\n\n\n"}}
