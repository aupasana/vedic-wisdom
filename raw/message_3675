As a result he nevertheless decided, in order\nto escape such =\r\ntroubles in future, to withdraw to a windowless underground\nvault under the=\r\n thousand-pillared hall,known as the Patala Lingam (patala =3D\nsnakes cave,=\r\n underworld, a kind of hell). There was a Shiva lingam, behind\nwhich he sat=\r\n down,leaning his back against the wall. The cellar was never\nused or visit=\r\ned and therefore never cleaned. The rays of the sun never\npenetrated here. =\r\nIt was also damp and overrun with vermin such as woodlice,\nants, bees and w=\r\nasps. Despite being bitten by mosquitoes Ramana sat unmoved\nin yoga posture=\r\n with legs crossed, impervious to the world. His thighs,\nwhere they met the=\r\n ground, were soon covered with ulcers, from which blood\nand pus oozed. The=\r\n scars were to remain visible for the rest of his life.\n\nHere the children =\r\nleft him in peace. He reported, =E2=80=9CChildren used to run\nafter me, and=\r\n when I hid myself in Patala Lingam, from the outside they\nwould pelt me wi=\r\nth stones and potsherds, but none of it reached me as I used\nto sit in the =\r\nsouth east corner. The urchins never dared to come in because\nof the extrem=\r\ne darkness that prevailed\nin the pit, the broken steps of which could not e=\r\nven be seen from the\nsurface.=E2=80=9D\n\nA pious woman named Ratnammal found=\r\n him there, she spoke to him and brought\nhim something to eat. She urgently=\r\n begged him to leave the place and come to\nstay at her home. But the young =\r\nSwami made no reply, either through words or\ngestures. She laid a\nclean pie=\r\nce of cloth beside him and bade him to use it as a bed or to sit on\nto keep=\r\n at least some of the vermin away, but he took no notice and did not\neven t=\r\nouch it. He also made no effort to obtain any food. People therefore\nused t=\r\no place food in his mouth, but he was not aware of it. When later he\nwas as=\r\nked if he had any food\nduring the time of his stay in the vault, he answere=\r\nd, =E2=80=9CFood was forthcoming\n=E2=80=93 milk, fruits =E2=80=93 but whoev=\r\ner thought of food?=E2=80=9D Sri Ramana neither spoke nor\nmoved. People who=\r\n saw him like this thought he was practising an intense\nkind of spiritual e=\r\nxercise\n(tapas).\n\nBecause he was silent, people were of the opinion that he=\r\n had taken a vow of\nsilence (mauna). But for him all this was no spiritual =\r\nexercise at all, it\nwas merely something that happened to him, =E2=80=9CI h=\r\nave never done any sadhana. I\ndid not even know what sadhana was. Only long=\r\n afterwards I came to know what\nsadhana was and how many different kinds of=\r\n it there were. Only if there was\na goal to attain, I should have made sadh=\r\nana to attain that goal.There was\nnothing which I wanted to obtain. I am no=\r\nw sitting with my eyes open. I was\nthen sitting with my eyes closed. That w=\r\nas all\nthe difference. I was not doing any sadhana even then. As I sat with=\r\n my eyes\nclosed, people said I was in samadhi. As I was not talking,they sa=\r\nid I was\nin mauna. The fact is, I did nothing. Some Higher Power took hold =\r\nof me and\nI was entirely in Its hand.=E2=80=9D\n\n\nThere is little or no info=\r\nrmation about how long Ramana stayed in samadhi in\nthe Patala Lingam. It wa=\r\ns probably several weeks. One Venkatachala Mudali, a\nvisitor to the temple,=\r\n finally brought him out of there, after Seshadri had\ndrawn his attention t=\r\no the alarming bodily condition of the young\nSwami. Venkatachala\nMudali rep=\r\norts,=E2=80=9COne day, going near the thousand-pillared hall, I found a\ngro=\r\nup of boys, mostly Moslems, hurling stones in the direction of the pit.\nEnr=\r\naged at the sight I seized a twig, and ran towards the young scamps who\nfle=\r\nd promptly. Suddenly from the dark recesses of the hall there issued\nforth =\r\nthe figure of Seshadri. I was taken aback, but, soon recovering\nmyself, enq=\r\nuired of the Swami if the stones pelted by the boys had hurt him.\n=E2=80=98=\r\nOh no,=E2=80=99 replied the Swami, =E2=80=98but go and see the Chinnaswami =\r\nthere=E2=80=99, pointed\ntowards the pit, and went away. Proceeding inside, =\r\nI could make out nothing\nfor a while, as I was coming from the glare into t=\r\nhe darkness.In a few\nminutes, the faint outlines of a young face became dis=\r\ncernible in that pit.\nSomewhat frightened, I went out to the adjoining flow=\r\ner-garden where a sadhu\nwas working with his disciples.Mentioning the facts=\r\n to them I took some of\nthem with me. Even then the youthful figure sat mot=\r\nionless and with closed\neyes, despite the noise of our footsteps. Then we l=\r\nifted the Swami from the\npit, carried him from the hall up a flight of step=\r\ns and deposited him in\nfront of a shrine of Subrahmanya. The Swami still re=\r\nmained unconscious, his\neyes closed; evidently he was in deep samadhi.\n\nWe =\r\nnoted the large number of sores on the nether side of his thighs and\nlegs, =\r\nwith blood and pus flowing from some of them, and wondered how any one\ncoul=\r\nd remain unconscious of the body amidst such torture. Regarding it as\nirrev=\r\nerence, nay impertinence,to make any further noise in such presence, we\nbow=\r\ned and came away.=E2=80=9D\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography b=\r\ny Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00032556528ef51f98047f268e9f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;One day, while Ramana was sitti=\r\nng absorbed in meditation in the thousand-pillared hall, he was pelted with=\r\n stones from behind,which, fortunately, did not hit him.
