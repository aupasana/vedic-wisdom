It discusses the various styles of chanting among sadhus, and =\r\ndescribes the differences in the alphabets of the differing languages of In=\r\ndia . Then it details the Sadhana of the Chandi: different ways of chanting=\r\n for different purposes. Ultimately it defines many of the Chandi Samputs, =\r\nand describes the siddhis for which each would be employed.\nIt&#39;s a small bo=\r\nok, a simple book, but I think it is very important for students of Sanskri=\r\nt. \n\n\nOther books from the same authors are also very good\nTheir Chandi Paa=\r\nth book is very meticulously written with a good process to read the Chandi=\r\n Paath.\n\nIf there are other books please share here too.\n\nBest Regards\nMite=\r\nsh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All\n&gt; \n&gt; Can anyone suggest a good Sanskrit edition of the=\r\n Devi Mahatmyam?\n&gt; \n&gt; The current book that I have is by Swami Jagishwarana=\r\nnda (Ram Krishna Math) and it does not have any of the samputikarana proced=\r\nure as mentioned by Narasimha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Any suggestion for good translations of=\r\n the Chandi Paath in English would also be appreciated.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for =\r\nyour help.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ______________________________=\r\n__\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

The en=\r\ntire prathama charitra is \n&gt; enclosed with Mahakali&#39;s beeja &quot;aim&quot;. The enti=\r\nre madhyama charitra is \n&gt; enclosed with Mahalakshmi&#39; s beeja &quot;hreem&quot;. The =\r\nentire uttara charitra is \n&gt; enclosed with Mahasaraswati&#39; s beeja &quot;kleem&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to enclose any mantra with a beeja, the best way is to say=\r\n &quot;om \n&gt; beeja&quot; at the beginning and &quot;beeja om&quot; at the end. For example, you=\r\n can read \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama stotram or Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama =\r\nstotram with \n&gt; &quot;om shriim&quot; at the start of &quot;shriim om&quot; at the end of each =\r\nverse, for \n&gt; prosperity. You can read Narasimha&#39;s mantra with &quot;om kshroum&quot;=\r\n at the \n&gt; beginning and &quot;kshroum om&quot; at the end for removal of poisons (ma=\r\nterial and \n&gt; subtle). You can add &quot;om kliim&quot; and &quot;kliim om&quot; (at start/end)=\r\n to several \n&gt; mantras, including Gayatri mantra, to overcome desires.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n You can note that each chapter in Chandipath is also enclosed with plain O=\r\nm. \n&gt; You get &quot;om RShiruvaaca&quot; at the beginning and there is an &quot;om&quot; at the=\r\n end of \n&gt; the chapter. Placing plain Om at the beginning and end of a mant=\r\nra is the \n&gt; simplest samputikarana. It is used for all the 13 chapters.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When you do Chandipath, it is actually fine to =\r\nuse the 3 beejas (aim, hreem, \n&gt; kleem) to do samputikarana of *each verse*=\r\n in the respective chapters. For \n&gt; example, first chapter will go as\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&quot;om aim RShiruvaaca aim om\n&gt; om aim saavaarNiH suurya tanayo yo manuH kathy=\r\nate.aShTamaH\n&gt; nishaamaya tadutpattim vistaraat gadato mam aim om\n&gt; om aim =\r\nmahaa maayaanubhaavena yathaa manvantaraadhipaH\n&gt; sa babhuuva mahaabhaagaH =\r\nsaavarNistanayo raveH aim om...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Like this, add &quot;om aim&quot; at the beginn=\r\ning and &quot;aim om&quot; at the end of each \n&gt; verse in first chapter. For each ver=\r\nse in chapters 2, 3 and 4, add &quot;om \n&gt; hriim&quot; and &quot;hriim om&quot;. For each verse=\r\n in other 9 chapters, add &quot;om kliim&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;kliim om&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; \n&gt; The beeja aim is known as sristhi beeja or creative seed. It put=\r\ns life in \n&gt; material and subtle things. Note that Brahma is the rishi for =\r\nthe first part \n&gt; (pratha charitra).\n&gt; \n&gt; The beeja hriim is known as maaya=\r\na beeja or delusion seed. It gives mastery \n&gt; over the delusion of this uni=\r\nverse and helps one come out of maya. Note that \n&gt; Vishnu is the rishi for =\r\nthe middle part (madhyama charitra).\n&gt; \n&gt; The beeja kliim is known as kaama=\r\n beeja or desire seed. It helps overcome \n&gt; desires and cleanse one. Note t=\r\nhat Rudra is the rishi for the final part \n&gt; (uttara charitra).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=\r\nam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal=\r\n pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Sent: Thursday, April 02, 2009 1:14 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: a que=\r\nstion on Chandi Paath (Durga Saptashati)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes Prasad Bhai,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; as=\r\n you mentioned, it is a samputa and there are many instances where this \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; concept is used. let us see if we can get opinion of some members having =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; knowledge of this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste =\r\nUtpal ji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;    This is called &#39;samputam&#39; (Lit. meaning a covered bo=\r\nx or enclosing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with folded palms as in anjali).
