But, in my \n&gt; view, pournaanik=\r\na mantra by Veda Vyasa (neelaanjana samaabhaasam) is \n&gt; better for most peo=\r\nple without proficiency in Sanskrit.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as =\r\none cannot pay off a thousand dollar loan with a one dollar \n&gt; bill, simila=\r\nrly sufferings from serious karmas cannot be annulled with \n&gt; just one ritu=\r\nal. Any practice yields results with regularity. There are \n&gt; thousands of =\r\npeople now, who are doing a homam daily or weekly and \n&gt; experiencing the m=\r\naterial and spiritual benefits. A one-off homam may \n&gt; not do anything tang=\r\nible, but a homam done daily or weekly can do \n&gt; something. But it is good =\r\nbeginning and all the best!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; It is fashionable=\r\n today to look down upon rituals and give empty talks \n&gt; on high philosophy=\r\n.

Fire is a living representative of god on earth. It \n&gt; has a ve=\r\nry powerful influence on one&#39;s consciousness and accelerates the \n&gt; purging=\r\n of bad samskaras (through which planets give us troubles). There \n&gt; is no =\r\nneed to take someone&#39;s words for it - if one spends some time with \n&gt; fire =\r\non a regular basis, one will know this for oneself.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;         =\r\n           http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-a=\r\nstrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sunder Rangarajan&quot; \n&gt; &lt;sunder.rangarajan@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hello All,\n&gt; &gt; I am going through Shani Mahadasa from June-2001 w=\r\nhich I must admit \n&gt; &gt; has  been very difficult for me so far....To please =\r\nShanidev I am \n&gt; &gt; planning to do Shani Homam tomorrow.....It is a do-it-yo=\r\nurself homam \n&gt; &gt; which I found in Narsimha Raoji&#39;s site here-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Any feedback/suggestions?????\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Sunder Rangarajan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
