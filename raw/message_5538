This, I =\r\nknow is not his intent - And if it is some juvenile attempt on your part to=\r\n make me leave a vedic wisdom group it is a very sad attempt. There is no w=\r\nay, I can leave a vaidika group as I am vaidika brAhmaN. A vaidika brahmaN =\r\nis protected by the vedah if he sticks to the vedaH and nothing but the ved=\r\naH. Lack of knowledge on anything as well the knowledge that he has is any =\r\nbig deal - \n\nHis call to the Adi shakti in trikAla sandhya is (Ayatu varadA=\r\n devyakShram brahma saMhitam gAyatrIM ChandasAm mAtedam brahma jusasveme ..=\r\n.yadannAt kurute pApam tadannat pRuti mucchyate.. ojoHsi sahoss, balamasi, =\r\n... sarvamassi in times of trouble or happiness ... and finally brahmArpana=\r\nmastu)  \n\nI dont care too much for shaktas and tantras but they too are no =\r\nbig deal - if there is reason enough kids can learn it in a matter of a few=\r\n months. I have been riduculed by a person that quotes 12 years for Grammar=\r\n - I suggest he have a look at Whitney&#39;s Sanskrit Grammar or The Ashthadhya=\r\nyi - translated into English - or Sir Monier Williams dictionary. and Gramm=\r\nar all published in 1800s. And they are masterpieces and truly tell me that=\r\n Sir Monier Williams or Whitney or Max Muller sat down cross legged and stu=\r\ndied Sanskrit Grammar for 12 years. And now whether you can tell that kid o=\r\nf 8 or 18 you cannot do this - the next thing you know is the rascal create=\r\ns a new computer language foxing University professors and probably even ha=\r\nck into the professor&#39;s computer and have a big chat with all his friends. =\r\nLike what is happening with wiki leaks.

The four classes of ved=\r\na purohits were called by sri dasharatha for the ashwamedha yAga and after =\r\nthe yaj~ja, dasharatha handed over the the four quarters of his kingdom to =\r\nthe priests.
