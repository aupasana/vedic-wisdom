No vedic prayer has any \nother ultimate purpose. But different mantras take one on a different path \nto that realization. Even though a mountain may have a single cliff, there \nmay be different paths leading to it.\n\nSadhana with Sri Sooktam makes one experience wellness, prosperity and \nhappiness and realize self through the happiness all around one.\n\nIn any case, there are hardly any people now who can make veda mantras work. \nIdeally, veda mantras are far more powerful than naama mantras, beeja \nmantras and shlokas. However, in this age, veda mantras also work similar to \nother mantras (for most of us anyway). After all, when people not knowing \nhow to shoot a gun have guns in their hands, they may use a gun like a \nstick. When faced with an enemy, one may beat up an enemy with the stick or \ngun in one&#39;s hand. To such a person, a gun and a stick may have no \ndifference. Of course, still one may feel more comfortable and confident \nholding a gun in hand.\n\nIMHO, the exact results attributed to each sooktam are irrelevant to you. \nJust pick the one you feel attracted to and read it with sincerity and \ndevotion. Accept whatever result god gives.\n\nAnswer to mail 2:\n\nThe first 15 riks are the main sooktam. The next riks are added later with \nthe results etc. For example, the 16th verse says that one who does homam \nwith ghee using the 15 riks gets prosperity. All those verses are not \nneeded. Repeating the 15 verses is sufficient. Some people add the &quot;om \nmahaadevyai cha vidmahe..&quot; from the end and make it 16 aahutis. That is what \nI suggest.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n\nMail 1:\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I googled and noted that Purusha Suktam verses are available in all the \n&gt; four vedas.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I searched about Sri Suktam, I could not get that kind of \n&gt; information. Is Sri Suktam available only in Rig Veda?\n&gt;\n&gt; Can any one advise me what would be the benefits of chanting each of the \n&gt; suktams? For example, I understand that those who desire material benefits \n&gt; will chant Sri Suktam. What about Purusha Suktam, Vishnu Suktam, Narayana \n&gt; Suktam, Rudram, Chamakam, etc etc?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Shankar\n\nMail 2:\n\n&gt; Namaste PVRji,\n&gt;\n&gt; In your Lakshmi Homam manual, you mentioned only the first 15 verses of \n&gt; Sri Suktam, while in parayana purpose, I note that there are 32 verses, as \n&gt; per books published by Sri Ramakrishna Mutt. In the audio CDs, I found \n&gt; that scholars have sung only the first 15 or 18 verses and rest of the \n&gt; verses are left out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is that only the first 15 verses are important. Can you please advise?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Shankar\n \n\n\n"}}
