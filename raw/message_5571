In fact, nobody can go through Veda completely in one\nlifetime. When Mah=\r\narshi Bharadwaja was trying to *read* and understand\nmore and more Vedic kn=\r\nowledge, he was told by Indra that reading more\nwill not help and he just n=\r\needed to meditate more time with Gayatri\nmantra, in order to understand Ved=\r\na.\n&gt;\n&gt; One cannot understand Veda intellectually by reading or thinking. Ve=\r\nda\nis beyond rational or emotional intelligence.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If anybody wants to understand Veda really, I suggest picking one\nver=\r\nse (perhaps associated with a rishi that one feels an attachment to)\nand me=\r\nditating with it all the time. If one&#39;s mind is always filled with\nthat ver=\r\nse, a day might come when the meaning of the verse *reveals*\nitself to one.=\r\n Veda can be &quot;understood&quot; only through &quot;revelation&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if one proper=\r\nly understands a *single* verse of Veda in one&#39;s\nlife, it is enough and one=\r\n&#39;s life is fruitful!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Restraint is shakti. One k=\r\nnowing when and how to use one&#39;s shakti is\ngiven higher shaktis by Nature. =\r\nOne not knowing when and how to use\none&#39;s shakti ends up wasting what one h=\r\nas and not getting more.\n&gt;\n&gt; When past rinas and conditioning make one pron=\r\ne to anger or hatred for\nsomeone, one tends to go with the flow of that con=\r\nditioning without\nrealizing that one is wasting one&#39;s shakti.

In fact, nobody can go through Veda=\r\n completely in one lifetime. When Maharshi Bharadwaja was trying to *read* =\r\nand understand more and more Vedic knowledge, he was told by Indra that rea=\r\nding more will not help and he just needed to meditate more time with Gayat=\r\nri mantra, in order to understand Veda.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; One cannot u=\r\nnderstand Veda intellectually by reading or thinking. Veda is beyond ration=\r\nal or emotional intelligence.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; If anybody wants to understand Veda reall=\r\ny, I suggest picking one verse (perhaps associated with a rishi that one fe=\r\nels an attachment to) and meditating with it all the time. If one&#39;s mind is=\r\n always filled with that verse, a day might come when the meaning of the ve=\r\nrse *reveals* itself to one. Veda can be &quot;understood&quot; only through &quot;revelat=\r\nion&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Even if one properly understands a *single* ve=\r\nrse of Veda in one&#39;s life, it is enough and one&#39;s life is fruitful!&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Restraint is shakti. =\r\nOne knowing when and how to use one&#39;s shakti is given higher shaktis by Nat=\r\nure. One not knowing when and how to use one&#39;s shakti ends up wasting what =\r\none has and not getting more.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; When past rinas and co=\r\nnditioning make one prone to anger or hatred for someone, one tends to go w=\r\nith the flow of that conditioning without realizing that one is wasting one=\r\n&#39;s shakti.
