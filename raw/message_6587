The atman is enti=\r\nrely opposed to action\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, note one fact. Long after becomin=\r\ng a sannyasin, Swami \n&gt; Sivananda travelled the world, wrote books, gave le=\r\nctures and founded \n&gt; Divine Life Society, among other &quot;actions&quot;! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If he established DLS with the expectation that it=\r\n becomes a success or \n&gt; 10,000 people join it or some such thing, then it =\r\nwould become an \n&gt; ignorant action, i.e. action with attachment. If he did =\r\nthe action \n&gt; completely ready for any outcome and without a sense of owner=\r\nship, and \n&gt; as an instrument of the divine will, then it is neither &quot;world=\r\nly&quot; nor \n&gt; binding nor ignorant. The problem is not &quot;actions&quot;, but actions =\r\nwith \n&gt; attachment and a sense of ownership, i.e. actions driven by the wil=\r\nl and \n&gt; agenda of a limited ego.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actions should not be spoken ill of =\r\nlike this. Detached action is a \n&gt; *sacred duty* of every being. Gods and r=\r\nishis came back again and again \n&gt; to earth to engage in detached action.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If &quot;the atman is entirely opposed to action&quot;, =\r\nthen why is atman (Self) \n&gt; even allowing action? Why doesn&#39;t it simply hal=\r\nt everything? Or, is all \n&gt; the action happening outside of atman? Is there=\r\n anything outside of \n&gt; atman at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some buddhist philosophies coine=\r\nd the term anatman (non-Self) to \n&gt; describe transient things. But, in Vedi=\r\nc philosophy, there is no \n&gt; anatman. All that is is atman (Self). Ocean is=\r\n permanent and still, but \n&gt; ripples that arise in it are transient and mov=\r\ning. But ripples are part \n&gt; of ocean only and you do not start labeling ri=\r\npples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman or Purusha or Shiva is the potential energ=\r\ny of this cosmos, while \n&gt; Maya or Prakriti or Shakti is the kinetic energy=\r\n of this cosmos. Shiva \n&gt; and Shakti are seen as different entities by some=\r\n people, but rishis \n&gt; have declared their oneness. Potential energy become=\r\ns kinetic energy and \n&gt; vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman is the still ocean and Maya =\r\nis the force (kinetic) that gives rise \n&gt; to moving ripples on the surface.=\r\n A ripple that exerts itself to move in \n&gt; a particular way keeps colliding=\r\n with the force and keeps moving hither \n&gt; and tither in a chaotic way for =\r\na very long time. A ripple that does not \n&gt; exert itself and moves smoothly=\r\n as dictated by the force will eventually \n&gt; grind to a halt and cease to e=\r\nxist as a ripple on the surface. It then \n&gt; becomes part of the still ocean=\r\n. If a ripple exerts itself to become \n&gt; still, it may even take longer to =\r\nbecome still. What prolongs a ripple \n&gt; is not movement but resisting the d=\r\nirection given by the force and \n&gt; exerting to move in a particular way (or=\r\n even exerting to become still). \n&gt; A ripple that surrenders to the force w=\r\nill ride the course and die down \n&gt; faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Contemplate the imagery I =\r\npresented above regarding Atman and Maya, \n&gt; ignorant/egoistic action and d=\r\netached action! It is very apt.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In not-so-dis=\r\ntant past, sannyasins remained in ashrams and isolated \n&gt; themselves from s=\r\nociety and did their sadhana. Swami Vivekananda started \n&gt; a new trend.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; A sannyasin renounces expectation of things from people stuck in \n&gt; trans=\r\nient material world and does not depend on anyone. But he may still \n&gt; *giv=\r\ne* basic material things to those hapless people stuck in transient \n&gt; mate=\r\nrial world! For example, Swami Vivekananda and his brother monks \n&gt; went to=\r\n places struck by plague, floods, droughts, cyclones etc and \n&gt; served peop=\r\nle. They provided food, medicines etc (instead of lecturing \n&gt; that body is=\r\n a transient illusion and one should stop worrying about its \n&gt; welfare!) a=\r\nnd also did construction work. They ignored the welfare of \n&gt; their own bod=\r\nies, put themselves at risk and overcame maya personally. \n&gt; But they serve=\r\nd those still stuck in maya without looking down upon them \n&gt; or their need=\r\ns or maya that trapped them! Those who wanted food got \n&gt; food, those who w=\r\nanted medicines got medicines and those who wanted \n&gt; books got books. Renu=\r\nnciation means you do not expect anything from \n&gt; anyone and accept whateve=\r\nr comes to you naturally. It does not \n&gt; necessarily mean rejecting or igno=\r\nring others. Overcoming maya does not \n&gt; require belittling maya or belittl=\r\ning those still stuck in maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trend started by Swami Vivekananda =\r\nwas continued by Swami Sivananda. \n&gt; For that reason, it is a bit weird to =\r\nsee him talking so ill of action! \n&gt; He was obviously trying to inspire a s=\r\npecific group of people for a \n&gt; specific body of work. These words are nei=\r\nther universal nor do they \n&gt; reflect his tremendous wisdom I have seen els=\r\newhere!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; All this intellectual discussion may =\r\nbe satisfying to some, but the \n&gt; quote from Swami Brahmanananda in the oth=\r\ner mail is very apt: &quot;You have \n&gt; been only hearing of all these spiritual =\r\nthings. Now realise them. You \n&gt; have done enough study and reasoning. Now =\r\ndo some spiritual practice. \n&gt; First take up that aspect of God which appea=\r\nls to you most. Follow your \n&gt; own path of Sadhana. When you realise God th=\r\nrough it, you will feel the \n&gt; joy of realising Him also in other aspects a=\r\nnd through other paths.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; According to Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda w=\r\nas a gopala who accompanied \n&gt; Lord Krishna in a previous life. His words a=\r\nre simple, pragmatic and \n&gt; powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want this forum to facilitate =\r\nexchange of Vedic knowledge (and I will \n&gt; also be contributing, though in =\r\nspurts). But I want more that this forum \n&gt; should inspire people to do sad=\r\nhana and find God. In the end, that is \n&gt; what matters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;     =\r\n               http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Ju=\r\nn 20, 2011 at 2:31 PM, Krishnendu wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;      Some may say: =C3=A2=C2=\r\n=80=C2=9CFrom. this it follows that it is not necessary for \n&gt; a knower eve=\r\nn to serve his preceptor or to perform tapas.=C3=A2=C2=80=C2=9D \n&gt; Househol=\r\nders who are afraid of begging for bread and are afraid of \n&gt; ridicule argu=\r\ne like this through their sharp intelligence.
