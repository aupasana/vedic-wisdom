Ever=\r\ny Sanskrit noun (including substantives, adjectives, pro-nouns, and numeral=\r\ns) has at least two distinct states prior to the formation of the nominativ=\r\ne case; viz. st, a root (dhAtu); 2ndly, a stem [prAtipadika] or [anga] *) f=\r\normed directly from the root or from a modification of the root, generally =\r\nby the addition of a suffix [pratyaya] which stem becomes a complete word [=\r\npada) by the addition of a case-ending ([vibhakttj+.\n&gt;\n&gt; [dhAtu] {+} suffix=\r\n [pratyaya or direct~&gt; a stem [prAtipadika] or [anga] {+} case-ending ([vib=\r\nhakttj ~&gt; complete word [pada\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; a. The root is of such importance in Sa=\r\nnskrit that it should be clearly defined before another step is taken.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nA root (dhdtv) is to language what the primitive elements are to\n&gt; chemistr=\r\ny ;\n&gt; it is that primitive part of a word which, being incapable of grammat=\r\nical decomposition, is supposed to contain the primary meaning antecedent t=\r\no any addition or modification.\n&gt; When a root has been developed in any way=\r\n by the addition of letters or syllables\n&gt; or by internal change it becomes=\r\n a stem, which again is subject to further development by the addition of l=\r\netters or syllables called case-endings or inflexions (vibhakti), whether n=\r\nominal or verbal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus [dAna] and [dadA] are stems (the former nominal,=\r\n the latter verbal) developed out of the root [da], but [dAna] and [dadA] a=\r\nre not fully developed until they have received terminations or inflexions,=\r\n when they become complete words ([pada]); thus [dAna-m] a gift.

You can just ignore the per=\r\nson whose writings you find offensive. It is fine if you want to argue with=\r\n him also. My only constraint is to engage in a scholarly way and as impers=\r\nonally and coolly as possible (e.g. see Ajit Krishnan&#39;s mails).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Ajit,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people put divine avataras on a ped=\r\nestal so that they need not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt to emulate them. Your logic on th=\r\ne other hand, seems to want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to bring them down simply to condemn them=\r\n, under the pretense of being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even-handed. Unfortunately, your logic =\r\nstinks of under-handedness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have in fact not seen any &quot;logic&quot; - I=\r\n have only seen &quot;views&quot; of a strongly opinionated person.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even when=\r\n Lord Krishna roamed earth, there were people who took pleasure in condemni=\r\nng him. Then, what to say of Shankara thousands of years after he left eart=\r\nh?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us take him as an ordinary puruSha. Anyone who has read ev=\r\nen a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; portion of his works will see a highly logical intellect. He is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely consistent and thorough in his writings.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You are ab=\r\nsolutely correct. He is the most prolific and significant scholar and spiri=\r\ntual writer of Kali yuga so far, though there may be some who disagree with=\r\n his philosophy. He commented on a crucial body of scriptures. He wrote man=\r\ny brilliantly composed prayers. He established mutts which are still giving=\r\n rise to great scholars and/or yogis. This is no ordinary man.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In f=\r\nact, world badly needs somebody like him again. Just as a pholosophy that e=\r\nmphasized renunciation and de-emphasized action was about to take over the =\r\nworld at the time of Shankara, which Shankara put brakes on, similarly I se=\r\ne that a pholosophy that emphasizes action and de-emphasizes renunciation i=\r\ns taking over the world now. Religious people see &quot;enemies&quot; in other religi=\r\nons or other sects in the same religion, but I see materialism as a serious=\r\n enemy for all religions at this point in history. Placed on a high pedesta=\r\nl by rational thinking and vogue intellectualism, this materialism threaten=\r\ns to swallow all religions in the coming generations, unless we put brakes =\r\non it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With omputer facilities - it is a likely that what peopl=\r\ne took 12\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years in Shankara&#39;s times can be learnt by kids in 3 mont=\r\nhs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, you will be able to provide examples of people whose sk=\r\nill can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rival a traditional 12-year-Pandita within 3 months? I truly =\r\nwish you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the best of luck.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Computers, internet and connectivi=\r\nty bring some advantages, but bring some disadvantages too. In any case, th=\r\ne above claim is laughable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I learnt Sanskrit when yo=\r\nung, when I was 9-11 years of age. By the age of 11, I had two BA degrees i=\r\nn Sanskrit (Sanskrita Bhasha Kovida and Sanskrita Bhasha Visharada), one of=\r\n them with distinction (i.e. above 80% score). I could write intelligent co=\r\nmmentary in Sanskrit on the works of Kalidasa, Bhasa, Bharavi etc. At 10, I=\r\n could compose poetry in classical Sanskrit metres like ancients did. When =\r\nI saw new words, I could instinctively come up with the etymology and I was=\r\n always correct. I could understand various slokas and prayers fully the ve=\r\nry first time I read/heard them. Sanskrit was almost like a mother tongue t=\r\no me by the time I was 11.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, I see children of this generation w=\r\nho are in 10-20 age group. I absolutely cannot see them amassing the kind o=\r\nf scholarship I did when I was 9-11 years, though they are as smart as I wa=\r\ns. They are computer savvy, but they do not learn anything in depth. They a=\r\nre good at context switching and multi-tasking, but they are bad at focusin=\r\ng on one thing and mastering it. They can work with ten windows on a comput=\r\ner or five devices in front of them at the same time, but they have a probl=\r\nem focusing on one thing for a long time. Computers and technology are help=\r\nful, but they also distract them...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In any case, the =\r\nkey to learning anything, especially Sanskrit, is discipline and focus. Com=\r\nputers can bring neither. All they can do is provide access to info. BTW, c=\r\nomputers and internet today mix good knowledge with junk and present them t=\r\nogether. There is a lot of junk information out there!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well-meaning=\r\n but overzealous people, whose credentials can never be verified, can self-=\r\npromote on the internet and create the toxic dish called pseudo-scholarship=\r\n by adding the spice of fancy speculation to their half-baked learning. It =\r\nmay be taken as pramaana by some people not knowing better. Computers and I=\r\nnternet come with their own risk..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste smartxpark=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lakShmi - the godess of weatlth and prosperity. The first part =\r\nis [lakSh] meaning objective . In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this one word is the truth of finan=\r\nce and human endeavour. And the entire science of management.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nbjective - first; Strategy to achieve the objective, Tactics to implement t=\r\nhe strategy- Operations to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; undertake activities according to some ope=\r\nrational plan. Each of these layers have objectives or [lakShya]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In short without [lakShya] lakShmi may bid you good bye. Related also is =\r\ntaking your own inventory and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not others. Successful busines take the=\r\nir own inventory very well and get rid of junk as soon as possible.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Actually, lakSh does not mean objective. The word lakShya means objective.=\r\n Without ya, lakSh only means &quot;to notice, to observe, to perceive&quot;. Moreove=\r\nr, lakShmI comes from &quot;lakShma[n]&quot;, which means a mark or token or symbol, =\r\ntypically of excellence or something good. Lakshmi is the giver of tokens a=\r\nnd symbols of excellence. Money, food, vehicles, kingdom, knowledge, braver=\r\ny, children etc are all symbols/tokens/marks of excellence and well-being. =\r\nLakshmi in her various forms (dhana lakShmI, dhaanya lakShmI, vaahana lakSh=\r\nmI, raajya lakShmI, vidyaa lakShmI, vikrama lakShmI, santaana lakShmI etc) =\r\nis the giver of these. THAT is the correct derivation of the name lakShmI a=\r\nnd not what you gave.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Because of your questionable understanding th=\r\nat Lakshmi shows business and money and because of your notions (conditioni=\r\nng) about the qualities a good businessman needs to have, you ended up comi=\r\nng up with a questionable etymology, where consonant &quot;m&quot; present in the wor=\r\nd has been ignored and consonant &quot;y&quot; has been added.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Why these ru=\r\nles are important - grammar is a boring subject - And if I were not\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n It depends. I never found Sanskrit grammar boring and was always excited b=\r\ny the consistency and logic in it, when I was young and learning it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; However, I will not try to excite anybody here about grammar. Spiritual s=\r\nadhana is more exciting and far more useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am som=\r\nehow reminded of a small story.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A couple of years back, we went to =\r\nNew York city to drop off a senior Indian priest who visited us for a coupl=\r\ne of months, at the New York airport. As there was still time for the fligh=\r\nt, we went to a small temple. A young priest was chanting Chandipath to an =\r\naudience of just one person in a nice voice. We were happy to hear it. The =\r\nsenior priest who was with us was in a 3-year mouna vratam (vow of silence)=\r\n then. BTW, he is about to finish the vratam and start talking again next m=\r\nonth. Anyway, he wrote on a paper and asked us to tell him about our daily =\r\nChandi homam. So we told him that I do a Chandi homam everyday. He asked if=\r\n I do the entire Saptashati. I said yes. He was surprised. To gauge my spee=\r\nd and judge how long it takes, he asked me to read a few verses. I was amus=\r\ned, but read a few verses. He complimented me saying my pronunciation was v=\r\nery good. The senior priest who was with us likes me very much and fondly c=\r\nalls me &quot;guruji&quot;. He likes telling people good things about me, even in my =\r\npresence. He wrote on the paper asking other people with us to tell the you=\r\nng priest about Guruji&#39;s (my) Sanskrit scholarship. So they told him I was =\r\na Sanskrit scholar. That young priest asked me what I studied and kept gett=\r\ning technical. I knew where it was going and kept answering tersely, trying=\r\n to end it. Finally, he started discussing Sanskrit grammar. I was not real=\r\nly interested. He was doing Chandipath before and then he got distracted in=\r\nto Sanskrit grammar! If he wanted to discuss (or just chant!) Chandipath or=\r\n discuss any spiritual matters, I would&#39;ve loved to spend some time with hi=\r\nm. If he wanted to leave those and discuss grammar instead, I had no intere=\r\nst. Moreover, it was clear to me that he did not have any questions per se =\r\nor any useful information for me and he simply wanted to show off his own s=\r\ncholarship and getting into my scholarship was a license for him to show of=\r\nf his scholarship! What happened later was exactly along those lines.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Uncomfortable as I was, one small thought came to me when the senior pri=\r\nest wrote something critical about the attitude of that young priest on our=\r\n way out. It takes just a split second for Her to change a person and remov=\r\ne a weakness, if and when She decides to do it! After all, I had been exact=\r\nly like that, wanting to show off my scholarship and various abilities, not=\r\n so long ago. Theoretical understanding of scriptures does not bring true d=\r\nispassion. Only when the scriptural knowledge is internalized and one exper=\r\niences the transientness of maayaa first-hand, does one start to develop tr=\r\nue dispassion. Even then, passion about this and that may return now and th=\r\nen. Why deplore an unhealthy fancy of someone else, when we ourselves had t=\r\nhat fancy before and when we ourselves have various other fancies even now?=\r\n Instead of feeling unhappy or disappointed, my mind was filled with compas=\r\nsion for that young priest as we came out.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My 2 cents of advice to =\r\nanyone interested in it is: Scholarship is good, but put it to a positive u=\r\nse. Do not show off to impress someone or for an ego trip. Use it to remove=\r\n confusion, use it to stop someone from creating confusion, and use it when=\r\n you feel there is a chance of serving a productive purpose. Otherwise, it =\r\nis better to keep quiet. However, when someone else is showing off or being=\r\n arrogant/egoistic, ignore as much as you can. Engage only when you are cle=\r\nar about why and how you are engaging.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyoti=\r\nsh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- Ajit K=\r\nrishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is reas=\r\non to evaluate the sha~gkara as human and not deva\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most people =\r\nput divine avataras on a pedestal so that they need not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attempt to em=\r\nulate them. Your logic on the other hand, seems to want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to bring them=\r\n down simply to condemn them, under the pretense of being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even-handed=\r\n. Unfortunately, your logic stinks of under-handedness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us =\r\ntake him as an ordinary puruSha. Anyone who has read even a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; portion o=\r\nf his works will see a highly logical intellect. He is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extremely cons=\r\nistent and thorough in his writings. Here, I find that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his writings d=\r\non&#39;t fit the &quot;old grammarian story&quot;, and yet, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writing itself (moh=\r\na-mudgara-stotram) is quite consistent. The most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; logical conclusions =\r\nare that either (a) he is not the author, and / or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (b) we&#39;ve forgotte=\r\nn the context. There are many possibilities, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based on his other w=\r\nritings, these are the most plausible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With omputer facilitie=\r\ns - it is a likely that what people took 12 years in Shankara&#39;s times can b=\r\ne learnt by kids in 3 months.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So, you will be able to provide e=\r\nxamples of people whose skill can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rival a traditional 12-year-Pandita=\r\n within 3 months? I truly wish you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the best of luck.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my=\r\n constitutional rights will be upheld in any court of law\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Adi s=\r\nhankara provided his teachings, and carefully pointed out the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adhikAr=\r\nii. You, who are not an adhikArii, fail to read his warning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; label, ov=\r\nerlook it when it is shown to you, and then somehow equate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his non-te=\r\naching to you as an infringement of your rights. Strange,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is more than obvious that pANiNi had no influence on Adi Shan=\r\nkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of things that are obvious to you, are laughable to =\r\nme. And, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do have some minuscule amount of skill with both the samsk=\r\nrit language\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Paninian grammar.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is likely to be m=\r\ny last post in this thread.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ati-ramaNiiye kAvye pishuno .anveSh=\r\nayati dUShaNAnyeva |\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ati-ramaNiiye vapuShi vraNameva hi makShikA-nika=\r\nraH ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An evil person spends his time looking for faults in a b=\r\neautiful composition,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as insects look for the [stench of] a sore=\r\n in a beautiful body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ajit\n\n\n"}}
