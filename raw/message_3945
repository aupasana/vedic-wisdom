I complim=\r\nent him for asking it and having the courage to ask it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Shiva in =\r\nGuru Gita tells to Devi Parvati --- &quot;There is no mukti without bukti&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Any good saint I have had a chance to read or listen or speak to,\n&gt; never =\r\nsays that &quot;Do Sadhana with spiritual expectations only&quot; In general I mean a=\r\nny type of Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donation, bh=\r\najan,satsang and many other types.\n&gt; \n&gt; They always try to increase further=\r\n the Shraddaha of a sadhak in things that captivates a Sadhaka&#39;s mind due t=\r\no his or her state of sanskars.\n&gt; \n&gt; They always try to help the Sadhak wal=\r\nk on the path that leads towards spirituality. They always wish well for th=\r\neir disciples and have good amount of patience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many Sadgurus take car=\r\ne of their disciples for many life times, helping and guiding in each life =\r\ntime.\n&gt; \n&gt; They always preach many things and show value for different type=\r\ns of sadhanas depending on their state, time, and type of disciple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fo=\r\nr householders always there are challanges and one should request God to lo=\r\nok into it and give guidance and help, whether it is food, house, marriage,=\r\n car, or any material issue. There is nothing wrong in doing this, even if =\r\nsadhana done for materialistic benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Today even those who have ren=\r\nounced householder life have to pray god to fulfill some of their material =\r\nneeds.\n&gt; \n&gt; We live in very difficult and challanging times and it appears =\r\nit is going to become more challenging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some material gain can at time=\r\ns make a person better or more balanced or be more prepared to do sadhana f=\r\nor spiritual benefits. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even during an eclipse many people do mantras =\r\netc to solve problems or improve material conditions, there is nothing wron=\r\ng about it. I have read messages in the past on this group suggesting nativ=\r\nes not to do it or it is wrong. These type of messages are not correct, it =\r\nonly confuses people. Time during the eclipse is very good for getting resu=\r\nlts for any sadhana done during that time. it is equally good for material =\r\nor spiritual type.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everyone has right to have a opinion and share thei=\r\nr views but one needs to also understand the influence aspect of those view=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are riders a=\r\nt the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges, enemies=\r\n etc.\n&gt; If it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not write it=\r\n.\n&gt; Are they wrong in writing that?\n&gt;  \n&gt; They write it to motivate people =\r\nto read them as one reads more times there is a possibility that may lead t=\r\no change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moving to original set of questions=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; Every one is born with accumulated sanskars out of which as a native=\r\n interacts with the world some of these accumulated or sanchit sanskars tak=\r\ne the form of prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskars give pleasure, pain=\r\n and challanges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh=\r\n sanskars are like a tree that bears fruit.\n&gt; \n&gt; All human beings are also =\r\nborn with another quality and that is known as will power. They say will po=\r\nwer can change destiny ...\n&gt; \n&gt; When one does sadhana like say Homaam or Ja=\r\npam. Many things happen\n&gt; at many levels, at times there is improvement in =\r\nmaterialistic situation, problems get solved or if the problems remain that=\r\n state of sadhaka becomes such that he or she pays less attention to the pr=\r\noblem or attaches less importance to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti sho=\r\nws the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadhana does increase will power and=\r\n makes one more tolerant and \n&gt; Sadhana also help in eliminating the sanchi=\r\nt sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your sanchit =\r\nsanskars will get crushed such that they can never germinate or fruitify in=\r\nto prarabdh sanskars.\n&gt; \n&gt; So yes doing sadhana can help one overcome many =\r\nthings at different levels and help one move in the right direction. At tim=\r\nes one moves faster or very slowly. The important thing is moving and if on=\r\ne falls down, than one should immediately get up.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are many ways =\r\nto improve and move faster towards spirtuality,\n&gt; Vimalanda is not just one=\r\n saint, there are many who have reached similar or higher or lower realizat=\r\nions adopting different methods and have written very good books too. Sprit=\r\nuality is much bigger, deeper and broader than what Vimalanada has describe=\r\nd in his books.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find it little cultish to just refer him all the tim=\r\ne in the group. Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please note =\r\nthat I have nothing against Him, I respect him as I respect other saints fr=\r\nom the bottom of my heart. I did spent money to get his books and plan to r=\r\nead in near future.\n&gt; \n&gt; I urge all the readers of this group to read more =\r\nbooks from different sects, different saints and try to get appropriate inf=\r\nluence. Get broader and deeper views as that helps forming a good base for =\r\nspirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance and remaining neutral in diffe=\r\nrent situations.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the line=\r\nage of Ramananda,\n&gt; Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christain saints=\r\n (The book of Mirdad) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism ha=\r\nd very deeper realizations and experiance. There are many sects in south in=\r\ndia too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajasthan, gujarat=\r\n and other states, all of them had great saints.\n&gt; \n&gt; Generally these saint=\r\ns never bothered to write or explain or were not able to explain. But some =\r\ndid write and a lot of good work is out there to explore along with doing s=\r\nadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; We live in times where there is very little guidance available=\r\n on the path of spirituality. So in these times we have to make up with rea=\r\nding good books written by saints of yestaryers and surrender more to god.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; There is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have many entry lev=\r\nel and confused situation :-) ....\n&gt; \n&gt; If you look at sikhism, the last sa=\r\ndguru dev from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru instead =\r\nof making anyone else take his seat.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Lahiri Mahashaya met a famoi=\r\nus saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous saint=\r\n&#39;s disciple were upset,\n&gt; at that the saint reminds them that to reach his =\r\nown spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya did it in =\r\none birth.\n&gt; His name slips my tongue, he was big and very strong lived in =\r\nwater many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They say that one is =\r\nnot able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at his samadhi man=\r\ndir.\n&gt; \n&gt; One must always try to broaden ones perspective, all of us have a=\r\n long long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I only have some more t=\r\nhings left so I may be done in some years, even that is an interesting situ=\r\nation as there is always a chance of falling down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even for Saint Bhar=\r\nathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevated but he also had some sanska=\r\nrs that forced him to take birth and enjoy first and than suffer due to pin=\r\ngala. He was already realized before his birth as the rajah.\n&gt; \n&gt; I did not=\r\n intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertantly did it I appolo=\r\ngize in advance, Narashima has written very well many times and of late has=\r\n written some good stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Raj=\r\nu,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It seems honest outburst.

It&#39;s like acting very=\r\n smart with God. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Insisted in his homam manual about the=\r\n mental attitude.
