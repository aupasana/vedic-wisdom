Ever since my childhood, primarily because of my upbrin=\r\nging, I have been trying and observing a lot of &quot;Good&quot; things. I have been =\r\nreading texts on spirituality and was a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda&#39;=\r\ns writings. I always found Kabir&#39;s following lines, as a best (and most com=\r\npact) commentary on the two prominent paths of spirituality: -\n\n\n&quot;Ek kahoon=\r\n to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&quot;Hai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat kabir vicha=\r\nree&quot;\n\n\ni.e.\n&quot;If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is contemplation&quot;\n&quot;L=\r\net it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation&quot;\n\n\nUntil last year, my =\r\nfaith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs. Last year made gave =\r\nme lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time to think. I have come up=\r\n with several doubts (just a few given below) about spirituality and God an=\r\nd Goodness, and I have started to feel getting drifted towards atheism (sus=\r\nprisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadashi, when am observing a fa=\r\nst). If someone can help me understand the problesm with my doubts, it woul=\r\nd be great help:-=C2=A0\n\n\n- Isn&#39;t &quot;Ishwar Paridhaan&quot; i.e. &quot;Ishwar yat karot=\r\ni shobhanam karoti&quot; same as stockholm syndrome?=C2=A0\n- Most people with go=\r\nod conduct I see these days are suffering and those who happily claim thems=\r\nelves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the supreme power&#39;s =\r\nrole in this. I know materialism is a different issue, but last year made m=\r\ne realize that materialistic troubles made me very weak spiritually too. So=\r\n, I dont see them to be connected somehow.\n- I do understand that in Kali Y=\r\nuga, the patience levels are low, and so called Godly correction of the wro=\r\nng doing, takes its own time. But doesn&#39;t that promotes the bad karma in it=\r\nself, specially in this yuga? And how long can one wait?\n- Suicide is consi=\r\ndered a greatest sin, as it is throwing away the best gift we get from the =\r\nlord. But, I am not sure that if people do it for fun. God presents a perso=\r\nn with tough situations in the name of testing times, and some day the limi=\r\nt is reached. Then isn&#39;t god accomplice in this so called crime.\n- In first=\r\n place, why does he need to test us?\n\n\nAs I said that all these question ma=\r\nke me feel that I am losing the faith in His goodness. All my spiritual pro=\r\ngress if any has been corrupted by these testing times. And no help came to=\r\n me(I could not figure out). And those who did offer, faced a lot of troubl=\r\nes themselves and are also suffering now. This is what makes me go mad abou=\r\nt it, as I am unable to bear this that I have passed my agony to someone.\n\n=\r\n\nDespite all these thoughts that have pre-occupied my mind for quite some t=\r\nime, I feel that I still survive a chance to get back to my faith in real t=\r\nerms and not driven by materialistic desire. This is the reason I am writin=\r\ng this mail. May be someone can make me see what I am missing here. Else, I=\r\n see myself getting totally crazy, insane and moving towards atheism and qu=\r\nit possibly committing the so called &quot;Sin&quot;.\n\n\nRegards,\nSri\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-412840787-1292604536=:86950\r\nContent-Type: text/html;
