He only is the Brahmin who has no\n&gt; sec=\r\nular employment. Secular employment is not for the Brahmin but for the\n&gt; ot=\r\nher castes. To the Brahmins I appeal, that they must work hard to raise\n&gt; t=\r\nhe Indian people by teaching them what they know, by giving out the culture=\r\n\n&gt; that they have accumulated for centuries. It is clearly the duty of the\n=\r\n&gt; Brahmins of India to remember what real Brahminhood is.

Whenever power is used =\r\nfor evil, it becomes diabolical; it\n&gt; must be used for good only. So this a=\r\nccumulated culture of ages of which the\n&gt; Brahmin has been the trustee, he =\r\nmust now give to the people at large, and\n&gt; it was because he did not give =\r\nit to the people that the Mohammedan invasion\n&gt; was possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was b=\r\necause he did not open this treasury to the people from the\n&gt; beginning, th=\r\nat for a thousand years we have been trodden under the heels of\n&gt; every one=\r\n who chose to come to India. It was through that we have become\n&gt; degraded,=\r\n and the first task must be to break open the cells that hide the\n&gt; wonderf=\r\nul treasures which our common ancestors accumulated; bring them out\n&gt; and g=\r\nive them to everybody and the Brahmin must be the first to do it. There\n&gt; i=\r\ns an old superstition in Bengal that if the cobra that bites, sucks out his=\r\n\n&gt; own poison from the patient, the man must survive. Well then, the Brahmi=\r\nn\n&gt; must suck out his own poison.\n&gt; \n&gt; To the non-Brahmin castes I say, wai=\r\nt, be not in a hurry.
