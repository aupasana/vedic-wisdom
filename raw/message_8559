Maybe now, may be ,later; but someday I will=A0=\r\nbe gone and you will be left here. you have learned quite a lot and you hav=\r\ne a lot left to learn. Never passup an opportunity to learn.&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Because it=\r\n is kali yuga there are no longer any Rishi ashrams here=A0on the physical =\r\nplane. But the Rishis are immortal=A0and they can travel anywhere they like=\r\n in the universe. This means that a Rishi might be moving amongst us, in Bo=\r\nmbay or anywhere else. of course no one would be able to recognize him; he =\r\nwould be in disguise. You would only be able to recognize him if you knew t=\r\nhe special signs on his body=A0 which distinguish him from ordinary human b=\r\neings. Very few humans knows these signs&quot;\n&gt; :::::::::::::::::::::\n&gt; &quot;Whatev=\r\ner you are destined to have you will get, beyond the shadow of a doubt. How=\r\n and when you get it depend on how well you can cultivate your mind. The fu=\r\nnction of Tantra and Aghora is to put the government of mind, senses and bo=\r\ndy into the proper order to avoid misery. Life minus misery for a prolonged=\r\n period produces satisfaction, which yields happiness; and when happiness i=\r\ns increased beyond all concievable limits and is sustained it becomes bliss=\r\n, what the Vedas called Ananda. Sadhana is=A0a means to this end. When Kund=\r\nalini awakens, if body, mind and spirit are in good working order bliss is =\r\ncertain.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Bliss is not something you have to create or accumulate; I=\r\nt arises spontaneously. Just let God decide what is best for you, and God w=\r\nill provide it accordingly. So even at those times when your will power is =\r\nweak and your mental control is poor, there is still nothing to worry about=\r\n. Always, always remember that the supreme method of mind control, the supr=\r\neme intoxication, is the perpetual repetition of the sweet name of God. Nev=\r\ner forget God and God will never forget you. And one day you will succeed&quot;\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
