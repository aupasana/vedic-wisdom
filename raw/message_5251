Inspite of\nthat Rama  killed all the demons. ***Success of great men depend\nsolely on their own capacities, and not on the means they get to\nuse***\n\n(i don&#39;t have the exact text with me now, but this is the closest\nversion available on the net, may be scholars on the forum will post\nan accurate version, I have also split up the lines to see the simple\ntranslation verbatim)\n\nMy additional 2c: If I could go back in time say -5000 years B.R\n(before Lord Raam) and tell the folks that one person would walk\nacross the country, cross the ocean, and defeat a powerful rakshasa\nwith just an army of monkeys, the listener would have laughed\n(presumably) in disbelief. Same is happening today, Many of us wonder\n(to some extent myself) as to how Kalki avatar, with just a horse and\nsword, is going to rid the world of all  anti-elements given that the\nworld is burgeoning rapidly in that direction.\n\nI guess the point of all this is, god even when apparently ni-hattha,\nis infinitely powerful.\n\nRegards.\n\n"}}
