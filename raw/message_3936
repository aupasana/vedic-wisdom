I have a few points to make in th=\r\nis regard.\n=C2=A0\nIMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or pe=\r\nople could be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counter curren=\r\nt even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.\n=C2=A0\nThis is absol=\r\nutely true. \n=C2=A0\nHowever, certain changes have happened in the world tha=\r\nt we live in, compared to the world that used to be=C2=A0even a 100=C2=A0to=\r\n=C2=A0150 years back. Consider the amount of exposure people have to subtle=\r\n sexual inneundoes in the form of televisions, average dressing, advertisem=\r\nents, books, pretty much anything and everything. This was not the case dur=\r\ning the times when people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa or Ramana Maharishi l=\r\nived. This is a clear sign of the Kali Yuga deepening. In such situations, =\r\neven souls who were very advanced sadhakas in past=C2=A0lives=C2=A0would fi=\r\nnd it a very, very difficult task to maintain brahmacharya (brahmacharya is=\r\n both physical and mental). This is how nature has designed things for this=\r\n age. Whereas the number of people=C2=A0wearinng the ochre robes and sittin=\r\ng in high pedastals and giving=C2=A0lectures on shastras=C2=A0have increase=\r\nd 5 fold in these last two decades, specially with revolution in communicat=\r\nion. The essence of the ochre is brahmachrya.\n One who cannot maintain that=\r\n should never wear that dress. Then why is this discrepency? Because, this =\r\nis Kali Yuga. Please note, I am not saying everyone who wears the dress of =\r\na sadhu is fake in this age, but many are.=C2=A0In such times nature will d=\r\necide to do a balancing act. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nWhile it is true that a large p=\r\nart of our lives are karmic reactions, but we do have alot of free will too=\r\n, still. One may get a bad guru due to his past karmas, but what about the =\r\nsoul who=C2=A0has become spiritual in this life for the first time, and has=\r\n no karmic links with any guru anywhere in=C2=A0past lives? Simple probabil=\r\nity says, such a soul will end up being deluded by a false personality rath=\r\ner than a genuine one in this age.=C2=A0Instead of being a karmic reaction,=\r\n that act would become the start of a new, complex and bad karmic cycle. An=\r\nd there could be many, many souls=C2=A0like this.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nI believe, a=\r\nnyone or anything, who helps to take a person towards God is a guru. Things=\r\n need not be personality driven. \n=C2=A0\nThe reason people this age flock t=\r\no gurus is because they feel they will get some benefit out of the same. In=\r\nstead if all the people who keep endlessly hunting for gurus, would spend t=\r\neh same time and energy in doing some sadhana, Nature Herself will guide th=\r\ne individual. Plus this reduces the risk of getting=C2=A0caught with some f=\r\nake.=C2=A0In past ages, if a person wore the dress of a guru and spoke like=\r\n a guru and acted like a guru, he was probably a genuine guru. Today, every=\r\nthing can be acting. I know of one specific case where a person posed as gu=\r\nru of sorts, had excellent communication skills, and=C2=A0could read people=\r\n&#39;s minds to some extent. If you were to talk to him, he would probably brin=\r\ng up a topic=C2=A0 or use a word or phrase or say something which you had b=\r\neen thinking about privately. He had some nice abilities. Naturally, 99 per=\r\ncent people who met him would end up getting overawed. Only later did some =\r\nof his disciples find out that he was sexual\n pervert. Thinking of this log=\r\nically, how would a person distinguish a fake from real in these circumstan=\r\nces? If you meet a person who speaks amazingly well, has some siddhis, appe=\r\nars quite=C2=A0knowledgeable, 9 out of 10 people would take such a person a=\r\ns genuine. That is because we have the tendency of juding a spiritual perso=\r\nn based on the externals - all these are externals - instead of how much re=\r\nal change has the person brought in us. BY change, one means detachment fro=\r\nm reactions and provocations of material life. If we put all this down to m=\r\nere karma and fate, I beg to disagree. That is a fatalistic attitude. There=\r\n is always some freewill. Not trying is never an option, at least as long a=\r\ns I have not become a real advaita gyani. Instead if one adopts the attitud=\r\ne that one will keep doing sadhana of any deity, there is better chance tha=\r\nt Nature/Deity will take the person to the right places and people to get g=\r\nuided as and wehn needed. The problem with\n this age is, people want short =\r\ncut remedies to problems, instead of doing sadhana themselves, and some non=\r\n genuine individuals misuse this tendency and fool people. \n=C2=A0\nIn this =\r\ncontext, I am reminded of two predictions that Sri Anandamayi Ma had given =\r\nto someone who knew her personally. Anandamayi Ma was considered a self rea=\r\nlized saint, who lives in Kasi died in early 80s. She had said, in the deca=\r\ndes to come, there will be &#39;gurus&#39; who will be like a snakes who eate his o=\r\nwn feces, in other words.\n=C2=A0\nSecond thing she mentioned was an imagery =\r\nof a hill, and from the top of the hill a boulder starts rolling. As it=C2=\r\n=A0rolls down=C2=A0it gain momentum and force and increases in size, and up=\r\nroots many huge and illustrous trees on the hill, one after the other, unti=\r\nll finally it comes and stops standstill=C2=A0infornt of a very small and f=\r\nrail tree. The big trees are the big names, and the small tree before which=\r\n the=C2=A0boulder stops=C2=A0is a common man.\n=C2=A0\nSomehow I feel, these =\r\ntwo examples have great signification for the decades to come.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Between me and You, there is onl=\r\ny me.\n\n\nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n--- On Mon, 8/3/10,=\r\n S &lt;tejomaya101@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: S &lt;tejomaya101@...&gt;\nSubject=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gurus of past, present and future\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\nDate: Monday, 8 March, 2010, 10:53 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\nNamaste Na=\r\nrasimha,\nI have to &#39;disagree&#39; with you here. The fact is that the uttama Gu=\r\nru appears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is =\r\na shortage of such people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is=\r\n a shortage of uttama Gurus. \n\nAgain it is nothing new to say that God must=\r\n be the Guru. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say - G=\r\nuru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen betw=\r\neen them. In the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the ph=\r\nysical being his Guru is not destined to succeed. \n\nEven today if a uttama =\r\nGuru is born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya and not an =\r\nadhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million def=\r\nects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the viewer.=\r\n What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem is=\r\n not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/sadhaka who is still subjec=\r\nt to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting on=\r\n him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limited p=\r\nersonalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited pers=\r\nonality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is wh=\r\ny the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.The =\r\nvakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. \n\nThe very fact that =\r\nvarious tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam and sishya lakshana=\r\nm is very revealing about how things have been for the past few 1000 years =\r\nat least.\n\nThe Guru as well as the devatha are never external. Our entire s=\r\nadhana lies in realisation of this fact. \n\nPeople are led by their own karm=\r\na to false Gurus. There is little need to look at false Gurus and despair(m=\r\nay be not you, but as many people are wont to). This is like looking at a b=\r\nad husband or cheating wife and believing that all husbands or wives are li=\r\nke that.\n\nThere were very clear indications about someone like Nityananda( =\r\nwhom I dont condemn for the particular aspect of having been unable to over=\r\n come his human weakness) being not a fit Guru. \n\nIMHO a sadhaka needs to b=\r\ne an example of how things or people could be in this world and provide an =\r\ninspiration and a counter current even when things outside seem to be falli=\r\nng to bits.\n\nMy apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or caused any offen=\r\nse.I may have stated the obvious in many different ways or alluded to thing=\r\ns without addressing them. I do not say &#39;dont do any sadhana and keep searc=\r\nhing for a Guru for ever&#39;; but I do not agree with giving up without search=\r\ning. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will understand what I say. All corr=\r\nect things are Her grace and all nonsense that of my limited ago.\n\nRegards,=\r\n\n\nS\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But in the times to come, the idea of runn=\r\ning after a guru\n&gt; &gt; will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru an=\r\nd keep\n&gt; &gt; doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I know one person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrima=\r\nge visiting many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would =\r\nmeet a realized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritua=\r\nlly. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the =\r\nbeginning that he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just =\r\nsit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that perso=\r\nn wanted to go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to sa=\r\ny he did not find anyone like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; We indeed had spiritual=\r\n masters in the past who were capable of lifting people just like that. How=\r\never, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that=\r\n great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret=\r\n what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to=\r\n earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may =\r\nonly show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Why should it be so?\n&gt; \n&gt; The age of fake swamis and babas who are secret=\r\nly after name and money has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will =\r\npretend to be realized masters though they are not. They will be difficult =\r\nto discern. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadgur=\r\nu to whom one can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sad=\r\nguru, surrendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your li=\r\nfe would be made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved sp=\r\niritually in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a =\r\nfake guru blindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more f=\r\nake gurus than sadgurus, isn&#39;t it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a s=\r\npiritual journey? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to hi=\r\nm, it may be better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fir=\r\ne as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The old thinking will slowly be rep=\r\nlaced by a new model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogana=\r\nnda said is along the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforc=\r\ne the new approach.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that great m=\r\nasters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said th=\r\nat he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accompa=\r\nnied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this time=\r\n. How do we reconcile?\n&gt; \n&gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do any mir=\r\nacles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but he will=\r\n probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to god himself, =\r\nbut point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably inspire ma=\r\nny people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In th=\r\ne old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very dharmik and unselfish. It=\r\n made sense to put power completely and unconditionally in their hands. It =\r\nworked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas became rare and world sta=\r\nrted to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seekers of power, Nature adjus=\r\nted the course of humanity and most of the world is today based on the conc=\r\nept of democracy or switching to it slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; In spiritual matters also,=\r\n we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. =\r\nit made sense to place people&#39;s spiritual lives completely and unconditiona=\r\nlly in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare and world starts to be d=\r\nominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in =\r\nthe web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course of humanity and redefine r=\r\neligion and spiritual progress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit=\r\n from them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some scrip=\r\ntures and just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and=\r\n wait patiently.

I have a few points to make in this regard.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how thin=\r\ngs or people could be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counte=\r\nr current even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is absolutely true. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;However, certain changes have happened in the world that we live=\r\n in, compared to the world that used to be&nbsp;even a 100&nbsp;to&nbsp;150=\r\n years back. Consider the amount of exposure people have to subtle sexual i=\r\nnneundoes in the form of televisions, average dressing, advertisements, boo=\r\nks, pretty much anything and everything. This was not the case during the t=\r\nimes when people like Ramakrishna Paramhamsa or Ramana Maharishi lived. Thi=\r\ns is a clear sign of the Kali Yuga deepening. In such situations, even soul=\r\ns who were very advanced sadhakas in past&nbsp;lives&nbsp;would find it a v=\r\nery, very difficult task to maintain brahmacharya (brahmacharya is both phy=\r\nsical and mental). This is how nature has designed things for this age. Whe=\r\nreas the number of people&nbsp;wearinng the ochre robes and sitting in high=\r\n pedastals and giving&nbsp;lectures on shastras&nbsp;have increased 5 fold =\r\nin these last two decades, specially with revolution in communication. The\n=\r\n essence of the ochre is brahmachrya. One who cannot maintain that should n=\r\never wear that dress. Then why is this discrepency? Because, this is Kali Y=\r\nuga. Please note, I am not saying everyone who wears the dress of a sadhu i=\r\ns fake in this age, but many are.&nbsp;In such times nature will decide to =\r\ndo a balancing act. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While i=\r\nt is true that a large part of our lives are karmic reactions, but we do ha=\r\nve alot of free will too, still. One may get a bad guru due to his past kar=\r\nmas, but what about the soul who&nbsp;has become spiritual in this life for=\r\n the first time, and has no karmic links with any guru anywhere in&nbsp;pas=\r\nt lives? Simple probability says, such a soul will end up being deluded by =\r\na false personality rather than a genuine one in this age.&nbsp;Instead of =\r\nbeing a karmic reaction, that act would become the start of a new, complex =\r\nand bad karmic cycle. And there could be many, many souls&nbsp;like this.&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I believe, anyone or anything, who helps =\r\nto take a person towards God is a guru. Things need not be personality driv=\r\nen. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The reason people this age flock to gurus=\r\n is because they feel they will get some benefit out of the same. Instead i=\r\nf all the people who keep endlessly hunting for gurus, would spend teh same=\r\n time and energy in doing some sadhana, Nature Herself will guide the indiv=\r\nidual. Plus this reduces the risk of getting&nbsp;caught with some fake.&nb=\r\nsp;In past ages, if a person wore the dress of a guru and spoke like a guru=\r\n and acted like a guru, he was probably a genuine guru. Today, everything c=\r\nan be acting. I know of one specific case where a person posed as guru of s=\r\norts, had excellent communication skills, and&nbsp;could read people&#39;s mind=\r\ns to some extent. If you were to talk to him, he would probably bring up a =\r\ntopic&nbsp; or use a word or phrase or say something which you had been thi=\r\nnking about privately. He had some nice abilities. Naturally, 99 percent pe=\r\nople who met him would end up getting overawed. Only later did some of his =\r\ndisciples find out\n that he was sexual pervert. Thinking of this logically,=\r\n how would a person distinguish a fake from real in these circumstances? If=\r\n you meet a person who speaks amazingly well, has some siddhis, appears qui=\r\nte&nbsp;knowledgeable, 9 out of 10 people would take such a person as genui=\r\nne. That is because we have the tendency of juding a spiritual person based=\r\n on the externals - all these are externals - instead of how much real chan=\r\nge has the person brought in us. BY change, one means detachment from react=\r\nions and provocations of material life. If we put all this down to mere kar=\r\nma and fate, I beg to disagree. That is a fatalistic attitude. There is alw=\r\nays some freewill. Not trying is never an option, at least as long as I hav=\r\ne not become a real advaita gyani. Instead if one adopts the attitude that =\r\none will keep doing sadhana of any deity, there is better chance that Natur=\r\ne/Deity will take the person to the right places and people to get guided a=\r\ns and wehn\n needed. The problem with this age is, people want short cut rem=\r\nedies to problems, instead of doing sadhana themselves, and some non genuin=\r\ne individuals misuse this tendency and fool people. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In this context, I am reminded of two predictions that Sri Anandamay=\r\ni Ma had given to someone who knew her personally. Anandamayi Ma was consid=\r\nered a self realized saint, who lives in Kasi died in early 80s. She had sa=\r\nid, in the decades to come, there will be &#39;gurus&#39; who will be like a snakes=\r\n who eate his own feces, in other words.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Secon=\r\nd thing she mentioned was an imagery of a hill, and from the top of the hil=\r\nl a boulder starts rolling. As it&nbsp;rolls down&nbsp;it gain momentum and=\r\n force and increases in size, and uproots many huge and illustrous trees on=\r\n the hill, one after the other, untill finally it comes and stops standstil=\r\nl&nbsp;infornt of a very small and frail tree. The big trees are the big na=\r\nmes, and the small tree before which the&nbsp;boulder stops&nbsp;is a commo=\r\nn man.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Somehow I feel, these two examples have=\r\n great signification for the decades to come.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt=\r\n; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=\r\n=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&quot;Between me and You, there is only me.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n class=3DMsoNormal&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;Take=\r\n away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Mon, 8/3/10, S &lt;I&gt;&lt;tejomaya101@y=\r\nahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MAR=\r\nGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: S &lt;tejom=\r\naya101@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gurus of past, present =\r\nand future&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Monday, 8 March, 20=\r\n10, 10:53 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv971495412&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Namaste Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;I have to=\r\n &#39;disagree&#39; with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru appears to sadh=\r\nakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is a shortage of such=\r\n people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is a shortage of utt=\r\nama Gurus. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again it is nothing new to say that God must be the Guru=\r\n. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say - Guru, mantra =\r\nand devatha are one and there should be no difference seen between them. In=\r\n the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the physical being=\r\n his Guru is not destined to succeed. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even today if a uttama Guru i=\r\ns born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya and not an adhama=\r\n sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million defects i=\r\nn ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the viewer. What =\r\nto say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem is not w=\r\nith the Guru/Devatha, but\n with the viewer/sadhaka who is still subject to =\r\nhis/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting on him/=\r\nher. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limited person=\r\nalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited personali=\r\nty which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is why the=\r\n tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.The vakya=\r\n comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The very fact that=\r\n various tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam and sishya lakshan=\r\nam is very revealing about how things have been for the past few 1000 years=\r\n at least.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Guru as well as the devatha are never external. Our e=\r\nntire sadhana lies in realisation of this fact. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People are led by t=\r\nheir own karma to false Gurus. There is little need to look at false Gurus =\r\nand despair(may be not you, but as many people are wont to). This is like l=\r\nooking at a bad\n husband or cheating wife and believing that all husbands o=\r\nr wives are like that.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There were very clear indications about someo=\r\nne like Nityananda( whom I dont condemn for the particular aspect of having=\r\n been unable to over come his human weakness) being not a fit Guru. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or people could be in =\r\nthis world and provide an inspiration and a counter current even when thing=\r\ns outside seem to be falling to bits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My apologies if I have spoken =\r\nany nonsense or caused any offense.I may have stated the obvious in many di=\r\nfferent ways or alluded to things without addressing them. I do not say &#39;do=\r\nnt do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever&#39;; but I do not agr=\r\nee with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a good Guru will=\r\n understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and all nonsense t=\r\nhat of my limited ago.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;S&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&=\r\ngt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But in t=\r\nhe times to come, the idea of running after a guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; will change=\r\n. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; doing sadhan=\r\na and Nature will teach in the best possible way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I know o=\r\nne person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting=\r\n many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a real=\r\nized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was=\r\n an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning t=\r\nhat he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home=\r\n and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person\n wanted t=\r\no go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did n=\r\not find anyone like that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We indeed=\r\n had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting people just =\r\nlike that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogan=\r\nanda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming year=\r\ns. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may st=\r\nill descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of p=\r\nast. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands =\r\nof people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Why should it be so?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The age o=\r\nf fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (o=\r\nr will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters though=\r\n they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render f=\r\nutile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can\n completely surrend=\r\ner. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and fol=\r\nlowed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achie=\r\nve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the=\r\n same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when th=\r\nere are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn&#39;t it ad=\r\nvisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searchi=\r\nng for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers=\r\n to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model app=\r\nropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the sa=\r\nme lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that great m=\r\nasters will not descend to earth in future.\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said t=\r\nhat he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accomp=\r\nanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this tim=\r\ne. How do we reconcile?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will n=\r\not do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that=\r\n, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to =\r\ngod himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probab=\r\nly inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas wh=\r\no were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely an=\r\nd unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such=\r\n kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and s=\r\nelfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of=\r\n the world is today based on the\n concept of democracy or switching to it s=\r\nlowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmana=\r\ns who were very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. it made sense to place pe=\r\nople&#39;s spiritual lives completely and unconditionally in their hands. As su=\r\nch braahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and =\r\nselfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Natur=\r\ne may adjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritual pro=\r\ngress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit =\r\nfrom them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some script=\r\nures and just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and =\r\nwait patiently. It is a more fruitful method than to search for a sadguru w=\r\nho will lift you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n------------ ---------\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://Sara=\r\nswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- rajarshi =\r\nnandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give\n the benefit of doubt to Swami Nit=\r\nyananda.

The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, follow=\r\ning, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in t=\r\nhe\n midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousnes=\r\ns, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and=\r\n one falls in the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fe=\r\nll, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we inst=\r\nead discuss his teachings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not sudden=\r\nly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual=\r\n truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps an increase of dha=\r\nrma is not possible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast =\r\nin key places. We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. Her=\r\n ways are definitely inscrutable.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------\n -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish=\r\n Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals fo=\r\nr short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicas=\r\nt/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifil/&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil&lt;/A&gt; ms.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings:=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;=\r\n/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- kr=\r\nishna Kanth &lt;kritels@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Sri narasimha Garu,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For the l=\r\nast few\n days there are so many Sex scandals by the so called (famous and i=\r\nnfamous) spiritual Guru&#39;s like Nithyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan etc etc are=\r\n being exposed to the masses. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Is ther=\r\ne any relationship with these incidents with the establishment of the Dharm=\r\na as you keep saying in the upcoming years?
