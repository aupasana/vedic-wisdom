This is the first law of Karma.\n \nGiving a potentially life-altering astrological reading is an action that will have a reaction. Doing so for financial rewards, pre-determined (fee) or completely left to the client (dakshina), will further complicate the equation.\n \nBut, giving astrological readings, freely or for a fee (including &quot;recommended&quot; dakshina) or for a dakshina (i.e. totally voluntary), is not the only action we engage in. We engage in so many actions, some better and some worse.\n \nOne with bad vaasanaas (mental conditioning) engages in wrong actions or in correct actions with wrong attitude, and pays for it later. Who are we to tell people what to do? Can we convert the whole world into gods or make everyone god-realized? People will evolve spiritually at their own pace, determined by the the density of the kaarmic baggage they carry.\n \nIf you consider someone to be your sishya in Jyotish, you may tell the person what to do. With other people, you have to maintain respect and assert your views gently, delicately and inoffensively.\n \n*        *        * \n \nIn a different private thread, someone wrote the following to me yesterday. It may be relevant when we are discussing astrology and fees. I am not an emotional person, but this made my eyes wet. If I was there, I would&#39;ve washed the feet of this beggar and sprinkled the water on my head. This kind of pure thinking is so difficult to find now-a-days...\n \n&quot;Once when I was in Alandi, I heard two blind beggars talk inside the temple presmises. One of them said that he has recently been initiated by someone into the Varkari path and he can now sing Abhags (spiritual songs in Marathi) in the company of other initiates. He was very happy. The other beggar asked him, why don&#39;t you sing the abhangs when you beg. You will get more money, your singing is terrific. The first man replied that he cannot use songs of God for earning money, even if the money is coming through begging. God is beyond everything else. Begging is for my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not mix the two.\n \n&quot;When I heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also there) I was stunned. This coming from a begger! This created a strong impact on my mind.\n \n&quot;Such is the power of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the consciousness of all who go there.&quot;\n \nBTW, Krishna temple at Alandi, where Gyaneshwar Maharaj is believed to be still meditating in the underground chamber (I have no doubt about it), is one of the most spiritually charged places I have been to. Tiruvannamalai, Girnar, Mayapur and Dakshineshwar are some other places that are alive with spiritual energy.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
