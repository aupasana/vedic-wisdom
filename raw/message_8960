It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; usually takes me 15 minutes to complete 28 times recital silently and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without lip movement.

I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wonder whether this has anything to do with the Gayatri mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the topic of medidation, I close with an anecdote about Sri Seshadri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swamigal. Once at Ujjain, I saw a dog in samadhi (or so I think!) and\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was perfectly still for close to 25 minutes! not even a murmur of\n&gt; movement.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;One should not discuss the subject of meditation; one immerse oneself\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day Avathar Sri Seshadri Swamigal came to Echammal&#39;s house and\n&gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her, &quot;What pooja you are doing?&quot; She replied, &quot;I keep Ramana Bhagawan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; picture and yours and worship.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami asked her, &quot;How many days will you be doing Pooja? You should\n&gt; sit in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meditation.&quot; She wanted to know how to meditate? Swami demonstrated it\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her in the Samadhi from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. without any movement, like a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lifeless doll. Echammal and other ladies of the house having completed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their household tasks sat by His side and observed Swami.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At 4 o&#39;clock Swami opened His eyes and said, &quot;Did you see, Echammal?\n&gt; This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is how you have to do meditation.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Mon, Jan 7, 2013 at 3:01 PM, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; **\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Ajit,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for the explanations. Very interesting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This reminds me of an incident with a good friend of mine. There is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; individual I know, who had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra\n&gt; ever.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; He used to feel, as per his own confession, no special love or\n&gt; attraction\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin family, there was no\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introduced to this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One day while meditating on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of\n&gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of correct swara or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and soundlessly, the\n&gt; Savitur\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of the mantra, he\n&gt; felt/saw -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and I describe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous,\n&gt; pure,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outside\n&gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told\n&gt; me, was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to enter into that stream of Light above and see things from that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; perspective. But as long as there are impurities in the mind and\n&gt; body, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is not possible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating,\n&gt; self-assurance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; satwa leading to a deeper equanimity in mind and life is needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently, he also realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a\n&gt; person to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the spiritual planes above.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So I asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of\n&gt; Gayatri\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said it would have\n&gt; pulled him\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in and he would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half\n&gt; way is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Reading the explanation your provided below, that is :\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our\n&gt; (naH)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his\n&gt; light,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; we would not be able to distinguish different objects. This is\n&gt; explained in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the Aitaterya Upanishad &quot;The sun, having become eyesight, entered the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; eyes&quot;. He thus blesses all living beings.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; .. matches with the description that I had heard from my friend.

He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gayatri\n&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; It starts with a summary in 32 shlokas, followed by an introduction.\n&gt; He\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; then gives 4 explanations / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri,\n&gt; (2)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; narayana, (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I am not attempting a literal or scholarly translation ... I&#39;ll try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; summarize the main point, from a practical point of view. I&#39;ll start\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the first of the meditations, on Gayatri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The first meditation is the &quot;common&quot; understanding of the Gayatri\n&gt; mantra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with the Sun as the devata. This follows the famous verse from the\n&gt; Agastya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Smriti -- &quot;yo devaH savitA .asmAkam dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet\n&gt; tasya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the deva\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of the\n&gt; sun,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to\n&gt; meditate\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; upon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whatever is experienced is easy to meditate upon, and that which is\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone can meditate\n&gt; upon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gayatri mantra\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; always taken first.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; vareNyam = whatever we can ask / desire. Through all karmas and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. &quot;Savitaa&quot; is\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fruit of all karmas ... this is taught in the Chandogya Upanishad. [\n&gt; A long\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; explanation follows, which is omitted here ]. We meditate upon the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; splendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our\n&gt; (naH)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his\n&gt; light,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; we would not be able to distinguish different objects.

Very interesting.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This reminds me of an incident with a good friend o=\r\nf mine. There is an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; individual I know, who had never chan=\r\nted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He used to feel, as =\r\nper his own confession, no special love or attraction&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for=\r\n this mantra and being born in a non-brahmin family, there was no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; religious-cultural occasion where he was formally introduced to th=\r\nis&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; One day wh=\r\nile meditating on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; i=\r\nnspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of what&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of correct sw=\r\nara or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and s=\r\noundlessly, the Savitur&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra. Within less than =\r\n20-30 japas of the mantra, he felt/saw -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and I describe i=\r\nt as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous, pure,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nflood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outside our&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea,=\r\n he told me, was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to enter into that stream of Light above=\r\n and see things from that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perspective. But as long as the=\r\nre are impurities in the mind and body, it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is not possibl=\r\ne to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, s=\r\nelf-assurance of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satwa leading to a deeper equanimity in =\r\nmind and life is needed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Apparently, he=\r\n also realized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nwhich serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the spiritual planes above.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; So I asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Ga=\r\nyatri&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said =\r\nit would have pulled him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in and he would not have been ab=\r\nle to continue the spiritual practices&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which he was alrea=\r\ndy doing for some time, and leaving something half way is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n not good.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Reading th=\r\ne explanation your provided below, that is :&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) o=\r\nur (naH)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH).

He&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthen gives 4 explanations / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2)&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; narayana, (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not attempting a literal or scholarly translati=\r\non ... I&#39;ll try to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; summarize the main point, from a p=\r\nractical point of view. I&#39;ll start with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the first of =\r\nthe meditations, on Gayatri.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  ----&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The first meditation is the &quot;common&qu=\r\not; understanding of the Gayatri mantra,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with the Sun as =\r\nthe devata. This follows the famous verse from the Agastya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; Smriti -- &quot;yo devaH savitA  .asmAkam dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet=\r\n tasya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas=\r\n (bhargaH) of the deva&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH=\r\n). This tejas is the light of the sun,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which is experienc=\r\ned by all living beings, and is thus easy to meditate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; upo=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whatever is experienced is easy to m=\r\neditate upon, and that which is not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experienced can be di=\r\nfficult to meditate upon. Everyone can meditate upon&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the =\r\nlight of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gayatri mantra is&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; always taken first.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vareNya=\r\nm =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through all karmas and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. &quot;Savitaa&quo=\r\nt; is the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit of all karmas ... this is taught in the C=\r\nhandogya Upanishad. [ A long&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; explanation follows, which i=\r\ns omitted here ].  We meditate upon the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; splendor of the s=\r\nun, which is vareNyam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; We meditate upon=\r\n that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; we would not be able to distinguish different objects.
