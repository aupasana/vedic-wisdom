When I visited those places I=\r\n find it very hard to concentrate on God especially while taking bath in th=\r\ne sacred Ganges. I couldn&#39;t bear the scenes of dead bodies floating in the =\r\nriver. I am not a yogi to be able to see God even in the trash and garbage =\r\nand my mind is still attached to this physical world. I know how holy those=\r\n places are but for me cleanliness is very important. How can I change my t=\r\nhinking and get benefited from pilgrimages?\n\n\nRegards,\nPadmaja\n\n\n"}}
