It all bo=\r\nils down to\nthe amount of fire that is present in the homa kunda. If there =\r\nis good\namount of fire, even if you do not offer ghee, offering marmara , h=\r\navan\nsamagri etc will be easily consumed. But if the fire is small, then yo=\r\nu\ndo need to offer ghee drops to keep the fire alive.\n         There were d=\r\nays when I used about  8-10 coconut halves for 1\nchandi homam, ie started w=\r\nith 2 pieces of 1 coconut half, adding half\npiece of  coconut half for each=\r\n chapter and finally a piece for\npurnahuti. Now, I am able to manage 1 chan=\r\ndi homa with about 2-3 coconut\nhalves. Others out there might be able to do=\r\n with much less.  It also\ndepends on the coconut pieces itself, some pieces=\r\n burn slow and some\nfast, so the quantity you may need may vary.\n         M=\r\nost importantly I  suggest you follow an important advice of\nNarasimhaji. P=\r\nouring ghee drops around the corners of the coconut piece,\nmaking sure the =\r\npiece catches fire from all the corners. Doing this way,\nat the end of the =\r\nhoma, all the coconut pieces are completely burnt,\nalmost like powder.\n    =\r\n    So, my suggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings  at your\ndispos=\r\nal, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does not matter). \nMake sure =\r\nthe offerings that you put with each swaha (sloka) catch fire.\nHold your of=\r\nferings ie havan samagri, marmara, poha etc joining your\nring finger, middl=\r\ne finger and thumb. This way, you will be offering\ndecent amount with each =\r\nswaha.\n        Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, blac=\r\nk and\nwhite sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and used the\ncomb=\r\nination as offering.\n        I am sure within first few days of your homa, =\r\nyou will have very\ngood idea of how much ghee and other offerings you need =\r\nto make.\n\nAll the Best.\n\n\nRavi\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;DHEER=\r\nAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&lt;khosladheeraj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&gt; khosladheeraj@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji an=\r\nd others,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                               I want to do homam for chan=\r\ndi devi.I\n&gt; &gt; had arranged a copper tray in square shape.Almost 1 feet by 1=\r\n\n&gt; feet.\n&gt; &gt; So is it good measurement or not ? I also bought havan samagri=\r\n,\n&gt; dry\n&gt; &gt; coconuts etc.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                     Actually i want to st=\r\nart with short cut method\n&gt; &gt; so please advice me that ,how much ghee,havan=\r\n samagri, dry coconut\n&gt; &gt; etc are used in one havana, so that i will plan t=\r\nhese items\n&gt; &gt; accordingly.I have arranged 2 kg of havan samagri, 1 kg dry\n=\r\n&gt; coconuts\n&gt; &gt; etc..So how to divide this in ratio as per single day proces=\r\ns.How\n&gt; &gt; much ghee in grams per havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf note=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; on homam again and again but doing practical things r difficult\n&gt; and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; need much more focus and methodology.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                Although =\r\n by God grace and your encouragement to\n&gt; &gt; people for doing homams, even i=\r\n myself get transformed towards\n&gt; &gt; homam ,so thanks for that. But i need y=\r\nour step by step guidance\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; everything is  not included in your note=\r\ns( although its best notes\n&gt; &gt; on homam). Its my weakness actually.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;                In normal homams by priests in India ,they do swaha\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n with ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after they\n&gt; pour\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ghee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of ghee\n&gt; &gt; in =\r\nwater too. So is it correct way or not ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                If sing=\r\nle person is doing a homam then how to\n&gt; manage\n&gt; &gt; ahutis of ghee and sama=\r\ngri both and of course mantra mala or notes\n&gt; u\n&gt; &gt; provided ? Bcz in India=\r\n, normally full group or family do homams\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; priest only says mantra=\r\ns.So i think two people r must for homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;                I have spo=\r\non made of wood ,Is it ok or i have to\n&gt; buy\n&gt; &gt; of copper metal ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n                I am still unmarried so can i do with my mother\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nchandi homam ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;        Please provide me some beautiful answers =\r\nof these\n&gt; queries.And\n&gt; &gt; dont mind if my queries prove to be very simple =\r\nand illogical.But\n&gt; i\n&gt; &gt; have to start from basics .So just cooperate with=\r\n me as i love the\n&gt; &gt; work with perfection.In next mail i will ask some que=\r\nries on\n&gt; mantras\n&gt; &gt; in order to understand properly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; U r really s=\r\npreading vedic wisdom in true practical sense.
