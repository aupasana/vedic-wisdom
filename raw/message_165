Beejaksharas are \npronounced ending with &quot;m&quot; as well as &quot;ng&quot;.\n\nHowever, please note that the &quot;g&quot; should not be explicitly pronounced. The \npronunciation of &quot;ng&quot; in beejas &quot;gang&quot; or &quot;aing&quot; or &quot;hreeng&quot; etc is actually \nlike that of the letter &quot;n&quot; in the English word &quot;king&quot; or &quot;monkey&quot;. Though \nit is written as &quot;ng&quot;, the sound &quot;g&quot; is not actually pronounced. To \npronounce &quot;gang&quot; correctly, start to pronounce &quot;gang&quot; and stop *just before* \nyou pronounce the last letter &quot;g&quot;. Unless you are about to pronounce &quot;g&quot;, \nthe correct pronunciation of &quot;n&quot; is not possible. So think that you will \npronounce &quot;gang&quot;, but suppress &quot;g&quot; at the last second.\n\nMany Tantrikas use &quot;ng&quot; as the nasal at the end of most beejas, while others \nuse &quot;m&quot; as the nasal at the end of most beejas.\n\nNasals are of aakaasa tattwa (ether/space) and owned by Jupiter. The nasal \n&quot;ng&quot; is a combination of agni and aakaasa tattwas ruled by Mars and Jupiter \nand is akin to Guru-Mangala yoga given by them. The nasal &quot;m&quot; is a \ncombination of vaayu and aakaasa tattwas ruled by Saturn and Jupiter and is \nakin to Brahma yoga given by them. Both are correct, but work differently. \nDo whatever comes naturally to you or whatever your guru taught you!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 04, 2007 2:17 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Pronunciation error and/or corruption? Question \nabout Ganesha Mantra\n\n\n&gt; This email below and Narasimhaji&#39;s previous email re:Pronunciation\n&gt; errors brought up a question that I have had for quite some time now:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sushil-ji wrote the Ganesha mantra below as\n&gt; &quot;Om Gung Ganpataye Namah&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In other places, I have seen &quot;Om Gan Ganapathaye Namah&quot;, as well as\n&gt; &quot;Om Gam Ganapathaye Namah&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Will the learned folks kindly provide their guidance on what the right\n&gt; version is, and hopefully provide pronunciation tips as well?\n&gt;\n&gt; Many Thanks in advance!\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sushil Dikshit&quot;\n&gt; &lt;sushil.dikshit@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Om Gurave Namah\n&gt;&gt; Om Gung Ganpataye Namah\n&gt;&gt; Om Hare Rama Krishna\n&gt;&gt; Om Shleem Dhleem Jyotirbrahmaaya Namah\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Power of Mantra\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now many people in this group are taking interest in learning Vedic\n&gt;&gt; Astrology and in a very proper manner too. So it is right time to reveal\n&gt;&gt; the secret of learning Vedic Astrology. Astrology is divine science so\n&gt;&gt; you need blessings of your Guru, Lord Ganesh and other gods. I am\n&gt;&gt; suggesting you to recite the following mantras to recite one mala daily.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Om Gurave Namah\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Om Gang Ganpataye Namah\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are some more mantras but you will not have so much time for it so\n&gt;&gt; I am suggesting you only two.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Those who do not have any Mala (like Tulsi etc.), they may use &quot;Kar\n&gt;&gt; Mala&quot;. &quot;Kar&quot; means hand so you will use your hand to count the number\n&gt;&gt; Mantras.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You should use your right hand to count mantras. You should use your\n&gt;&gt; thumb for counting like in the picture given below,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Note :- You should avoid putting thumb on lines and tip of fingers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When you complete one cycle of ten, use your left hand and its thumb in\n&gt;&gt; the same manner to count one cycle. when you have completed the 10 cycle\n&gt;&gt; or 10 x 10 = 100 times (menas you have recited the Mantras 100 times\n&gt;&gt; till now) you would have completed the 10 points on left hand too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now remove thumb from left hand and count the balance 8 Mantras in the\n&gt;&gt; following manner.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now you one Mala of 108 Mantras is complete. So you do not need any type\n&gt;&gt; of mala to recite the mantras. Kar Mala is very very powerful too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Important :- After some months you will see the difference in your\n&gt;&gt; vision. There will be unbelievable changes in you learning capacity -\n&gt;&gt; UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE UNBELIEVABLE CAPACITY TO LEARN VEDIC\n&gt;&gt; ASTROLOGY. IT IS MY PROMISE.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; with regards\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; sushil dikshit\n\n\n"}}
