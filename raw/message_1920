However, Shiva teaches Parvati \nin Todala tantra that Maatangi is Rama. Can you give the full list of \nmapping as given in Munda maalaa tantra?\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, June 04, 2009 4:07 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Rama as God\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshiji,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As a corollary, can the path shown by Lord Rama be equated to the path of \n&gt;&gt; Dakshina Kali and that of Krishna as Vama Kali.\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, Krishna is equated to Kali, as per the Munda Mala Tantra. \n&gt; Krishna&#39;s beeja akshara is Kleem while Kali&#39;s beeja akshara is Kreem. \n&gt; Whereas, Rama is equated to Taaraa, the Raama Naama is called the Taaraka \n&gt; mantra. Taaraa means crossing and she is the one who helps us cross-over \n&gt; from the material plane to the spiritual plane. Raama also had to cross \n&gt; the ocean to get Sita. Esoterically, Raama is the soul, Lakshmana is the \n&gt; single-pointed concentration (lakshya-mana) and Sita is the Kundalini \n&gt; Shakti. Raavana who stands for our material desires steals Sita and takes \n&gt; her away to Lanka, stands for how our material desires makes the kundalini \n&gt; remain in the mooladhara. The beeja akshara of Mooladhaara is Lam, which \n&gt; is what Lanka is.\n&gt;\n&gt; Munda Maala tantra has other parallels (equating Das Mahaavidya & Das \n&gt; Avataara) too, some of which makes sense and some of them dont.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Narayan\n\n\n"}}
