It is just A SMALL\n STEP in overcoming one=\r\n&#39;s current limited identity.\n=C2=A0\nLet me give an analogy. One wanting to =\r\nmove from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n body-mind complex) to a huge=\r\n palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move i=\r\nnto it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays=\r\n in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of body experience=\r\ns due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risk=\r\ns. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one=\r\n can progress towards complete Self-realization without any out of body exp=\r\neriences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord R=\r\nama.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, one does not get something without wanting it and put=\r\nting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini =\r\nrise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one ma=\r\ny be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even=\r\n want it!) when it comes in this life.\n=C2=A0\nAs you do sadhana, try not to=\r\n fancy too many specific\n desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting=\r\n your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now=\r\n, arising from YOUR\n OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you w=\r\nhat you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For e=\r\nxample, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a ric=\r\nh but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray wh=\r\nole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but n=\r\not have any knowledge or money. In another \ncase, one may deeply desire to =\r\nact in a famous film. One may be reborn \nas a tiger or a dog and act in a f=\r\namous film, but not really enjoy that \nexperience. Basically, people keep g=\r\noing in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are =\r\n&quot;missing&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires a=\r\nn out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous kar=\r\nmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life=\r\n with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik =\r\nforce behind it).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n *\n=C2=A0\nKundalini rise is not nec=\r\nessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and=\r\n detachment.\n=C2=A0\nOnce I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to =\r\nfree it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to =\r\nsave it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nWe are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-=\r\nmind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nIf our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are inco=\r\nrrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete =\r\nrealization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind co=\r\nmplex, without being scared?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nKundalini rise =\r\nafter most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than\n Kundal=\r\nini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in =\r\none&#39;s system.\n=C2=A0\nWhen one transcends one problematic notion about who o=\r\nne is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciou=\r\nsness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notio=\r\nn &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex t=\r\nhat one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a gr=\r\neat scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a=\r\n hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy =\r\nthat he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s=\r\n self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can =\r\ncause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in i=\r\ngnorance and get stuck badly.\n=C2=A0\nAn awakened Kundalini in a system with=\r\n undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions=\r\n heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms o=\r\nf Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n weaknesses and im=\r\nprove your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment=\r\n is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is t=\r\nhe other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.\n=C2=A0\n\nD=\r\non&#39;t worry about \nwhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether =\r\nyou are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta=\r\n pashas) or \nnot. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are mak=\r\ning progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making p=\r\nrogress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness)=\r\n \nwill automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne word on surrendering to a personal deity. T=\r\nhough true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do=\r\n business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the =\r\nplain and bare fact.\n=C2=A0\n&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give i=\r\nt to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please pro=\r\ntect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you want an=\r\nd you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, dem=\r\nands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination=\r\n for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throw=\r\ns one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad =\r\nand accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascin=\r\nation and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n=C2=A0\nIf one w=\r\nithout true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a=\r\n Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal g=\r\nod. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is =\r\nnot about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued t=\r\no mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared.=\r\n Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s\n protection!=\r\n God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one=\r\n should run away from!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhether through the pat=\r\nh of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that a=\r\nll this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have=\r\n and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only=\r\n detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, disli=\r\nkes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy =\r\nconditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (=\r\nself-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n=C2=A0\nThe real key is=\r\n how light your conditioning is.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAs=\r\ntrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sast=\r\nry@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly=\r\n correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes=\r\n the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and =\r\nmanthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play h=\r\navoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=\r\n=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 b=\r\ne wiped off .

Constant ef=\r\nforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-b=\r\nody structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more =\r\nequanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2=\r\n - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self i=\r\ndentify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense =\r\nkind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is=\r\n very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also=\r\n open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of wh=\r\nich are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given hal=\r\nf a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold =\r\nof inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. H=\r\nence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n vital. 4 - While someday or o=\r\nther every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening an=\r\nd rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human =\r\npsychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal =\r\nwith various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an indi=\r\nvidual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to re=\r\nmain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, hig=\r\nh stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free ass=\r\ness of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing se=\r\nrious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are =\r\nthere, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such=\r\n a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to re=\r\nctify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing=\r\n more than an intelligent guess work.\n Sometimes it will have results, some=\r\ntimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind=\r\n in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore =\r\nsano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAma=\r\nbuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: =\r\nsunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kund=\r\nalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kunda=\r\nlini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doin=\r\ng a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someon=\r\ne who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini=\r\n since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of e=\r\nnergy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kunda=\r\nlini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We hav=\r\ne not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests norma=\r\nl)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we c=\r\nall mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwan=\r\nted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and resear=\r\nch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients a=\r\nre not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments fo=\r\nr deranged kundalini,\n we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly=\r\n waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling tha=\r\nt kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill hersel=\r\nf at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She fe=\r\nels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wond=\r\nered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pr=\r\nay to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suff=\r\nering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear =\r\nthis. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and fo=\r\nr others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is piti=\r\nable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situ=\r\nation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is =\r\nperhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini r=\r\nising bit to\n God&#39;s will.

It is just A SMALL\n STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dil=\r\napidated house (this\n body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) m=\r\nay first construct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLET=\r\nE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still unde=\r\nr construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise),=\r\n is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is=\r\n safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards com=\r\nplete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not m=\r\ny word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondl=\r\ny, one does not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient eff=\r\nort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous =\r\nlife and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now=\r\n. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it =\r\ncomes in this life.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too ma=\r\nny specific\n desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires=\r\n (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising fro=\r\nm YOUR\n OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want =\r\nLATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one m=\r\nay pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very si=\r\nck man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for =\r\nhealth. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any k=\r\nnowledge or money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_136206784661=\r\n9_141&quot;&gt;In another \ncase, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One=\r\n may be reborn \nas a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not reall=\r\ny enjoy that \nexperience. Basically, people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv548088472=\r\nyui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;keep going in circles through various lives=\r\n, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, comin=\r\ng back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given =\r\nby a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having i=\r\nt in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire dest=\r\nined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or pai=\r\nnful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it =\r\npanicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a =\r\ncertain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We =\r\nare like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind compl=\r\nex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If o=\r\nur ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrec=\r\nt and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete real=\r\nization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind comple=\r\nx, without being scared?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini=\r\n rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than\n =\r\nKundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still le=\r\nft in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion=\r\n about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper=\r\n in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcom=\r\nes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mi=\r\nnd complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv5480884=\r\n72yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv548088472userContent&quot;&gt;e=\r\n.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a =\r\ngreat soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X=\r\n or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundal=\r\nini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may =\r\nshow some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck\n badl=\r\ny.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditio=\r\nning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause se=\r\nrious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&quot;&gt;The best approach=\r\n I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sa=\r\ndhana, overcome your\n weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Aga=\r\nin, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life=\r\n/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment.=\r\n&lt;/span&gt; It is a negative attachment.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color=\r\n: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333px; background-color: transparent; font-s=\r\ntyle: normal; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; &quot; id=3D&quot;yiv5480884=\r\n72yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_155&quot;&gt;D&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_136=\r\n2067846619_141&quot;&gt;on&#39;t worry about \nwhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worr=\r\ny about whether you are able to\n resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and =\r\n8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \nnot. If your ability to resist them is increa=\r\nsing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you a=\r\nre still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (you=\r\nr self-awareness) \nwill automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (=\r\ntrue Self).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_136206784661=\r\n9_57&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_58&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(=\r\n0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; background-color: transparent; font-style: norma=\r\nl; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is hel=\r\npful, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though =\r\npeople may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I want X, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619=\r\n_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;I will pray t=\r\no you and &lt;/span&gt;please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I w=\r\nill pray to you and please\n protect\n me&quot; - all this is just a business deal=\r\n. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no=\r\n place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is los=\r\ning oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender =\r\nis accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or h=\r\nighly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender=\r\n is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (an=\r\nd during) Death.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one without true surrender and with many d=\r\nesires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be tra=\r\npped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want =\r\nto &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. =\r\nIf you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was tr=\r\nying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes =\r\none *run away* from God&#39;s\n protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a condi=\r\ntioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;y=\r\niv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and =\r\ndetachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytim=\r\ne. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to los=\r\ne everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning =\r\n(very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises=\r\n to meet True Self.

Constant efforts of purification of t=\r\nhe various elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler =\r\nwords this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-react=\r\niveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine K=\r\nundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata wi=\r\nth greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata t=\r\nhen takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti a=\r\nwakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body=\r\n to various other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nat=\r\nure while some of them are useless, and\n given half a chance can make use\n =\r\nof the\n individual\n for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness =\r\nin character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-su=\r\nddhi becomes even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will=\r\n have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all ma=\r\nladies of psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understoo=\r\nd by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It=\r\n is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects =\r\nus from various subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional enti=\r\nties, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventi=\r\nonal lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities=\r\n inside the mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all =\r\nthese are very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possib=\r\nle to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correct=\r\nly\n done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. M=\r\nany who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intellig=\r\nent guess work. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all thes=\r\ne to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as th=\r\ne ancient Greeks used to say - &lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv548088472st&quot;&gt;Mens sana in =\r\ncorpore sano.&lt;/span&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv class=3D&quot;yiv548088472MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yiv548088472Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(153,153,153)=\r\n;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv548088472Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot; class=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv548088472yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950 yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_136206784661=\r\n9_92&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;color: navy; font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; &quot; class=3D&quot;yiv54808=\r\n8472yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv548088472yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv=\r\n548088472yui_3_7_2_17_1362045432997_73 yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_13620678466=\r\n19_93&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;param b=\r\nhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_19_13=\r\n62067846619_95&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, couri=\r\ner, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv548088472yui_3_7_2_1=\r\n9_1362067846619_96&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman=\r\n&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px sol=\r\nid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px=\r\n solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv548088472hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;=\r\n&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 28 Febr=\r\nuary 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nb&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv548088=\r\n472&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv548088472ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dea=\r\nr all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent =\r\nexperience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, an=\r\nd have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had =\r\na spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involv=\r\ned out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of =\r\nIndian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started a=\r\nnd she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything =\r\nphysically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is d=\r\nue to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themsel=\r\nves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakeni=\r\nng- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream =\r\npsychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western=\r\n medicine, and as we have no treatments\n for deranged kundalini, we struggl=\r\ne to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experien=\r\nce with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibl=\r\ny wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering =\r\nfrom the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it i=\r\ns something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be=\r\n to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who mani=\r\nfests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either c=\r\nure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good=\r\n samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may no=\r\nt know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in ou=\r\nr sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is =\r\nwhy the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be =\r\nyour\n instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini rising bit to God&#39;s will. Om Dum =\r\nDurgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---657894450-123450966-1362125003=:38621--\r\n\n"}}
