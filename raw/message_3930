The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have a=\r\nll kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force t=\r\nhat can be used to change or move something karmically.\n\nSuppose you see so=\r\nmething or someone beautiful and the enemy of &quot;desire&quot; (one of shadripus - =\r\nsix internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuses =\r\nyou and the enemy of &quot;anger&quot; tries to attack your mind. How does your mind =\r\nfight back?\n\nJust as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind n=\r\needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the enem=\r\nies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts shak=\r\nti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on the =\r\nmind is negated.\n\nWhen you eat, you get physical energy. When you exercise,=\r\n that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Similarly,=\r\n when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats from th=\r\ne universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time in pat=\r\nterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), it s=\r\ntores that shakti in the right places in the mind.\n\nJust as physical energy=\r\n helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual energy hel=\r\nps you fight internal enemies who attack you.\n\nIf your surrender is perfect=\r\n and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas without c=\r\nommitting new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless leaf a=\r\nnd you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have a cond=\r\nitioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable to=\r\n committing NEW karmas, don&#39;t you think some energy is needed?\n\nDon&#39;t look =\r\nat spiritual shakti as something that enables you to do great deeds in the =\r\nworld. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude and in=\r\nappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something that =\r\nenables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome your own w=\r\neaknesses.\n\n* * *\n\n4. If you are living every second without any goals/agen=\r\ndas/ wishes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberated and t=\r\nhen your point is meaningful.\n\nBut, if you do have some some goals, some wi=\r\nshes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize that th=\r\nose wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmicall=\r\ny) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumu=\r\nlated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy and st=\r\nop you from getting bound further.\n\nSome people make the mistake of thinkin=\r\ng that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from moksha. That=\r\n is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely wort=\r\nh having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.\n\nSuppose you have a tra=\r\nsh can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash and =\r\nhang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new trash tha=\r\nt comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you keep col=\r\nlecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can also, =\r\nwhen you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.\n\nBest regard=\r\ns,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yo=\r\nurself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpi=\r\nrituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- -\n\n&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 2010 11:42:03 +0=\r\n000\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadhana\n&gt; From: Manish P=\r\nandit &lt;mm.pandit@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; On Brahmacharya and virya:\n&gt; \n&gt; In a ml of semen, there are millions of s=\r\nperm, most living beings with\n&gt; potential to form a jiva.\n&gt; Look at them un=\r\nder a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.\n&gt; They swim re=\r\nally energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try not to\n&gt; kill tadp=\r\noles normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be ok to take God&#39;s\n&gt; name a=\r\nnd kill them?\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is that those poor beings are destined for sho=\r\nrt life and death\n&gt; normally.\n&gt; If you realised this and stopped yourself b=\r\ny Brahmacharya, still you would\n&gt; have nightly emissions. Partly, rich food=\r\n, partly lots of Kama related\n&gt; thoughts are responsible.\n&gt; Whenever you th=\r\nink of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by\n&gt; conscious effor=\r\nt and look at the thought, you will clearly see the\n&gt; copulation happening =\r\nin your thought in the head.\n&gt; That is problematic, but essentially it mean=\r\ns that sex starts in the mind\n&gt; only. Control the mind and things are gener=\r\nally fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing is the prostatic fluid itself, if you get a=\r\n slight erection\n&gt; say after 20-30 days of strict Brahmacharya, you will no=\r\ntice that although\n&gt; there is no emission of sperm, some prostatic fluid co=\r\nmes out (this is a\n&gt; form of Shukra-Acharya. ... prostatic fluid nourishes =\r\nsperm and ....\n&gt; &quot;teaches&quot; it) This also represents a loss of shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nRight, so, how to stop it??\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and keep Br=\r\namhacharya for a few days,\n&gt; someday you may be destined for a fall from Br=\r\nahmacharya, for example, if\n&gt; some great looking heroine comes to you and d=\r\nrops her clothes without asking,\n&gt; how many of you will be able to resist, =\r\nkeeping in mind that sexual imagery\n&gt; from films may have already spoiled t=\r\nhe mind. Most difficult... .\n&gt; There are only two ways, total control, whic=\r\nh very few can do or total\n&gt; gratification followed by terrific sadhana.\n&gt; =\r\nHere is where Tantra is superb, none of these so called gurus can match a\n&gt;=\r\n true sadhaka of tantra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name just as\n&gt;=\r\n sitting in a smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are afraid of=\r\n\n&gt; Her in the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which binds norm=\r\nal\n&gt; humans.\n&gt; Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana of a s=\r\nexual nature.\n&gt; These are two separate things. Sadhana of this sort tricks =\r\nthe mind in many\n&gt; ways already discussed before.\n&gt; I would suggest that Sh=\r\niva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind\n&gt; of control which most=\r\n people cannot imagine.\n&gt; First, you will stick to one partner for the sadh=\r\nana, that is a kind of\n&gt; Brahmacharya in itself.\n&gt; Two, the sadhana when it=\r\n matures, will be so good that ordinary sex will be\n&gt; thrown out of the win=\r\ndow.\n&gt; Three, a naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the way it d=\r\nid when\n&gt; you first started.\n&gt; Four, the play of the deity within your resp=\r\nective bodies will give you\n&gt; knowledge which normal people do not have.\n&gt; =\r\nFive, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and the\n&gt; de=\r\nities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? The Law of\n&gt; ka=\r\nrma applies to everybody.\n&gt; Six, The bliss of not having to think of sex wi=\r\nll occur for many months on\n&gt; end.\n&gt; The aashirvaad given by the sperm for =\r\nnot being killed (millions of such\n&gt; beings), is so tremendous that the Oja=\r\ns of such a sadhaka amplifies\n&gt; tremendously. Notice that i still say sadha=\r\nka, not &quot;Great exhalted Guru&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or all that rubbish.\n&gt; As far=\r\n as I am concerned, very few people are qualified enough to be a Guru(\n&gt; I =\r\ndo not think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my children).\n&gt;=\r\n True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost impossible=\r\n\n&gt; to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do everything suc=\r\nh a\n&gt; being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?\n&gt; And the punishme=\r\nnt for Guru Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.\n&gt; Unfortunately, som=\r\netimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/\n&gt; Guru comes to their doo=\r\nr, they foolishly direct that person elsewhere, such\n&gt; is the force of maya=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Love\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The argum=\r\nent involving Virya is not satisfying to me:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. This explanation is e=\r\nxplaining predominantly from a male point of view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. According the mo=\r\ndern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or\n&gt; &gt; not, the Virya doe=\r\ns not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why so much focus or affinit=\r\ny for accumulation of energy? Yes, the\n&gt; &gt; common argument is that we need =\r\nto accumulate spiritual energy to burn our\n&gt; &gt; karma. But, why burn the kar=\r\nma? In several threads, the only absolute way of\n&gt; &gt; burning karma seem to =\r\nbe paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the\n&gt; &gt; mind. In order to=\r\n realise this and condition our mind, do we really need\n&gt; &gt; energy. I trust=\r\n, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Is not the go=\r\nal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to\n&gt; &gt; anticipate/wish for an =\r\nexperiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do\n&gt; &gt; sadhana with out a=\r\nny anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy\n&gt; &gt; or even obta=\r\nining Moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the =\r\nmind in Brahman all the\n&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not result in any mor=\r\ne karma because, your mind is\n&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence you do not =\r\nidentify yourself in your actions.\n&gt; &gt; You do them because you had to do th=\r\nem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoiding certain actio=\r\nns but, try\n&gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about God while doing a=\r\nny/every thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in my child hood=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the best devotee as he k=\r\neeps\n&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him by namin=\r\ng some\n&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters the nam=\r\ne of Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada protests and then Vis=\r\nhnu gives him a\n&gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head =\r\nand walk around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s name whi=\r\nle you are doing sex. If\n&gt; &gt; you can manage to decrease amount of joy you d=\r\nerise out of sex, then you are\n&gt; &gt; on the correct path. Nigraha will come a=\r\nutomatically if you stop enjoying\n&gt; &gt; it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-702343921-1268048675=:88296\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sri Narasimha Garu,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Please look at some thoughts and questions that have cros=\r\nsed my mind and do reply of you deem them fit for a reply.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;From Sri Manish&#39;s mail - &quot;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #00=\r\nbfbf&quot;&gt; The aashirvaad given by the sperm for not being killed (millions of =\r\nsuch &gt; beings), is so tremendous that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifi=\r\nes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; tremendously.&quot;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR=\r\n: #00bfbf&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fffff=\r\nf&quot;&gt;I tend to agree with the point of killing all such probable beings that =\r\nare getting killed by the act...and from the Vimalandas words our life is a=\r\n result of the accumulated Blessings and Curses..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;=\r\nBACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff&quot;&gt;We inhale and exhale continuously and in the pro=\r\ncess kill so many micro beings..whill that accumulate to any curse or is th=\r\nere any process that helps us in getting over such karma? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also, when we fall sick we would tend to take antibioti=\r\ncs etc that in turn would kill so many such micro beings..what affects that=\r\n may have on our Karma sheet..&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also, we may be=\r\n soing such acts very unknowingly..does the acts that are performed unknowi=\r\nngly have equal impact as ones done with full consciousness..&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;also just wondering here about doing the karmas in a detatc=\r\nhed fashion (though knowing what we are doing in full consiousness) vs acts=\r\n done unknowingly (without we knowing what we have done or going to do etc =\r\nand hence probably may not tend to associate ourself with such acts).

When it spends time in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam=\r\n, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), it stores that shakti in the right places in=\r\n the mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Just as physical energy helps you fight external enemies =\r\nwho attack you, this spiritual energy helps you fight internal enemies who =\r\nattack you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If your surrender is perfect and you are going through t=\r\nhe good and bad fruits of your karmas without committing new karmas, your p=\r\noint is right. You are like a weightless leaf and you need no energy - you =\r\ngo with the flow. But, if you still have a conditioned mind that is vulnera=\r\nble to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable to committing NEW karmas, don&#39;=\r\nt you think some energy is needed?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Don&#39;t look at spiritual shakti as=\r\n\n something that enables you to do great deeds in the world. Though that to=\r\no is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude and inappropriate for most =\r\nsadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to fight =\r\nback your own internal enemies and overcome your own weaknesses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. If you are living every second without any goals/agendas/ wish=\r\nes/anticipat ions at all, then you are all already liberated and then your =\r\npoint is meaningful.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, if you do have some some goals, some wishe=\r\ns, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize that those=\r\n wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmically) =\r\nand they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumulat=\r\ned through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy and stop =\r\nyou from getting bound further.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people make the mistake of thin=\r\nking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from\n moksha. =\r\nThat is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely =\r\nworth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose you =\r\nhave a trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected =\r\ntrash and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new=\r\n trash that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that yo=\r\nu keep collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash =\r\ncan also, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jy=\r\notish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 20=\r\n10 11:42:03 +0000&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadh=\r\nana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Manish Pandit &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.c=\r\nom/mc/compose?to=3Dmm.pandit%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ym=\r\nailto=3D&quot;mailto:mm.pandit%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;mm.pandit@gmail. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/com=\r\npose?to=3Dpvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@charter. net&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; On Brahmach=\r\narya and\n virya:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In a ml of semen, there are millions of s=\r\nperm, most living beings with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; potential to form a jiva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Loo=\r\nk at them under a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; They swim really energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try =\r\nnot to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kill tadpoles normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be o=\r\nk to take God&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; name and kill them?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The point is t=\r\nhat those poor beings are destined for short life and death&lt;BR&gt;&gt; normall=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you realised this and stopped yourself by Brahmacharya, still=\r\n you would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have nightly emissions. Partly, rich food, partly lots o=\r\nf Kama related&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thoughts are responsible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever you think=\r\n of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conscious ef=\r\nfort and look at the thought, you will clearly see the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; copulation h=\r\nappening in your thought in the head.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; That is problematic, but\n ess=\r\nentially it means that sex starts in the mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only. Control the min=\r\nd and things are generally fine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The other thing is the pr=\r\nostatic fluid itself, if you get a slight erection&lt;BR&gt;&gt; say after 20-30 =\r\ndays of strict Brahmacharya, you will notice that although&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there is=\r\n no emission of sperm, some prostatic fluid comes out (this is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; fo=\r\nrm of Shukra-Acharya. ... prostatic fluid nourishes sperm and ....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;teaches&quot; it) This also represents a loss of shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Right=\r\n, so, how to stop it??&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and =\r\nkeep Bramhacharya for a few days,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; someday you may be destined for a=\r\n fall from Brahmacharya, for example, if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some great looking heroine=\r\n comes to you and drops her clothes without asking,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how many of you=\r\n will be able to resist, keeping in mind that sexual imagery&lt;BR&gt;&gt; from f=\r\nilms may have already spoiled the mind. Most difficult...\n .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There =\r\nare only two ways, total control, which very few can do or total&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gr=\r\natification followed by terrific sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Here is where Tantra is s=\r\nuperb, none of these so called gurus can match a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; true sadhaka of ta=\r\nntra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name just as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sitting in a=\r\n smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are afraid of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her =\r\nin the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which binds normal&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; humans.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana o=\r\nf a sexual nature.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; These are two separate things. Sadhana of this s=\r\nort tricks the mind in many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ways already discussed before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nI would suggest that Shiva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; of control which most people cannot imagine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; First, you wil=\r\nl stick to one partner for the sadhana, that is a kind of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahmacha=\r\nrya in itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Two, the sadhana when it\n matures, will be so good t=\r\nhat ordinary sex will be&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thrown out of the window.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Three, a=\r\n naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the way it did when&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n you first started.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Four, the play of the deity within your respect=\r\nive bodies will give you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledge which normal people do not have.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Five, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; deities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? =\r\nThe Law of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; karma applies to everybody.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Six, The bliss of no=\r\nt having to think of sex will occur for many months on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; end.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The aashirvaad given by the sperm for not being killed (millions of such&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; beings), is so tremendous that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; tremendously. Notice that i still say sadhaka, not &quot;Great exhalted =\r\nGuru&quot; or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or all that rubbish.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As far as I am con=\r\ncerned, very few people are qualified\n enough to be a Guru(&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do no=\r\nt think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my children).&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost impossibl=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do everyth=\r\ning such a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; And the punishment for Guru Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, sometimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Guru comes to their door, they foolishly direct that person elsewhe=\r\nre, such&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is the force of maya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Love&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504=\r\n.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpvklnrao%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvklnrao%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;pvklnrao@yahoo. com&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered question=\r\ns in my mind.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; The argument involving V=\r\nirya is not satisfying to me:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. This explanation is expl=\r\naining predominantly from a male point of view&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Accordi=\r\nng the modern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nnot, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3=\r\n. Why so much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; common argument is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to bu=\r\nrn our&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; karma. But, why burn the karma? In several threads, the=\r\n only absolute way of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; burning karma seem to be paying it up wi=\r\nth out attachment. It is all in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind. In order to realise =\r\nthis and condition our mind, do we really need&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; energy. I trust=\r\n, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. I=\r\ns not the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; an=\r\nticipate/wish for an experiance\n while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana with out any anticipation, why all this focus on accum=\r\nulating energy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; or even obtaining Moksha?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in Bra=\r\nhman all the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not result in any more =\r\nkarma because, your mind is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence you =\r\ndo not identify yourself in your actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; You do them because =\r\nyou had to do them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way t=\r\no get this is not avoiding certain actions but, try&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; developing=\r\n ability to keep thinking about God while doing any/every thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in my child hood.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is th=\r\ne best devotee as he keeps&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. =\r\nVishnu disappoints him by\n naming some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best=\r\n devotee. This wood cutter utters the name of Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; only few =\r\ntimes during the day. Narada protests and then Vishnu gives him a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head and walk around.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s =\r\nname while you are doing sex. If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you can manage to decrease am=\r\nount of joy you derise out of sex, then you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the correct=\r\n path. Nigraha will come automatically if you stop enjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-702343921-1268048675=:88296--\r\n\n"}}
