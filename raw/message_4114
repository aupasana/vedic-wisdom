This is condemned by Lord Krishna=\r\n in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord. It is an instrument fo=\r\nr Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if the body is not kept stron=\r\ng and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an evil as attachment to s=\r\nensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abhimana of Sadhus and Sann=\r\nyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Abhimana of worldly person=\r\ns.\n\nVairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It is difficult to get rid of the=\r\n Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the body-idea. The feeling, &quot;I am a=\r\n great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhimana. The body of a Sannyasi, who=\r\n has dedicated it unto the service of humanity, is a public property. He ha=\r\ns no claim on it because he denies the existence of body and tries to feel =\r\nalways: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public will take care of his body.\n\nLord=\r\n Buddha tortured the body, did severe austerities, gave up food and yet he =\r\nwas not able to attain the goal. He heard the song:\n\n&quot;Fair goes the dancing=\r\n when the Sitar&#39;s tuned, \n\nTune us the Sitar neither low nor high. \n\nAnd we=\r\n will dance away the hearts of men \n\nThe string o&#39;erstretched breaks and th=\r\ne music flies,\n\nThe string o&#39;erslack is dumb and music dies, \n\nTune us the =\r\nSitar neither low nor high.&quot;\n\nThen he ate food, adopted the middle path and=\r\n succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all necessary=\r\n for attaining perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya born of=\r\n strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practice of severe a=\r\nusterities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by way of rigid =\r\nTapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a stron=\r\ng, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to give i=\r\nt up at any time for a noble cause.\n\nThe care-taker of the horse feeds it w=\r\nith proper nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing. Then only i=\r\nt is ready for further work. Even so, this body should be injected with pro=\r\nper nutrition. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only it will soon=\r\n regain its lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. Work will suff=\r\ner if the body is not well attended to. When the body grows old it must be =\r\nwell-protected against cold and well-looked after. If hard Titiksha is prac=\r\ntised now, it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shore of immortal=\r\nity and fearlessness cannot be reached.\n\nO Ram, neglect not this body. The =\r\nsociety and Prakriti will extract and continue to extract as much work as p=\r\nossible from those selfless workers who have dedicated their lives to the s=\r\nervice of humanity. They are yoked to service till the last breath leaves t=\r\nheir bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, &quot;My dear Prahlada! Enough of y=\r\nour Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samadhi. Serve people now=\r\n. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot; Yoga Vasishtha speaks of one as a &quot;Maha=\r\n Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has renounced the idea of &quot;I am a Tyagi&quot; and =\r\n&quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither accepts nor rejects things that come by thems=\r\nelves by identifying himself with the silent witness, the Immortal Atma, wh=\r\no feels always &quot;I am Akarta (non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I am Abhokta (non-enjoyer) &quot; even=\r\n while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, &quot;But the disciplined self, mov=\r\ning among sense-objects, with senses free from attraction and repulsion mas=\r\ntered by the Self, goeth to\nPeace.&quot; Chapter II-64.\n\nSome neophytes and raw =\r\naspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; or &quot;Maha Bhogins&quot; and quote sc=\r\nriptures also: &quot;We eat without tongues; we see without eyes&quot;. The thief or =\r\nthe hypocrite will be found out soon. They are just like the people who cat=\r\nch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their palates and quote Gita:=E2=80=94=\r\n&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavakah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo=\r\n na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth h=\r\nim, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away&quot;. Sublime philosophy indee=\r\nd of perverted people with perverted intellects! The gilted ornaments canno=\r\nt shine for a long time. The crow that shines under borrowed feathers of th=\r\ne peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishnas and Vasanas will burst out=\r\n and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite without difficulty.\n\nA Maha=\r\n Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to accept some mangoes or a cup of mil=\r\nk when they come by themselves. But he will not crave for them. He will not=\r\n say, &quot;I have enjoyed today good mangoes or good milk.&quot; If an aspirant is s=\r\neriously ailing, if he is not able to eat solid food-stuffs, if there is a =\r\nfeeling of want in him for milk, if he has no money with him to purchase mi=\r\nlk, if any devotee casually offers of his own accord some milk, he should n=\r\not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He takes care of his devotees by work=\r\ning through the minds of various persons.\n\nThe child sometimes eats food at=\r\n night while he is sleeping. If the mother asks the child in the morning. &quot;=\r\nBaby, you took food last night,&quot; he replies, &quot;I have not taken anything las=\r\nt night. You are playing and joking with me.&quot; Such is the condition of a Je=\r\nevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. =\r\nHe eats without a mouth and smells without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at=\r\n night when he dreams. If you ask him when he comes to waking consciousness=\r\n, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you talked last night when you were dreaming?&quot;=\r\n He replies &quot;I do not remember anything.&quot; Such is the state of a Jeevanmukt=\r\na or a Maha Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.\n\nDurvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he =\r\nsaid, &quot;I am a Nitya Upavasi. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only=\r\n&quot;, because he identified himself with the Atma who is always the witness an=\r\nd the non-enjoyer. Lord Krishna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though h=\r\ne was with Radha, Rukmini and Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wif=\r\ne, &quot;My beloved! Say unto the river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, ha=\r\ns commanded you to give path of way. She will at once yield and you can cro=\r\nss it without a boat.&quot; She repeated the words of her husband and crossed th=\r\ne river immediately. She was quite amazed at the words of her husband and a=\r\nsked him, &quot;My Lord! You are living with me and yet you say that you are a N=\r\nitya Brahmachari. I am struck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain thi=\r\ns philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluvar replied, &quot;I am immortal Atma. I have realised t=\r\nhis through direct cognition (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the sil=\r\nent witness. The senses,\nbody, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am =\r\nentirely distinct from them.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s wife understood the nature of=\r\n the soul and then she became silent.\n\nOrdinary aspirants with delicate hea=\r\nlth should not take recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He who=\r\n has attained Kaya Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is adam=\r\nantine. If an aspirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to live=\r\n on neem leaves alone, the obvious result is that he will get various sorts=\r\n of gastro-intestinal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obtain=\r\ned by persons who practise Tamasic Tapas.\n\nIf you have mastery over the pai=\r\nr of opposites, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense heat and inten=\r\nse cold, if you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri, this is hi=\r\nghly creditable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you attempt to st=\r\nand before the sun in summer for some hours, if you throw off your clothing=\r\n in the Gangotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunstroke or pneu=\r\nmonia. You should not attempt to take recourse to these hard practices. Wha=\r\nt little you will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth will be lost, a=\r\nnd you have lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to reach him by=\r\n your foolish practices or Tamasic Tapas.\n\nAn aspirant gave up his clothing=\r\n all at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died wi=\r\nthin a short time. During the period of sickness all cravings that were tem=\r\nporarily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled force. He became a =\r\nslave of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of food. He could not sup=\r\npress them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute diarrhoea.\n\nAn aspira=\r\nnt said, &quot;I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for some yea=\r\nrs. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, &quot;I am immortal Atma&quot;. I ha=\r\nve got full Vairagya. No sin will cling to me, because my motive is pure. I=\r\n will attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually committed the abominable act. =\r\nDo you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. Thi=\r\ns is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature of =\r\ntrue Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters for s=\r\nome time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by taking =\r\nto wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot enterta=\r\nin the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the time of committing the act. Horrible t=\r\nhoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to share obviou=\r\nsly the fate of Pretas (ghosts).\n\nThe mind should gradually be weaned off i=\r\nts old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleasure centres=\r\n, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants who take to t=\r\noo much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. You should t=\r\nrain the mind in meditation gradually and make it taste the inner bliss. Gr=\r\nadually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and you can get y=\r\nourself established in true Vairagya.\n\nThe more the Viveka, the more the tr=\r\nue Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in the garden of Antahk=\r\narana from the understanding that the world is a mere appearance and full o=\r\nf miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality full of knowledge and=\r\n bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and association with t=\r\nhe realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, all objects of the w=\r\norld appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or worthless things. =\r\nHe will not give up his new spiritual life even if the wealth of the whole =\r\nworld is offered to him.\n\nAspirants should give up those articles of food w=\r\nhich they like best for some time. They should discipline all the Indriyas =\r\nin a perfect manner. They should always lead a simple life. They should alw=\r\nays eat simple food. But they should not become slaves of Vairagya. Abhiman=\r\n Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this in his devotees in order=\r\n to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.\n\nMay you all become Maha Ty=\r\nagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free from the canker of Vairagya Abhi=\r\nmana!\n\nMay you all possess true lasting Para Vairagya!!\n\nMay you all attain=\r\n Kaivalya or perfection!! !\n\nReal Vairagya\n\nThere was a Sannyasi at Benares=\r\n. He was a great Titikshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used t=\r\no stand in the sun for some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges=\r\n for some hours. He used to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots=\r\n.\n\nOn one occasion one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri=\r\n Ram provided him a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot.=\r\n He asked him to provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. I=\r\nt was extremely difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to =\r\nget for the Swami a bed of grass with great difficulty.\n\nSri Ram said: &quot;Swa=\r\nmiji, it is very difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents=\r\n. Kindly use the cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an a=\r\ndvanced Sannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of gras=\r\ns or on a cot?&quot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I must have my usual bed o=\r\nf grass only. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;\n\nAttachment to Vairagya is as much=\r\n an evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wisdom of =\r\nthe Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage has nei=\r\nther Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, he is qui=\r\nte satisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats, milk an=\r\nd fruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good food. He al=\r\nways takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external objects. This =\r\nis the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or not. A wo=\r\nrldly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of food which =\r\nhe likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A realised sou=\r\nl has equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.\n\nSuka Deva was te=\r\nsted by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate for some days. He=\r\n was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees served him and =\r\ngave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.\n\nObviously, the=\r\n Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained equanimity o=\r\nf mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even after several=\r\n years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from all sorts of =\r\nattachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not attain Sahaja-A=\r\nvastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent to all kinds =\r\nof objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the bed of grass or a beautiful=\r\n cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.\n\nHe who is endowed wit=\r\nh equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi i=\r\nn Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but it is extremely diff=\r\nicult to keep the evenness of mind.\n\nSome Sannyasins who are working for th=\r\ne public good make resolves: &quot;We will not travel in trains. We will walk on=\r\nly. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will not use fountain pens or wa=\r\ntch.&quot; These are not desirable resolves. This is not the real nature of Vair=\r\nagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is another kind of defect. T=\r\nhey want to do service. If they move in cars or trains, if they keep the bo=\r\ndy strong and healthy, they can do more service in a short space of time. T=\r\nhose who do much writing-work can turn out much work if they use a fountain=\r\n pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is one kind. It does not leav=\r\ne even educated persons or cultured Sannyasins.\n\nSome Sannyasins practise V=\r\nairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and respect. But God knows the mo=\r\ntives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner Ruler. You cannot deceive Him=\r\n.\n\nWhere is the strength of Vairagya when one lives in seclusion, where the=\r\nre is no temptation? Where is the strength of Vairagya when one has not ren=\r\nounced anything, when he has nothing to renounce, when he has not enjoyed t=\r\nhe objects of the world, when there is no attraction in the mind for the ob=\r\njects of the world even though he shows externally that he is a great Virak=\r\nta or dispassionate man by putting on a gunny bag or keeping a small wooden=\r\n bowl only in his hand?\n\nRaja Janaka was amidst regal enjoyments. People re=\r\nported that the city of Mithila was burst and yet, he was not a bit affecte=\r\nd. That is real Vairagya. He alone can be called a real great Virakta.\n\nYou=\r\nng aspirants should be very careful and cautious. They should not take adva=\r\nntage of the liberty of a Maha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be practise=\r\nd only by an advanced Yogi who has got equal vision over all beings. Beginn=\r\ners should stick to their resolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vaira=\r\ngya to the very letter and spirit.\n\nMay you all transcend Raga and Vairagya=\r\n and attain knowledge of the Self. May you all understand the true nature a=\r\nnd Swaroopa of Vairagya.\n\nVairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollable =\r\nmind is restrained. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and =\r\nstrong dispassion for anything other than Atma.\n\nIf one considers the posit=\r\nion and happiness of Brahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has dev=\r\neloped a real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairag=\r\nya. It will not help the aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.\n\nI=\r\nt is common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or=\r\n other. But by having dispassion for all objects at all times, one will get=\r\n knowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Gur=\r\nu, by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.\n\nDo not fall a=\r\n victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and well-ado=\r\nred fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attain Self-=\r\nrealisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.\n\nDevotion, dispass=\r\nion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Dispassion is d=\r\nesirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of the heart and s=\r\no everybody has this Atma.\n\nLight on Vairagya\n\nVairagya is born of Viveka, =\r\ndiscrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and non-eternal) , Sat and=\r\n Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka comes through disintere=\r\nsted selfless service done in several births and through Puja and Aradhana,=\r\n and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is born Vairagya. It gives =\r\nspiritual strength.\n\nA man of Vairagya has no attraction for the world. It =\r\nis like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, inexhaustible wealth for aspiran=\r\nts. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, Samadhana, and generates burni=\r\nng Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberation or Emancipation, or Release.=\r\n\n\nRaga is attachment to objects. Wherever there is a little pleasure, there=\r\n is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there is dislike. Like and dislike are on=\r\ne. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the important afflictions, according to Patan=\r\njali Maharshi. The five afflictions are: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism=\r\n), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Abhinivesha (clinging to life). First,=\r\n there is ignorance, the original Avidya. From this is born egoism, Asmita,=\r\n and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, and from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, th=\r\ne clinging to this life.\n\nVairagya is of different types or degrees=E2=80=\r\n=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild, moderate and intense). Intense Vairagy=\r\na only will help the aspirant to stick to this path. If it is of a dull typ=\r\ne like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava Vairagya, the mind will simply be waitin=\r\ng to get back the objects that were renounced previously, and the aspirant =\r\nwill get a downfall. He will not be able to climb again to the heights he f=\r\normerly reached. So aspirants should be careful. Even though the Vairagya i=\r\ns of a mild type, they should try to make it moderate; and then intense Vai=\r\nragya comes through looking into the defects of sensual life. Sensual pleas=\r\nure is not real happiness. It is illusory, transient, impermanent. It is mi=\r\nxed with pain. So again and again by looking into the defects of sensual li=\r\nfe, Vairagya dawns. It should be strengthened through study of spiritual bo=\r\noks, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry.\n\nSimply living in nudity and eating nee=\r\nm leaves, and drinking cow&#39;s urine does not constitute real Vairagya. Vaira=\r\ngya should be born of discrimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mi=\r\nnd is weaned from sensual enjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=E2=80=\r\n=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 and then only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and ag=\r\nain you will have to make enquiry. Physical nudity and these external thing=\r\ns will not constitute real Vairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enquiry=\r\n, Vichara. All these objects do not give us lasting happiness. They lead us=\r\n into pain and sorrow. Such deep enquiry, again and again, persisted in for=\r\n a very long time, produces lasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an =\r\naspirant. It helps him to do real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. T=\r\nhis Vairagya puts a break to the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if th=\r\ne mind runs towards objects, at once it will point out that there is pain t=\r\nhere, that sensual enjoyment is the cause\nfor rebirth and intense suffering=\r\n. So the mind is terribly afraid, and gradually through intense practice, i=\r\nt is established in real, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.\n\nVairagya i=\r\ns of two kinds also: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes =\r\nafter one attains Self-realisation. The whole world then looks like a straw=\r\n. That is intense spiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.\n\nWithout Vaira=\r\ngya there cannot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only =\r\nvital, fundamental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will co=\r\nme by themselves. Patanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan ni=\r\nrodhah&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairag=\r\nya.&quot; They are the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of =\r\nImmortal Abode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. &quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunte=\r\nya, vairagyena cha grihyate&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by practice an=\r\nd Vairagya, dispassion, intense detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the mind is detac=\r\nhed. He who works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspiran=\r\nts&#39; duty to cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.\n\nVairagya=\r\n is doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual gro=\r\noves. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, a=\r\nnd yet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the w=\r\norld, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not aff=\r\nected in the least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she =\r\nruled a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renou=\r\nncing his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached =\r\nto the body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any=\r\n one object.\n\nYou see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but he=\r\n will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairagi. =\r\nThis is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that on=\r\ne has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not belong to=\r\n this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing only a rope around the waist=\r\n. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had tha=\r\nt mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.\n\nLord=\r\n Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. &quot;Karshayantah=\r\n sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham tan vidhy=\r\nasuranischayan .&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;They torture all the elements in the body and Me=\r\n also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord Buddha also tortured his body, and late=\r\nr on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; and then he c=\r\name to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by the middle pa=\r\nth always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisation. Especi=\r\nally in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should not torture=\r\n the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You should not =\r\nexpose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you should practis=\r\ne &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm in taking good, healthy food. Ev=\r\nery man has got a different physical constitution. You should use common se=\r\nnse in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot sit for a long\ntime =\r\nin one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some fruits. You should=\r\n have extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya internally and at the same time follow t=\r\nhe middle path externally.\n\nGenerally, aspirants say: &quot;I have given up umbr=\r\nella.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I take only one meal.&quot; Their whole Sadhana is: &quot;I have giv=\r\nen up shirt.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I have given up sweater.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I have given up=\r\n shoes.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&quot; Their Sadhana consists i=\r\nn &quot;giving up&quot;=E2=80=94give up this, give up that. Real spiritual life does =\r\nnot involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving up or taking. The o=\r\nnly thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind. If you are very hun=\r\ngry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a small cup of milk. Vaira=\r\ngya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the mind. It will hurl y=\r\nou down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.\n\nAt the present moment,=\r\n there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is a great Vairagi. For the la=\r\nst so many years he is living without clothing in the icy region and he sle=\r\neps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gave a very good description o=\r\nf him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a wonderful man and made him=\r\n his Guru.\n\nAvadhoot Kesavananda is another Vairagi. He was living in Rishi=\r\nkesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji. He always slept on grass. Malavi=\r\naji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused to sleep on blanket. It was rain=\r\ning, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for him to sleep. He was a Vairagi. V=\r\nairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to this cult. They put ash all over=\r\n the body and make the hair look golden, and they wear a very thick rope, o=\r\nf the size used for drawing chariots. This is Vairagya Sampradaya. In Laksh=\r\nman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Panchagni Tapas. They have got a phys=\r\nical body.\n\nThere is another great Vairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Sw=\r\nami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He used to take food left in the leaves th=\r\nat are thrown out by others after meals. &quot;Avadhootas&quot; are naked people. The=\r\ny have no clothing or home. Real Avadhoota is one who has shaved his mind o=\r\nf all Vasanas. When all Vasanas are destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brah=\r\nmendra Swami lived a very austere life. He was Poornabodha&#39; s Guru and Swam=\r\ni Krishnananda&#39; s Guru. Once in his Ashram, they prepared very good food, a=\r\nnd Brahmendra Swami ordered the food to be given to cows. He used to make s=\r\nevere tests. Sankarananda is also his disciple. He had a very strong body a=\r\nnd lived an austere life.\n\n------------ --------- ---\n\n`Light on Vairagya&#39; =\r\nwill resume next week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-519221652-1270360985=:79597\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hi,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Th=\r\nis is a very nice read.

This is Asuric Tapas of ignorant persons. This is c=\r\nondemned by Lord Krishna in the Gita. Body is the moving temple of the Lord=\r\n. It is an instrument for Self-realisation. You cannot do any Sadhana if th=\r\ne body is not kept strong and healthy. Attachment to Vairagya is as much an=\r\n evil as attachment to sensual objects. Give up Vairagya-Abhimana. This Abh=\r\nimana of Sadhus and Sannyasins is more dangerous and inveterate than the Ab=\r\nhimana of worldly persons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya-Abhimana is a deadly canker. It =\r\nis difficult to get rid of the Vairagya- Abhimana as long as there is the b=\r\nody-idea. The feeling, &quot;I am a great Vairagi or Thyagi&quot; is Vairagya Abhiman=\r\na. The body of a Sannyasi, who has dedicated it unto the service of humanit=\r\ny, is a public\n property. He has no claim on it because he denies the exist=\r\nence of body and tries to feel always: &quot;I am Siva (Sivoham)&quot;. The public wi=\r\nll take care of his body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lord Buddha tortured the body, did severe =\r\nausterities, gave up food and yet he was not able to attain the goal. He he=\r\nard the song:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Fair goes the dancing when the Sitar&#39;s tuned, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Tune us the Sitar neither low nor high. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And we will dance away the=\r\n hearts of men &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The string o&#39;erstretched breaks and the music flies,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The string o&#39;erslack is dumb and music dies, &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Tune us the Si=\r\ntar neither low nor high.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then he ate food, adopted the middle path=\r\n and succeeded in achieving Nirvana. Extreme asceticism is not at all neces=\r\nsary for attaining perfection. What is wanted is strong mental Vairagya bor=\r\nn of strong discrimination. All bodies are not fit for the practice of seve=\r\nre austerities. The body will drop down if you tax it too much by way of ri=\r\ngid\n Tapas. Do not spoil your health and body in the name of Tapas. Have a =\r\nstrong, healthy body, but have no attachment for the body. Be prepared to g=\r\nive it up at any time for a noble cause.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The care-taker of the horse=\r\n feeds it with proper nutrition when it is over-worked, when it is ailing. =\r\nThen only it is ready for further work. Even so, this body should be inject=\r\ned with proper nutrition. Then only it will turn out good work. Then only i=\r\nt will soon regain its lost vitality on account of overwork or ailment. Wor=\r\nk will suffer if the body is not well attended to. When the body grows old =\r\nit must be well-protected against cold and well-looked after. If hard Titik=\r\nsha is practised now, it will give way soon. Consequently, the other shore =\r\nof immortality and fearlessness cannot be reached.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O Ram, neglect no=\r\nt this body. The society and Prakriti will extract and continue to extract =\r\nas much work as possible from those selfless workers who have dedicated\n th=\r\neir lives to the service of humanity. They are yoked to service till the la=\r\nst breath leaves their bodies. Lord Vishnu instructs Prahlada, &quot;My dear Pra=\r\nhlada! Enough of your Tapas. Take care of your body. Rise from your Samadhi=\r\n. Serve people now. Disseminate Bhakti far and wide.&quot; Yoga Vasishtha speaks=\r\n of one as a &quot;Maha Tyagi&quot; and &quot;Maha Bhogi&quot;, who has renounced the idea of &quot;=\r\nI am a Tyagi&quot; and &quot;I am a Vairagi&quot;, who neither accepts nor rejects things =\r\nthat come by themselves by identifying himself with the silent witness, the=\r\n Immortal Atma, who feels always &quot;I am Akarta (non-doer)&quot;, &quot;I am Abhokta (n=\r\non-enjoyer) &quot; even while moving amidst objects. The Gita says, &quot;But the dis=\r\nciplined self, moving among sense-objects, with senses free from attraction=\r\n and repulsion mastered by the Self, goeth to&lt;BR&gt;Peace.&quot; Chapter II-64.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Some neophytes and raw aspirants pose themselves for &quot;Maha Tyagins&quot; or =\r\n&quot;Maha Bhogins&quot; and quote scriptures also: &quot;We eat without\n tongues; we see =\r\nwithout eyes&quot;. The thief or the hypocrite will be found out soon. They are =\r\njust like the people who catch fishes from the Ganges to satisfy their pala=\r\ntes and quote Gita:=E2=80=94&quot;Nainam Chhindanti Sastrani Nainam Dahati Pavak=\r\nah; Na chainam Kledayantyapo na sosha-yati marutah&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;Weapons cleave=\r\n him not, nor fire burneth him, nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him awa=\r\ny&quot;. Sublime philosophy indeed of perverted people with perverted intellects=\r\n! The gilted ornaments cannot shine for a long time. The crow that shines u=\r\nnder borrowed feathers of the peacock will be found out soon. Their Trishna=\r\ns and Vasanas will burst out and any lay bystander can detect the hypocrite=\r\n without difficulty.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A Maha Tyagi or Maha Bhogi will not refuse to a=\r\nccept some mangoes or a cup of milk when they come by themselves. But he wi=\r\nll not crave for them. He will not say, &quot;I have enjoyed today good mangoes =\r\nor good milk.&quot; If an aspirant is seriously ailing, if he is not\n able to ea=\r\nt solid food-stuffs, if there is a feeling of want in him for milk, if he h=\r\nas no money with him to purchase milk, if any devotee casually offers of hi=\r\ns own accord some milk, he should not refuse it. God works mysteriously. He=\r\n takes care of his devotees by working through the minds of various persons=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The child sometimes eats food at night while he is sleeping. If th=\r\ne mother asks the child in the morning. &quot;Baby, you took food last night,&quot; h=\r\ne replies, &quot;I have not taken anything last night. You are playing and jokin=\r\ng with me.&quot; Such is the condition of a Jeevanmukta, or a Maha Tyagi or Maha=\r\n Bhogi. He eats and yet he does not eat. He eats without a mouth and smells=\r\n without a nose. Sometimes a man talks at night when he dreams. If you ask =\r\nhim when he comes to waking consciousness, &quot;O Prema! Do you know that you t=\r\nalked last night when you were dreaming?&quot; He replies &quot;I do not remember any=\r\nthing.&quot; Such is the state of a Jeevanmukta or a Maha\n Tyagi and Maha Bhogi.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Durvasa ate a sumptuous meal and yet he said, &quot;I am a Nitya Upavasi=\r\n. I do not eat anything. I take grass juice only&quot;, because he identified hi=\r\nmself with the Atma who is always the witness and the non-enjoyer. Lord Kri=\r\nshna is regarded as a Nitya Brahmachari though he was with Radha, Rukmini a=\r\nnd Satyabhama. Sage Tiruvalluvar said to his wife, &quot;My beloved! Say unto th=\r\ne river that my husband, a Nitya Brahmachari, has commanded you to give pat=\r\nh of way. She will at once yield and you can cross it without a boat.&quot; She =\r\nrepeated the words of her husband and crossed the river immediately. She wa=\r\ns quite amazed at the words of her husband and asked him, &quot;My Lord! You are=\r\n living with me and yet you say that you are a Nitya Brahmachari. I am stru=\r\nck with wonder. I am puzzled. Kindly explain this philosophy.&quot; Tiruvalluvar=\r\n replied, &quot;I am immortal Atma. I have realised this through direct cognitio=\r\nn (Anubhava). I do not do anything. I am the\n silent witness. The senses,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;body, mind and intellect are my instruments. I am entirely distinct from =\r\nthem.&quot; Tiruvalluvai&#39; s wife understood the nature of the soul and then she =\r\nbecame silent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ordinary aspirants with delicate health should not ta=\r\nke recourse to the practice of drastic austerities. He who has attained Kay=\r\na Siddhi can do any kind of Tapas because his body is adamantine. If an asp=\r\nirant with delicate health gives up food and tries to live on neem leaves a=\r\nlone, the obvious result is that he will get various sorts of gastro-intest=\r\ninal diseases and pass away soon. This is the fruit obtained by persons who=\r\n practise Tamasic Tapas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have mastery over the pair of opposi=\r\ntes, viz., heat and cold, if you can bear intense heat and intense cold, if=\r\n you can remain without clothing in the icy Gangotri, this is highly credit=\r\nable indeed. But if your frame is delicate, if you attempt to stand before =\r\nthe sun in summer for some hours, if\n you throw off your clothing in the Ga=\r\nngotri all at once, you will die immediately of sunstroke or pneumonia. You=\r\n should not attempt to take recourse to these hard practices. What little y=\r\nou will gain by Japa and meditation in this birth will be lost, and you hav=\r\ne lost one chance given by the Lord in this birth to reach him by your fool=\r\nish practices or Tamasic Tapas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An aspirant gave up his clothing all=\r\n at once. He developed rheumatism, malaria, enlarged spleen and died within=\r\n a short time. During the period of sickness all cravings that were tempora=\r\nrily suppressed asserted themselves with re-doubled force. He became a slav=\r\ne of the tongue. He craved for many varieties of food. He could not suppres=\r\ns them. He ate indiscriminately and died of acute diarrhoea.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An aspi=\r\nrant said, &quot;I have not realised the Self though I did meditation for some y=\r\nears. I am going to commit suicide with the Bhava, &quot;I am immortal Atma&quot;. I =\r\nhave got full Vairagya. No sin\n will cling to me, because my motive is pure=\r\n. I will attain self-realisation. &quot; He actually committed the abominable ac=\r\nt. Do you find such a statement anywhere in the scriptures? Certainly not. =\r\nThis is extreme foolishness. Some aspirants who have no idea of the nature =\r\nof true Vairagya, who have not lived under the guidance of their masters fo=\r\nr some time, commit such ignoble acts. They can never get salvation by taki=\r\nng to wrong Tapas though their Bhava (motive) may be pure. They cannot ente=\r\nrtain the Bhava &quot;I am Atma&quot; just at the time of committing the act. Horribl=\r\ne thoughts will crowd at the critical juncture. They will have to share obv=\r\niously the fate of Pretas (ghosts).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The mind should gradually be wea=\r\nned off its old habits and cravings. If you cut off all at once its pleasur=\r\ne centres, it will get puzzled. That is the reason why young aspirants who =\r\ntake to too much Vairagya commit the ignoble act of committing suicide. You=\r\n should train the mind\n in meditation gradually and make it taste the inner=\r\n bliss. Gradually it will leave off its old habits and old cravings and you=\r\n can get yourself established in true Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The more the Viveka,=\r\n the more the true Vairagya. The flower of Vairagya gradually grows in the =\r\ngarden of Antahkarana from the understanding that the world is a mere appea=\r\nrance and full of miseries and that Brahman alone is the only reality full =\r\nof knowledge and bliss, and through continued practice of meditation and as=\r\nsociation with the realised souls for a protracted period. Eventually, all =\r\nobjects of the world appear before the dispassionate soul as trifling or wo=\r\nrthless things. He will not give up his new spiritual life even if the weal=\r\nth of the whole world is offered to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Aspirants should give up th=\r\nose articles of food which they like best for some time. They should discip=\r\nline all the Indriyas in a perfect manner. They should always lead a simple=\r\n life. They\n should always eat simple food. But they should not become slav=\r\nes of Vairagya. Abhiman Vairagya is a mental state. The Lord infuses this i=\r\nn his devotees in order to get rid of the clinging to sensual objects.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;May you all become Maha Tyagins and Maha Bhogis! May you all be free fro=\r\nm the canker of Vairagya Abhimana!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all possess true lasting =\r\nPara Vairagya!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all attain Kaivalya or perfection!! !&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Real Vairagya&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There was a Sannyasi at Benares. He was a great Titik=\r\nshu. He could bear heat and cold. In summer he used to stand in the sun for=\r\n some hours. In winter he used to stand in the Ganges for some hours. He us=\r\ned to sleep on a bed of grass. He shunned wooden cots.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;On one occasi=\r\non one of his admirers, Sri Ram, took him to Mussoorie. Sri Ram provided hi=\r\nm a cot to sleep. The Sannyasi refused to sleep on the cot. He asked him to=\r\n provide a bed of grass. There was much rain on that day. It was extremely\n=\r\n difficult for him to get grass. Anyhow, Sri Ram managed to get for the Swa=\r\nmi a bed of grass with great difficulty.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Ram said: &quot;Swamiji, it =\r\nis very difficult to get grass here. It is raining now in torrents. Kindly =\r\nuse the cot today. This will not bind you in any way. You are an advanced S=\r\nannyasi. What is it for you whether the body lies on a bed of grass or on a=\r\n cot?&quot; The Swamiji replied &quot;No, no, no. I must have my usual bed of grass o=\r\nnly. You must bring it anyhow.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Attachment to Vairagya is as much an=\r\n evil as attachment itself. Vairagya is a means for attaining wisdom of the=\r\n Self. It is not the goal itself. A Jeevanmukta or realised sage has neithe=\r\nr Raga nor Vairagya. If you give him a little dry bread alone, he is quite =\r\nsatisfied. He will not grumble. If you give him best sweetmeats, milk and f=\r\nruits, he will not refuse, but he will not be elated by good food. He alway=\r\ns takes delight in his own Self only, but not in external objects.\n This is=\r\n the test to find out whether a man has attained realisation or not. A worl=\r\ndly man is much troubled when he cannot get the right kind of food which he=\r\n likes best. He rejoices when he obtains palatable dishes. A realised soul =\r\nhas equanimity of mind. He is above likes and dislikes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suka Deva wa=\r\ns tested by Raja Janaka. He remained without food at the gate for some days=\r\n. He was quite peaceful. Then he was taken to the harem. Ranees served him =\r\nand gave him best food. He remained unaffected. This is wisdom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Obvi=\r\nously, the Swami who wanted a bed of grass at Mussoorie had not attained eq=\r\nuanimity of mind and Self-realisation. He was attached to Vairagya even aft=\r\ner several years of spiritual practice. He was not completely free from all=\r\n sorts of attachments because he was attached to Vairagya. He did not attai=\r\nn Sahaja-Avastha or natural state wherein the Sage is quite indifferent to =\r\nall kinds of objects, wherein the sage would sleep on the\n bed of grass or =\r\na beautiful cot with mattress and pillow with the same feeling.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He w=\r\nho is endowed with equanimity of mind towards objects is called a Maha Tyag=\r\ni or Maha Bhogi in Yoga Vasishtha. It is easy to practise Vairagya, but it =\r\nis extremely difficult to keep the evenness of mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some Sannyasins=\r\n who are working for the public good make resolves: &quot;We will not travel in =\r\ntrains. We will walk only. We will not take milk, fruits, etc. We will not =\r\nuse fountain pens or watch.&quot; These are not desirable resolves. This is not =\r\nthe real nature of Vairagya. They are also attached to Vairagya. This is an=\r\nother kind of defect. They want to do service. If they move in cars or trai=\r\nns, if they keep the body strong and healthy, they can do more service in a=\r\n short space of time. Those who do much writing-work can turn out much work=\r\n if they use a fountain pen. Foolishness assumes various forms. This is one=\r\n kind. It does not leave even educated persons or\n cultured Sannyasins.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Some Sannyasins practise Vairagya in order to gat Pratishta or fame and=\r\n respect. But God knows the motives of all, as He is the Antaryami or inner=\r\n Ruler. You cannot deceive Him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Where is the strength of Vairagya wh=\r\nen one lives in seclusion, where there is no temptation? Where is the stren=\r\ngth of Vairagya when one has not renounced anything, when he has nothing to=\r\n renounce, when he has not enjoyed the objects of the world, when there is =\r\nno attraction in the mind for the objects of the world even though he shows=\r\n externally that he is a great Virakta or dispassionate man by putting on a=\r\n gunny bag or keeping a small wooden bowl only in his hand?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raja Jan=\r\naka was amidst regal enjoyments. People reported that the city of Mithila w=\r\nas burst and yet, he was not a bit affected. That is real Vairagya. He alon=\r\ne can be called a real great Virakta.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Young aspirants should be very=\r\n careful and cautious. They should not take\n advantage of the liberty of a =\r\nMaha Tyagi and a Maha Bhogi. This can be practised only by an advanced Yogi=\r\n who has got equal vision over all beings. Beginners should stick to their =\r\nresolves of Truth, Ahimsa, Brahmacharya and Vairagya to the very letter and=\r\n spirit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;May you all transcend Raga and Vairagya and attain knowledg=\r\ne of the Self. May you all understand the true nature and Swaroopa of Vaira=\r\ngya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya is the rein by which the uncontrollable mind is restra=\r\nined. Ripe Vairagya is intense attachment to Atmic bliss and strong dispass=\r\nion for anything other than Atma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one considers the position and =\r\nhappiness of Brahma even as the dung of a cow, then only he has developed a=\r\n real lasting Vairagya. Temporary fleeting dispassion is not Vairagya. It w=\r\nill not help the aspirant in the attainment of Self-realisation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It =\r\nis common to have dispassion for some particular objects by some cause or o=\r\nther. But by having dispassion for\n all objects at all times, one will get =\r\nknowledge of the Self. You may get Atma-Jnana soon by the grace of the Guru=\r\n, by devotion to him, and by practice of what he instructs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do not f=\r\nall a victim of Moha even if you happen to move in towns with young and wel=\r\nl-adored fashionable ladies of high civilised societies. Resolve to attain =\r\nSelf-realisation. The Tamoguna will vanish of its own accord.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Devoti=\r\non, dispassion and knowledge of Atma are the three means of salvation. Disp=\r\nassion is desirelessness This All-full Atma resides in the chambers of the =\r\nheart and so everybody has this Atma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Light on Vairagya&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vaira=\r\ngya is born of Viveka, discrimination between Nitya and Anitya (eternal and=\r\n non-eternal) , Sat and Asat (real and unreal), Tattwa and Atattwa. Viveka =\r\ncomes through disinterested selfless service done in several births and thr=\r\nough Puja and Aradhana, and through the Grace of the Lord. From Viveka is b=\r\norn Vairagya. It gives\n spiritual strength.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A man of Vairagya has no=\r\n attraction for the world. It is like a straw. So Vairagya is a supreme, in=\r\nexhaustible wealth for aspirants. Vairagya produces concentration of mind, =\r\nSamadhana, and generates burning Mumukshutwa, strong yearning for Liberatio=\r\nn or Emancipation, or Release.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Raga is attachment to objects. Wherev=\r\ner there is a little pleasure, there is Raga. Wherever there is pain, there=\r\n is dislike. Like and dislike are one. Raga-Dwesha is also one of the impor=\r\ntant afflictions, according to Patanjali Maharshi. The five afflictions are=\r\n: Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-Dwesha (like and dislike and Ab=\r\nhinivesha (clinging to life). First, there is ignorance, the original Avidy=\r\na. From this is born egoism, Asmita, and from Asmita is born Raga-Dwesha, a=\r\nnd from Raga-Dwesha, Abhinivesha, the clinging to this life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagy=\r\na is of different types or degrees=E2=80=94Mridu, Madhyama and Teevra (mild=\r\n, moderate and\n intense). Intense Vairagya only will help the aspirant to s=\r\ntick to this path. If it is of a dull type like Smasana Vairagya or Prasava=\r\n Vairagya, the mind will simply be waiting to get back the objects that wer=\r\ne renounced previously, and the aspirant will get a downfall. He will not b=\r\ne able to climb again to the heights he formerly reached. So aspirants shou=\r\nld be careful. Even though the Vairagya is of a mild type, they should try =\r\nto make it moderate; and then intense Vairagya comes through looking into t=\r\nhe defects of sensual life. Sensual pleasure is not real happiness. It is i=\r\nllusory, transient, impermanent. It is mixed with pain. So again and again =\r\nby looking into the defects of sensual life, Vairagya dawns. It should be s=\r\ntrengthened through study of spiritual books, Satsanga, Vichara and enquiry=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Simply living in nudity and eating neem leaves, and drinking cow&#39;s=\r\n urine does not constitute real Vairagya. Vairagya should be born of\n discr=\r\nimination, enquiry and Vichara. By these, the mind is weaned from sensual e=\r\nnjoyments and rendered thin like a thread=E2=80=94Thanumanasi=E2=80=94 and =\r\nthen only the Vairagya is lasting. Again and again you will have to make en=\r\nquiry. Physical nudity and these external things will not constitute real V=\r\nairagya. Real Vairagya should come from enquiry, Vichara. All these objects=\r\n do not give us lasting happiness. They lead us into pain and sorrow. Such =\r\ndeep enquiry, again and again, persisted in for a very long time, produces =\r\nlasting Vairagya. It is the real wealth for an aspirant. It helps him to do=\r\n real Sadhana. It makes the mind introverted. This Vairagya puts a break to=\r\n the extrovert tendency of the mind. Even if the mind runs towards objects,=\r\n at once it will point out that there is pain there, that sensual enjoyment=\r\n is the cause&lt;BR&gt;for rebirth and intense suffering. So the mind is terribly=\r\n afraid, and gradually through intense practice, it is established in\n real=\r\n, lasting, sustained, intense Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya is of two kinds als=\r\no: Para Vairagya and Apara Vairagya. Para Vairagya comes after one attains =\r\nSelf-realisation. The whole world then looks like a straw. That is intense =\r\nspiritual strength. That is Para Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Without Vairagya there ca=\r\nnnot be any real spiritual progress. In Vedanta it is the only vital, funda=\r\nmental Sadhana. If you have Vairagya, all other virtues will come by themse=\r\nlves. Patanjali Maharshi says &quot;Abhyaasa vairaagyaabhyaam tan nirodhah&quot;=E2=\r\n=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by meditation or Sadhana and Vairagya.&quot; They =\r\nare the two wings of the aspirant to soar high into the realm of Immortal A=\r\nbode. The same thing Lord Krishna also says. &quot;Abhyasena tu Kaunteya, vairag=\r\nyena cha grihyate&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;The mind is controlled by practice and Vairagya=\r\n, dispassion, intense detachment.&quot; By Vairagya, the mind is detached. He wh=\r\no works in a detached way is not bound by Karma. So it is aspirants&#39; duty t=\r\no\n cultivate this one virtue, or Sadhana-anka, Vairagya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vairagya is=\r\n doubtless a mental state wherein the mind does not run into sensual groove=\r\ns. It moves towards Atma, towards God. Queen Chudalai ruled a kingdom, and =\r\nyet she had absolute Para Vairagya. Even amidst the temptations of the worl=\r\nd, she had mental Vairagya through Vichar and wisdom. So she was not affect=\r\ned in the least by the attractive objects of the world, even though she rul=\r\ned a kingdom; whereas her husband, Sikhidhwaja, went to the forest renounci=\r\nng his kingdom, yet he was not established in Vairagya. He was attached to =\r\nthe body, he was attached to his Kamandalu. A man may be attached to any on=\r\ne object.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You see a Vairagi. His whole body is smeared with ash, but=\r\n he will fight for a rupee if he finds you giving a rupee to another Vairag=\r\ni. This is his mental state. So by external appearance you cannot tell that=\r\n one has Vairagya. Vairagya is a mental state. Sri Ramanuja does not\n belon=\r\ng to this extreme type of Vairagya=E2=80=94wearing only a rope around the w=\r\naist. He was amidst luxurious things, but his mind was not polluted. He had=\r\n that mental state of Vairagya, detachment, indifference, born of Viveka.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lord Krishna says that He is not in favour of extreme asceticism. &quot;Ka=\r\nrshayantah sareerastham bhootagramamachetas ah, mam chaivantassareerast ham=\r\n tan vidhyasuranischayan .&quot;=E2=80=94&quot;They torture all the elements in the b=\r\nody and Me also who dwells in the body.&quot; Lord Buddha also tortured his body=\r\n, and later on he found out that there was not much spiritual progress; and=\r\n then he came to the golden medium, the middle path. So we should go by the=\r\n middle path always. The body is an instrument for attaining Self-realisati=\r\non. Especially in this Kali Yuga, Prana lives in the bones. So you should n=\r\not torture the body. Whatever is needed for the body you should have. You s=\r\nhould not expose the body to chill. God has given common sense. So you\n sho=\r\nuld practise &quot;common sense Sadhana&quot;. There is no harm in taking good, healt=\r\nhy food. Every man has got a different physical constitution. You should us=\r\ne common sense in your Sadhana. If you are weak and if you cannot sit for a=\r\n long&lt;BR&gt;time in one Asan, you can take a little Chyavanaprash or some frui=\r\nts. You should have extreme or &quot;Teevra&quot; Vairagya internally and at the same=\r\n time follow the middle path externally.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Generally, aspirants say: &quot;=\r\nI have given up umbrella.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I take only one meal.&quot; Their whole Sad=\r\nhana is: &quot;I have given up shirt.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I have given up sweater.&quot;=E2=80=\r\n=A6 &quot;I have given up shoes.&quot;=E2=80=A6 &quot;I live only on bread and dhal.&quot; Thei=\r\nr Sadhana consists in &quot;giving up&quot;=E2=80=94give up this, give up that. Real =\r\nspiritual life does not involve any giving up or taking. There is no giving=\r\n up or taking. The only thing is, you should not give leniency to the mind.=\r\n If you are very hungry in the morning, take one or two iddalies and a smal=\r\nl cup of milk.\n Vairagya is a mental state. But do not give leniency to the=\r\n mind. It will hurl you down. Always be watchful. Be eternally vigilant.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the present moment, there is Swami Krishnananda in Gangotri. He is =\r\na great Vairagi. For the last so many years he is living without clothing i=\r\nn the icy region and he sleeps over the ice sometimes. Rai Bahadur Modi gav=\r\ne a very good description of him, sleeping on the ice. He found him to be a=\r\n wonderful man and made him his Guru.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Avadhoot Kesavananda is anothe=\r\nr Vairagi. He was living in Rishikesh. He was very much liked by Malaviaji.=\r\n He always slept on grass. Malaviaji once took him to Mussoorie. He refused=\r\n to sleep on blanket. It was raining, and Malaviaji had to bring grass for =\r\nhim to sleep. He was a Vairagi. Vairagi is a cult. Our Ram Kumar belongs to=\r\n this cult. They put ash all over the body and make the hair look golden, a=\r\nnd they wear a very thick rope, of the size used for drawing chariots. This=\r\n is\n Vairagya Sampradaya. In Lakshman Jhula there is a Vairagi. They do Pan=\r\nchagni Tapas. They have got a physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is another great =\r\nVairagi, our Sendamangalam Brahmendra Swami. He lived on Gomukha Vritti. He=\r\n used to take food left in the leaves that are thrown out by others after m=\r\neals. &quot;Avadhootas&quot; are naked people. They have no clothing or home. Real Av=\r\nadhoota is one who has shaved his mind of all Vasanas. When all Vasanas are=\r\n destroyed, you will have Manolaya. Brahmendra Swami lived a very austere l=\r\nife. He was Poornabodha&#39; s Guru and Swami Krishnananda&#39; s Guru. Once in his=\r\n Ashram, they prepared very good food, and Brahmendra Swami ordered the foo=\r\nd to be given to cows. He used to make severe tests. Sankarananda is also h=\r\nis disciple. He had a very strong body and lived an austere life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--=\r\n---------- --------- ---&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;`Light on Vairagya&#39; will resume next week.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-519221652-1270360985=:79597--\r\n\n"}}
