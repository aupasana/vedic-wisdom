Yes, trying to delink the kundalini experience and=\r\n defining it in terms modern has serious problems because the modern wester=\r\nn thought structure is NOT build to tackle this is all its manifestations a=\r\nnd subtlety. There are deep fundamental differences which cannot be bridged=\r\n. \n\n\nI knew an person who had a similar experience graph. First he sees a h=\r\nuge allconsuimg light, a feeling of endless love and joy and beauty, a nice=\r\n powerful state of mind and body, then a voice starts speaking and telling =\r\nhim how special he is, eventually the voice gives him sexual and/or murdero=\r\nus instructions. His state deteriorated so badly that his folks at home too=\r\nk him to a hundred doctors from US to UK to whatnot, he simply could not be=\r\n cured. I don&#39;t know what happened later on. They also went to many spiritu=\r\nal God-men yet nothing happened.\n\n\nThe problem is when due to sudden life e=\r\nxperiences the ordinary mind calms down, and some form of shakti awakens, i=\r\nt also opens up some part of the human mind-body complex to ALL influences.=\r\n Herein lies the catch. The person is as much opened up to positive influen=\r\nces as s/he is to negative influences. The subtle world is as good or as ba=\r\nd as our physical world. It will require some deep maturity to understand t=\r\neh right from teh wrong in this world. As such this plane has no Light (pra=\r\nkash) of the Supreme. Each, when they enter, must bring in his/her own Ligh=\r\nt. Many over ages have lost their path in this world. Beyond the astral lie=\r\ns teh causal world. Accessing this is MUCH more difficult and rarely will a=\r\n person experience a Kundalini awakening which takes him/her to this plane =\r\ndirectly. Here, nothing even remotely negative in nature can survive, not e=\r\nven the mightest Asura.\n\nComing to teh world of the sukshma jagat, to survi=\r\nve such a sudden opening into this mixed world the consciousness has to be =\r\nprepared deeply with pre-fed conducive ideals of love, peace, purity, equan=\r\namity, non-attachment, greater reverence for a Devata, humility etc etc. Th=\r\ne spiritual-cultural cushioning has to be ready and well integrated to surv=\r\nive this. This is sadhana or bhuta-suddhi, constant self-purification. The =\r\nbest protection, if such a thing is possible, is to open up the heart compl=\r\netely by going deeper in meditation behind the vishnu granthi. There is an =\r\ninherent Light inside it. IF this process is done properly, then this inher=\r\nent Light of the Divine accompanies the sadhaka at all times and there is n=\r\no chance of delusion ever. Unlike the mind, which knows very little and get=\r\ns swayed by appearances, the true heart can never be deluded. Of course, ev=\r\nen getting to this opening of the heart is not easy at all and may take lif=\r\netimes of\n efforts.=C2=A0 \n\n=C2=A0\nTypically when self-importance increases=\r\n due to an unprovoked K experience, it is because the manipura chakra - and=\r\n the individuals sense of power and control and authority has not yet been =\r\nmade to submit to the Divine. Sexual thoughts awaken because the instict of=\r\n lust has not yet been submited to the Divine. ETC ETC. \n\nThe human self is=\r\n not one but a composite of many things. Each part has to be controlled and=\r\n offered to the Supreme. THAT is the highest sadhana. Our Rishis understood=\r\n the complex nature of the human mind-body far far better than what western=\r\n medicine understands today.\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhaya=\r\nh |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n___________________=\r\n_____________\n From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Saturday, 2 March =\r\n2013 9:21 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrome\n \n\n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 YES=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0 homame=C2=A0=C2=A0 is=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n the=C2=A0 best .=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0But the main cul=\r\nprit is vata dosha and while attending to that ,the symptoms also have to b=\r\ne allieviated .

But ho=\r\nw is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? F=\r\neatures of both include similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smellin=\r\ng things that others cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;=\r\nhallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or the result of kundalini derang=\r\nement- we have no diagnostic test. \n&gt;\n&gt;However most doctors are pretty good=\r\n at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinati=\r\nons, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and diffe=\r\nrent from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini=\r\n patient. \n&gt;\n&gt;About vata, most of our patients have severe problems with sl=\r\neep and appetite. They are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor app=\r\netite)... definite vata derangement. We try and help with this with medicat=\r\nion and lifestyle advice.

See all the saints. You a=\r\nre unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all=\r\n lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). However the=\r\n internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completel=\r\ny that some great ones were completely unaware of their external problems.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to slee=\r\np.I sometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air=\r\n by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s sur=\r\nrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mo=\r\nther so it&#39;s feeling is that of\n joy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that t=\r\nhey have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother =\r\ntakes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;That =\r\nresults in the problem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges&quot; of energy may=C2=A0result=C2=\r\n=A0in mental havoc.=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kund=\r\nalini rise are brought up with the concept of japa.

A true Kun=\r\ndalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, i=\r\nn food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish=\r\n Vata, all=C2=A0that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. C=\r\nontrol of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the=\r\n body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in dif=\r\nficult real cases may be useful.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Then institute small=C2=A0Homas to Mah=\r\naGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should r=\r\neally improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The who=\r\nle process may be chalked out over one-two years.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non real case=\r\ns, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R.\n Rao wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with p=\r\nsychiatric problems may expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but =\r\nit may or may not be one.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that =\r\nKundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis without one having gon=\r\ne through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitu=\r\nde and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One ma=\r\ny wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana, =\r\nwhile many serious sadhakas may not experience it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly=\r\n, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL\n&gt;&gt; STEP in overc=\r\noming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analo=\r\ngy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n&gt;&gt; body-mi=\r\nnd complex)\n to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palac=\r\ne over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occas=\r\nionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for =\r\nout of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fa=\r\nct, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing=\r\n in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization witho=\r\nut any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasis=\r\nhtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get some=\r\nthing without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may =\r\nhave deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put en=\r\nough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepa=\r\nred (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try\n not to fancy too many specific\n&gt;&gt; desi=\r\nres. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of cons=\r\ntraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR\n&gt;&gt; OWN pre=\r\nvious actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you =\r\nno longer want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for gre=\r\nat wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next =\r\nlife. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the =\r\nlife after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or mon=\r\ney. In another \n&gt;&gt; case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One=\r\n may be reborn \n&gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not re=\r\nally enjoy that \n&gt;&gt; experience. Basically, people keep going in circles thr=\r\nough various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply\n desires an out of=\r\n body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas cons=\r\ntrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with th=\r\nis specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force be=\r\nhind it).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini ris=\r\ne is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of =\r\nattitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a =\r\nmouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake=\r\n violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared t=\r\nhat I would kill it!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to t=\r\nhe mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued fro=\r\nm a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (vi=\r\nz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinit=\r\ne Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stage=\r\n involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most un=\r\ndesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than\n&gt;&gt; Kundalini rise fo=\r\nrced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s syste=\r\nm.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion about who on=\r\ne is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in conscious=\r\nness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion=\r\n &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex th=\r\nat one&#39;s\n awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a gr=\r\neat scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a=\r\n hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy =\r\nthat he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s=\r\n self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can =\r\ncause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet remain in i=\r\ngnorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a s=\r\nystem with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wro=\r\nng notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recommen=\r\nd is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, over=\r\ncome\n your\n&gt;&gt; weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I wa=\r\nnt to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/=\r\npeople around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a=\r\n negative attachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt;&gt; whether =\r\nyour Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 i=\r\nnternal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt;&gt; not. If yo=\r\nur ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF y=\r\nour Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you compl=\r\netely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt;&gt; will automatically=\r\n ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to\n a personal deity. Th=\r\nough true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do =\r\nbusiness with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the p=\r\nlain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and plea=\r\nse give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and p=\r\nlease protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something yo=\r\nu want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, des=\r\nires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fa=\r\nscination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything L=\r\nord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;=\r\ns prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord wi=\r\nth fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong\n =\r\nnotions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thi=\r\nnking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one =\r\nas said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to=\r\n my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect i=\r\nt, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* fr=\r\nom God&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind lik=\r\ne grave danger that one should run away from!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, dev=\r\nelop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can =\r\nbe taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, bu=\r\nt be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light =\r\nmental conditioning\n (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as =\r\none&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities =\r\nin one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her=\r\n from meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your co=\r\nnditioning is.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;___________________________=\r\n_____\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Febru=\r\nary 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly cor=\r\nrect=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the=\r\n ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and man=\r\nthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havo=\r\nc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a=\r\n mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wip=\r\ned off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements=\r\n that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this\n transla=\r\ntes into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control o=\r\nf anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening=\r\n happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. =\r\nDevotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of =\r\nthe journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and wh=\r\nen it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other =\r\nthings and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of =\r\nthem are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual fo=\r\nr its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and natur=\r\ne and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience=\r\n of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholog=\r\ny are because of this. The human psychology as\n understood by west today is=\r\n puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible =\r\nsometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various su=\r\nbtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;rup=\r\ntured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, t=\r\nrauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind a=\r\nnd they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very com=\r\nplex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down ev=\r\nery option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few =\r\ncan have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they =\r\ncan do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nSometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved=\r\n, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks=\r\n used to say - Mens sana in corpore\n sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwam=\r\najAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_=\r\n1080 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursd=\r\nay, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndr=\r\nome\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of k=\r\nundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am =\r\ndoing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of so=\r\nmeone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their\n kund=\r\nalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges=\r\n of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of =\r\nkundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. W=\r\ne have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests =\r\nnormal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people=\r\n we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or =\r\nunwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and r=\r\nesearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patie=\r\nnts are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatmen=\r\nts for deranged\n&gt;&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to f=\r\norcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feel=\r\ning that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill=\r\n herself at times because the suffering from the deranged\n energy is so bad=\r\n. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from=\r\n. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one w=\r\nas to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve =\r\nthe suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength =\r\nto bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her=\r\n, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really=\r\n is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in t=\r\nhis situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest=\r\n. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kun=\r\ndalini\n&gt;&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.

It will require som=\r\ne deep maturity to understand teh right from teh wrong in this world. As su=\r\nch this plane has no Light (prakash) of the Supreme. Each, when they enter,=\r\n must bring in his/her own Light. Many over ages have lost their path in th=\r\nis world. Beyond the astral lies teh causal world.

This is sadhana or\n bhuta-suddhi, co=\r\nnstant self-purification. The best protection, if such a thing is possible,=\r\n is to open up the heart completely by going deeper in meditation behind th=\r\ne vishnu granthi. There is an inherent Light inside it. IF this process is =\r\ndone properly, then this inherent Light of the Divine accompanies the sadha=\r\nka at all times and there is no chance of delusion ever. Unlike the mind, w=\r\nhich knows very little and gets swayed by appearances, the true heart can n=\r\never be deluded. Of course, even getting to this opening of the heart is no=\r\nt easy at all and may take lifetimes of efforts.&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Typically when self-importance increases due to an unprovoked K=\r\n experience, it is because the manipura chakra - and the individuals sense =\r\nof power and control and authority has not yet been made to submit to the D=\r\nivine.

But how is a doctor to tell apart=\r\n kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include sim=\r\nilar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot=\r\n experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these =\r\nhallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnosti=\r\nc test. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the atten=\r\ntion-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses..=\r\n.. their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;=\r\nI hear voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;About=\r\n vata, most of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. T=\r\nhey are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite =\r\nvata derangement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle a=\r\ndvice. The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m\n=\r\n sure this does no good for vata.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Ganapati homam idea sounds goo=\r\nd, and I will do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot reco=\r\nmmend this to any patient. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful=\r\n/harmful in the kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as=\r\n &quot;psychosis&quot; and will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc=\r\n. I hope this will not harm them, though I doubt it will help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advic=\r\ne and thoughts from all members would be much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Om Dum Du=\r\nrgayai Namaha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aparna&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; yma=\r\nilto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Niyama is=\r\n very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you. in actual fact, that=\r\n is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;However,&nbsp;the hold of the I ness on everyth=\r\ning is so tremendous that its difficult to let go enough that you can allow=\r\n this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine=\r\n such a force, because they are conditioned to think in words, most psychia=\r\ntrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God completely anyway.&lt;br&gt;&gt; This,&nbsp=\r\n;combined with the fact that for&nbsp;most people, Kundalini is not wanted =\r\nbecause these\n people&nbsp;want the objects which God can give, not God Her=\r\nself, means that the scope for misunderstanding is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nEverybody wants happiness but most are unable to realise that &quot;material obj=\r\nects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;That&#39;s li=\r\nfe for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely to see even one who lived =\r\na life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(when looked at =\r\nby an external observer). However the internal joy of Kundalini is somethin=\r\ng which fills that saint so completely that some great ones were completely=\r\n unaware of their external problems.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakt=\r\ni) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes&nbsp;compare Kun=\r\ndalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s loo=\r\nk of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby k=\r\nnows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that o=\r\nf\n joy.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they have to learn surr=\r\nender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not =\r\na painless process unlike that of the baby.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;That results in the=\r\n problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;result&nbsp;in mental h=\r\navoc.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who=\r\n have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of japa. Japa which de=\r\nals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can cause serious instabi=\r\nlity in these people.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;people who have Kun=\r\ndalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a single w=\r\northwhile thing in their lives and think that the faking of Kundalini rises=\r\n may help them get some esteem in the eye of the general public.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, for any doctor, the sepa=\r\nration of the true from the false claims must precede any attempt at\n helpi=\r\nng the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata ten=\r\nds to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, t=\r\nravel.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp;that must be regimentalis=\r\ned, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramha=\r\ncharya. Application of oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful.=\r\n I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases may be useful.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to =\r\nbe performed by the patient. That should really improve matters, as Ganesha=\r\n is The Lord of the Muladhara.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked=\r\n out over one-two years.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychothe=\r\nrapy may be sufficient.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Ram=\r\na&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.\n Rao wrote:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;Someone with psychiatric problems may expereience what sounds like a Ku=\r\nndalini rise, but it may or may not be one.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously rising thro=\r\nugh various nadis without one having gone through proper preparation in thi=\r\ns life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and development of detachment) C=\r\nAN create havoc!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how =\r\nKundalini may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana, while many se=\r\nrious sadhakas may not experience it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s smal=\r\nl dilapidated house (this&lt;br&gt;&gt; body-mind complex)\n to a huge palace (rea=\r\nlized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into it when =\r\nit is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the pala=\r\nce still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kun=\r\ndalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The forme=\r\nr approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progres=\r\ns towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. Th=\r\nese are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something withou=\r\nt wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply =\r\ndesired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort.=\r\n As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and iro=\r\nnically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try\n not to fancy too many specif=\r\nic&lt;br&gt;&gt; desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (=\r\nbecause of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from =\r\nYOUR&lt;br&gt;&gt; OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you =\r\nwant LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, =\r\none may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but ve=\r\nry sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life=\r\n for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have =\r\nany knowledge or money. In another &lt;br&gt;&gt; case, one may deeply desire to =\r\nact in a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;br&gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog and ac=\r\nt in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;br&gt;&gt; experience. Basicall=\r\ny, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; som=\r\nething they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, c=\r\noming back to Kundalini, if one deeply\n desires an out of body experience g=\r\niven by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from hav=\r\ning it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire=\r\n destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if on=\r\ne is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to =\r\nfree it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to =\r\nsave it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to t=\r\nhe mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued fro=\r\nm a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If our idea=\r\ns about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and i=\r\nf we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization=\r\n of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, with=\r\nout being scared?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable c=\r\nonditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;br&gt;&gt; Kundalini rise forced w=\r\nhen some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic not=\r\nion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried dee=\r\nper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one over=\r\ncomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body=\r\n-mind complex that one&#39;s\n awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a gr=\r\neat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if =\r\none person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the worl=\r\nd, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world=\r\n now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such=\r\n notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and=\r\n yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning m=\r\nay accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious =\r\npsychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I r=\r\necommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhan=\r\na, overcome\n your&lt;br&gt;&gt; weaknesses and improve your detachment over time.=\r\n Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for =\r\nlife/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachm=\r\nent. It is a negative attachment.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;br&gt;&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or n=\r\not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripu=\r\ns) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &lt;br&gt;&gt; not. If your ability to resist=\r\n them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fas=\r\nt asleep, you are still making progress. When you completely overcome them,=\r\n Kundalini (your self-awareness) &lt;br&gt;&gt; will automatically ascend to the =\r\ntop and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrenderi=\r\nng to\n a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do n=\r\not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be offended=\r\n by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am s=\r\ncared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all th=\r\nis is just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask god for=\r\n it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectati=\r\nons. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualitie=\r\ns of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whet=\r\nher it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it =\r\ngratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasur=\r\ne, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong\n notio=\r\nns experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking=\r\n of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as sa=\r\nid below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;=\r\nchipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, bu=\r\nt it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from Go=\r\nd&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt; protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind lik=\r\ne grave danger that one should run away from!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether thr=\r\nough the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Re=\r\nalize that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it wh=\r\nile you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything a=\r\nnytime. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning\n (very light d=\r\nesires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True=\r\n Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract risin=\r\ng Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning i=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Nar=\r\nasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology &amp; Spiritualit=\r\ny Resources: &lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;_________=\r\n_______________________&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense b=\r\nhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka=\r\n and remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas=\r\n with out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter =\r\nin to the inner planes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we=\r\n are under the protection of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; distu=\r\nrbances will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements tha=\r\nt compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this\n translates =\r\ninto more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of an=\r\nger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening hap=\r\npens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devo=\r\ntion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the =\r\njourney. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when i=\r\nt really does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other thin=\r\ngs and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them=\r\n are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for it=\r\ns own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature an=\r\nd miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experienc=\r\ne of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholo=\r\ngy are because of this. The human psychology as\n understood by west today i=\r\ns puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible=\r\n sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various s=\r\nubtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ru=\r\nptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, =\r\ntrauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind =\r\nand they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very co=\r\nmplex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down e=\r\nvery option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few=\r\n can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they=\r\n can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ac=\r\nhieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient =\r\nGreeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore\n sano. -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;aw=\r\naktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyaya=\r\nmanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to war=\r\nn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient o=\r\nf mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in t=\r\nhe care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening o=\r\nf their\n kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experienc=\r\nes and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had ne=\r\nver heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an e=\r\nxplanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with he=\r\nr (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini=\r\n. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritua=\r\nl crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered i=\r\nnterest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunatel=\r\ny these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we hav=\r\ne no treatments for deranged&lt;br&gt;&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them. M=\r\nany yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady=\r\n confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This w=\r\noman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deranged=\r\n\n energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she =\r\ncannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem.=\r\n The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kun=\r\ndalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give=\r\n her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans amon=\r\ng you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- thei=\r\nr suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as =\r\nnot to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti m=\r\narga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot;=\r\n and leave the kundalini&lt;br&gt;&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.
