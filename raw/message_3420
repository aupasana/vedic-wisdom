May I ask anoth=\r\ner question in respect to Chandi path. I can read Sanskrit and know Hindi t=\r\noo but not fluently. While doing Nyasa few actions are mentioned which I fi=\r\nnd hard to understand. Is it necessary to perform all those actions while c=\r\nhanting the mantras or can one just keep reading the mantras and ignore the=\r\n actions. What role does these actions play?\n\nI know asking to record the w=\r\nhole of Chandi homam would be hard hence I would humbly request Narsimha Si=\r\nr, to please video record only the nyasa part. I think of all the Homams Ch=\r\nandi homam is a challenge. \n\nAlso I live in a hot place where dangerous spi=\r\nders and scorpions are a problem. Most of the time I throw them outside but=\r\n occasionally when they pose danger we have to kill them. I feel very guilt=\r\ny in doing so.
