Soon after creating the manual, I gave homa kundas to him \nand Narayan Iyer (who wrote here once) and they both started at the same \nnice muhurta on the Dattatreya Jayanti day in 2006. They are both doing \ndaily homam still.\n\nOn lustre etc:\n\nExternal things such as facial lustre are quite subjective, misleading and \nnot that important. Let us please leave out the superficial things.\n\nHonestly, at the time of the shooting, I was quite tired, without much sleep \nfor a few days and feeling a bit awkward and self-conscious about the \nartificialness of the shooting, i.e. pauses in the shooting to change angles \nfrequently as suggested by Manish. My focus was in bits and pieces and \nfrequently disturbed by the demands of the shooting. Only when I meditated \nat the end could I forget everything and sustain a good level of focus.\n\nOn &quot;severe sadhana&quot;:\n\nIn general, I encourage people to do serious sadhana, but I also urge them \nto constantly contemplate one&#39;s thoughts, motives and actions and \nconsciously try to improve self-control. Serious sadhana tends to bring \nthose changes internally, but it can still take a long time. There are some \nwho do serious sadhana for years and yet stuck in the quicksand of ego. Yes, \nego IS a quicksand. Getting out is very very tough.\n\nContemplation and conscious effort to overcome ego should go in parallel to \nthe &quot;severe sadhana&quot;. In fact, I see them as much as a part of one&#39;s sadhana \nas the external rituals, practices and meditation.\n\nWithout a conscious effort to weed out ego, even serious sadhana can cause \npride in one and make one fall. Perhaps nobody exists today who can do more \nsevere sadhana than Ravana. But, despite such severe penances, Ravana was \nnot immune to pride and he fell.\n\nSadhana makes things easier on the effort to overcome ego, but does not \nguarantee anything. One needs to supplement sadhana with a conscious effort \nto overcome ego.\n\nOn ochre/saffron robes:\n\nYes, they symbolize detachment. Clothes symbolize the gunas that condition \nour consciousness. Saffron is different from red. Saffron symbolizes \nsacrifice. Yellow color symbolizes auspiciousness. Red color symbolizes \nbravery and steadfastness. White color symbolizes peace and calmness. And so \non. Usually, white and yellow colors are preferred in rituals. But red color \nis the favorite of Ganesha. I was using a red color veshti simply because it \nwas gifted to me by my favorite priest who was originally instrumental in \ngiving us the resources that enabled the homam manuals.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 06, 2009 3:16 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Homam video\n\n\n&gt; Dear Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; Atleast we all feel there is some changes in Narashima recently\n&gt; external,unless he did a makeup for the video shoot :-) I hope not.\n&gt; His internal changes only he knows I am sure they are fantastic.\n&gt;\n&gt; For one to do severe sadhana, one needs blessing of god and guru, so\n&gt; that no obstacles crop up and also preparation for previous birth and\n&gt; this birth including intense desire. It is a pleasure to know that\n&gt; Narashima seems to have these.

I told\n&gt;&gt; myself that it is surely due to the amount of stress, his body must\n&gt;&gt; have gone thro&#39; because of tremendous Sadhanaas he has performed in\n&gt;&gt; recent years.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; like you all noticed, i was also pleasently surprised to see\n&gt;&gt; the &#39;Glowing Face&#39; of his in the video when i saw it for the first\n&gt;&gt; time day before yesterday. actually i was very happy to see his\n&gt;&gt; shining face in that video.\n&gt;&gt; BUT it hardly matters to me if his face is shining or lusterless.\n&gt; To\n&gt;&gt; be honest, Even his knowledge has not impressed me that much\n&gt; because\n&gt;&gt; You&#39;ll find great many &#39;Orators&#39; and philosophical lacturers. even\n&gt; i\n&gt;&gt; can give a good philosophical lacture. it may not be a big deal now\n&gt;&gt; a days. What has really impressed me is his attitude of engaging\n&gt;&gt; into practical Sadhanaas. He has inspired me with his demonstration\n&gt;&gt; of doing Sadhanaas. His steadfastness in putting long hours for\n&gt; God.\n&gt;&gt; 32 chandi Homas in 3 days is not a joke. He is very very serious in\n&gt;&gt; his quest for Realisation and THAT is the thing which inspires me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Utpal\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Padmaja Sunchu\n&gt;&gt; &lt;padmaja.sunchu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Om Vishnave Namah\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namasthe Mitesh\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Its a coincidence that I too was thinking of the same, when I\n&gt;&gt; first saw the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; video.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I had met Sri Narasimha garu in August 2006 at the SJC West Coast\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Conference,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and I see a lustre in his face now.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Srinivasa\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 6, 2009 at 7:21 AM, m540i98 &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;   Namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The video is very good, Good work by the video grapher and\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a pleasure watching it and I feel that I will watch it a\n&gt;&gt; few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; more times.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Most importantly I want to bring out the fact that when one\n&gt; does\n&gt;&gt; a lot\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; japams and homams, the good work is reflected in the persons\n&gt;&gt; face,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the lustre etc. Although I have not met Narasimha ever, I have\n&gt;&gt; seen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one picture of him may be from many years ago and now the video.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a striking difference between the two.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The transformation internally may be more intense and\n&gt; fantanstic.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On a different note, I have heard from a very realized soul that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks is\n&gt;&gt; reserved\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for them, it is not advisible for people like us married or\n&gt;&gt; single to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; put it on.
