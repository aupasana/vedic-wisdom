How can i\n&gt; &gt; again experie=\r\nnce the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done =\r\ncorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the=\r\n deity commanding a\n&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen( be it what appears to be g=\r\nood or be it that\n&gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is=\r\n crucial. Ugra\n&gt;\n &gt; devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself=\r\n, so self\n&gt; &gt; identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolut=\r\nion\n&gt; &gt; continues.\n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according=\r\n to me which is black magic.\n&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti =\r\nand deity is a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara,=\r\n Chinnamasta, then your power\n&gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided you=\r\n have Vijnana). After the death\n&gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka joins the r=\r\nealm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a se=\r\nparate realm reserved for these\n&gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak bri=\r\nngs the full bearing of karma onto the heads\n&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some =\r\npeople may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar =\r\nNath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an earthquake).=\r\n Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only =\r\naction and reaction.(Bit like you attack\n&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will =\r\nget a result of this from that same Atma\n&gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 =\r\nlifetimes later. But if you attack\n&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the=\r\n universe and has very few karmas\n&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attack=\r\ns you, because your attack is not\n&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identifica=\r\ntion, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti po=\r\nssesed by a small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti wh=\r\nich can be used, moreover=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will no=\r\nt be free of identification with\n&gt; &gt; the body and so their actions are thos=\r\ne which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; black magic. These people usually join =\r\nthe same spirits\n which they have\n&gt; &gt; been using after death, this is not a=\r\nn enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for=\r\n a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that de=\r\nity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(bec=\r\nause of his previous\n&gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this=\r\n mantra only in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind ev=\r\nery mantra are crucial and may not\n&gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; Accord=\r\ning to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me\n&gt; &gt; suggest =\r\nan easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day,=\r\n do 1000\n&gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayat=\r\nri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; Sam=\r\ne time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same\n place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is yo=\r\nur inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, n=\r\not just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 h=\r\nrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; See=\r\n the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; &gt; Long and short , =\r\nwhat is important is that life may be short, so do some\n&gt; &gt; sadhana, and pe=\r\nrsist with that sadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; I ho=\r\npe this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82\n&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; You may post this on the list =\r\nas a\n clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\n\n\n\nThe =\r\nINTERNET now has a personality.

How can i&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in=\r\n the sadhak or the deity commanding a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; certain thing to happen(=\r\n be it what appears to be good or be it that&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; which appears to =\r\nbe bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; devatas ma=\r\nke the person care almost for nothing himself, so self&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identif=\r\nication is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; cont=\r\ninues.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C3=82 very little=C3=82 according to=\r\n me which is black magic.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your S=\r\nhakti and deity is a higher shakti&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, =\r\nMahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; will be that of G=\r\nod himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the=\r\n body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; beings.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full be=\r\naring of karma onto the heads&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of the attackers and some people=\r\n may realise this to their detriment(&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandh=\r\nar Nath burying the city of Patan with his&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Shakti causing an =\r\nearthquake). Some people may even equate this with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; black magic=\r\n. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\na normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few =\r\nkarmas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because you=\r\nr attack is not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie =\r\nGod or the universe).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti po=\r\nssesed by a small Pisacha,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little =\r\nShakti which can be used, moreover=C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; then their minds and =\r\nintellects will not be free of identification with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the body an=\r\nd so their actions are those which are generally termed as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; bla=\r\nck magic. These people usually join the same spirits\n which they have&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, the=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such=\r\n a sadhak&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(becaus=\r\ne of his previous&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; effort).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; On the other hand some=\r\nbody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; feel that the=\r\n 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ach=\r\neive in this lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the puddin=\r\ng is in the eating, so let me&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C3=82 call this the=C3=82 Gayatri, bu=\r\nt the real&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Same time every day.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same\n place.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same m=\r\naterials.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Same direction.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As little movement as o=\r\nne can.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do no=\r\nt eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nbefore you start.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole=\r\n procedure 3 times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality bef=\r\nore and after.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life=\r\n may be short, so do some&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadha=\r\nna for as long as is physically&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; possible.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I hope =\r\nthis clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; manish&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; You may post this on the list as a\n clarification from me if you feel&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; that this is suitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td=\r\n&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personali=\r\nty.
