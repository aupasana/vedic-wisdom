He is troubled by some professional rivals. A priest recommended Prat=\r\nyangira homam and performed it for him. Some people mistakenly believe that=\r\n Pratyangira homam gives relief from this kind of petty troubles.\n \nInspite=\r\n of the risk of offending some elders, I want to put my foot down and asser=\r\nt one thing strongly and bluntly, for whatever it is worth. More learned on=\r\nes who disagree with me may kindly forgive me and ignore me.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nPratyangira is a very very powerful deity and very very few peopl=\r\ne know today how to worship her properly. I am talking about all kinds of w=\r\norship here - worshipping Her in an external fire and worshipping Her in on=\r\ne&#39;s own internal fire and Kundalini shakti.\n \nI do not want to emphasize th=\r\ne necessity to learn to worship Her properly, because very very few people =\r\nare actually *ready* for worshipping this form today. Many other forms are =\r\nfar more suitable for most people.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPratyangira is a=\r\nn astra devata (astra=3Dweapon). A powerful automatic gun may be used to sh=\r\noot a specific object at a large distance when an expert uses it. If one is=\r\n not an expert, the gun may not fire at all or may hit some other object. O=\r\nne is better off staying away from the gun in that case.\n \nI can give an al=\r\nlegory for today&#39;s situation w.r.t. Pratyangira.\n \nOne&#39;s Mother had a very =\r\npowerful automatic gun. She was a high official in military and used the gu=\r\nn in some important wars she participated in. Once upon a time, one of her =\r\nsons learnt how to use the gun and knew how to knock down powerful enemies =\r\nin a combat using that gun.\n \nMany years later, a small young boy of the la=\r\ndy was being troubled by a bully at school. He wanted to solve the problem.=\r\n A friend at school, who was known in his circle as a smart person, suggest=\r\ned using his mother&#39;s gun. They messed around with mother&#39;s gun, but nothin=\r\ng happened because they did not know how to use it. But that was good, beca=\r\nuse there could have been an accident and one of them could have been hurt =\r\nin the exercise! Luckily, his mother put a locking mechanism on the gun bec=\r\nause she had young children at home. Another time, a smart frind who knew h=\r\now to unlock it but not knowing fully how to use the gun, unlocked it and s=\r\nhot it. He ended up unintentionally hurting the young boy.\n \nIn today&#39;s dee=\r\npening age of Kali, &quot;locking mechanism&quot; is put on astra vidyas such as Prat=\r\nyangira, Bala, Atibala, Mahabala, Paashupata etc. Going back to my allegory=\r\n, because the home (world of sadhana) now includes a lot of young boys (mos=\r\nt of us with half-knowledge and incomplete spiritual maturity), mother has =\r\nplaced locking mechanism on dangerous weapons that are risky in the hands o=\r\nf young children. She did not want automatic guns, assault rifles, missile =\r\nlaunchers etc to be used for getting back at a school bully. When one is br=\r\nave enough, decides that one does not fear the possibility of death and wan=\r\nts to go and fight the enemies of the nation in a war, then those big weapo=\r\nns are useful. They are not meant for standing up to a school bully.\n \nIf s=\r\nomeone helps us unlock the weapons, it is still a bad idea to try using the=\r\nm. It is very risky. The best thing a child can do when a school bully is t=\r\nroubling is to tell his mother about it and let her handle it. Taking mothe=\r\nr&#39;s weapons and trying to handle it oneself is a very bad idea.\n \nSimialrly=\r\n, performing Pratyangira homam to overcome the obstacles caused by an enemy=\r\n or a rival or take care of some such material troubles is unwise and risky=\r\n. When one is very pure and saattwik and battle with a tamasik force has ag=\r\nitated a highly pure one, she is to be used as a weapon to bring down that =\r\nagitation and restore sattwa. Her purpose is a really high one and inapplic=\r\nable to most people.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSome temples perform Pratyangi=\r\nra homam regularly. I see it as an obedient son taking the automatic gun of=\r\n his mother, dusting it off, cleaning it, lubricating it and putting back w=\r\nhere it belongs. The son may do this service on a regular basis, without ex=\r\npecting any result and out of love for mother. That is fine.\n \nThe problem =\r\ncomes only when a son tries to use the weapon against his enemies or rivals=\r\n.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you look at Pratyangira&#39;s story, she came into=\r\n being to pacify Lord Narasimha, who drank the blood of the demon he killed=\r\n. The guna caused in him by the demon&#39;s blood created big problems for the =\r\nuniverse and Pratyangira pacified Lord Narasimha and filled him with pure s=\r\nattwa again.\n \nIf a goddess could pacify a deeply agitated and angry incarn=\r\nation of Narayana himself and restore sattwa in him, you can imagine what t=\r\nhat goddess must be like. She is the ultimate power to restore saattwa and =\r\nremove all kind of disturbance from one&#39;s consciousness. Such a high deity =\r\nof purity, equanimity and sattwa restoration has been converted to one who =\r\nruins one&#39;s enemies and rivals and gives material success and several peopl=\r\ne perform Pratyangira homam with dried red chillies etc for petty purposes.=\r\n\n \nJust as a young boy is better off approaching one&#39;s mother when harassed=\r\n by a school bully instead of trying to use his mother&#39;s machine gun, we ar=\r\ne better off approaching the Mother and asking for help rather than trying =\r\nto use Pratyangira shakti. Chandi homam, saptashati chanting, lalita sahasr=\r\na nama chanting etc can be used instead of Pratyangira vidya. Surrender to =\r\nthe Mother and chant her prayers, instead of trying to use her sophisticate=\r\nd astra shakti directly.\n \nNext time somebody suggests a Pratyangira homam =\r\nfor material problems, please think of what I wrote.\n \nAs I have already sa=\r\nid, more learned ones who disagree with me may kindly forgive me and ignore=\r\n me.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarp=\r\nana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------ \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_038D_01C915DA.08E37CF0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I recently saw the chart of a person who =\r\nis in some \ntroubles.
