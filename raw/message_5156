The only major point where I disagree is whether one can do Sri\nSri Chan=\r\ndi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion on\ntranslation of m=\r\nantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some\nunnecessary confu=\r\nsion. A few pointers:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. There are various sacred chants embedded with=\r\nin the Vedas, Puranas,\nAgamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can =\r\nbe categorised as\nmantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras to=\r\no are also treated\nas mahamantras and mantras. The Samhita portion of the V=\r\nedas too is referred\nto as mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Undoubtedly mantras and stotras=\r\n have to be chanted in the original.\nReading a translation is not even comp=\r\narable to chanting the original chant.\nSo far it is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Whilst ma=\r\nntra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition\nmakes a dist=\r\ninction between them.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. As per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need =\r\nto be initiated to chant a\nstotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with=\r\n most mantras. Mantras\ncontaining bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of M=\r\nahavidyas etc need\ninitiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from t=\r\nhe Veda Samhita are\nnot the same as these other mantras that need initiatio=\r\nn, which are\ngenerally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you =\r\ncall these\nmantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral parts=\r\n of larger\nand distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as in =\r\nthe case of\nMahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Vishnusahasranama, Siva=\r\nsahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need\ninitiation as they fall under s=\r\ntotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and\nDevi Mahatmyam are traditionally=\r\n viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of\npuranas. They have a larger statu=\r\ns as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana.\nChanting them without initiatio=\r\nn is not recommended especially when the\nreader combines the navarna or sho=\r\ndashi mantras too as an integral part of\nthe chanting.\n&gt; \n&gt; 6. I know from =\r\npersonal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi\nas well as Srin=\r\ngeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of\nSri Sri Chand=\r\ni and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND\nSHODASAKSHARI ma=\r\nntras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the\nsadhana. Acharyas=\r\n of both these traditions hold that one needs to be\ninitiated to chant the =\r\nNavarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. Recapping my earlier sta=\r\nnce, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an\nindependent status by itsel=\r\nf as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a\nMahavidya, a Yogasastra as=\r\n well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the\nUpanishads. ***As a Mahavidy=\r\na the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri\nChandi path***. Thus tradit=\r\nion holds that one needs to be initiated to chant\nit. However if one wishes=\r\n to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth\naspects of the Devi Mahatm=\r\nyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular\nhas been recommended in my=\r\n write-up, as chanting the original along with the\nnavakshari amounts to pr=\r\nacticing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it\nis recommended to be i=\r\nnitiated and go through the specialised sadhanas\nproperly under guidance.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 8. Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the\nor=\r\niginal Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya,\n=\r\nit has an inherent problem in our times. The problem with attempting to do =\r\na\nparayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that\n=\r\nmost readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or\nstotr=\r\nas such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 9. I you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget\ntrans=\r\nlating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing.\nNeither h=\r\nave I attempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of\nmantras do not=\r\n have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak.\nHowever it is recom=\r\nmended to know the essence or import (artha) of the\nmantra and its sadhana =\r\nwhile chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the\nessence of `Vak&#39;, not =\r\na translation! \n&gt; \n&gt; 10. For those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi pat=\r\nh without\ninitiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has t=\r\no be a\ncertain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path its=\r\nelf. We\nall have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no\ni=\r\nnitiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not\n=\r\nto do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is bette=\r\nr\nto just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That\nat=\r\ntitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will\nhappe=\r\nn on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the\ncompassion=\r\nate Goddess. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Satya Prakash \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&lt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; , h ramalin=\r\ngam &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; &gt; I want to share one=\r\n anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam\nSri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Chandrase=\r\nkara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; &gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore =\r\nin Karnataka One day all\nthe\n&gt; &gt; learned persons male and female alike\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrequested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada\nlanguage=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.\n&gt; &gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t =\r\nreply to this request which was made early in the\nmorning.\n&gt; &gt; Later in the=\r\n day after the days pooja etc were over as usual Postman\ncame to\n&gt; &gt; camp t=\r\no deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. Swamigal was\n&gt; &gt; seriousl=\r\ny looking at the cover\n&gt; &gt; in front of the learned members and was looking =\r\nat one line written as\nPIN\n&gt; &gt; Code and followed by six numbers. Then he as=\r\nked the learned members to\n&gt; &gt; explain the meaning of PIN Code and no one c=\r\nould tell that. But everyone\n&gt; &gt; understood the significance of that number=\r\n. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; &gt; member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviati=\r\nons book from his library and\nread\n&gt; &gt; the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER a=\r\nnd told the group that even the\nmeaning\n&gt; &gt; of PINCode was not known to the=\r\n group and still it serves the purpose\nand\n&gt; &gt; people are using it in day t=\r\no day work. Similarly not knowing the\nmeaning of\n&gt; &gt; Vishnu Saharanamam wil=\r\nl not take away the benefits of chanting the\nstothsram\n&gt; &gt; was he told the =\r\ngroup.

That is definitely the ideal\nsituation.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading some=\r\nthing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being even without understanding the me=\r\naning\nis very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapa=\r\nthi\nAtharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi=\r\n as the source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of surrender =\r\nto Ganapathi. One\ncan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experien=\r\ncing anything, it is\nmore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correc=\r\nt attitude and surrender\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the s=\r\npecific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the=\r\n meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The wo=\r\nrds uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; liter=\r\nal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important layers\nare\n&gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nost in translation. The most important layers of meaning are never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; un=\r\nderstood intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wheth=\r\ner you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rela=\r\nxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a\ntarget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nount and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of duty.\nIf it\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender to the deity, it=\r\n\ncan do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra is calmness of th=\r\ne mind.\nIf a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thoughts and chanting o=\r\nf the mantra\nis just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one of those thousand activities, nothing will h=\r\nappen. If most\nthoughts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subside and mind is essentially reverberating=\r\n with a mantra, that is\nwhen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical\nvibration is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts\nan=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mantras=\r\n\ncomposed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentially beings =\r\nwith very\nstable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such that the physical =\r\nvibration of the\nmantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can eventually cause the corresponding imager=\r\ny in the mind by\nresonance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when other mental activity subsides. Thus=\r\n, after repeating the mantra\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you can recre=\r\nate a certain imagery and thought\nsystem\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in your mind. That can perma=\r\nnently alter the way your mind workd. But\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; key is to attain a reas=\r\nonably stable, focused and calm mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marath=\r\ni interpretation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositio=\r\nns have a power of their own, as they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realized souls.

Th=\r\ney are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy.

But, even without it, a mantra that\nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used by great sadh=\r\nakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact=\r\n, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually\nunderstand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can =\r\nbe more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a\nnormal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nperson that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I\nsuggest=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading Sanskr=\r\nit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an a=\r\nnalogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman\nmay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of schol=\r\narly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the\nball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand=\r\n of the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line\nof the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ball, =\r\nhow to play it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and\nwhen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nto play back foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbatsman. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course,\nsome=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practi=\r\nce\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in\nspirituali=\r\nty\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, al=\r\nl paths\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions tha=\r\nt we are\ndoing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things and realize that the divine acts through all of=\r\n us. The divine\nacts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning a=\r\nnd gives corresponding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until on=\r\ne overcomes the notions\nof &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this=\r\n and I dislike that&quot; etc.\nThough this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the essence of all scripture=\r\ns and one knows it, one may be deluded\nagain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and again. There is no m=\r\nagic formula to internalize this understanding\nfully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and overcome the=\r\n instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is\na=\r\nt the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watchin=\r\ng over\none&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thou=\r\nghts, one&#39;s\nsadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the n=\r\need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is =\r\nfine to meet spiritual people\n(physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) an=\r\nd discuss good things. But that will only\ncreate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical unders=\r\ntanding. For it to be internalized and to govern\nall of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s instinc=\r\nts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what=\r\n\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person running around a\nmo=\r\nuntain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an =\r\nexcellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows that =\r\nhe needs to\nclimb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle ins=\r\ntead of climbing\nit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is important in tan=\r\ntric path\nbut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* pa=\r\nths or parts of\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccura=\r\nte notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really T=\r\nantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s\nattitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants. Anyb=\r\nody who wants specific material results needs to\nbe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; careful regarding=\r\n how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to\naffect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular =\r\nresult is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru\nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not ma=\r\nny are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spec=\r\nific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cons=\r\ntraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some ma=\r\ny sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for\nbegetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sp=\r\necific material results and Vedic path is for self-realization. That\nis\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam\nfor\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in an\nelab=\r\norate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to rem=\r\nove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If yo=\r\nu are looking for a specific material\nresult,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you need clear guidance=\r\n and supervision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving today! Instead=\r\n, if you want spiritual progress and an increase\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your surrender, y=\r\nou can just keep doing sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just k=\r\neep company of scriptures and other like-minded\npeople.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and p=\r\nrecise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directions and some supervision. If you just want to go to nor=\r\nth pole,\nyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can keep walking towards north. Of course, having superv=\r\nision helps\nthere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too, but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference:\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://=\r\nsaraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic=\r\n_pathak@ &lt;vedic_pathak%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advis=\r\ned the non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other regional languag=\r\ne is because understanding the meaning and\n&gt;constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are p=\r\nossible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language that t=\r\nhey can fully follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if this =\r\nis the reason then its understandable.

H=\r\nowever after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original\npost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wit=\r\nh my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhrough some posts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere\nhere is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quickly=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might reply=\r\n\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nUtpal ji has raised an important question regarding the\nnecessity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of =\r\ninitiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nneeds to be invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the\nMANY\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an\nabsolute=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. Howev=\r\ner\nif\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mant=\r\nra\nsadhana as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C2?YES.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the t=\r\nantric adage goes; thereby\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessity for multiple approaches and =\r\nmultiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inevitability of multiple perspective=\r\ns. In the pan-Indian context\nthere are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many paths for sadhana. But in=\r\n the current context of this question I\nwill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restrict myself to only =\r\nthe five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. =\r\nYoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantri=\r\nc)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practic=\r\nalisation of the\ngreat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the abo=\r\nve paths EMPHASISES\nparticular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods and techniques in its attempt =\r\nto practicalise the abstract\ntruths at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an experiential level. Let us =\r\nbriefly look at the predominant methods/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques employed by each =\r\nof these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly orien=\r\nted to Gnana/Advaita,\nstrictly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speaking even the external guru is not=\r\n necessary, though one can\ngreatly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; benefit from the wisdom and experi=\r\nence of a genuine teacher. The\ndirect path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Advaita emphasises the =\r\nmethods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Advait=\r\na being essentially a culmination of the\nVaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; system it has retaine=\r\nd the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-study of texts) to=\r\no as an important practice. All of these\npractices\n&gt; &gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39;=\r\n in a big way with a marginal role for external\npractices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by=\r\n consistent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment)=\r\n. Hindu\nschools of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (or=\r\nienting oneself\ntowards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jin=\r\na schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasise only the first two as they subscribe=\r\n to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marg=\r\na (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional\nacceptance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s wil=\r\nl through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasi=\r\ns in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad\nGita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enga=\r\nging in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nKarma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finall=\r\ny I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana\nwhere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone the i=\r\nnevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity\nof a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Guru=\r\n arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain\noccult\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that\ne=\r\nxcept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, =\r\nwhile\nBhakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the=\r\n age-old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path=\r\n\ninvokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speec=\r\nh, another the\nfire of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; austerity, and yet another the physical fire o=\r\nf the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;=\r\ns method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak\nthrough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lab-=\r\nlike practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly\npowerful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tec=\r\nhniques that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adh=\r\nikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about\nqualification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWould you allow a child to experiment with fire without any\nsupervision?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like any\nother=\r\n lab\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment proper training and experience are part of the proced=\r\nure\napart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment=\r\n too.\nHowever the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experimen=\r\nt is awakening the\nSakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the individual consciousness (also re=\r\nferred to as Kundalini\nSakti).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As this is not a topic for mere intell=\r\nectualisation, I will refrain\nfrom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; further discussion on the Kundalin=\r\ni. Without going into other needless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; details here, I will just elabor=\r\nate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to\ncontextualise\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major\n=\r\nriver\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the ent=\r\nire\nSakta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three =\r\nmajor\nschools\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living traditions among the Dasha=\r\nMahaVidyas-\nKalikula,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana be=\r\nlongs to Kalikula\nwhilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just t=\r\no make the picture more\ncomplete the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (=\r\n!) have taken to Tarakula. To those\nwho are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Bud=\r\ndhism I will draw attention to the the 21\nforms of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vaj=\r\nrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas=\r\n in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ka=\r\nli kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; invoked at=\r\n all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; majo=\r\nr milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra,\nmantra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\nija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of\nsynchronistic\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the\nfull-=\r\nfledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage=\r\n of that\npath\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERT=\r\nED TREE with\nSIVA\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Ea=\r\nch branch and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downwar=\r\nd till the\nindividual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can =\r\nvisualise it. Another\nmodern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metaphor that one can use is that of ele=\r\nctricity. It is held by the\nTantric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advocate that initiation not only=\r\n completes the circuit necessary for\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conduit of electricity but a=\r\nlso prevents short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/ligh=\r\nts at each point in this inverted tree of live wires,\nwhere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is =\r\na long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the\nway up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nill Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n(Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within\nthe\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; individual consciousness through an integrated approach that combines\nthe=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated\nappro=\r\naches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Chand=\r\ni\nseemingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also a f=\r\null-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also si=\r\nmultaneously\na text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The questi=\r\non of initiation is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevant only to those following the Tantramarga =\r\nand thus employing\nthe text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a mantramaya text . For those who expl=\r\nore the text as a yogasastra,\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant w=\r\nhich I have covered extensively in\nmy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; write-up. For those who are alr=\r\neady inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri\nSri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi provides the conte=\r\nxt for immensely powerful reflections through\nits\n&gt; &gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fledged\nUpanishadic=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in\nt=\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with =\r\nthe\nother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central tru=\r\nth of\nAdvaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I adv=\r\nised the non-initiate to read in English or\nany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other regional langua=\r\nge is because understanding the meaning and\nconstant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are p=\r\nossible only when one repeatedly reads the text in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language that th=\r\ney can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explore the t=\r\next as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its\nobvious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; status a=\r\ns Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded\nas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sru=\r\nti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that\nregard\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will\nstraightaw=\r\nay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even t=\r\nhe\nworship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and D=\r\nERIVED from\na one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu=\r\n temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitio=\r\nners do the Homam as an integral part of\nSri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in ac=\r\ncordance with the Vedic approach, there are\nthose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who adhere to the T=\r\nantric approach and do the sadhana as per the\nmantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; marga. It is thi=\r\ns particular approach that needs initiation as per its\nown\n&gt; &gt; &gt; principles=\r\n. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic\npath of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vive=\r\nka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even\nthe\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth.\nLikewise\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predominantly\n=\r\nVaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of =\r\nthese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind t=\r\nhat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as S=\r\nrikula as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent o=\r\nriginally\ntrace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance o=\r\nf initiation for\nthose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vid=\r\nya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make sp=\r\niritual progress through any of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sri =\r\nChandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairag=\r\nya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa\netc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are all effective. However =\r\ndepending on the individual temperament,\naptitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc., some of these=\r\n methods are more suited relatively to different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practitioners. One m=\r\nay progress through a combination of any of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods in spiritua=\r\nl life. However the *full-fledged* integrated\napproach of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; KALIKULA in=\r\nvolves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against\nwhich\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the an=\r\nswer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method and path,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language th=\r\nat\none is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND=\r\n BEST\nchoice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (th=\r\nough not as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangh=\r\na and\nsatsangha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spir=\r\nitual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue=\r\n of serving,\nlistening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to and spending time in the company of sadhus =\r\nand sants in his younger\ndays.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath=\r\n made a quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attended the=\r\n Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respective=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain abou=\r\nt the scarcity of Satsangha\nnowadays, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will just quote Swami Sivanan=\r\nda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders no=\r\nwadays that\nthere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The co=\r\nmpany of Sadhus is\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question of supply and demand. If there is a sin=\r\ncere demand, the\nsupply will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; come at once. This is the inexorable law=\r\n of nature. If you are really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thirsty, you will find your Master at y=\r\nour threshold. You lead a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of p=\r\nassion and unholy Vasanas.\nYou do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not care a bit for higher divine li=\r\nfe. You waste your time in idle\ngossiping\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and vain, worldly talks. Yo=\r\nu have become a hopeless slave of passion,\ngreed,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and name and fame. =\r\nAnd yet you complain: `I cannot get good\nSatsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Make yourself =\r\na deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall\ntake you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the =\r\nlotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path,\nguide\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high\nsouls ar=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in=\r\n\nplenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no=\r\n good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no =\r\nreal\nseekers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual company of the=\r\n\ngreat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; masters.

However, one without a rich father is still better off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ope=\r\nning a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slowly\nwith\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do\nsadha=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you =\r\nfind\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate y=\r\nou), get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used fo=\r\nr two purposes - (i)\nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting specific material results and (ii) a=\r\ns tools of increasing\nsurrender\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. In the=\r\n case of (ii), initiation is not\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important. But, in the case of =\r\n(i), there are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare one sufficiently. One =\r\ncan get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few\npeople who\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only\nfo=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever material results god wants t=\r\no\ngive\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals f=\r\nor\nbegetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *specific* material results (for oneself or others or so=\r\nciety/universe\nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general), Nature will make arrangements for one to =\r\nget correct\nknowledge of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one starts, one should=\r\n start with the attitude\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any\nritu=\r\nal or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material\n=\r\ndesires, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual=\r\n, god may give\nany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; material results or spiritual results and not nece=\r\nssarily fulfil my\ndesires.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will accept whatever god gives. I want t=\r\no increase my devotion and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. Yo=\r\nu are then SAFE. Initiation\nis not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; required. That attitude itself is =\r\nan initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gent=\r\nle deities give good results slowly, but there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fie=\r\nrce deities give results fast, but there may be some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hiccups. I gave =\r\nthis analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is\ntaking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fru=\r\nits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and\ntrying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; re=\r\ntrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one\nmay do\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be\nmini=\r\nmal. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be=\r\n more\nspillage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuc=\r\nk under the\nrotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala =\r\nof your karmas is in\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits=\r\n and throw them in\ngarbage and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give you a good fruit to eat. There ma=\r\ny be some spillage. A gentle\ndeity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi =\r\nmay take more time to get out the\ngood\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruit, but the spillage will b=\r\ne minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava or Kali or Narasi=\r\nmha may have more spillage, but the good\nfruit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that t=\r\nhese fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of your own actions=\r\n. Without sadhana, you\nwould&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to eat each of those rotten fruit=\r\ns before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of\nrotten\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and\nstayin=\r\ng with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be a=\r\nssessed\nby a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru before starting a practice. If you realize the abov=\r\ne, you can\nstart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras without initiation. If some bad results occu=\r\nt, you have to\nrealize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it is a fruit of your own actions and the=\r\n deity is trying to\naccelerate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good results. If you are weak-hearted,=\r\n stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and\nwere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ignor=\r\nant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took\nseveral\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years back are\nnow\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I know that some\n=\r\nof them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and have experienced some things too.\n=\r\nObviously, they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce=\r\n aspects of\nDivine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank material=\r\nism, if\nsomeone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is impo=\r\nrtant, is looking\nfor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; god and is attracted to a specific advanced sad=\r\nhana (e.g. Chandipath),\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person obviously has some good karmas an=\r\nd good vasanas. That person\nhas done\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that sadhana in the past. Previo=\r\nus life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s\nadhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what is what, =\r\nhow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what is m=\r\nore\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important and what is less important, that is what initiation is =\r\nall\nabout!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best

The only major p=\r\noint where I disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri\nChandi path *without in=\r\nitiation*. The rest of the confusion on translation of\nmantras needs some c=\r\nlarification as there seems to be some unnecessary\nconfusion. A few pointer=\r\ns:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1. There are various sacred chants embedded within th=\r\ne Vedas, Puranas,\nAgamas etc. Broadly speaking such sacred chants can be ca=\r\ntegorised as mantras,\nstotras, kavachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are=\r\n also treated as\nmahamantras and mantras. The Samhita portion of the Vedas =\r\ntoo is referred to as\nmantras.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2. Undoubtedly mantras an=\r\nd stotras have to be chanted in the original.\nReading a translation is not =\r\neven comparable to chanting the original chant. So\nfar it is fine.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3. Whilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all based on Sabda/Vak,=\r\n tradition\nmakes a distinction between them.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 4. As per t=\r\nhe traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a\nstotra or d=\r\nhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras\ncontaining bija=\r\nksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need\ninitiation. This is=\r\n the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not\nthe same as th=\r\nese other mantras that need initiation, which are generally\nreferred to as =\r\nAgamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the\nactual idea is =\r\nthat these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct\nspiritual spec=\r\nialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such\nas Kali or=\r\n Sri.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 5. Vishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrda=\r\nyam etc do not need initiation\nas they fall under stotra category only. Lal=\r\nitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam\nare traditionally viewed not MERELY as st=\r\notras or parts of puranas. They have a\nlarger status as integral parts of a=\r\n Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without\ninitiation is not recommended esp=\r\necially when the reader combines the navarna\nor shodashi mantras too as an =\r\nintegral part of the chanting.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 6. I know from personal i=\r\nnteraction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi\nas well as Sringeri param=\r\nparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of\nSri Sri Chandi and Sri =\r\nVidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND\nSHODASAKSHARI mantras whic=\r\nh are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the\nsadhana. Acharyas of both t=\r\nhese traditions hold that one needs to be initiated to\nchant the Navarna as=\r\n well as shodashakshari mantras.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 7. Recapping my earlier=\r\n stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an\nindependent status by i=\r\ntself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a\nMahavidya, a Yogasastr=\r\na as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the\nUpanishads. ***As a Maha=\r\nvidya the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri\nChandi path***. Thus tr=\r\nadition holds that one needs to be initiated to chant\nit. However if one wi=\r\nshes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects\nof the Devi Ma=\r\nhatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been\nrecommended i=\r\nn my write-up, as chanting the original along with the navakshari\namounts t=\r\no practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is\nrecommended to =\r\nbe initiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properly\nunder guidanc=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 8. Arguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi M=\r\nahatmyam in the\noriginal Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and no=\r\nt as a Mahavidya, it\nhas an inherent problem in our times. The problem with=\r\n attempting to do a\nparayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without in=\r\nitiation) is that most\nreaders inadvertently end up also chanting the Navar=\r\nna mantra or stotras such\nas the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain th=\r\ne bijaksharas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 9. I you carefully peruse my write-up on =\r\nthe Devi Mahatmyam, forget\ntranslating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna m=\r\nantra even in writing. Neither\nhave I attempted to write a commentary on it=\r\n. Translations of mantras do not\nhave the power of the original mantra as S=\r\nabda or Vak. However it is\nrecommended to know the essence or import (artha=\r\n) of the mantra and its sadhana\nwhile chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the im=\r\nport, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a\ntranslation! &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 10. For =\r\nthose who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without\ninitiation, there i=\r\ns no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain\nlevel of samsk=\r\nara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have\nit. Otherwis=\r\ne we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Please\nkeep doing=\r\n whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sadhana.\nAs Nara=\r\nsimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana\nWITH=\r\nOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself will reduce a\nl=\r\not of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own accord in the\n=\r\nnatural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Hope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Satya Prakash &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:ve=\r\ndic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\nh ramalinga=\r\nm &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste everybody=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Mah=\r\na\nSannidanam Sri\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
