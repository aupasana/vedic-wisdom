I look forward to the detailed Ga=\r\nnapati Homam manual one day.  \n\nI have been using this guide in the past fo=\r\nr various pujas.  It may be of benefit to others. I cannot vouch for the ac=\r\ncuracy of the procedures as my knowledge in these matters is limited.  \n\nht=\r\ntp://www.sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/completevidhi.pdf\n\nI tried to combi=\r\nne a simple 16 upchara puja of Ganesha in an idol prior to the 16 upchara h=\r\nomam manual provided by you and received good results.  A simple guide (chi=\r\nldren&#39;s guide) for doing 16 upchara Ganesha puja on an idol is available he=\r\nre, again people will need to decide on the accuracy of this manual on thei=\r\nr own \n\nhttp://www.balagokulam.org/ganesh/resources/ganeshpoojavidhi.pdf\n\nT=\r\nhere are several resources on the internet for pujas which vary in content =\r\nbut very limited manuals for Homam and none comes as close to the work that=\r\n you have done.  I hope we can continue to refine these and make them avail=\r\nable in short, regular, and detailed formats for sadhakaas depending on the=\r\n interest and time available with each.  \n\nBest regards\n\nVeenu\n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namas=\r\nte,\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Apart from 16 upacharas instead of 5, there are other things. =\r\nYou invoke \n&gt; Varuna in a kalasha, do 16 upachara pooja, read Pavamaana (pu=\r\nrifying) \n&gt; sooktam (also known as Punyaaha vaachanam), do pooja to dikpaal=\r\nakas etc. \n&gt; Some people do Jayaadi homam as a part of uttaraangam (offerin=\r\ngs to various \n&gt; Gandharvas and Apsaras representing various aspects of our=\r\nselves, with \n&gt; respective Veda mantras). For vasordhara, some read the ent=\r\nire Chamakam \n&gt; instead of just the 3rd anuvaakam. And so on. I may publish=\r\n a long manual \n&gt; for Ganapathi homam sometime, if Mother is willing.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n(2) You can do swaha in Chamakam after each anuvaakam. Some people offer \n&gt;=\r\n just Namakam in pradhaana homam and read Chamakam for vasordhara. Namakam =\r\n\n&gt; and Chamakam are a very powerful Vedic prayer.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding your experiences, my thought is that your children are speci=\r\nal \n&gt; with good spiritual potential. Any sadhana of an ugra devata, homam o=\r\nr \n&gt; meditation, can throw up some tests as one starts to make progress. As=\r\n I \n&gt; explained earlier, this is like some mess spilling onto the floor as =\r\nan \n&gt; agressive person tries to take out rotten fruits from a fruit basket =\r\nand \n&gt; throws them into garbage can, so that some good fruits stuck under c=\r\nan be \n&gt; extracted. A gentle deity will be slow and careful and the spillov=\r\ner will be \n&gt; minimal. Also, the speed at which good fruits are extracted w=\r\nill also be \n&gt; slow. An ugra devata will be fast and agressive and there ma=\r\ny be some \n&gt; spillover. But the good fruits are extracted fast that way. Wi=\r\nth a gentle \n&gt; deity such as Ganesha or Vishnu or Lakshmi, some spillover i=\r\ns possible, but \n&gt; it will be small. Most importantly, one should note that=\r\n the rotten fruit \n&gt; that spilled over was put in that basket by oneself (i=\r\n.e. one&#39;s own karma) \n&gt; and, for every little spillover, a lot more would&#39;v=\r\ne been successfully \n&gt; thrown into garbage can (i.e. bad karmas burnt up in=\r\n sadhana so that they do \n&gt; not have to be experienced).\n&gt; \n&gt; The fruits of=\r\n one&#39;s sadhana will also be enjoyed by the people to whom one \n&gt; is closely=\r\n attached and with whom one&#39;s karmas are strongly intertwined. \n&gt; However, =\r\nany negative results due to spillover of karmas will usually be \n&gt; taken by=\r\n the person oneself. However, if there are gentle and elevated souls \n&gt; aro=\r\nund one, they *may* take it on themselves. This is like a gentle and nice \n=\r\n&gt; person around you hurrying to clean up some rotten fruit spilled over on =\r\nthe \n&gt; floor near you.\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, these are all signs that Ganesha =\r\nis not looking at just giving \n&gt; material benefits to you, as he does to mo=\r\nst people, but considering you \n&gt; worthy of spiritual progress and testing =\r\nyou. Ganesha can give material and \n&gt; spiritual progress. Secondly, it show=\r\ns that your children have some \n&gt; potential. Teach them some religious stuf=\r\nf from a young age.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri=\r\n Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;homamstudent&quot; &lt;vedichoroscope@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 23, 2009 12:17 AM\n&gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Homam Questions\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pranaam Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI have been following your Mahaganapati Homam for a few weeks now and\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nave been getting good results and for that I am thankful to you and\n&gt; &gt; Man=\r\nishji who is the inspiration behind this.  When I started this\n&gt; &gt; initiall=\r\ny I had big doubts since on the first day I performed the Homam\n&gt; &gt; my elde=\r\nr son fell down and broke his tooth and had bleeding (I was\n&gt; &gt; reading the=\r\n story of Ganesha losing his tooth to Parashurama&#39;s axe the\n&gt; &gt; same day) a=\r\nnd the next time I did the Homam my younger son caught his\n&gt; &gt; foot in the =\r\ntemple door we were visiting on the same day (Ganesha\n&gt; &gt; guarding the door=\r\n?) and got hurt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was expecting some negative experiences to come =\r\nmy way when I started\n&gt; &gt; the Homams as part of some karmic cleansing but I=\r\n was expecting them to\n&gt; &gt; come my way and not the way of family members so=\r\n was a bit surprised.  I\n&gt; &gt; was wondering if you have any thoughts on this=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; My questions on Homam are the following\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.  Have you publ=\r\nished a regular or long procedure for Mahaganapati\n&gt; &gt; Homam?  At some poin=\r\nt I would like to try a longer version if that is\n&gt; &gt; available.  Is the di=\r\nfference only between the 5 types and the 16 types\n&gt; &gt; of offering or there=\r\n is more to it such as detailed puja of digpalas and\n&gt; &gt; grahas etc?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 2.  I recite Sri Rudram/Chamakam path for several years now and would\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n like to do that via Homam.  Can you provide some guidance as to how to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n do this?  i.e. when to say swaha?  I think it is fairly logical to do\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthat in Rudram but Chamakam is not so clear and swaha seems to come at\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe end of each anuvaaka only.  Or perhaps Chamakam is only to be\n&gt; &gt; recit=\r\ned and not offered to Agni\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Veenu\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
