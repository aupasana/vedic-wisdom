Someone sent me a few snippets fr=\r\nom an \ninterview posted on her website. Please see below.\n\nIt is interestin=\r\ng that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It \nis interestin=\r\ng that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and \nshow what i=\r\ns truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This \nis similar=\r\n to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to \nhim during=\r\n Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n\nShe told him that many people are and will=\r\n be born who will perform a short \nfire ritual on a regular basis, establis=\r\nh sanatana dharma and peace in the \nworld and also make quick spiritual pro=\r\ngress individually in that process. \nShree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramak=\r\nrishna told her is along similar \nlines.\n\nMy guru was also told by Mother t=\r\nhat a few centres of regular Chandi homam \nshould be established around the=\r\n world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a \nday. These places do not need=\r\n to be near any temples or famous places and \ncan be anywhere. The ritual n=\r\need not be elaborate. For example, there is no \nneed to offer silk sarees e=\r\ntc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum \nofferings is enough, but it =\r\nneeds to be performed 3 times everyday. When a \nfew such centres are establ=\r\nished, it will apparently lead to a chain of \nevents that will help re-esta=\r\nblish sanatana dharma.\n\nThough not 3 times a day, these people have done a =\r\nChandi homam everyday for \n3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such=\r\n homas. That is fantastic! \nIt is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that c=\r\nreates energy and brings \ndeities to a place. While several ancient temples=\r\n are without any divine \npresence these days, new places of divine presence=\r\n may be created by pure \nsouls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing=\r\n dharma in the world.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Ch=\r\nandi homam during which \nMother appeared and gave instructions to my guru o=\r\nn spreading homam was \ntaken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the ti=\r\nme of sankalpa was within \na few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha tim=\r\ne of the birth anniversary. \nAll of this was a coincidence and we were unaw=\r\nare of this significance when \nwe decided the muhurta. It is interesting to=\r\n know that Ramakrishna did \nmention fire ceremonies specifically to somebod=\r\ny and that his words are \nsimilar to the words of Mother.\n\nBest regards,\nNa=\r\nrasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJa=\r\ngan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n - \n\n&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; Master, has a small ashram h=\r\nere near the Bay Area\n&gt;\n&gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snippets f=\r\nrom her website\n&gt; pasted for your benefit), from an interview found here\n&gt; =\r\nhttp://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Shree Ma=\r\na: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go now for\n&gt; our country=\r\n, and all other country, you have to go do fire ceremonies\n&gt; and show what =\r\nis truth, what is dignity, and at that time the whole\n&gt; world will be peace=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of Americ=\r\nan descent),\n&gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her and =\r\nall that;\n&gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;At a tim=\r\ne when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at best,\n&gt; he had trav=\r\neled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he studied\n&gt; with a number =\r\nof gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi and\n&gt; the sacred fire cer=\r\nemony, the yagya, as his primary system of worship\n&gt; and meditation, while =\r\nundertaking great austerities in the process.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They undertook t=\r\nhe Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremony\n&gt; and worship of the Go=\r\nddess, without setting foot outside from the\n&gt; humble temple grounds they e=\r\nstablished in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-11658903-1235670634=:55721\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-s=\r\nerif&quot;&gt;Dear Sir,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DVerdana&gt;Should I try at Ujja=\r\nin ?

Someone sent me a few snippets from an &lt;BR&gt;interview posted on her=\r\n website. Please see below.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is interesting that she considers Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It &lt;BR&gt;is interesting that Ramakrishna to=\r\nld her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and &lt;BR&gt;show what is truth&quot; and &quot;at t=\r\nhat time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This &lt;BR&gt;is similar to what my gur=\r\nu was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to &lt;BR&gt;him during Shata Chand=\r\ni homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She told him that many people are and will be bo=\r\nrn who will perform a short &lt;BR&gt;fire ritual on a regular basis, establish s=\r\nanatana dharma and peace in the &lt;BR&gt;world and also make quick spiritual pro=\r\ngress individually in that process. &lt;BR&gt;Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ra=\r\nmakrishna told her is along similar &lt;BR&gt;lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My guru was also told=\r\n by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam &lt;BR&gt;should be establi=\r\nshed around the\n world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a &lt;BR&gt;day. These=\r\n places do not need to be near any temples or famous places and &lt;BR&gt;can be =\r\nanywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no &lt;BR&gt;ne=\r\ned to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nofferings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;few such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though not =\r\n3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for &lt;BR&gt;3 yea=\r\nrs in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! &lt;BR&gt;I=\r\nt is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ndeities to a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;presence these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the\n worl=\r\nd.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam du=\r\nring which &lt;BR&gt;Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreadin=\r\ng homam was &lt;BR&gt;taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time of s=\r\nankalpa was within &lt;BR&gt;a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of=\r\n the birth anniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All of this was a coincidence and we were unawa=\r\nre of this significance when &lt;BR&gt;we decided the muhurta. It is interesting =\r\nto know that Ramakrishna did &lt;BR&gt;mention fire ceremonies specifically to so=\r\nmebody and that his words are &lt;BR&gt;similar to the words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Be=\r\nst regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedic=\r\nastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nvedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://w=\r\nww.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now her=\r\ne is the very interesting part (snippets from her website&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pasted fo=\r\nr your benefit), from an interview found here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonomy_menu/54/86&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &l=\r\nt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have =\r\nto go now for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our country, and all other country, you have to go do=\r\n fire ceremonies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and at th=\r\nat time the whole&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world will be peace.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American des=\r\ncent),&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her and =\r\nall that;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;sn=\r\nip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduou=\r\ns at best,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior whe=\r\nre he studied&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship=\r\n of Chandi and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the\n yagya, as his primary=\r\n system of worship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerit=\r\nies in the process.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahas=\r\nra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremony&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and worship of the Godd=\r\ness, without setting foot outside from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humble temple grounds th=\r\ney established in Martinez, California.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-11658903-1235670634=:55721--\r\n\n"}}
