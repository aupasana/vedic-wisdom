Rao wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish was reading half of the Veda mantra given in the homam manuals \n&gt; (RigVeda 10.16.9 - kravyaadamagnim) when he rejected a lit matchstick in \n&gt; the southwestern corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Veda mantra literally means, &quot;I keep the form of fire known as \n&gt; kravyaada (consumer of flesh) at bay. May the carrier of the \n&gt; inauspicious go to Lord Yama. May the other form of fire known as \n&gt; Jaatavedas (all-knowing and all-possessing one) come here and carry \n&gt; oblations to deities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Rejecting a lit matchstick behind one is a risky instruction to give, \n&gt; i.e. something can catch fire if one is not careful. So it was not a \n&gt; part of the standardized procedure in the manual. Moreover, many priests \n&gt; do not do it. Some priests touch the homa kundam with darbha and leave \n&gt; it in the southwestern corner.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who want to use a lit matchstick or a darbha and leave it on the \n&gt; southwest can feel free to do so. Those who do not do either need not \n&gt; worry and continue their procedure.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, there are slight differences in the way Manish pronounces \n&gt; &quot;kravyaadamagnim&quot; and how it is given in the manual. Manish told me it \n&gt; was a RigVeda mantra. He asked to search for it in RigVeda and give the \n&gt; correct text in the manual, which I did.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On *Tue, 2/2/10, puneetrph /&lt;puneetrph@...&gt;/* wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     From: puneetrph &lt;puneetrph@...&gt;\n&gt;     Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Question on Homam - Shri Manishji&#39;s Maha\n&gt;     Ganapati Homam procedure\n&gt;     To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     Date: Tuesday, February 2, 2010, 6:33 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     Symbolically it makes sense as kravyaada agni is inauspicious, and\n&gt;     the mantra is requesting that he go.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Should this be done when reciting the mantra for homam?\n&gt; \n&gt;     --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;     &lt;/mc/compose?to=vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, &quot;dinesh_nambisan&quot;\n&gt;     &lt;dinesh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; I think he is reciting the &quot;Kravyaadamagnim. .&quot; mantra(request to\n&gt;     keep an inauspicious form of fire away) and tossing the match on\n&gt;     fire to the side.\n&gt;      &gt; ./Dinesh\n&gt;      &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;     &lt;/mc/compose?to=vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, manish gour\n&gt;     &lt;manishgo_in@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt;      &gt; &gt;\n&gt;      &gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt;      &gt; &gt; Â \n&gt;      &gt; &gt; Interestingly I had seen only that portion of the video before\n&gt;     reading your email and the same question came to my mind.
