Regard=\r\ning Krishna and gopis:\n&gt; \n&gt; The love of gopis for Krishna is not physical. =\r\nGopis were re-incarnations of blessed beings from higher lokas (realms of c=\r\nonsciousness) and were instinctively drawn to Krishna as they were aware th=\r\nat Krishna was the perfected being. They had perfect surrender to the perfe=\r\ncted being and aspired for his company always.\n&gt; \n&gt; The story of vastraapah=\r\narana (Krishna stealing the clothes of gopis from the riverbank while they =\r\nwere bathing in the river and forcing them to come out of the river without=\r\n clothes) explains complete surrender and has an esoteric meaning. The sens=\r\nual overtones some may perceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect=\r\n of the overly sensualized society we live in.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me talk =\r\nabout the esoteric meaning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gopi literally means the shakti that has c=\r\nontrol over the cows. Cows and horses in RigVeda symbolize the jnanendriyas=\r\n and karmendriyas respectively. After all, this is the meaning in &quot;Sri Sook=\r\ntam&quot; also, where we encounter &quot;ashvadaayI ca godaayI&quot;, though that line has=\r\n been superficially interpreted by scholars as &quot;one who gives cows and hors=\r\nes&quot;. Extolling Sri Maha Lakshmi as the giver of two specific kinds of cattl=\r\ne would be too frivolous for RigVeda, which represents the timeless and unc=\r\nreated absolute knowledge rather than relative knowledge bound by space and=\r\n time. The true meaning is that our jnanendriyas and karmendriyas come into=\r\n being and operate through the shakti of the Mother. Anyway, let us go back=\r\n to gopis.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Within us, gopis represent the control over the =\r\nsenses. Control of various kinds over the senses will restrict the sense ac=\r\ntivity and safeguard one&#39;s purity. But, merely by controlling or restrictin=\r\ng the senses, one cannot reach god or merge in god. The goal of the shaktis=\r\n that represent control over senses is to merge in the Infinite. That is wh=\r\nat the desire of gopis to be with Krishna represents.\n&gt; \n&gt; Clothes represen=\r\nt conditioning with gunas. Even as one controls/restricts sense activity, t=\r\nhere may be pride about it and several other types of conditioning that col=\r\nors the control exerted over sense activity. That is what the clothes of go=\r\npis represent! Gopis going to Krishna without clothes represents pride and =\r\nother conditioning being withdrawn from one&#39;s control over senses, one&#39;s se=\r\nlf-control becoming pure and devoid of ANY conditioning and then merging in=\r\n the Supreme.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, the sensual overtones some may perceive in th=\r\ne story are an unfortunate side effect of the overly sensualized society we=\r\n live in.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding all people being women and the Supreme =\r\nbeing a man:\n&gt; \n&gt; This is also an esotetic concept and not physical or sens=\r\nual in nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this universe, masculine spirit represents the poten=\r\ntial energy and feminine spirit represents the kinetic energy. Supreme Cosm=\r\nic Being or Parama Purusha exists as the potentiality behind the entire uni=\r\nverse. He is the potential energy. Shakti or the kinetic energy that is run=\r\nning the show in this entire universe manifests in each person as his/her K=\r\nundalini shakti. It is through the Kundalini shakti that one is aware of th=\r\ne universe and acts in it. One&#39;s awareness of the world is colored by one&#39;s=\r\n conditioning. As Kundalini shakti awakens, rises, purifies herself and dro=\r\nps off all conditioning that colors one&#39;s self-awareness, it will rise to s=\r\nahasrara and has a union with Parama Purusha. Instead of being aware of one=\r\nself as a limited object that perceives and interacts with so many other ob=\r\njects, one then is absorbed in an awareness of the Supreme Potentiality of =\r\nthe entire universe. Kundalini shakti (one&#39;s self-awareness) is symbolicall=\r\ny represented\n&gt;  as a female deity. She awakens (one starts to search for t=\r\nrue self), purifies herself, sheds her clothing (conditioning that colors o=\r\nne&#39;s self-awareness) and ultimately has a union with the supreme being in s=\r\nahasrara.\n&gt; \n&gt; All this is symbolic and esoteric in meaning. Any sensuality=\r\n one perceives in this depiction is simply due to the conditioning of one&#39;s=\r\n mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; [Warning: Some raw and uninhibited language in the r=\r\nemainder of this mail MAY offend some sensitive and conservative readers.]\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Regarding references to body parts:\n&gt; \n&gt; There is nothing inherentl=\r\ny &quot;titillating&quot; in a breast or other body parts. When a baby sees the breas=\r\nt, for example, the baby thinks of milk and nourishment. There are no other=\r\n thoughts in the baby&#39;s mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; Our problems and weaknesses do not lie i=\r\nn external objects. They lie in our own minds. When one sees a luxury car, =\r\none can just appreciate its elegance, power and beauty and leave it at that=\r\n. One need not think, &quot;I must somehow have this car&quot; or imagine what one ca=\r\nn do if one has that car. When one sees a briefcase containing one million =\r\ndollars, one can just appreciate that it is a lot of money and a lot of thi=\r\nngs can be bought with it. One need not think, &quot;I must somehow have this mo=\r\nney&quot; or imagine what one can do if one has that money. Similarly, when one =\r\nsees a breast, one can just appreciate its ability to nurture new life. One=\r\n need not imagine what one can do with it. When one sees a vagina, one can =\r\njust appreciate it as the source of new life.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately=\r\n, ego and conditioning make one think unnecessary thoughts about every obje=\r\nct perceived by senses. Ego and mental conditioning make one introduce ones=\r\nelf mentally in the middle of all objects perceived by senses and engage in=\r\n mental actions with those objects. Those mental actions are of course shap=\r\ned by one&#39;s own conditioning! THAT is the problem. The over-materialization=\r\n and over-sexualization prevalent in our society makes the conditioning dee=\r\nper and more difficult to shake off. But the goal of sadhana is to shake of=\r\nf all conditioning.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; When an evolved yogi sees a beautiful n=\r\naked body, he need not close eyes and run away. He need not feel uncomforta=\r\nble or embarrassed or self-conscious when looking at or talking about it. T=\r\nhere is nothing inherently wrong or sinful in a naked body. It is not an ob=\r\nject of lust by itself, though it may seem like an object of lust to a mind=\r\n conditioned with lust. Even if such a conditioned person takes sannyasa an=\r\nd remains in a forest for 30 years away from everybody, he may feel lust if=\r\n he suddenly sees a beautiful naked body after those 30 years of brahmachar=\r\nya. On the other hand, when an evolved yogi who overcame this conditioning =\r\nsees a beautiful naked body, he may not close eyes and run away. He may not=\r\nice its beauty (just like one may notice the beauty of a roadside scenery o=\r\nr waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or a sunrise over a lake etc) and a=\r\nppreciate the Creator for creating objects of infinite variety and beauty. =\r\nThoughts of lust (e.g. I can\n&gt;  do so and so thing with this body, it will =\r\nbe nice to do so and so thing with this body, etc) may not even arise in hi=\r\ns mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, when one is lustful, the best thing to do is to kee=\r\np oneself away from objects that provoke lust. But the final goal is to rea=\r\nch the above state.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; When you encounter references of body p=\r\narts in ancient devotional literature, you should realize that those author=\r\ns had overcome lust and were childlike. Talking of a breast or navel would =\r\nnot make them lustful or uncomfortable or embarrassed. There was no differe=\r\nnce between talking about a breast or a navel that they saw and talking abo=\r\nut a scenery or a waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or sunrise over a l=\r\nake that they saw.\n&gt; \n&gt; When a goddess revealed herself to them, there was =\r\nno need to cover her breasts. Clothes represent covering by additional cond=\r\nitioning and gunas. If goddess revealed herself to one with more conditioni=\r\nng, there was a need for more clothes, jewellery etc. If goddess revealed h=\r\nerself to a childlike one with no conditioning, unconditioned raw form is j=\r\nust fine. After all, a woman may feel comfortable standing naked in front o=\r\nf a baby, while she will cover herself properly when coming in front of a t=\r\nwenty year old son whose mind looks at things differently.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nBottomline: Those yogis and authors were unconditioned by lust and were sho=\r\nwn what they were ready to see and they described what they saw. Moreover, =\r\neverything has a symbolic meaning too. However, if you are teaching a young=\r\n and conditioned mind, I&#39;d suggest not teaching verses that can appear to b=\r\ne explicit or provocative. It is easy to misunderstand or get erotic though=\r\nts in the mind, though that is not the intention of the author. After all, =\r\nlet me give an analogy. Suppose seeing anything red makes a person remember=\r\n a bloodbath one saw earlier, become enraged and go and kill the enemies. S=\r\nuppose you have a picture of abhishekam of a Lalita idol with kumkum (sacre=\r\nd red vermillion powder). You better not show the picture to that person..\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jy=\r\notish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste all learned friends, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few questions for which I am s=\r\nincerely seeking answers. The questions pertain to Mathura Bhakti tradition=\r\n as well as some very popular works of great sages and saints of our belove=\r\nd Bharata Varsha. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. There is this tradition of envisioning the l=\r\nord (paramatma) as the only purusha and all the humanity (various jeevatmas=\r\n) as women and thereby jeevatmas seeking union with paramatma culminating i=\r\nn salvation. We have seen examples of great saints like Chaitanya Maha Prab=\r\nhu who were stalwarts of this path. And this explains the Krishna tatva in =\r\nSrimad bhagavatam as well in gopika vastra apaharana / rasaleela episodes. =\r\nWhile I think I understand this concept very well, I find it very hard to e=\r\nxplain it 1. To someone who is foreign to our culture and 2. To people who =\r\nintentionally malign the image of our rich Vedic traditions and 3. To kids =\r\nwho might come up with questions on this subject. What is the best way to e=\r\nxplain it in these situations? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. In Lalitha Sahasranama stotra a=\r\ns well as Saundarya Lahari stotra, Veda Vyasa and Adi Sankara respectively =\r\nhave described the mother goddess in a very detailed way detailing on speci=\r\nfic body parts. Yes, undoubtedly they have envisioned the formless nirguna =\r\nBrahman as their beloved mother, but where from is this tradition anga-anga=\r\n varnana (part - by part description) of mother? While I have no problem in=\r\n accepting those and include those in my daily prayers, how do we sensibly =\r\n/ convincingly explain these to the above groups of people? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not o=\r\nnly in these, I find reference to woman&#39;s body parts quite liberally in mos=\r\nt of the ancient sanskrit / telugu literature and I want to know why? Examp=\r\nles are Sri Krishna Ashtakam, Venkateshwara stotra that follows soon after =\r\nSuprabhata (kamala kucha choochuka kumkumatO ....) and so on. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Par=\r\ndon me if I am sounding naive... But having to teach some of these to a tee=\r\nnage kid... I really do not know how to approach, in case of any questions!=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
