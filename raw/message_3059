If it is, then it did not merge fully. Something remain separat=\r\ned to identify it with body.\nWhen RKP was leaving physical body he said to =\r\nSwami Vivekananda that he is same as previous avatars but not in a vedatani=\r\nc sense. It is quite possible as RKP was six months in Nirvekalpa Samadhi w=\r\nhich in itself is a non human thing, his whole inner consciousness changed.=\r\n Only Mother knows what is real.\n\nWhen I was living in a ashram a sadhu cam=\r\ne to live in next room to me. After initial talks he said that his mind is =\r\nfixed on God and deep meditation and things like that although he did not u=\r\nse the word samadhi. I saw him sitting staring in distance.\n\nNext day when =\r\nI saw him I noticed his eyes were red. I said, are you alright?. Do you hav=\r\ne fever. He said he is ok, no fever etc. I was very very very naive. He was=\r\n on ganja. I did not speak to him again. 2/3 days later he was asked to lea=\r\nve.\n\nWhen I came to London I saw several writings where authors have descri=\r\nbe their experiences using mind altering substances. Who knows if it was a =\r\nreal samadhi or deep trances.\nI have not used ganja etc ever but when I go =\r\nback to India I will learn how to use it and then abracadabra I will be in =\r\nsamadhi.
