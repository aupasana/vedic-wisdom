Today, interestingly, the Shia =\r\nclerics have made it clear to Hindu organisations that they would agree to =\r\nhave the site restored as Ramjanmabhoomi. It is the Sunni Wakf Board, which=\r\n entered the legal dispute as late as 1961, that has been litigating in the=\r\n court claiming the title to the land on which the structure once stood.It =\r\nis now well established by GPRS-directed excavations done under the Allahab=\r\nad High Court monitoring and verification in 2002-03, that a large temple d=\r\nid exist below where that Babri Masjid structure once stood. Inscriptions f=\r\nound during excavations describe it as a temple of Vishnu Hari who had kill=\r\ned the demon king Dasanan (Ravana).TRUE and devout Hindus believe that Bhag=\r\nwan Sri Ram was born in Ayodhya, the then capital of a flourishing kingdom =\r\nof the Suryavamsa dynasty. Ram is venerated as Maryada Purushottam and wors=\r\nhipped by Hindus of the north. As an avatar of Vishnu, while it was first p=\r\nropagated by the Tamil saints known as Nayanmars and Alwars who composed ma=\r\nny hymns and songs dedicated to his divinity, the North which later came to=\r\n accept Ram as one, especially thanks to the saint Tulsidas, the fervor for=\r\n Ram worship is much more. In that sense, Sri Ram was the first truly natio=\r\nnal king of India, supra region, supra varna or jati. That is why poet Iqba=\r\nl called him =91Imam-e-Hind=92.The exact spot of the palace where Ram was b=\r\norn has been and remains firmly identified in the Hindu mind and is held as=\r\n sacred. This is the very area where stood from 1528 till December 6, 1992 =\r\na structure that came to be known as Babri Masjid, put up in 1528 by Babar=\r\n=92s commander Mir Baqi.In fact, Baqi was a Shia Muslim, and hence he inten=\r\nded it to be a place for Shias to read namaz. Today, interestingly, the Shi=\r\na clerics have made it clear to Hindu organisations that they would agree t=\r\no have the site restored as a Ramjanmabhoomi. It is the Sunni Wakf Board, w=\r\nhich entered the legal dispute as late as 1961, that has been litigating in=\r\n the court claiming the title to the land on which the structure once stood=\r\n.I call it a &quot;structure&quot; since it cannot be strictly called a mosque by Sun=\r\nni edicts- because it did not have the mandatory minarets and wazu (water p=\r\nool). That a Ram temple existed and or that there is a sacred spot known as=\r\n Ramjanmabhoomi is attested by many sources.In Skanda Purana (Chapter X, Va=\r\nishnav Khand) the site is vivdly described. Valmiki Ramayana also describes=\r\n beautifully. Less than two decades before Mir Baqi carried out the horribl=\r\ne demolition of the Ram Temple, Guru Nanak had visited the Ramjanmabhoomi a=\r\nnd had darshan of Ramlala in the Mandir at the spot. There are many comment=\r\naries on this visit which are a part of the Sikh scriptures. Guru Nanak him=\r\nself records in 1521 the barbarity of Babar=92s invasions (in Guru Granth S=\r\nahib at p.418). In Akbar=92s time, Abul Fazal wrote the Ain-i-Akbari in whi=\r\nch he describes Ayodhya fame as the place of &quot;Ram Chandra=92s residence who=\r\n in Treta age combined spiritual supremacy and Kingship&quot; (Tranlated by Col.=\r\n H.S. Jarrett and published in Kolkata in 1891).In Chapter X of the Report =\r\nof Archeological Survey of India, NW., and Oudh (1889) it is mentioned (p.6=\r\n7) that Babri Mosque &quot;was built in AD 1528 by Mir Khan on the very spot whe=\r\nre the old temple of Janmasthan of Ram Chandra was standing.&quot;Hindus have th=\r\nroughout foreign occupation of India deeply held as sacred that exact spot =\r\nwhere the Babri Masjid once stood, as is recorded in many official and judi=\r\ncial proceedings. In 1885, for example, Mahant Raghubar Das in a Suit No 61=\r\n/280 of 1885 filed in the Court of Faizabad Sub-Judge against the Secretary=\r\n of State for India (who was based in London), prayed for permission to bui=\r\nld a temple on the Chabutra outside the mosque. His suit was dismissed on M=\r\narch 18, 1886.However, in his Order the Sub-Judge, an Englishman, stated: &quot;=\r\nIt is most unfortunate that a Masjid was built on land specially held sacre=\r\nd by the Hindus. But as the event occurred 358 years ago, it is too late no=\r\nw to remedy the grievance.&quot; Since the English as policy never sought to dis=\r\nturb the social status quo in India as evidenced, for example, on the =91Sa=\r\nti=92 question, the Judge took the easy way out and dismissed the Suit.It i=\r\ns now well established by GPRS-directed excavations done under the Allahaba=\r\nd High Court monitoring and verification in 2002-03, that a large temple di=\r\nd exist below where that Babri Masjid structure once stood. Inscriptions fo=\r\nund during excavations describe it as a temple of Vishnu Hari who had kille=\r\nd the demon king Dasanan (Ravana).The Sunni Wakf Board does not accept thes=\r\ne findings as meaning anything. It does not however matter if all this was =\r\nindeed so or not, since under Section 295 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) it=\r\n is prescribed that &quot;whoever destroys, damages or defiles any place of wors=\r\nhip, or any object held sacred by any class of persons, with the intention =\r\nof thereby insulting the religion of any class of persons or with the knowl=\r\nedge that any class of persons is likely to consider such destruction, dama=\r\nge or defilement as an insult to their religion, shall be punishable with i=\r\nmprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years,=\r\n or with fine, or with both.&quot;That is, an offence under criminal law is comm=\r\nitted if a body of persons hold something as sacred. It does not matter if =\r\nthe majority does or does not hold so. Nor can a court decide what is sacre=\r\nd and what is not. Only a body of persons can identify what is sacred. The =\r\noffence under Section 295 IPC is cognizable and non-bailable, as well as no=\r\nn-compoundable.The fundamental question before us is thus this: Can a templ=\r\ne and a masjid be considered at par as far as sacredness is concerned? Rely=\r\ning on two important court judgements that hold the field today, the answer=\r\n is no! A masjid is not an essential part of Islam, according to a majority=\r\n judgement of a Constitution Bench of India=92s Supreme Court.In the famous=\r\n Ismail Farooqui vs Union of India case (reported in (1994) 6 SCC 376), the=\r\n Supreme Court had observed: &quot;It has been contended that a mosque enjoys a =\r\nparticular position in Muslim law and once a mosque is established and pray=\r\ners are offered in such a mosque, the same remains for all time to come a p=\r\nroperty of Allah...and any person professing Islamic faith can offer prayer=\r\n in such a mosque, and even if the structure is demolished, the place remai=\r\nns the same where namaz can be offered.&quot; (para 80).The Constitution Bench r=\r\nebutted this contention. The Bench stated: &quot;The correct position may be sum=\r\nmarised thus. Under Mohammed law applicable in India, title to a mosque can=\r\n be lost by adverse possession...A mosque is not an essential part of the p=\r\nractice of the religion of Islam and namaz (prayer) can be offered anywhere=\r\n, even in the open. Accordingly, its acquisition is not prohibited by the p=\r\nrovisions in the Constitution of India.&quot; (para 82).Thus what was wrong in t=\r\nhe demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 was that it was unaut=\r\nhorised by law and hence a criminal offence. Otherwise any Government depri=\r\nving the Muslims of the Babri Masjid is within law, if the government decid=\r\nes to do so in the interest of public order, public health and morality (Ar=\r\nticle 25 of the Constitution). This is the position in Islamic law as well =\r\nsince in Saudi Arabia the authorities demolish mosque to lay roads. Even th=\r\ne mosque where Islam=92s Prophet Mohammed used to pray was demolished for a=\r\n road to pass through!But then what of a temple? Is it in the same category=\r\n as the mosque in our jurisprudence? When I was Union Law and Justice Minis=\r\nter, this question of the status of a temple-even if in ruins or without wo=\r\nrship-had come up before me in November 1990 in a case of a smuggled out br=\r\nonze Nataraja statue which was up for sale in London.The Government of Indi=\r\na when Rajiv Gandhi was PM had decided to file a case in the London trial c=\r\nourt in 1986 for recovery. The Nataraja statue had by then traced to a temp=\r\nle in ruins in Pathur, Thanjavur district. A farmer named Ramamoorthi had u=\r\nnearthed it in 1976 while digging mud with a spade near his hut.When the ne=\r\nws spread, touts of an antique dealer by name Ahmed Hussein reached him and=\r\n paid a small sum and smuggled it out to London, where in 1982 they sold it=\r\n to Bumper Development Corporation Private Limited. In turn the said Corpor=\r\nation sent it to the British Museum for appraisal and possible purchase. By=\r\n then the Government of India was onto it and asked the UK government to ta=\r\nke action.The Nataraja idol was seized by London Metropolitan Police, and t=\r\nhus the Corporation sued the Police in court for recovery but lost the case=\r\n. An appeal was filed in the Queens Bench (our High Court level) which was =\r\ndismissed on April 17, 1989. So, the Bumper Corporation went to the House o=\r\nf Lords (our Supreme Court level). On February 13, 1991 when I was Law Mini=\r\nster, the judgement came which is truly landmark dismissing Bumper=92s fina=\r\nl appeal (see (1991) 4 All ER 638).The UK Apex Court upheld the Indian gove=\r\nrnment=92s position that because of the prana prathista puja a temple is ow=\r\nned by the deity, in this case Lord Shiva, and any Hindu can litigate on be=\r\nhalf of the deity as a defacto trustee. The Bench consisting of Justices Pu=\r\nrchas, Nourse and Leggatt concluded: &quot;We therefore hold that the temple is =\r\nacceptable as party to these proceedings and that it is as such entitled to=\r\n sue for the recovery of the Nataraja.&quot; (page 648 para g).Thus even if a te=\r\nmple is in ruins as the ASI had found, or destroyed as Ram Temple was, any =\r\nHindu can sue on behalf of Lord Ram in court for recovery! No such ruling e=\r\nxists for a mosque for the simple reason that a mosque is just a facilitati=\r\non centre for reading namaz, and has no essentiality for Islam religion. It=\r\n can be demolished and/or shifted as any building can and are being so in A=\r\nrab countries and Pakistan. That is, the Ram Temple on Ramjanmabhoomi has a=\r\n superior claim to the site than any mosque. This the fundamental truth in =\r\nthe Ayodhya dispute. This truth will apply to Kashi Vishvanath and Brindava=\r\nn temple sites as well.The only compromise we Hindus can accept is that Mus=\r\nlims agree to shift the building of a new masjid to some other site beyond =\r\nthe Saryu River. It is important to note that as of now there are eight mos=\r\nques in Ayodhya which the ASI has taken over since these had no one coming =\r\nto read namaz. Hence what use will another mosque be? If however the Muslim=\r\n hardline organisations want to re-build the Babri Masjid in the Ramjanmabh=\r\noomi area, then the Hindus will launch a struggle.Hence what should be the =\r\npatriots=92 response to the judgement of Lucknow Bench of Allahabad High Co=\r\nurt allotting one-third of the Ramjanmabhoomi to the Sunni Wakf Board to bu=\r\nild a mosque in the area near the Ramlala temple? The response should be a =\r\nresounding No! A temple cannot be equated to a mosque. Nor can we Hindus by=\r\n the back door allow aggression and atrocity of demolishing temples be rewa=\r\nrded in any manner. Therefore, as with the Shah Bano case precedent, Govern=\r\nment should be forced by agitation if necessary to bring an amendment to th=\r\ne Acquisition of Certain Areas of Ayodhya Act of 1993 to bar constructing a=\r\nny structure other than those connected with a temple for Sri Ram.That will=\r\n be in keeping with the assurance contained in the affidavit filed in 1993 =\r\nby the Solicitor General of India in the Supreme Court: &quot;..namely, that (if=\r\n) a Hindu temple/structure did exist prior to the construction of the demol=\r\nished (mosque) structure, government action will be in support of the wishe=\r\ns of the Hindu community.&quot;That will be the fit atonement of the entire peop=\r\nle of our nation for tacitly tolerating for so long the demolition of Ram T=\r\nemple on the orders of Babar of Afghanistan. Babri, after whom the mosque i=\r\ns named incidentally was a 9 year boy in Kabul who was a &quot;special&quot; intimate=\r\n of Babar.If such an amendment is not brought forth, Hindus should wage a f=\r\nierce democratic struggle for the next 3=BD years to force the government t=\r\no do so or weld a solid Hindu vote so that in the next General Election a H=\r\nindu Front supported by the Hindu Dharmacharyas, VHP and RSS can obtain an =\r\nabsolute majority in the Lok Sabha.(The author is a former Union Law Minist=\r\ner and also the Convenor of the Legal and Parliamentary Cells of the Hindu =\r\nDharma Acharya Sabha)  \t\t \t   \t\t  \r\n--_92630803-cb4f-4f50-9ce5-fd15026d307d_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;Windows-1252&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;&lt;!--\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmm=\r\nessage\n{\nfont-size: 10pt;\nfont-family:Tahoma\n}\n--&gt;&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body cl=\r\nass=3D&#39;hmmessage&#39;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-f=\r\namily: Georgia; line-height: 17px; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); &quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\nline-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-=\r\nheight: 20px; font-family: &#39;bookman old style&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; f=\r\nont-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 127, 64); &quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 20px; =\r\nfont-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); &quot;&gt;&lt;font siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: normal; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; f=\r\nont-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Fundamentals of the battle for Sri Ram temple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;By Dr Subramanian Swamy&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-hei=\r\nght: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;Thanks:&nbsp;&lt;a href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=3DContent&amp;pa=3Dshowpage=\r\n&amp;pid=3D369&amp;page=3D12&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px;=\r\n font-weight: inherit; text-decoration: underline; color: rgb(30, 102, 174)=\r\n; cursor: pointer; &quot;&gt;http://www.organiser.org/dynamic/modules.php?name=3DCo=\r\nntent&amp;pa=3Dshowpage&amp;pid=3D369&amp;page=3D12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;=\r\nline-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;In fact, Baqi was a =\r\nShia Muslim, and hence he intended it to be a place for Shias to read namaz=\r\n.

Inscriptions found during excavations describe it a=\r\ns a temple of Vishnu Hari who had killed the demon king Dasanan (Ravana).&lt;b=\r\nr style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The Sunni=\r\n Wakf Board does not accept these findings as meaning anything. It does not=\r\n however matter if all this was indeed so or not, since under Section 295 o=\r\nf the Indian Penal Code (IPC) it is prescribed that &quot;whoever destroys, dama=\r\nges or defiles any place of worship, or any object held sacred by any class=\r\n of persons, with the intention of thereby insulting the religion of any cl=\r\nass of persons or with the knowledge that any class of persons is likely to=\r\n consider such destruction, damage or defilement as an insult to their reli=\r\ngion, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a ter=\r\nm which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.&quot;&lt;br style=3D&quot;l=\r\nine-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;That is, an offence u=\r\nnder criminal law is committed if a body of persons hold something as sacre=\r\nd. It does not matter if the majority does or does not hold so. Nor can a c=\r\nourt decide what is sacred and what is not. Only a body of persons can iden=\r\ntify what is sacred. The offence under Section 295 IPC is cognizable and no=\r\nn-bailable, as well as non-compoundable.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The fundamental question before us is thus=\r\n this: Can a temple and a masjid be considered at par as far as sacredness =\r\nis concerned? Relying on two important court judgements that hold the field=\r\n today, the answer is no! A masjid is not an essential part of Islam, accor=\r\nding to a majority judgement of a Constitution Bench of India=92s Supreme C=\r\nourt.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;In=\r\n the famous Ismail Farooqui vs Union of India case (reported in (1994) 6 SC=\r\nC 376), the Supreme Court had observed: &quot;It has been contended that a mosqu=\r\ne enjoys a particular position in Muslim law and once a mosque is establish=\r\ned and prayers are offered in such a mosque, the same remains for all time =\r\nto come a property of Allah...and any person professing Islamic faith can o=\r\nffer prayer in such a mosque, and even if the structure is demolished, the =\r\nplace remains the same where namaz can be offered.&quot; (para 80).&lt;br style=3D&quot;=\r\nline-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The Constitution Ben=\r\nch rebutted this contention. The Bench stated: &quot;The correct position may be=\r\n summarised thus. Under Mohammed law applicable in India, title to a mosque=\r\n can be lost by adverse possession...A mosque is not an essential part of t=\r\nhe practice of the religion of Islam and namaz (prayer) can be offered anyw=\r\nhere, even in the open. Accordingly, its acquisition is not prohibited by t=\r\nhe provisions in the Constitution of India.&quot; (para 82).&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-he=\r\night: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;Thus what was wrong in the =\r\ndemolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992 was that it was unauthor=\r\nised by law and hence a criminal offence. Otherwise any Government deprivin=\r\ng the Muslims of the Babri Masjid is within law, if the government decides =\r\nto do so in the interest of public order, public health and morality (Artic=\r\nle 25 of the Constitution). This is the position in Islamic law as well sin=\r\nce in Saudi Arabia the authorities demolish mosque to lay roads. Even the m=\r\nosque where Islam=92s Prophet Mohammed used to pray was demolished for a ro=\r\nad to pass through!&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-heig=\r\nht: 17px; &quot;&gt;But then what of a temple? Is it in the same category as the mo=\r\nsque in our jurisprudence? When I was Union Law and Justice Minister, this =\r\nquestion of the status of a temple-even if in ruins or without worship-had =\r\ncome up before me in November 1990 in a case of a smuggled out bronze Natar=\r\naja statue which was up for sale in London.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; =\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The Government of India when Rajiv Gand=\r\nhi was PM had decided to file a case in the London trial court in 1986 for =\r\nrecovery. The Nataraja statue had by then traced to a temple in ruins in Pa=\r\nthur, Thanjavur district. A farmer named Ramamoorthi had unearthed it in 19=\r\n76 while digging mud with a spade near his hut.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17=\r\npx; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;When the news spread, touts of an a=\r\nntique dealer by name Ahmed Hussein reached him and paid a small sum and sm=\r\nuggled it out to London, where in 1982 they sold it to Bumper Development C=\r\norporation Private Limited. In turn the said Corporation sent it to the Bri=\r\ntish Museum for appraisal and possible purchase. By then the Government of =\r\nIndia was onto it and asked the UK government to take action.&lt;br style=3D&quot;l=\r\nine-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The Nataraja idol was=\r\n seized by London Metropolitan Police, and thus the Corporation sued the Po=\r\nlice in court for recovery but lost the case. An appeal was filed in the Qu=\r\neens Bench (our High Court level) which was dismissed on April 17, 1989. So=\r\n, the Bumper Corporation went to the House of Lords (our Supreme Court leve=\r\nl). On February 13, 1991 when I was Law Minister, the judgement came which =\r\nis truly landmark dismissing Bumper=92s final appeal (see (1991) 4 All ER 6=\r\n38).&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The=\r\n UK Apex Court upheld the Indian government=92s position that because of th=\r\ne prana prathista puja a temple is owned by the deity, in this case Lord Sh=\r\niva, and any Hindu can litigate on behalf of the deity as a defacto trustee=\r\n. The Bench consisting of Justices Purchas, Nourse and Leggatt concluded: &quot;=\r\nWe therefore hold that the temple is acceptable as party to these proceedin=\r\ngs and that it is as such entitled to sue for the recovery of the Nataraja.=\r\n&quot; (page 648 para g).&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-hei=\r\nght: 17px; &quot;&gt;Thus even if a temple is in ruins as the ASI had found, or des=\r\ntroyed as Ram Temple was, any Hindu can sue on behalf of Lord Ram in court =\r\nfor recovery! No such ruling exists for a mosque for the simple reason that=\r\n a mosque is just a facilitation centre for reading namaz, and has no essen=\r\ntiality for Islam religion. It can be demolished and/or shifted as any buil=\r\nding can and are being so in Arab countries and Pakistan. That is, the Ram =\r\nTemple on Ramjanmabhoomi has a superior claim to the site than any mosque. =\r\nThis the fundamental truth in the Ayodhya dispute. This truth will apply to=\r\n Kashi Vishvanath and Brindavan temple sites as well.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-heig=\r\nht: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;The only compromise we Hindus=\r\n can accept is that Muslims agree to shift the building of a new masjid to =\r\nsome other site beyond the Saryu River. It is important to note that as of =\r\nnow there are eight mosques in Ayodhya which the ASI has taken over since t=\r\nhese had no one coming to read namaz. Hence what use will another mosque be=\r\n? If however the Muslim hardline organisations want to re-build the Babri M=\r\nasjid in the Ramjanmabhoomi area, then the Hindus will launch a struggle.&lt;b=\r\nr style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;Hence wha=\r\nt should be the patriots=92 response to the judgement of Lucknow Bench of A=\r\nllahabad High Court allotting one-third of the Ramjanmabhoomi to the Sunni =\r\nWakf Board to build a mosque in the area near the Ramlala temple? The respo=\r\nnse should be a resounding No! A temple cannot be equated to a mosque. Nor =\r\ncan we Hindus by the back door allow aggression and atrocity of demolishing=\r\n temples be rewarded in any manner. Therefore, as with the Shah Bano case p=\r\nrecedent, Government should be forced by agitation if necessary to bring an=\r\n amendment to the Acquisition of Certain Areas of Ayodhya Act of 1993 to ba=\r\nr constructing any structure other than those connected with a temple for S=\r\nri Ram.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;=\r\nThat will be in keeping with the assurance contained in the affidavit filed=\r\n in 1993 by the Solicitor General of India in the Supreme Court: &quot;..namely,=\r\n that (if) a Hindu temple/structure did exist prior to the construction of =\r\nthe demolished (mosque) structure, government action will be in support of =\r\nthe wishes of the Hindu community.&quot;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;That will be the fit atonement of the entire pe=\r\nople of our nation for tacitly tolerating for so long the demolition of Ram=\r\n Temple on the orders of Babar of Afghanistan. Babri, after whom the mosque=\r\n is named incidentally was a 9 year boy in Kabul who was a &quot;special&quot; intima=\r\nte of Babar.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17p=\r\nx; &quot;&gt;If such an amendment is not brought forth, Hindus should wage a fierce=\r\n democratic struggle for the next 3=BD years to force the government to do =\r\nso or weld a solid Hindu vote so that in the next General Election a Hindu =\r\nFront supported by the Hindu Dharmacharyas, VHP and RSS can obtain an absol=\r\nute majority in the Lok Sabha.&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;br style=\r\n=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;(The author is a former Union Law Minister and als=\r\no the Convenor of the Legal and Parliamentary Cells of the Hindu Dharma Ach=\r\narya Sabha)&nbsp;&lt;br style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;line-height: 17px; color: =\r\nrgb(255, 255, 255); &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt; \t\t \t   \t\t  &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--_92630803-cb4f-4f50-9ce5-fd15026d307d_--\r\n\n"}}
