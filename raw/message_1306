Someone=\r\n sent me a few snippets from an \ninterview posted on her website. Please se=\r\ne below.\n\nIt is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as h=\r\ner guru. It \nis interesting that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire c=\r\neremonies and \nshow what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will b=\r\ne peace&quot;. This \nis similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when s=\r\nhe appeared to \nhim during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n\nShe told him tha=\r\nt many people are and will be born who will perform a short \nfire ritual on=\r\n a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the \nworld and als=\r\no make quick spiritual progress individually in that process. \nShree Maa&#39;s =\r\nstatement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar \nlines.\n\nMy guru=\r\n was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \nshould=\r\n be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a \nday=\r\n. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous places and \ncan=\r\n be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no \nn=\r\need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum \nof=\r\nferings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a \nf=\r\new such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of \neve=\r\nnts that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n\nThough not 3 times a day,=\r\n these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for \n3 years in the same pl=\r\nace and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \nIt is the sadhana and=\r\n purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings \ndeities to a place. Whi=\r\nle several ancient temples are without any divine \npresence these days, new=\r\n places of divine presence may be created by pure \nsouls engaged in selfles=\r\ns sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, th=\r\ne sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which \nMother appeared and gave=\r\n instructions to my guru on spreading homam was \ntaken on Ramakrishna&#39; s bi=\r\nrth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within \na few minutes from the=\r\n actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. \nAll of this was a co=\r\nincidence and we were unaware of this significance when \nwe decided the muh=\r\nurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \nmention fire ceremoni=\r\nes specifically to somebody and that his words are \nsimilar to the words of=\r\n Mother.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- - \n\n&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; Ma=\r\nster, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt;\n&gt; Now here is the very in=\r\nteresting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; pasted for your benefit), from =\r\nan interview found here\n&gt; http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/5=\r\n4/86\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have t=\r\no go now for\n&gt; our country, and all other country, you have to go do fire c=\r\neremonies\n&gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and at that time the w=\r\nhole\n&gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satya=\r\nnanda Saraswati (of American descent),\n&gt; that same page describes his backg=\r\nround, how he met her and all that;\n&gt; but another interesting snippet in th=\r\nere:-\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was ardu=\r\nous at best,\n&gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where h=\r\ne studied\n&gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi=\r\n and\n&gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of worshi=\r\np\n&gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities in the process.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremo=\r\nny\n&gt; and worship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from the\n&gt; hu=\r\nmble temple grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!

While several ancient temples are without any divine &lt;BR&gt;presence th=\r\nese days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure &lt;BR&gt;souls en=\r\ngaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the\n world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As =\r\nI mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was w=\r\nithin &lt;BR&gt;a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth an=\r\nniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this si=\r\ngnificance when &lt;BR&gt;we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that =\r\nRamakrishna did &lt;BR&gt;mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and th=\r\nat his words are &lt;BR&gt;similar to the words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. h=\r\nome.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan n=\r\nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Master, has=\r\n a small ashram here near the Bay Area&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now here is the very=\r\n interesting part (snippets from her website&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pasted for your benefi=\r\nt), from an interview found here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.shreemaa.or=\r\ng/drupal/taxonomy_menu/54/86&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.shr=\r\neemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go now for=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our country, and all other country, you have to go do fire ceremon=\r\nies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and at that time the w=\r\nhole&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world will be peace.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He=\r\nr main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American descent),&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; that same page describes his background, how he met her and all that;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at best,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he studied=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi an=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the\n yagya, as his primary system of wo=\r\nrship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities in the pr=\r\nocess.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yag=\r\nya, a three year fire ceremony&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and worship of the Goddess, without =\r\nsetting foot outside from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humble temple grounds they establishe=\r\nd in Martinez, California.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOT=\r\nE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--6--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Add more friends =\r\nto your messenger and enjoy! &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_mess=\r\nenger_6/*http://messenger.yahoo.com/invite/&quot;&gt; Invite them now.&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-1500505519-1235539221=:36167--\r\n\n"}}
