All action is God&#39;s. His power has fixed each thing=\r\n into its own\nindividual function. By His agency the insentient objects and=\r\n the sentient\nbeings do their work. All actions are His.\n\n2. All are doing =\r\ntheir respective work. So what has God to do with it? We\nwill first conside=\r\nr the sentient beings and, later on, the insentient\nobjects. We are sentien=\r\nt beings. Let us first see whose actions are ours. We\nall desire a higher s=\r\ntate and work for it. But our achievements are not\nuniform. Sometimes the g=\r\noal is the same and so is the work, but why is there\na difference in the re=\r\nsults? Here God makes us understand that the action is\nHis. Otherwise all m=\r\nust be alike. The difference in the conditions cannot be\naccounted for. Can=\r\n there be anyone who does not wish to improve his\nposition? Whatever their =\r\nintention towards others, their intention towards\nthemselves is surely hone=\r\nst. The conditions of people of the same intention\nare yet different. This =\r\nis because all actions are of God.\n\n3. All beings have the same intention; =\r\nyet their efforts are of different\ndegrees, so also their states. After say=\r\ning this, the question arises: What\nis effort? Is it not simply a mental im=\r\nage? All these images have the same\norigin, namely, the common intention of=\r\n all. Why then should the image of\neffort differ in each? Here too God make=\r\ns us see that all actions are His.\n\n4. If it is said that notwithstanding t=\r\nhe same intention, the effort can\nvary according to individual capacity, th=\r\ne question arises: What is the\nsource of this capacity? It is of the body a=\r\nnd mind. The environment may\nalso affect it. One must take account of all t=\r\nhe factors before one makes an\neffort. However, these factors are not under=\r\n one&#39;s control so that the\neffort may not be equal to the task. Therefore a=\r\nll actions are God&#39;s.\n\n5. Again, if it is said that the body, the mind and =\r\nthe environment will\ngradually be made equal to the task, it implies a pres=\r\nent incapacity. This\nis to admit that all actions are God&#39;s.\n\n6. Now, is it=\r\n for good or bad that people do not gain their objectives? It\nis certainly =\r\ngood. Why? Most of them are selfish. Judge for yourself if\ntheir success is=\r\n for the good of the world or otherwise. You may ask: Should\nnot the attemp=\r\nts of the unselfish be entirely successful? Though to all\nappearances they =\r\nmay look unselfish, yet they are not free from blemishes.\nThese depend on t=\r\nhe ego. If the imagined unselfishness has given rise to a\nsense of superior=\r\nity over others, God frustrates their purpose and teaches\nthem that &quot;You ar=\r\ne also like others and I govern you&quot;. On the other hand,\nfree from selfishn=\r\ness and free from ego is the representative of God, within\nwhom the cloud o=\r\nf ego that conceals God does not exist and from whom God is\never shining fo=\r\nrth. To such a one of true purpose (Sattva Sankalpa) all his\nintentions com=\r\ne out true. God shines forth directly in him. There is no\ndarkness in him. =\r\nOnly he knows the Divine purpose as it is. Through him God\nfulfills the pur=\r\npose of His creation. All actions are God&#39;s.\n\n7. If it is asked: Is there n=\r\not a single person of true intent? And why\nshould not the world have all bl=\r\nessings in full? The answer, which is a\nsecret, is that the sages who are a=\r\nware that all actions are God&#39;s, wish to\nmake it known to others as well. T=\r\nhere is no greater good than to know that\nall actions are God&#39;s and not our=\r\n own. This knowledge contains all the\nblessings in itself. Therefore the in=\r\ntention of the sages is to clearly\ninstruct others in the knowledge of God =\r\nand His actions. Even so, they do\nnot say &quot;Know God this very instant,&quot; but=\r\n they teach the ways and means to\nknowledge and encourage us in right condu=\r\nct-this much only. They do not say,\n&quot;Be emancipated at once.&quot; Why? Because =\r\nthis is not possible for the common\npeople. Nor do the sages say to God, &quot;L=\r\niberate the people at once.&quot; Because\nthe sages are free from the ego and th=\r\nink, &quot;God knows what He should do and\nwhen to do it. What is there for me t=\r\no say to Him?&quot; Thus they wish only to\ndo their work, without any interest i=\r\nn the fruits this work may produce.\nThey have known that God alone dispense=\r\ns the fruits of actions. Simply they\nwatch the course of events in the worl=\r\nd and do their work, never thinking of\ncreating a world of their own. Why? =\r\nTo do so is a form of egoism. The\ncreation is as it should be. Everything i=\r\ns in order. All actions are God&#39;s.\n\n8. Knowing their actions are subservien=\r\nt to the Higher Power, how could they\nhope to achieve something dear to the=\r\nir hearts? No, they cannot. They will\ndo their work simply as a duty. The s=\r\ncriptures say, &quot;Do work, but do not\nthink of its fruits.&quot; Just as anger unc=\r\nonsciously overpowers a man even\nthough he is determined not to get angry, =\r\nso also the sages of true intent\n(Sattva Sankalpa) may be shocked by the in=\r\niquities of the world and\nunwittingly think, &quot;God, let that be made good!&quot; =\r\nIf so, then it will\ncertainly happen and good will prevail. This is the cau=\r\nse of some\nextraordinary events in the world. These extraordinary events ar=\r\ne the\nresults of a wish stealing into the mind of a sage. This is the law o=\r\nf\nnature. Who can change it? All actions are God&#39;s.\n\n9. Whatever takes plac=\r\ne, it is in the natural order of things. Also, it is\nright. Everything happ=\r\nens by His will alone. In truth, it is not wrong to\nthink &quot;He makes the thi=\r\nef steal.&quot; Why? Because at the time of punishment He\nalso makes the thief s=\r\nuffer for the robbery. Thus, there should be no\nill-will directed towards t=\r\nhe thief. Such is the fruit of the knowledge that\nall actions are God&#39;s.Alt=\r\nhough there is no ill-will towards the thief, there\nis a dislike of theft. =\r\nThis is also the result of our knowledge that all\nactions are God&#39;s. How is=\r\n this? Because the thief himself dislikes theft:\nWould he keep quiet if his=\r\n own belongings were stolen by another? He would\nnot. Who can be unaware th=\r\nat good is right and evil is wrong? Therefore the\nknowledge that all action=\r\ns are God&#39;s will bring into the world an era of\norderly conduct. Our knowle=\r\ndge does not extend further. We can repeat only\nwhat we know. We need not w=\r\norry about what lies beyond our knowledge. This\ntoo is God&#39;s will.\n\n10. One=\r\n of the fruits of knowledge granted to us by God is the knowledge\nthat all =\r\nactions are God&#39;s. We are powerless to ask God, &quot;Why do you act\nthus?&quot; Beca=\r\nuse the fruits of our actions are not always according to our\ndesire, all r=\r\neligions admit similar states of our powerlessness. In other\nwords, because=\r\n our powers are limited, we cannot but say that all actions\nare God&#39;s. The =\r\nlaw which applies to us, applies to insentient objects also.\nOur law is no =\r\nbetter than theirs. All is one. Even though some do not admit\nthat all acti=\r\nons are God&#39;s, yet they admit their own incapacity. This itself\nis the act =\r\nof God.\n\nChapter VI - EGO\n\n1. Oh ego, all the evils of the world are from y=\r\nou. To crush you, the kings\nmake laws and the wise give lessons. In spite o=\r\nf their efforts from time\nimmemorial, alas! you are yet alive; you simply g=\r\no into hiding and reappear\nagain and again. Can there be no end to you? Yea=\r\n, it is surely approaching.\nAnother Ego has started to kill you. It is the =\r\nUniversal Ego called &quot;I am\nBrahman&quot;.\n\n2. Eh! ego, think not that your enemy=\r\n is of your kind. You are perishable\nwhereas He is not. You are conceited a=\r\ns &quot;I&quot; because you always differentiate\nas &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;he,&quot; but your ene=\r\nmy is free from this conceit. How? He\nharmonizes all differences, resolves =\r\nall into Himself. Moreover, you feel\nenmity towards Him because he has aris=\r\nen to kill you. But He has no\nill-feelings towards you. How is this? Becaus=\r\ne you are not to be found in\nHis presence. He regards you as a part of His =\r\nlimbs. Your loss in his\nproximity is the working of your own falsity; He wo=\r\nuld not think of killing\nyou because you are of no consequence in His sight=\r\n. Therefore, ego, you are\nHis enemy, but He is not yours. More briefly put,=\r\n you are your own enemy.\nWhy? Owing to your greed you flaunted yourself bef=\r\nore the Great One as you\nwould elsewhere. Instantly, you were lost; therefo=\r\nre, the Universal Self\nobscures you by devouring you and then shines forth =\r\nas All-light.\n\n3. Eh! ego, the evils of your works have no limits. You are =\r\nnot content\nunless you are exalted above others and others are lowered befo=\r\nre you.\nEndless are your desires, such as &quot;By what title shall I gain honor=\r\n?&quot; &quot;In\nwhat form shall I appear elegant?&quot; &quot;Do others bow to me? Do others o=\r\nbey me\nin silence?&quot; &quot;Do others say that no one excels me?&quot;. Alas! How short=\r\n is your\nlife! And yet to how much do you aspire! And how much evil you do!=\r\n You have\ndeluded yourself that there is happiness in such ideas and in\ndif=\r\nferentiating yourself from all others. This is not to your good. Why not?\nA=\r\nre not others also entitled to all these? What is your share in things\nwhic=\r\nh are common to millions and millions of others? Such being the case, do\nno=\r\nt desire in vain to rule over all. By your vain desire you bring about\nevil=\r\n to yourself and to others. Listen to my friendly advice. Truly\nspeaking, H=\r\ne whom you regard as your mortal enemy is your friend. He knows\nhow to make=\r\n you worthy of true greatness and blessings. Surrender to Him.\nThis Univers=\r\nal Ego does not treat you as an enemy but is your greatest\nbenefactor.\n\n4. =\r\nBy no means can you discover what He will make of you unless you\nsurrender =\r\nyourself to Him. However much I may speak of it, you cannot\nunderstand. It =\r\nis a matter of experience. Doubtless He will do nothing less\nthan exalt you=\r\n to His state. Therefore, be not perplexed about your future;\ndirectly surr=\r\nender yourself. You can always turn away if joy does not\novertake you from =\r\nthe very instant of surrender.Just as the drinking of milk\nstarts with an a=\r\ngreeable taste and ends with the satisfaction of hunger, so\nalso surrender =\r\nstarts with delight and ends with Perfect Bliss, which lies\nbeyond evenplea=\r\nsure and pain. Therefore your goal, without doubt, is this\nUniversal Ego (I=\r\n-am-Brahman).\n\n5. What will be your new name after surrender? There is no n=\r\name besides\nyours. The Vedas laud you; the world praises you; the essence o=\r\nf religious\nteachings is yourself. Then what is your form? All forms are yo=\r\nurs. There is\nno form which is not yours. What is installed in the temples =\r\nof worship is\nyou; what is described in the Vedas is you; festivities and c=\r\nelebrations are\nall for you. Now what can be your power? In your presence t=\r\nhe world is\nactive; each is what it is, because of you. Briefly said, all t=\r\nhings glorify\nyou and bear witness to your being. They are duty bound to do=\r\n so. You would\nnot have even dreamt that this will be your state. Start at =\r\nonce, be not\nself-conceited. The Universal Ego awaits you.\n\n6. Do you wish =\r\nto wake up from your dream or continue in it? How long will\nthe dream image=\r\ns last? Be not idle, shake off your sleep, wake up! You are\nwitnessing your=\r\n own mental images and imagining more and more. It is all in\nvain. Just fin=\r\nd out who it is that sees the visions. Do not delude yourself\nthat you are =\r\nthese that rise and sink in you. Wake up. The instant you wake\nup you will =\r\nknow that waking is better than this dream. Get up!The Universal\nEgo waits =\r\nto rejoice at seeing you awake.\n\n7. Fear not the cessation of the present e=\r\ngo dream. Once you are awake you\nwill enjoy the same all the more. You will=\r\n no longer be deluded and will\nobserve it with cheerful detachment, unconfu=\r\nsed. The folly of all\nappearances will be understood and you will have no b=\r\nurdens. In dream your\nmental imagery assumes shapes. On waking you know the=\r\n dream as just a\ndream. Do not mistake dream for the waking state. Know the=\r\n dream as dream.\nFor doing so, you must reach the state of &quot;I-am-Brahman&quot; (=\r\nUniversal Ego) and\nwake from the illusion of the ego.\n\n8. I have instructed=\r\n you for your good and not in my own interest. If you\nbelieve me, you shoul=\r\nd act upon what I have taught you. On the other hand,\nif you see no good in=\r\n what I have said, then turn away from this ideal. How\ncan I help you if my=\r\n advice and all the advice of the saints do not make any\nimpression on you?=\r\n No state is higher than this. Believe me, it is for your\ngood that you rea=\r\nlize this truth; and through you others may realize the\nsame. Be free from =\r\nself-conceit. Start at once. Realize that the Universal\nEgo is your own.\n\n9=\r\n Oh ego, see how you are a slave to all and therefore suffer. How pitiable\n=\r\nis your state! All are hostile to you! When you say &quot;for me only,&quot; all\nothe=\r\nrs will also contend &quot;for me only, for me only&quot;. When you say &quot;I am\ngreat,&quot;=\r\n they protest, &quot;Why? We are also.&quot; All are hostile to you. Owing to\nthe tro=\r\nubles caused by others, your mental images increase a million fold.\nShould =\r\nyou not rise above them and profit by surrendering to a Master? Then\nall yo=\r\nur enemies will befriend you. If you say to others, &quot;All these are\nyours,&quot; =\r\neveryone becomes your friend. There is only One who can make you\nthat magna=\r\nnimous and that is &quot;I-am-Brahman&quot; (Universal Ego).\n\n10. I shall say one wor=\r\nd only and this is not owing to my egoism. It is\nsimply my duty. I do not s=\r\nay this word just for your or my good alone. It is\nfor the good of all. The=\r\n truth is &quot;I-am-Brahman&quot; (Universal Ego).\n\nSources:\n1) http://www.arunachal=\r\na.org/newsletters/1999/?pg=3Djan-feb\n2) http://www.arunachala.org/newslette=\r\nrs/1999/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =\r\n =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636d34cc679868a048cbd081c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nChapter V - ACTION&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;1. Al=\r\nl action is God&#39;s. His power has fixed each thing into its own individu=\r\nal function. By His agency the insentient objects and the sentient beings d=\r\no their work. All actions are His.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;2. All are doing their r=\r\nespective work. So what has God to do with it? We will first consider the s=\r\nentient beings and, later on, the insentient objects. We are sentient being=\r\ns. Let us first see whose actions are ours.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;We all desire a higher state and work for it. But our achievements a=\r\nre not uniform. Sometimes the goal is the same and so is the work, but why =\r\nis there a difference in the results? Here God makes us understand that the=\r\n action is His. Otherwise all must be alike.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0The difference in =\r\nthe conditions cannot be accounted for. Can there be anyone who does not wi=\r\nsh to improve his position? Whatever their intention towards others, their =\r\nintention towards themselves is surely honest. The conditions of people of =\r\nthe same intention are yet different. This is because all actions are of Go=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3. All beings have the same intention; yet their efforts are of=\r\n different degrees, so also their states. After saying this, the question a=\r\nrises: What is effort? Is it not simply a mental image? All these images ha=\r\nve the same origin, namely, the common intention of all. Why then should th=\r\ne image of effort differ in each? Here too God makes us see that all action=\r\ns are His.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;If it is said =\r\nthat notwithstanding the same intention, the effort can vary according to i=\r\nndividual capacity, the question arises: What is the source of this capacit=\r\ny? It is of the body and mind. The environment may also affect it. One must=\r\n take account of all the factors before one makes an effort. However, these=\r\n factors are not under one&#39;s control so that the effort may not be equa=\r\nl to the task. Therefore all actions are God&#39;s.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;5. Agai=\r\nn, if it is said that the body, the mind and the environment will gradually=\r\n be made equal to the task, it implies a present incapacity. This is to adm=\r\nit that all actions are God&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Now, is it for good or bad tha=\r\nt people do not gain their objectives? It is certainly good. Why? Most of t=\r\nhem are selfish. Judge for yourself if their success is for the good of the=\r\n world or otherwise.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;You may ask: Sho=\r\nuld not the attempts of the unselfish be entirely successful? Though to all=\r\n appearances they may look unselfish, yet they are not free from blemishes.=\r\n These depend on the ego. If the imagined unselfishness has given rise to a=\r\n sense of superiority over others, God frustrates their purpose and teaches=\r\n them that &quot;You are also like others and I govern you&quot;. On the ot=\r\nher hand, free from selfishness and free from ego is the representative of =\r\nGod, within whom the cloud of ego that conceals God does not exist and from=\r\n whom God is ever shining forth. To such a one of true purpose (Sattva Sank=\r\nalpa) all his intentions come out true. God shines forth directly in him. T=\r\nhere is no darkness in him. Only he knows the Divine purpose as it is. Thro=\r\nugh him God fulfills the purpose of His creation. All actions are God&#39;s=\r\n.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;7. If it is asked: Is there not a single person of true i=\r\nntent? And why should not the world have all blessings in full? The answer,=\r\n which is a secret, is that the sages who are aware that all actions are Go=\r\nd&#39;s, wish to make it known to others as well. There is no greater good =\r\nthan to know that all actions are God&#39;s and not our own. This knowledge=\r\n contains all the blessings in itself. Therefore the intention of the sages=\r\n is to clearly instruct others in the knowledge of God and His actions. Eve=\r\nn so, they do not say &quot;Know God this very instant,&quot; but they teac=\r\nh the ways and means to knowledge and encourage us in right conduct-this mu=\r\nch only. They do not say, &quot;Be emancipated at once.&quot; Why? Because =\r\nthis is not possible for the common people. Nor do the sages say to God, &q=\r\nuot;Liberate the people at once.&quot; Because the sages are free from the =\r\nego and think, &quot;God knows what He should do and when to do it. What is=\r\n there for me to say to Him?&quot; Thus they wish only to do their work, wi=\r\nthout any interest in the fruits this work may produce. They have known tha=\r\nt God alone dispenses the fruits of actions. Simply they watch the course o=\r\nf events in the world and do their work, never thinking of creating a world=\r\n of their own. Why? To do so is a form of egoism. The creation is as it sho=\r\nuld be. Everything is in order. All actions are God&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;8. Know=\r\ning their actions are subservient to the Higher Power, how could they hope =\r\nto achieve something dear to their hearts? No, they cannot. They will do th=\r\neir work simply as a duty.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The script=\r\nures say, &quot;Do work, but do not think of its fruits.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0=\r\nJust as anger unconsciously overpowers a man even though he is determined n=\r\not to get angry, so also the sages of true intent (Sattva Sankalpa) may be =\r\nshocked by the iniquities of the world and unwittingly think, &quot;God, le=\r\nt that be made good!&quot; If so, then it will certainly happen and good wi=\r\nll prevail. This is the cause of some extraordinary events in the world. Th=\r\nese extraordinary events are the results of a wish stealing into the mind o=\r\nf a sage. This is the law of nature. Who can change it? All actions are God=\r\n&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;9. Whatever takes place, it is in the natural order of thi=\r\nngs. Also, it is right.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Everything ha=\r\nppens by His will alone. In truth, it is not wrong to think &quot;He makes =\r\nthe thief steal.&quot; Why? Because at the time of punishment He also makes=\r\n the thief suffer for the robbery. Thus, there should be no ill-will direct=\r\ned towards the thief.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Such is the fruit of the knowledge that a=\r\nll actions are God&#39;s.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Although there is=\r\n no ill-will towards the thief, there is a dislike of theft. This is also t=\r\nhe result of our knowledge that all actions are God&#39;s. How is this? Bec=\r\nause the thief himself dislikes theft: Would he keep quiet if his own belon=\r\ngings were stolen by another? He would not.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Who can be unaware =\r\nthat good is right and evil is wrong? Therefore the knowledge that all acti=\r\nons are God&#39;s will bring into the world an era of orderly conduct. Our =\r\nknowledge does not extend further. We can repeat only what we know. We need=\r\n not worry about what lies beyond our knowledge. This too is God&#39;s will=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;10. One of the fruits of knowledge granted to us by God is the k=\r\nnowledge that all actions are God&#39;s. We are powerless to ask God, &quot=\r\n;Why do you act thus?&quot; Because the fruits of our actions are not alway=\r\ns according to our desire, all religions admit similar states of our powerl=\r\nessness. In other words, because our powers are limited, we cannot but say =\r\nthat all actions are God&#39;s. The law which applies to us, applies to ins=\r\nentient objects also. Our law is no better than theirs. All is one.=C2=A0&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Even though some do not admit that all actio=\r\nns are God&#39;s, yet they admit their own incapacity. This itself is the a=\r\nct of God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Chapter VI - EG=\r\nO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;1. Oh ego, all the evils o=\r\nf the world are from you. To crush you, the kings make laws and the wise gi=\r\nve lessons. In spite of their efforts from time immemorial, alas! you are y=\r\net alive; you simply go into hiding and reappear again and again. Can there=\r\n be no end to you? Yea, it is surely approaching. Another Ego has started t=\r\no kill you. It is the Universal Ego called &quot;I am Brahman&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;2. Eh! ego, think not that your enemy is of your kind. You are pe=\r\nrishable whereas He is not. You are conceited as &quot;I&quot; because you =\r\nalways differentiate as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;he,&quot; =\r\nbut your enemy is free from this conceit. How? He harmonizes all difference=\r\ns, resolves all into Himself. Moreover, you feel enmity towards Him because=\r\n he has arisen to kill you. But He has no ill-feelings towards you. How is =\r\nthis? Because you are not to be found in His presence. He regards you as a =\r\npart of His limbs. Your loss in his proximity is the working of your own fa=\r\nlsity; He would not think of killing you because you are of no consequence =\r\nin His sight. Therefore, ego, you are His enemy, but He is not yours. More =\r\nbriefly put, you are your own enemy. Why? Owing to your greed you flaunted =\r\nyourself before the Great One as you would elsewhere. Instantly, you were l=\r\nost; therefore, the Universal Self obscures you by devouring you and then s=\r\nhines forth as All-light.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;Eh! ego, the evils of your works have no limits. You are not content unles=\r\ns you are exalted above others and others are lowered before you. Endless a=\r\nre your desires, such as &quot;By what title shall I gain honor?&quot; &quo=\r\nt;In what form shall I appear elegant?&quot; &quot;Do others bow to me? Do =\r\nothers obey me in silence?&quot; &quot;Do others say that no one excels me?=\r\n&quot;. Alas! How short is your life! And yet to how much do you aspire! An=\r\nd how much evil you do! You have deluded yourself that there is happiness i=\r\nn such ideas and in differentiating yourself from all others. This is not t=\r\no your good. Why not? Are not others also entitled to all these? What is yo=\r\nur share in things which are common to millions and millions of others? Suc=\r\nh being the case, do not desire in vain to rule over all. By your vain desi=\r\nre you bring about evil to yourself and to others.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Listen to my=\r\n friendly advice. Truly speaking, He whom you regard as your mortal enemy i=\r\ns your friend. He knows how to make you worthy of true greatness and blessi=\r\nngs. Surrender to Him. This Universal Ego does not treat you as an enemy bu=\r\nt is your greatest benefactor.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4. By no means can you discover wha=\r\nt He will make of you unless you surrender yourself to Him. However much I =\r\nmay speak of it, you cannot understand. It is a matter of experience. Doubt=\r\nless He will do nothing less than exalt you to His state. Therefore, be not=\r\n perplexed about your future; directly surrender yourself. You can always t=\r\nurn away if joy does not overtake you from the very instant of surrender.&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Just as the drinking of milk starts with an =\r\nagreeable taste and ends with the satisfaction of hunger, so also surrender=\r\n starts with delight and ends with Perfect Bliss, which lies beyond evenple=\r\nasure and pain. Therefore your goal, without doubt, is this Universal Ego (=\r\nI-am-Brahman).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;5. What will be your new name after surrende=\r\nr? There is no name besides yours. The Vedas laud you; the world praises yo=\r\nu; the essence of religious teachings is yourself. Then what is your form? =\r\nAll forms are yours. There is no form which is not yours. What is installed=\r\n in the temples of worship is you; what is described in the Vedas is you; f=\r\nestivities and celebrations are all for you. Now what can be your power? In=\r\n your presence the world is active; each is what it is, because of you. Bri=\r\nefly said, all things glorify you and bear witness to your being. They are =\r\nduty bound to do so. You would not have even dreamt that this will be your =\r\nstate. Start at once, be not self-conceited. The Universal Ego awaits you.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;6.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Do you wish to wake up fr=\r\nom your dream or continue in it? How long will the dream images last? Be no=\r\nt idle, shake off your sleep, wake up! You are witnessing your own mental i=\r\nmages and imagining more and more. It is all in vain. Just find out who it =\r\nis that sees the visions. Do not delude yourself that you are these that ri=\r\nse and sink in you. Wake up. The instant you wake up you will know that wak=\r\ning is better than this dream. Get up!&lt;/span&gt;The Universal Ego waits to rej=\r\noice at seeing you awake.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;7. Fear not the cessation of the present=\r\n ego dream. Once you are awake you will enjoy the same all the more. You wi=\r\nll no longer be deluded and will observe it with cheerful detachment, uncon=\r\nfused. The folly of all appearances will be understood and you will have no=\r\n burdens. In dream your mental imagery assumes shapes. On waking you know t=\r\nhe dream as just a dream.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Do not mist=\r\nake dream for the waking state. Know the dream as dream. For doing so, you =\r\nmust reach the state of &quot;I-am-Brahman&quot; (Universal Ego) and wake f=\r\nrom the illusion of the ego.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;8. I have instructed you for y=\r\nour good and not in my own interest. If you believe me, you should act upon=\r\n what I have taught you. On the other hand, if you see no good in what I ha=\r\nve said, then turn away from this ideal. How can I help you if my advice an=\r\nd all the advice of the saints do not make any impression on you? No state =\r\nis higher than this. Believe me, it is for your good that you realize this =\r\ntruth; and through you others may realize the same. Be free from self-conce=\r\nit. Start at once. Realize that the Universal Ego is your own.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;9 O=\r\nh ego, see how you are a slave to all and therefore suffer. How pitiable is=\r\n your state! All are hostile to you! When you say &quot;for me only,&quot; =\r\nall others will also contend &quot;for me only, for me only&quot;. When you=\r\n say &quot;I am great,&quot; they protest, &quot;Why? We are also.&quot; Al=\r\nl are hostile to you. Owing to the troubles caused by others, your mental i=\r\nmages increase a million fold. Should you not rise above them and profit by=\r\n surrendering to a Master? Then all your enemies will befriend you. If you =\r\nsay to others, &quot;All these are yours,&quot; everyone becomes your frien=\r\nd. There is only One who can make you that magnanimous and that is &quot;I-=\r\nam-Brahman&quot; (Universal Ego).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;10. I shall say one word only an=\r\nd this is not owing to my egoism. It is simply my duty. I do not say this w=\r\nord just for your or my good alone. It is for the good of all. The truth is=\r\n &quot;I-am-Brahman&quot; (Universal Ego).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;Sources&lt;/span&gt;:=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/=\r\nnewsletters/1999/?pg=3Djan-feb&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org=\r\n/newsletters/1999/?pg=3Djan-feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.=\r\norg/newsletters/1999/?pg=3Dmar-apr&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala=\r\n.org/newsletters/1999/?pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:=\r\n0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-to=\r\np:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3=\r\nem&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636d34cc679868a048cbd081c--\r\n\n"}}
