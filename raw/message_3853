I would l=\r\nike to point out that brahmacharya should not be taken\n&gt; as a unilateral de=\r\ncision and that the wife&#39;s sexual needs also be honored\n&gt; and respected (wh=\r\nether verbally articulated or not). Even Ramakrishna\n&gt; offered Sarada that =\r\nhe would give up his sexual abstinence in order to\n&gt; fulfill his husbandly =\r\ndharma towards her. Grhastha dharma in many of our\n&gt; scriptures enjoins cer=\r\ntain restrictions upon sexual behavior (e.g., not\n&gt; during Ekadasi or other=\r\n certain days, or so many days after a woman&#39;s menses\n&gt; has ended, etc.), w=\r\nhich are short of extended periods of sexual celibacy but\n&gt; nevertheless ac=\r\ncomplish the same ends (gradually, over time) of channeling\n&gt; healthily, co=\r\nntrolling, and then overcoming the desire for sex. Also,\n&gt; forcible repress=\r\nion can have the opposite effet--flaring up of strong sexual\n&gt; urges that c=\r\nan be more problematic later on if healthy release is not\n&gt; allowed. A lot =\r\nof problems in the Catholic church, ISKCON and now BAPS are\n&gt; attributable =\r\nto this.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Mar 3, 2010 at 10:27 AM, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@.=\r\n..&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Vijay,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I suggest reading &quot;Brahmachary=\r\na&quot; pdf in file section. The manual, written\n&gt; &gt; by Swami Sivananda, is comp=\r\nrehensive and throws light on the topic in a big\n&gt; &gt; way. It probably answe=\r\nrs many or all of your questions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One thing is for sure - Swami Viv=\r\nekananda (In Rajayoga book), Sivananda (In\n&gt; &gt; the Manual mentioned above),=\r\n Even unconventional Vimalanada (Aghora Part-2)\n&gt; &gt; agree, in no uncertain =\r\nterms, that real spiritual progress requires complete\n&gt; &gt; absent of Sex Ide=\r\na and action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnr=\r\nao@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The argument involving Virya is not satisfying to me:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Thi=\r\ns explanation is explaining predominantly from a male point of view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2=\r\n. According the modern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnot, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why so muc=\r\nh focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the\n&gt; &gt; common argumen=\r\nt is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our\n&gt; &gt; karma. But=\r\n, why burn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way of\n&gt; &gt; burn=\r\ning karma seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n mind. In order to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; energy. I trust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 4. Is not the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to\n&gt; &gt; antic=\r\nipate/wish for an experiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsadhana with out any anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energ=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; or even obtaining Moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmachar=\r\nya is to keep the mind in Brahman all the\n&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not=\r\n result in any more karma because, your mind is\n&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and=\r\n hence you do not identify yourself in your actions.\n&gt; &gt; You do them becaus=\r\ne you had to do them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoi=\r\nding certain actions but, try\n&gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about=\r\n God while doing any/every thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I rea=\r\nd in my child hood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the be=\r\nst devotee as he keeps\n&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disapp=\r\noints him by naming some\n&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cut=\r\nter utters the name of Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada pro=\r\ntests and then Vishnu gives him a\n&gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to p=\r\nut it on his head and walk around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to ch=\r\nant God&#39;s name while you are doing sex. If\n&gt; &gt; you can manage to decrease a=\r\nmount of joy you derise out of sex, then you are\n&gt; &gt; on the correct path. N=\r\nigraha will come automatically if you stop enjoying\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
