I told \nmy=\r\nself that it is surely due to the amount of stress, his body must \nhave gon=\r\ne thro&#39; because of tremendous Sadhanaas he has performed in \nrecent years.\n=\r\n\nlike you all noticed, i was also pleasently surprised to see \nthe &#39;Glowing=\r\n Face&#39; of his in the video when i saw it for the first \ntime day before yes=\r\nterday. actually i was very happy to see his \nshining face in that video.\nB=\r\nUT it hardly matters to me if his face is shining or lusterless. To \nbe hon=\r\nest, Even his knowledge has not impressed me that much because \nYou&#39;ll find=\r\n great many &#39;Orators&#39; and philosophical lacturers. even i \ncan give a good =\r\nphilosophical lacture. it may not be a big deal now \na days. What has reall=\r\ny impressed me is his attitude of engaging \ninto practical Sadhanaas. He ha=\r\ns inspired me with his demonstration \nof doing Sadhanaas. His steadfastness=\r\n in putting long hours for God. \n32 chandi Homas in 3 days is not a joke. H=\r\ne is very very serious in \nhis quest for Realisation and THAT is the thing =\r\nwhich inspires me.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Padmaja Sunchu \n&lt;padmaja.sunchu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Om Vishnave Namah\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Namasthe Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; Its a coincidence that I too was thinking of the same=\r\n, when I \nfirst saw the\n&gt; video.\n&gt; I had met Sri Narasimha garu in August 2=\r\n006 at the SJC West Coast\n&gt; Conference,\n&gt; and I see a lustre in his face no=\r\nw.\n&gt; \n&gt; Srinivasa\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Feb 6, 2009 at 7:21 AM, m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Namaste\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The video is very good, Good work by the =\r\nvideo grapher and \nNarasimha.\n&gt; &gt; It was a pleasure watching it and I feel =\r\nthat I will watch it a \nfew\n&gt; &gt; more times.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most importantly I want=\r\n to bring out the fact that when one does \na lot\n&gt; &gt; japams and homams, the=\r\n good work is reflected in the persons \nface,\n&gt; &gt; the lustre etc. Although =\r\nI have not met Narasimha ever, I have \nseen\n&gt; &gt; one picture of him may be f=\r\nrom many years ago and now the video.\n&gt; &gt; There is a striking difference be=\r\ntween the two.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The transformation internally may be more intense an=\r\nd fantanstic.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On a different note, I have heard from a very realize=\r\nd soul that\n&gt; &gt; The Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks i=\r\ns \nreserved\n&gt; &gt; for them, it is not advisible for people like us married or=\r\n \nsingle to\n&gt; &gt; put it on.
