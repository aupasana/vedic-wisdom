Each person is usually protected by his own aura which extends six in=\r\nches from the physical body. Normal healthy people have nothing to fear fro=\r\nm any entities and so on. Only when there is a rupture in the aura or imbal=\r\nance in some of the chakras there is a possibility of intrusion .Again such=\r\n an intrusion should be sanctioned by one&#39;s own karma&#39;s in the past life wh=\r\nich make such an individual susecptibile to possession which might be revea=\r\nled by astrology chart.\n\nJust remain as the witness during your meditation =\r\nand all your fears will melt away . One of the members of this group recent=\r\nly had a nice forward email from Swami Sivananda where the swami says &quot; man=\r\ny sanyasis chant Sivoham ,Sivoham externally but will run away at the mere =\r\nsight of a cat in the jungle at night &quot; . Just gently remind yourself that =\r\nyou are neither the body , nor the experiences you see during meditation. T=\r\nhis will immensely heal your subconscious and reduce many fears.\n\nIf it wil=\r\nl help to reassure you further , just like Narasimha ji had posted a few mo=\r\nnths back ...ghosts or spirits are not out to get you nor do they have a wh=\r\nole planning mechanism on attacking people . They are simply souls waiting =\r\nin a different dimension to take rebirth.\n\nAll that you experience during m=\r\neditation is your own subconscious bringing about thoughts from your mind w=\r\nhirlpool.Just be the witness and you will see a majority of those ripples w=\r\nill disappear.\n\nWish you happy meditations henceforth.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ra=\r\nm Kishore \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;ved=\r\nicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also had simil=\r\nar experiences as Priya, but I feel my case is slightly different and I hav=\r\ne a specific fear, wondering if you can address it. Background is that I am=\r\n definitely going through a bad patch after my dad&#39;s passing about 7 months=\r\n ago. Recently, in my dreams I have witnessed intense suffering (and when w=\r\nitnessing it I somehow &quot;knew&quot; it was the worst suffering possible in this u=\r\nniverse). Note that I say witnessed and not experienced. In the dream one m=\r\noment I was outside in the bright sunlight, then suddenly was drawn into an=\r\n underground railway station and into a train I didnt want to be in. A woma=\r\nn on the train told me it is going to Praarthak, Pravarthak (some such word=\r\n). I wanted to get out, and take the next train back. But it kept taking me=\r\n on. I knew somehow it was going to take me to 7 stations, I dont know how.=\r\n At each of the 7 stations, all underground without light, were &quot;half forme=\r\nd people&quot; in absolute, unbelievable darkness, pain and misery. They were in=\r\n a sense &quot;trying to get their identity together&quot; without as much as a ray o=\r\nf hope or light. The suffering was too intense. I felt like they/their pain=\r\n would overwhelm me and draw me into them/the pain/their-closed-suffering-f=\r\nilled-darkness for eternity, but I was not them. Simultaneously, I have had=\r\n other dreams in which someone is around me, trying to get to/into me.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I have also been doing meditations in which I am trying to open my heart, =\r\nlet my emotions out (I am very reserved by nature). These meditations are q=\r\nuite cathartic and give me peace at the end. But here is my fear: I feel th=\r\nis &quot;opening myself out internally&quot; is attracting some huge external negativ=\r\nity of some kind. Is this possible? Or is it simply my own bad karma of the=\r\n past that is being revealed to me? How do I tell if this negativity is to =\r\nbe experienced and suffered (if it is my own), or is to be avoided (if it i=\r\ns someone else)?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaste Priya,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As Atul ji said, one has to experience various po=\r\nsitives and negatives \n&gt; &gt; before tasting Amrita, based on one&#39;s kaarmik de=\r\nbts and conditioning. \n&gt; &gt; People reap their good and bad karmas over time =\r\nand go through \n&gt; &gt; pleasurable and painful situations. We cannot change th=\r\ne whole world or \n&gt; &gt; make people avoid the fruits of their karmas. When we=\r\n observe people \n&gt; &gt; suffering, we should do something about it if there is=\r\n something we can \n&gt; &gt; do and it feels like the right thing to do. Otheriws=\r\ne, we should just \n&gt; &gt; observe and move on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Next time something li=\r\nke this happens, try not to be scared or upset. \n&gt; &gt; Try to tell yourself t=\r\nhat you are just an observer. Feeling \n&gt; &gt; compassionate about someone&#39;s pr=\r\noblems is one thing and identifying with \n&gt; &gt; it and feeling scred or upset=\r\n is another. Try to distance yourself from \n&gt; &gt; it and think of god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Every experiences, pleasurable or painful, will eventually pass away. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Instead of focusing the mind on the passing clouds, one needs to learn \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; to focus it on the sky behind the clouds. That alone is a constant. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Clouds do not stay forever.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
