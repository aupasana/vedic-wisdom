I =\r\nhave had another thing for you to do and it is for that I have brought you =\r\nhere, to teach you what you could not learn for yourself and to train you f=\r\nor my work.&quot; Then He placed the Gita in my hands. His strength entered into=\r\n me and I was able to do the sadhana of the Gita. I was not only to underst=\r\nand intellectually but to realise what Sri Krishna demanded of Arjuna and w=\r\nhat He demands of those who aspire to do His work, to be free from repulsio=\r\nn and desire, to do work for Him without the demand for fruit, to renounce =\r\nself-will and become a passive and faithful instrument in His hands, to hav=\r\ne an equal heart for high and low, friend and opponent, success and failure=\r\n, yet not to do His work negligently. I realised what the Hindu religion me=\r\nant. We speak often of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few o=\r\nf us really know what that religion is. Other religions are preponderatingl=\r\ny religions of faith and profession, but the Sanatan Dharma is life itself;=\r\n it is a thing that has not so much to be believed as lived. This is the Dh=\r\narma that for the salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of t=\r\nhis peninsula from of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising=\r\n. She does not rise as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, =\r\nto trample on the weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted t=\r\no her over the world. India has always existed for humanity and not for her=\r\nself and it is for humanity and not for herself that she must be great.\n\nTh=\r\nerefore this was the next thing He pointed out to me, =97 He made me realis=\r\ne the central truth of the Hindu religion. He turned the hearts of my jailo=\r\nrs to me and they spoke to the Englishman in charge of the jail, &quot;He is suf=\r\nfering in his confinement; let him at least walk outside his cell for half =\r\nan hour in the morning and in the evening.&quot; So it was arranged, and it was =\r\nwhile I was walking that His strength again entered into me. I looked the j=\r\nail that secluded me from men and it was no longer by its high walls that I=\r\n was imprisoned; no, it was Vasudeva who surrounded me. I walked under the =\r\nbranches of the tree in front of my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it=\r\n was Vasudeva, it was Sri Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding ove=\r\nr me his shade. I looked at the bars of my cell, the very grating that did =\r\nduty for a door and again I saw Vasudeva. It was Narayana who was guarding =\r\nand standing sentry over me. Or I lay on the coarse blankets that were give=\r\nn me for a couch and felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my=\r\n Friend and Lover. This was the first use of the deeper vision He gave me. =\r\nI looked at the prisoners in the jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swin=\r\ndlers, and as I looked at them I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found=\r\n in these darkened souls and misused bodies. Amongst these thieves and daco=\r\nits there were many who put me to shame by their sympathy, their kindness, =\r\nthe humanity triumphant over such adverse circumstances. One I saw among th=\r\nem especially, who seemed to me a saint, a peasant of my nation who did not=\r\n know how to read and write, an alleged dacoit sentenced to ten years&#39; rigo=\r\nrous imprisonment, one of those whom we look down upon in our Pharisaical p=\r\nride of class as Chhotalok. Once more He spoke to me and said, &quot;Behold the =\r\npeople among whom I have sent you to do a little of my work. This is the na=\r\nture of the nation I am raising up and the reason why I raise them.&quot;\n\nWhen =\r\nthe case opened in the lower court and we were brought before the Magistrat=\r\ne I was followed by the same insight. He said to me, &quot;When you were cast in=\r\nto jail, did not your heart fail and did you not cry out to me, where is Th=\r\ny protection ? Look now at the Magistrate, look now at the Prosecuting Coun=\r\nsel.&quot; I looked and it was not the Magistrate whom I saw, it was Vasudeva, i=\r\nt was Narayana who was sitting there on the bench. I looked at the Prosecut=\r\ning Counsel and it was not the Counsel for the prosecution that I saw; it w=\r\nas Sri Krishna who sat there, it was my Lover and Friend who sat there and =\r\nsmiled. &quot;Now do you fear ?&quot; He said, &quot;I am in all men and I overrule their =\r\nactions and their words. My protection is still with you and you shall not =\r\nfear. This case which is brought against you, leave it in my hand. It is no=\r\nt for you. It was not for the trial that I brought you here but for somethi=\r\nng else. The case itself is only a means for my work and nothing more.&quot; Aft=\r\nerwards when the trial opened in the Sessions Court, I began to write many =\r\ninstructions for my Counsel as to what was false in the evidence against me=\r\n and on what points the witnesses might be cross-examined. Then something h=\r\nappened which I had not expected. The arrangements which had been made for =\r\nmy defence were suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend =\r\nme. He came unexpectedly, =97 a friend of mine, but I did not know he was c=\r\noming. You have all heard the name of the man who put away from him all oth=\r\ner thoughts and abandoned all his practice, who sat up half the night day a=\r\nfter day for months and broke his health to save me, =97 Srijut Chittaranja=\r\nn Das. When I saw him, I was satisfied, but I still thought it necessary to=\r\n write instructions. Then all that was put away from me and I had the messa=\r\nge from within, &quot;This is the man who will save you from the snares put arou=\r\nnd your feet. Put aside those papers. It is not you who will instruct him. =\r\nI will instruct him.&quot; From that time I did not of myself speak a word to my=\r\n Counsel about the case or give a single instruction, and if ever I was ask=\r\ned a question, I always found that my answer did not help the case. I had l=\r\neft it to him and he took it entirely into his hands, with what result you =\r\nknow. I knew all along what He meant for me, for I heard it again and again=\r\n, always I listened to the voice within; &quot;I am guiding, therefore fear not.=\r\n Turn to your own work for which I have brought you to jail and when you co=\r\nme out, remember never to fear, never to hesitate. Remember that it is I wh=\r\no am doing this, not you nor any other. Therefore whatever clouds may come,=\r\n whatever dangers and sufferings, whatever difficulties, whatever impossibi=\r\nlities, there is nothing impossible, nothing difficult. I am in the nation =\r\nand its uprising and I am Vasudeva, I am Narayana, and what I will, shall b=\r\ne, not what others will. What I choose to bring about, no human power can s=\r\ntay.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
