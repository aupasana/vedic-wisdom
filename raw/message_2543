If your neighbo=\r\nrs know you perform the ritual, they are bound to make some noise. The smel=\r\nl from the ghee burning is much much milder than their barbeque sessions!! =\r\n So, just ignore them. Use incense sticks liberally, which helps in spreadi=\r\nng the pleasant smell. I sprinkly sambrani powder on the embers in the kund=\r\nam. You can also use the pleasant smelling jawar, which have an awesome aro=\r\nma, and serves as a room freshener when sprinkled on the embers.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope =\r\nthis helps\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;mahalakshmi_gorla&quot; &lt;mahalakshmi_gorla@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha garu,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is it okay to close the homakundam once the fire goes off=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; to avoid the smoke spreading in the house?
