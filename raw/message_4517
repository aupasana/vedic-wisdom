Archana and abhishekam performed by a priest at a te=\r\nmple are also included.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you want to remove a small rock blocking th=\r\ne road, a small amount of energy may be sufficient. If a big boulder is blo=\r\ncking the road, one cannot push it away just like that. One has to keep exe=\r\nrting force and push it persistently. Similarly, small problems are easy to=\r\n solve. But most people now-a-days are bogged down by serious kaarmic block=\r\nages that require a lot of effort to overcome.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if a superma=\r\nn is available to you to help, he may push the boulder in a second. But the=\r\nre are hardly any supermen anymore.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the old days, many priests exis=\r\nted who did intense sadhana, became enlightened and were like walking fire.=\r\n Also, many temples existed, where such priests, great yogis and rishis did=\r\n sadhana and left great energy. Thus, big kaarmik problems could also be so=\r\nlved with one pooja, one homam, one abhishekam, one visit to a temple etc.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Such priests and temples are quite rare today. Do not expect one pooja=\r\n, one archana, one homam or one abhishekam to solve problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; However,=\r\n little bit at a time adds up over time. If you keep doing sadhana (pooja, =\r\narchana, homam, abhishekam etc) regularly, it will slowly add up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFi=\r\nlms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotis=\r\nh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Harish Mohanbabu &lt;har=\r\nishm_26@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; || Jai Gurudev ||\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or any ritual) once every 6 mon=\r\nths or so is unlikely to cause any considerable material or spiritual benef=\r\nit. \n&gt; &gt; I wanted to ask this for quite some time now. When you say any rit=\r\nual, do you also mean rituals like archana and abhishegams that are perform=\r\ned in temples? \n&gt; &gt; Kindly clarify.\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt; Harish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would still go to a priest for doing homam. Why ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of going through an online manual I get a live person with\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; experience who can help me setup the homam the ingredients needed. Note=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that most priests these days let YOU participate in the homam and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; constantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It just makes it mor=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; convenient.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or a=\r\nny ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable =\r\nmaterial or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most peo=\r\nple have, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event =\r\ncannot fix things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ri=\r\ntual) everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one&#39;s f=\r\navor over the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one&#39;s sp=\r\niritual evolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one has access and is able to engage a pries=\r\nt everyday or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One point I want to make is that priests may have fallen just=\r\n like rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of us , but they are also human living in the same world o=\r\nr rather same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yuga as we are! I feel a priest with reasonable desires=\r\n of taking care\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his daily needs and his family need not be shunned=\r\n although he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing rituals for the sake of money/tips/gifts.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Absolutely. We should have nothing against them. Giving them money or h=\r\nelping them or engaging them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *mos=\r\nt* (though not all) of them have no ability to give a boost to the material=\r\n and spiritual pursuit of others (like many priests of old days did) and he=\r\nnce people should not leave the remedying of their problem completely to th=\r\ne priest (they are very likely to be disappointed that way). If they realiz=\r\ne that they are on their own and do something about it, they are more likel=\r\ny to succeed over time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jyotisha readings that you =\r\ntalk about the end are a different ball game. They are mostly an intellectu=\r\nal exercise and can be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doin=\r\ng a ritual for someone and giving a boost to one&#39;s material and spiritual p=\r\nursuits (using one&#39;s own spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is=\r\n a spiritual exercise and one without a good level of spiritual energy cann=\r\not do it well. These days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fi=\r\nx their own blockages and how can they take care of others?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I apologize if I offended you. I&#39;m a nobody compared to you.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; No offense taken.
