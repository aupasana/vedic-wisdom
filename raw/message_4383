Everybody,\n=C2=A0\nIf i can=C2=A0share something=C2=A0on the concept=\r\n of=C2=A0 UPAVAASA.\n=C2=A0\nVrata- means Course of Conduct\n=C2=A0\nSankalapam=\r\n - means Vow\n=C2=A0\nUpavaasa means- Being nearer/sitting nearer/residing ne=\r\narer and literally=C2=A0it doesn&#39;t mean empty bowl.\n=C2=A0\nFor a theist upa=\r\nvaasa would mean residing near God,being nearer to god and for a non-theist=\r\n it would probably mean being nearer to your inner self, residing near your=\r\n inner self.\n=C2=A0\nNot to eat during a Upavaasa is a secondary act, which =\r\nis supposed to come out as a necessary result of really spending time in re=\r\nsiding near God/inner self and failing to find time to eat or failing to fe=\r\nel the need for food because of the pleasure/happiness/enjoyment one is der=\r\niving on account of his/her proximity to God/Inner self, just like the=C2=\r\n=A0two lovers involved in true love for each other=C2=A0 fail to feel the n=\r\need for food, water etc till the time=C2=A0they are together=C2=A0.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nThere would be another explanation to Upavaasa meaning fasting. Our true na=\r\nture is not contained in the physical body. Physical body is only the mediu=\r\nm or to say in the words of Bhagavat Geeta it&#39;s only a cloth/dress which so=\r\nul wears to fulfil the divine plan and keeps on changing till attainment of=\r\n the divine plan/completion of it&#39;s self realisation. We are supposed to ca=\r\nrry our physical body, till we identify ourselves with our ego with our phy=\r\nsical body and the bondage between the body and soul falls apart on realisa=\r\ntion of the true identity/nature of soul. So to attain liberation/moksha it=\r\n&#39;s essential to realise the true nature of the self, to realie that physica=\r\nl body is separate from the soul. \n=C2=A0\nSo upavaasa is a conscious design=\r\n to train oneself to realise the difference between one&#39;s physical body and=\r\n one&#39;s soul. when we do upavaasa we are to observe/see how even though the =\r\nphysical body starves still there&#39;s an entity which remains unaffected by t=\r\nhe starvation. We are to observe/see that it&#39;s the physical body which feel=\r\ns starved and the consciousness/soul is still separarte from the physical b=\r\nody which is starving. There are so many practices which are designed to ac=\r\nhieve this realisation of separation of physical body and soul. All tapasch=\r\naryas( austere measures/practices like sleeping on=C2=A0 a nail-bed) are de=\r\nsigned for this alone.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0Having understood the real purpose of U=\r\npavaasa, now while fasting/doing upavaasa if all your attention is centered=\r\n around food only and waiting for the period of upavaasa to be over so that=\r\n you can eat something, then that kind of Upavaasa has no meaning as you ar=\r\ne not residing near your Inner Self/God but you are residing near food.So i=\r\nt would aptly be then called &quot;Phala-Vaasa&quot; / &quot;Bhojana-Vaasa&quot; or &quot;any-Vaasa&quot;=\r\n but not &quot;UpaVaasa&quot;.=C2=A0But if even while eating if=C2=A0you can realise/=\r\n u can see/ U can observe=C2=A0that it&#39;s the body which is receiving the fo=\r\nod and not the soul, it&#39;s the body which is relishing the food and not the =\r\nsoul,=C2=A0 and can accept any kind of food( so long as it meets the=C2=A0r=\r\nequirement of body)=C2=A0without any complain of food tasting good/bad, you=\r\n are doing upavaasa in true sense of the meaning\n=C2=A0\nSo Upavaasa and fas=\r\nting are two different things.\n=C2=A0\nRegards\n=C2=A0\nTanmaya\n\n--- On Sun, 5=\r\n/23/10, Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Astro Seeker &lt;a=\r\nstro.seeker@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Ekadashi Vratam\nTo: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, May 23, 2010, 11:44 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\nHi =\r\nAll,\n\n\nI have been observing a fast on Ekadashi for quite some time now. My=\r\n mind has come up with following queries regarding Vratam with Ekadashi Vra=\r\ntam in particular. Can someone please answer the following: -\n\n\n- I conside=\r\nr &quot;Vratam&quot; as &quot;Sankalpam&quot; (Means a Vow) and not mainly &quot;Upwaas&quot; (Which mean=\r\ns bowls empty). And I observe Ekadashi Vratam as Falaahar Vratam i.e. Vow t=\r\no sustain myself on Fruits mainly. At the same time, I observe it as a Upwa=\r\nas in the sense that I eat only two times a day, thereby, keeping my bowls =\r\nempty for most of the time. Is this the right way of doing Ekadashi Vratam?=\r\n\n\n\n- Also, there is an ambiguity about Udaya Tithi. For Example, Ekadashi i=\r\nn India starts this noon and remains till tomorrow noon or so. But, since E=\r\nkadashi will be the Tithi per tomorrow&#39;s sunrise, Tomorrow is recommended f=\r\nor Vratam by Panchangas. I am not sure if this sampling (or synchronisation=\r\n) by sunrise (clock) of the tithi (data) comes from ancient texts or some r=\r\necent modifications have brought this concept. This becomes specifically am=\r\nbiguous when Ekadashi happens to begin just after one sunrise (hold violati=\r\non) and ends few minutes after the next sunrise. Per Udaya Tithi, Ekadashi =\r\nwill be the next day, although all the conjuct (in degrees from 120 or 240 =\r\nto 132 or 252 so) has lost its impact by that time.\nCan someone please clar=\r\nify?\n\n\n- For me, Ekadashi is the day when Sun and Moon are in trines i.e. O=\r\nur mind has close trinal conjunct with our soul. That is how this is an aus=\r\npicious day. Now, based on Udaya tithi, Ekadashi is celebrated on the day w=\r\nhen at sunrise, Sun is in Lagna and Moon is in any of the trines. Thus, on =\r\nthe sunrise, it is auspicious with Sun, Moon and Lagna all being in auspici=\r\nous positions. But, does that make that whole day auspicious enough for Vra=\r\ntam?\n\n\n- =C2=A0Any specific Homams that can be done on Ekadashi to boost yo=\r\nur spiritual progress?\n\n\n-=C2=A0Any specific Mantras?\n\n\nI have more questio=\r\nns which I will try ask as and when my understanding of these things get be=\r\ntter.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nSriram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-392330223-1274613246=:58667\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv628868227&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Hello!
