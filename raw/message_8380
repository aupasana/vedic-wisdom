Couple of my recent posts must have reflec=\r\nted my behavior. I realized my mistake then and was really looking for an o=\r\npportunity to apologize. Many thanks Utpal ji,your mail made me realize tha=\r\nt, this is the right time to do so. \n\nHence with all my humility I apologiz=\r\ne  to all those whom I have hurt-ed so far. Without an apology I won&#39;t be a=\r\nble to look at my god in his eyes. Thanks all for being so patient and unde=\r\nrstanding and never letting your hurt-ed feelings out. \n\nI have tried medit=\r\nation, long morning walks but mind still feels restless. I am going to join=\r\n yoga classes to see if that works.\n\nHaving said that now I can finally rel=\r\nax and concentrate on my evening prayers without any guilt, \n\nMany thanks a=\r\nnd regards,\n\nPriya\n\n\n"}}
