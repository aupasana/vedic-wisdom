Some of them are\nmeaningful to an extent and some =\r\nof them are simply made up over the\nlast few millennia by intellectuals.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; However, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the pleasure of a\nde=\r\nity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are some tra=\r\nditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi\nhomam everyday as a sadha=\r\nna for many generations and they do not look at\nthese technicalities.\n&gt;\n&gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt;\n&gt; If Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to heavens\n(aa=\r\nkaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on\nearth. You=\r\n cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even\nflow of signals=\r\n in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere\nat all times. Even=\r\n during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni\nis certainly capable =\r\nof acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on\nearth and making them r=\r\neach various deities.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; If you want to get your father (or moth=\r\ner) to buy you a car or to give\nyou money to start a business, you may want=\r\n to pick a good time to see\nhim and talk about it (e.g. when he is not tire=\r\nd after quarrel with\nsomeone and when he is in a good mood). Of course, eve=\r\nn when you think\nyou picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your fath=\r\ner may not be\nin a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agendas =\r\nand only\nwant to tell your father &quot;I love you&quot; and take whatever he gives, =\r\nyou\ncan do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favored by=\r\n\nparents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to\ngive.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Similarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are\nsev=\r\neral technicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them,\nyou m=\r\nay not get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are\nmany cor=\r\nruptions in our understanding of the technicalities and the art\nof getting =\r\nspecific material results through rituals is nearly extinct.\nThe best appro=\r\nach is to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation\nto express your =\r\nlove and surrender and take whatever you are given in\nreturn as a prasad. S=\r\nuch a person will be favored by deities over the\nlong run.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste Ramakishore,\n&gt;\n&gt; Different points of space and different points of ti=\r\nme have a\ndifferent quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as s=\r\nadhana\nin Girnar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not =\r\nthe\nsame as sadhana on Pournima.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one is doing a specific sadhana occ=\r\nasionally (e.g. a monthly Satya\nNarayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or=\r\n a monthly Krishna homam), it\nis not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is =\r\naligned with the energy of\nthat deity.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, one can only make so mu=\r\nch progress with occasional sadhana.\nTo make real progress and to experienc=\r\ne divinity, more intense sadhana\nis needed. If one is into serious sadhana =\r\nwith a mantra/deity, one can\ndo it every day and at all times.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; A lot of beggars may be standing at the gate of a king&#39;s palace,\nwaiting =\r\nfor the king to see them when leaving/entering the palace and\ngive them som=\r\ne money. That king may be known to step out of the house to\ngo to a specifi=\r\nc place on every so and so day and there may be a bigger\ncrowd of beggars g=\r\nathering at his gate on that day. But, by standing at\nthe gate on that day =\r\nalong with so many beggars, you may or may not be\nable to get something fro=\r\nm the king. On the other hand, if you simply\nstand at the gate everyday, ki=\r\nng&#39;s eyes may fall on you someday!\n&gt;\n&gt; Have the attitude of a beggar, surre=\r\nnder to the deity, keep doing your\nchosen sadhana everyday and patiently wa=\r\nit for the deity&#39;s grace. That\nis a sureshot formula for success.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The issue of auspicious days and times is a double edged sword. While\n=\r\na particular day may be more auspicious than other days, it may or may\nnot =\r\nmean much to one. For example, if a particular cricket pitch is\neasier to b=\r\nat on, you cannot expect to go there and score a century.\nInternational cri=\r\ncketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir and Sehwag may score\nmore runs there tha=\r\nn at other places, but you may still get out cheaply.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of helpin=\r\ng, sadhana done on a particularly good day can\nsometimes bog one down with =\r\nfalse pride and expectancy. I remember one\nincident.\n&gt;\n&gt; A few years ago, I=\r\n decided oneday in spring that I wanted to spend the\ncoming Saturday medita=\r\nting with the Gayatri mantra for the whole day. I\ngot that intention from n=\r\nowhere and did not look at anything like tithi,\nmy horoscope etc. I simply =\r\ndecided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Manish\nand he said, &quot;excellent, go a=\r\nhead&quot;. I meditated with Gayatri mantra from\n5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up o=\r\nnly a few times for 2-minute breaks and\nhaving a fistful of saattwik food f=\r\nor lunch in the middle of the day.\nWhen I finished in the night, I was in a=\r\n nice state.\n&gt;\n&gt; Next morning, I realized that the previous day was Akshaya=\r\n Tritiya\n(Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birthday of Ganga and Parasurama and the =\r\nday\nTretayuga started). It is said that spiritual sadhana done on Akshaya\nT=\r\nritiya is 1,000 times more effective than a normal day. I was excited\nthat =\r\nthe day I picked at random happened to be an auspicious day.\n&gt;\n&gt; I mentione=\r\nd it to Manish. He said, &quot;I knew it was Akshaya Tritiya even\nwhen you menti=\r\noned the intention to me&quot;. I asked him why he did not tell\nthat to me then.=\r\n He curtly remarked, &quot;knowing you were doing this\nsadhana on Akshaya Tritiy=\r\na would not have helped and would have instead\ndistracted you.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He was =\r\nright. As such, I was a little &quot;proud&quot; of the sadhana -\nspending the whole =\r\nday in japam. There was a bit of excitement and\nexpectancy that was present=\r\n as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted\nmy focus on the mantra. Had I k=\r\nnown that I was doing it on a day when\nsadhana is supposed to be 1,000 time=\r\ns more effective, that undercurrent\nof useless excitement would&#39;ve been hig=\r\nher and distracted me even more!\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds ex=\r\nist. But what really matters is\nthe state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a =\r\nsadhana on an auspicious day\ncan create excitement and expectancy and distr=\r\nact one. Doing the same\nsadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to su=\r\ncceed oneday is\nperhaps a simpler and more foolproof strategy.
