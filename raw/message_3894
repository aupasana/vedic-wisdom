Let me add some more comments.=\r\nSri Karunanidhi was also the person who asked, &quot;Which engineering college d=\r\nid Rama pass out from?&quot;. That is horrible. I wonder if anyone in India has =\r\nthe guts to publicly come out and ask a similar kind of question about reli=\r\ngious figures of the Abrahamic religions. I find it also weird that people =\r\nstart a witch-hunt against Nityananda Swami for his sex scandal, but nothin=\r\ng of that sort happened when Sri Karunanidhi could publicly question the au=\r\nthenticity of the Ramayana and Rama as a God. \n=C2=A0\nI personally had no c=\r\nlue who Nityananda Swami was till yesterday when the news broke. He maybe g=\r\nenuine, he may not be. But how are we to judge that? Just because he is cau=\r\nght having a sexual relation with someone, he suddenly becomes untouchable?=\r\n In that case what about another very famous &#39;saint&#39; /&#39;guru&#39; in India, who =\r\nis merely a product of calculated advertisements and intelligent PR machine=\r\nry, which makes sure that at least 10/15 days in a month his quotes on ever=\r\ny damn subject on the planet (and very shallow quotes if you ask me), or ne=\r\nws related to him appears in the largest selling english daily in India?=C2=\r\n=A0That is another level of cheating, in my opinion. Why don&#39;t I see people=\r\n trying to witch-hunt such &#39;sadhus&#39;? Because Hindus are a confused lot. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAs Narasimha says, maybe this was needed for real Dharma to come bac=\r\nk. In which case=C2=A0I sincrely=C2=A0pray to Ma Chamunda that she throws d=\r\nown some more of these money-making, platitude-mouthing, &#39;sadhus&#39;/&#39;gurus&#39; f=\r\nrom their lofty public pedestals. In this age we don&#39;t need &#39;bhagwans&#39; and =\r\n&#39;sadhus&#39;, we need sadhana. Let us do our own=C2=A0sadhana and inspire other=\r\ns to do sadhana and let us sincerely pray to Her to clean up this country o=\r\nnce and for all. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Between me and Yo=\r\nu, there is only me.\nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n--- On=\r\n Fri, 5/3/10, K Gopu &lt;kgopu_24@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: K Gopu &lt;kgopu_24=\r\n@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gur=\r\nus\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, 5 March, 2010, 7:22 AM\n\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndear sri ram kishore,\nI would like to add a few corrections=\r\n in regards to our Chief minister\nkarunanidhi.

Dayanidhi maran is karunanidhi&#39; s nep=\r\nhew and not\nhis brother. If u recollect when Sun TV and its family newspape=\r\nr was\nattacked during 2008by karunanidhi&#39; s sun Alagiri(now union chemical\n=\r\nminister) three of the employees of the newspaper died in that violent\natta=\r\ncks. All this happened because the newspaper reported that\npeople will pref=\r\ner Stalin(karunanidhi&#39; s IInd son) rather than Alagiri.\nThis dayanidhi mara=\r\nn went on TV saying that perpetrators of this \nviolence will be dealt with =\r\nstrongly as per law. Over a period of time\npatch work was done between the =\r\ntwo families and now the same\ndayanidhi maran has withdrawn the cases filed=\r\n against Alagiri and\nquietly forgotten the loss of three innocent employees=\r\n lives.\nSuch people cannot talk abt morality. Karunanidhi has ammassed weal=\r\nth\nthro corrupt deals and he is one of the richest family which u may not\ns=\r\nee in communist party. He hates brahmins and he is an anti hindu.\n=C2=A0\nCo=\r\nming to the sting operation the whole thing can be a farce or doctored.\nIt =\r\nis high time Sri Nityananda comes out and tells the truth behind this\nepiso=\r\nde. As a human he can always denounce Brahmacharyam and get\ninto Grihasta l=\r\nife, but if such a desire is strong in his mind then he shud\nannounce and t=\r\nell his followers that he is denouncing Brahmacharyam, but\nyet he would be =\r\ncontinuing his spiritual discourses and activity.\nI only wish this sting op=\r\neration is a false and it shud be a lesson to all\nthese media people who se=\r\nem to sway the minds of the people by\nrepeated broadcast of such perverted =\r\nmaterial.\n=C2=A0\nregards,\nk.gopu\n\n\n\n--- On Fri, 3/5/10, vemparlaramkishore =\r\n&lt;vemparlaramkishore@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparla=\r\nramkishore@ yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritua=\r\nl gurus\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Friday, March 5, 2010, 1:5=\r\n9 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nUtpal ji and Rajarshi ji\n\nVimalananda says in book1 Page 97=\r\n Chapter: Shiva\n\n&quot;This is one of the many reasons I hate communism .Communi=\r\nsts are taught to forget their parents ,culture to denounce them .If you de=\r\nstroy your parents and culture which is your root how do you ever expect to=\r\n prosper &quot;\n\n1.I agree on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both are politically affliated =\r\nentities with parties hell bent on atheism which wait for a chance to use a=\r\nny occassion to denigrate sanatana dharma. I do not wish to deviate the dis=\r\ncussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip i=\r\ns owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a =\r\ncarbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used the cover =\r\nof this occasion to once again lash out at dharma.\n\nThe same Karunanidhi al=\r\nso lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu n=\r\newspaper which is praised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles=\r\n every day with so called details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pa=\r\nttern ...That is the media war of modern India controlled by vested interes=\r\nts who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in=\r\n this drama are the missionary orgs.\n\n2.In Nithyananda&#39; s defense he never =\r\nsaid he was god . He also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His a=\r\ndvice was very simple ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long =\r\nas fantasies are not involved it does not become a addiction. \n\nHe could ve=\r\nry well be repaying a rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. \n\nTwo=\r\n of his gurus were an old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in h=\r\nis youtube video on divine consciousness and feminity.\n\n3.Like Narasimha ji=\r\n pointed out , he has a very good way of explaining higher level truths.\n\nW=\r\nhat he did or did not do is only his karma alone .This does not take away a=\r\nnything from his lectures or messages.\n\nand like Utpal ji rightly pointed o=\r\nut...When we are prepared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we=\r\n better be prepared when the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incur=\r\nr a share of the karma others committed and also will be judged quite harsh=\r\nly when our turn comes.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste R=\r\najarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha aptly worte:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read,=\r\n no matter how much one has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has=\r\n done, no matter how &gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritu=\r\nal experiences &gt;one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation=\r\n or most &gt;of the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;=\r\nstill fall. \n&gt; \n&gt; I learnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s message=\r\n. What will be our condition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n***\n&gt; You have passionately raised some questions in defense and i find not=\r\nhing wrong in it but One thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of =\r\nembarrassment such episodes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may=\r\n not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and =\r\nhaving a great many followers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time=\r\n he preaches the same and does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime kno=\r\nwledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weaknes=\r\ns, it is a gross.\n&gt; I whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. =\r\nHe was extremely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness a=\r\nnd his struggles on sexual matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a =\r\nperson of such a stature in society. He really was a Saadhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is =\r\na big difference between fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal pe=\r\nrson. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Nai=\r\nk, is a big embarrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular =\r\nSpiritual Master, in front of the whole world is even bigger pain and embar=\r\nrassment. It is a bigger blow to faiths of general public.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sp=\r\necific on Satyananda here because i do not know if it is really true.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIf the footage is right, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful ep=\r\nisodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing=\r\n such bitter pills so that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to =\r\nvery minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have =\r\nbecome so &gt;twisted and \n&gt; \n&gt; You have spoken the truth. The world today is =\r\nmany times more tempting then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a=\r\n married person (Even for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes ba=\r\nck) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, i woul=\r\nd say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Mas=\r\nters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approa=\r\nch to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimi=\r\nanry steps in final Brahmacharya. )\n&gt; \n&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s f=\r\namous line\n&gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy=\r\n &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I too believe =\r\nwe should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.

Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and m=\r\nisconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; All said a=\r\nnd done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who =\r\nlived - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianr=\r\ny sadhus and saints?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possibl=\r\ne that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the tim=\r\nes to come, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must tak=\r\ne God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the b=\r\nest possible way.

The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, r=\r\nespect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the mid=\r\nst of either adulation or adversity.

I wonder if anyone in India has the guts to public=\r\nly come out and ask a similar kind of question about religious figures of t=\r\nhe Abrahamic religions. I find it also weird that people start a witch-hunt=\r\n against Nityananda Swami for his sex scandal, but nothing of that sort hap=\r\npened when Sri Karunanidhi could publicly question the authenticity of the =\r\nRamayana and Rama as a God. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I personally had =\r\nno clue who Nityananda Swami was till yesterday when the news broke. He may=\r\nbe genuine, he may not be. But how are we to judge that? Just because he is=\r\n caught having a sexual relation with someone, he suddenly becomes untoucha=\r\nble? In that case what about another very famous &#39;saint&#39; /&#39;guru&#39; in India, =\r\nwho is merely a product of calculated advertisements and intelligent PR mac=\r\nhinery, which makes sure that at least 10/15 days in a month his quotes on =\r\nevery damn subject on the planet (and very shallow quotes if you ask me), o=\r\nr news related to him appears in the largest selling english daily in India=\r\n?&nbsp;That is another level of cheating, in my opinion. Why don&#39;t I see pe=\r\nople trying to witch-hunt such &#39;sadhus&#39;? Because Hindus are a confused lot.=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As Narasimha says, maybe this was needed for=\r\n real Dharma to come back. In which case&nbsp;I sincrely&nbsp;pray to Ma Ch=\r\namunda that she throws down some more of these money-making, platitude-mout=\r\nhing, &#39;sadhus&#39;/&#39;gurus&#39; from their lofty public pedestals. In this age we do=\r\nn&#39;t need &#39;bhagwans&#39; and &#39;sadhus&#39;, we need sadhana. Let us do our own&nbsp;s=\r\nadhana and inspire others to do sadhana and let us sincerely pray to Her to=\r\n clean up this country once and for all. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Reg=\r\nards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=3D#000000 size=3D=\r\n3&gt;&quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;MARG=\r\nIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 5/3/10, K=\r\n Gopu &lt;I&gt;&lt;kgopu_24@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=\r\n=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px so=\r\nlid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: K Gopu &lt;kgopu_24@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, 5 March, 2010, 7:22 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv433614656&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TA=\r\nBLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dt=\r\nop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;dear sri ram kishore,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I would like to add a few correct=\r\nions in regards to our Chief minister&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;karunanidhi.

I do not wish to deviate the =\r\ndiscussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the cli=\r\np is owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is=\r\n a carbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used the cov=\r\ner of this occasion to once again lash out at dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same Karun=\r\nanidhi also lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing=\r\n. Hindu newspaper which is praised by normal people as unbiased\n was writin=\r\ng articles every day with so called details of misgivings at the ashram....=\r\nSense a pattern ...That is the media war of modern India controlled by vest=\r\ned interests who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stake=\r\nholders in this drama are the missionary orgs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.In Nithyananda&#39; s d=\r\nefense he never said he was god . He also never encouraged one to turn away=\r\n from sex. His advice was very simple ...when in the physical act keep it p=\r\nhysical.As long as fantasies are not involved it does not become a addictio=\r\nn. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He could very well be repaying a rna ...or might be involved in =\r\na sexual ritual. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two of his gurus were an old woman and a female ta=\r\nntrik which he mentions in his youtube video on divine consciousness and fe=\r\nminity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a very good way of =\r\nexplaining higher level truths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What he did or did not do is only hi=\r\ns karma alone .This does not take away anything from his\n lectures or messa=\r\nges.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are prepared to=\r\n sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be prepared when the=\r\n divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share of the karma other=\r\ns committed and also will be judged quite harshly when our turn comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Vemparla Ram Kishore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc24=\r\n5.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt=\r\n;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha aptly worte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;No matter how much one ha=\r\ns read, no matter how much one has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadha=\r\nna one has done, no matter how &gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter=\r\n what spiritual experiences &gt;one had, no matter how blissful one feels d=\r\nuring meditation or most &gt;of the time, no matter how\n elevated one is sp=\r\niritually, one can &gt;still fall. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I learnt a very good t=\r\nhing today from Narasimha&#39;s message.

There may not be anything wrong=\r\n, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many fo=\r\nllowers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same =\r\nand does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about =\r\nBrahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; I whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely=\r\n truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles=\r\n on sexual matters. It is a rarest of rare\n frankness for a person of such =\r\na stature in society. He really was a Saadhu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a b=\r\nig difference between fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal perso=\r\nn. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, =\r\nis a big embarrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spi=\r\nritual Master, in front of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarras=\r\nsment. It is a bigger blow to faiths of general public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I =\r\nam not specific on Satyananda here because i do not know if it is really tr=\r\nue.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If the footage is right, then i fancy here that such s=\r\nhocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The =\r\nMother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corruption is finally contr=\r\nolled and reduced to very minimum.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in this a=\r\nge of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; You have spoken the truth. The\n world today is many times more temptin=\r\ng then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even f=\r\nor a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pl=\r\neasure/pains of sexual desires.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally, i would say that =\r\nits high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start =\r\ntaking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the s=\r\nubject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps =\r\nin final Brahmacharya. )&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s =\r\nfamous line&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://us.mc245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; I too believe we should give=\r\n the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.

Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all pre=\r\nvious births, would=C3=82&nbsp;probably=C3=82&nbsp; not be able to remain s=\r\no when born in thid age=C3=82&nbsp;is a simple fact of nature, otherwise ho=\r\nw else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She wants it\n that wa=\r\ny and so it is that way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in=\r\n this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex th=\r\nat untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one goin=\r\ng to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness a=\r\nnd misconceptions about lust and spirituality. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of th=\r\ne greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. Wh=\r\nat to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a f=\r\nake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea of running aft=\r\ner a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doin=\r\ng sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard, f=\r\nire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some\n years. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;R=\r\najarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, the=\r\nre is only me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiri=\r\ntual gurus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/co=\r\nmpose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 201=\r\n0, 8:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste KK,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefi=\r\nt of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someon=\r\ne said.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *Even i=\r\nf* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is fre=\r\ne from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect,=\r\n money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of e=\r\nither adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pri=\r\nde to take root in one&#39;s mind, one\n thing leads to another and one falls in=\r\n the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not=\r\n benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses.
