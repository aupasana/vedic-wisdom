Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1] Rahu homam manual will be created in time. Homam =\r\nwith the veda mantra \n&gt; &quot;kayaanschitra&quot; was suggested by Maharshi Parasara =\r\nfor relief from problems \n&gt; with Rahu. Some people also use Vyaasa&#39;s pouraa=\r\nnika mantra &quot;ardha kaayam&quot;. I \n&gt; will try to create Rahu and Ketu homam man=\r\nuals soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2] Apart from doing Rahu homam or japam of Rahu mantra, one=\r\n can pray to \n&gt; Chandi or Durga. The 700 verses known as &quot;Devi Maahaatmyam&quot;=\r\n (glory of the \n&gt; goddess) or &quot;Durga saptashati&quot; (Durga&#39;s 700) or &quot;Chandipa=\r\nth&quot; (chanting of \n&gt; Chandi) are ideal. Those who are not fluent in Sanskrit=\r\n and not willing to \n&gt; try at all can try Durga/Chandi saptashloki, which i=\r\ns a collection of 7 \n&gt; representative verses out of those 700.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is p=\r\nossible to do a simple homam by using the Chandi homam manual on the \n&gt; web=\r\nsite below and use just the saptashloki (7 verse) for pradhaana homam. \n&gt; J=\r\nust invoke the goddess in fire, offer 5 upachaaras, offer one aahuti to her=\r\n \n&gt; parivaara devatas and then keep offering these 7 verses over and over, =\r\nas \n&gt; many times as you can.\n&gt; \n&gt; One can also pray to Lord Venkaeswara or =\r\nBalaji for relief from Rahu \n&gt; problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n--- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rakesh.behal&quot; &lt;rakesh.behal@...&gt;\n&gt; To:=\r\n &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 14, 2009 4:31 AM=\r\n\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] query\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear guru ji,\n&gt; &gt;   charan sapar=\r\nsh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1] Pls design homa for rahu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2] pls also suggest which sa=\r\ndhna are best to control rahu and avoid its \n&gt; &gt; bad effects\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regds\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; rakesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
