Their is not a single \nfictitious character in Mahabharat.\n\nOne of my close has old scripture which completely described about the \naeroplane and its making.\nIt has many chapters in Sanskrit stanzas devoted to it. He is looking \nfor the translation. This Granth is written by Rishi Bhardwaj.\n\nWe have certainly lost huge knowledge in last 1500 yrs.\n\nBest Wishes,\nVijay Goel\nJaipur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
