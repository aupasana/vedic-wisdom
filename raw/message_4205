A Muslim resident of Kuwait requested historical\nresearch m=\r\naterial that can help explain the connection between Hindu\ncivilisation and=\r\n Arabia.]\n\nWas the Kaaba Originally a Hindu Temple?\nBy P.N. Oak (Historian)=\r\n\n\nGlancing through some research material recently, I was pleasantly surpri=\r\nsed\nto come across a reference to a *king Vikramaditya* inscription found i=\r\nn the\nKaaba in Mecca proving beyond doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed=\r\n a part\nof his Indian Empire.\n\nThe text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscrip=\r\ntion, found inscribed on a gold\ndish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca,=\r\n is found recorded on page 315 of\na volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=\r\n=E2=80=99 treasured in the Makhtab-e-Sultania\nlibrary in Istanbul, Turkey. =\r\nRendered in free English the inscription says:\n\n&quot;Fortunate are those who we=\r\nre born (and lived) during king Vikram=E2=80=99s reign.\nHe was a noble, gen=\r\nerous dutiful ruler, devoted to the welfare of his\nsubjects. But at that ti=\r\nme we Arabs, oblivious of God, were lost in sensual\npleasures. Plotting and=\r\n torture were rampant. The darkness of ignorance had\nenveloped our country.=\r\n Like the lamb struggling for her life in the cruel\npaws of a wolf we Arabs=\r\n were caught up in ignorance. The entire country was\nenveloped in a darknes=\r\ns so intense as on a new moon night. But the present\ndawn and pleasant suns=\r\nhine of education is the result of the favour of the\nnoble king Vikramadity=\r\na whose benevolent supervision did not lose sight of\nus- foreigners as we w=\r\nere. He spread his sacred religion amongst us and sent\nscholars whose brill=\r\niance shone like that of the sun from his country to\nours. These scholars a=\r\nnd preceptors through whose benevolence we were once\nagain made cognisant o=\r\nf the presence of God, introduced to His sacred\nexistence and put on the ro=\r\nad of Truth, had come to our country to preach\ntheir religion and impart ed=\r\nucation at king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s behest.&quot;\n\nFor those who would like t=\r\no read the Arabic wording I reproduce it hereunder\nin Roman script:\n\n&quot;Itras=\r\nhaphai Santu Ibikramatul Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha Wayosassaru\nBihill=\r\nahaya Samaini Ela Motakabberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min howa Yapakhara\nphaj=\r\njal asari nahone osirom bayjayhalem.

That the ancient Indian e=\r\nmpires may have extended up to the eastern\nboundaries of Arabia until Vikra=\r\nmaditya and that it was he who for the first\ntime conquered Arabia. Because=\r\n the inscription says that king Vikram who\ndispelled the darkness of ignora=\r\nnce from Arabia.\n\n2.      That, whatever their earlier faith, King Vikrama=\r\n=E2=80=99s preachers had\nsucceeded in spreading the Vedic (based on the Ved=\r\nas, the Hindu sacred\nscriptures)) way of life in Arabia.\n\n3.      That the =\r\nknowledge of Indian arts and sciences was imparted by\nIndians to the Arabs =\r\ndirectly by founding schools, academies and cultural\ncentres. The belief, t=\r\nherefore, that visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge\nto their own lands th=\r\nrough their own indefatigable efforts and scholarship\nis unfounded.\n\nAn anc=\r\nillary conclusion could be that the so-called Kutub Minar (in Delhi,\nIndia)=\r\n could well be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemorating his conquest =\r\nof\nArabia. This conclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the\nin=\r\nscription on the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the\nm=\r\narriage of the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika.\nThi=\r\ns Balhika is none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be\ntha=\r\nt Arabia was wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who\nconc=\r\nluded a treaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the victor.\nSecondly, =\r\nthe township adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli\nafter Mi=\r\nhira who was the renowned astronomer-mathematician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s=\r\n\ncourt. Mehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=\r\n=80=99 signifying a\nrow of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and ass=\r\nistants working on\nastronomical observations made from the tower.\n\nHaving s=\r\neen the far reaching and history shaking implications of the Arabic\ninscrip=\r\ntion concerning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together the story\nof its =\r\nfind. How it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What\nare t=\r\nhe other proofs reinforcing the belief that Arabs were once followers\nof th=\r\ne Indian Vedic way of life and that tranquillity and education were\nushered=\r\n into Arabia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an=\r\n\nuneasy period of &quot;ignorance and turmoil&quot; mentioned in the inscription.\n\nIn=\r\n Istanbul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania,\nwh=\r\nich is reputed to have the largest collection of ancient West Asian\nliterat=\r\nure. In the Arabic section of that library is an anthology of ancient\nArabi=\r\nc poetry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742\nund=\r\ner the orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim.\n\nThe pages of that volume =\r\nare of Hareer =E2=80=93 a kind of silk used for writing on.\nEach page has a=\r\n decorative gilded border. That anthology is known as\nSayar-ul-Okul. It is =\r\ndivided into three parts. The first part contains\nbiographic details and th=\r\ne poetic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets.\nThe second part embodie=\r\ns accounts and verses of poets of the period\nbeginning just after prophet M=\r\nohammad=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the\nBanee-Um-Mayya dynasty. The t=\r\nhird part deals with later poets up to the end\nof Khalif Harun-al-Rashid=E2=\r\n=80=99s times.\n\nAbu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate =\r\nof\nHarun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited the anthology.\n=\r\n\nThe first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 was printed an=\r\nd published in\nBerlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the one published in=\r\n Beirut in 1932.\n\nThe collection is regarded as the most important and auth=\r\noritative anthology\nof ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light =\r\non the social life,\ncustoms, manners and entertainment modes of ancient Ara=\r\nbia. The book also\ncontains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine =\r\nof Mecca, the town\nand the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held =\r\nevery year around\nthe Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers t=\r\nhat the annual haj\nof the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic co=\r\nngregation.\n\nBut the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a forum=\r\n for the elite\nand the learned to discuss the social, religious, political,=\r\n literary and\nother aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =E2=\r\n=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99\nasserts that the conclusion reached at those d=\r\niscussions were widely\nrespected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, follo=\r\nwed the Varanasi\ntradition (of India) of providing a venue for important di=\r\nscussions among\nthe learned while the masses congregated there for spiritua=\r\nl bliss. The\nprincipal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Ar=\r\nvasthan\n(Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva)=\r\n emblems\ncan be seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgrims =\r\nreverently\ntouch and kiss in the Kaaba.\n\nArabic tradition has lost trace of=\r\n the founding of the Kaaba temple. The\ndiscovery of the Vikramaditya inscri=\r\nption affords a clue. King Vikramaditya\nis known for his great devotion to =\r\nLord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India),\nthe capital of Vikramaditya, exists=\r\n the famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of\nLord Shankara (Siva) associated wi=\r\nth Vikramaditya. Since according to the\nVikramaditya inscription he spread =\r\nthe Vedic religion, who else but he could\nhave founded the Kaaba temple in =\r\nMecca?\n\nA few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars the entry=\r\n of any\nnon-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days when the K=\r\naaba was\nstormed and captured solely for the newly established faith of Isl=\r\nam. The\nobject in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prevent its=\r\n\nrecapture.\n\nAs the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to shave his=\r\n head and\nbeard and to don special sacred attire that consists of two seaml=\r\ness sheets\nof white cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and the other =\r\nover the\nshoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic practice=\r\n of\nentering Hindu temples clean- and with holy seamless white sheets.\n\nThe=\r\n main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as the\nKaaba.=\r\n It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates from the\ndays=\r\n when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by\ncamouflaging =\r\nit.\n\nAccording to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has 360 images.\nT=\r\nraditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the 360 destroyed=\r\n\nwhen the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was of the Moon an=\r\nd\nyet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaaba the Arabs\n=\r\nworshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the practice of\n=\r\n=E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is s=\r\ntill in vogue.\nTwo of these nine are Saturn and Moon.\n\nIn India the crescen=\r\nt moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva\nsymbol. Since that=\r\n symbol was associated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it\ncame to be grafted =\r\non the flag of Islam.\n\nAnother Hindu tradition associated with the Kaaba is=\r\n that of the sacred\nstream Ganga (sacred waters of the Ganges river). Accor=\r\nding to the Hindu\ntradition Ganga is also inseparable from the Shiva emblem=\r\n as the crescent\nmoon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Ganga must co-exist=\r\n. True to that\nassociation a sacred fount exists near the Kaaba. Its water =\r\nis held sacred\nbecause it has been traditionally regarded as Ganga since pr=\r\ne-Islamic times\n(Zam-Zam water).\n\n[Note: Even today, Muslim pilgrims who go=\r\n to the Kaaba for Haj regard this\nZam-Zam water with reverence and take som=\r\ne bottled water with them as sacred\nwater.]\n\nMuslim pilgrims visiting the K=\r\naaba temple go around it seven times. In no\nother mosque does the circumamb=\r\nulation prevail. Hindus invariably\ncircumambulate around their deities. Thi=\r\ns is yet another proof that the\nKaaba shrine is a pre-Islamic Indian Shiva =\r\ntemple where the Hindu practice\nof circumambulation is still meticulously o=\r\nbserved.\n\nThe practice of taking seven steps- known as Saptapadi in Sanskri=\r\nt- is\nassociated with Hindu marriage ceremony and fire worship. The culmina=\r\nting\nrite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon the bride and groom to go round =\r\nthe\nsacred fire four times (but misunderstood by many as seven times). Sinc=\r\ne\n&quot;Makha&quot; means fire, the seven circumambulations also prove that Mecca was=\r\n\nthe seat of Indian fire-worship in the West Asia.\n\nIt might come as a stun=\r\nning revelation to many that the word =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 itself\nis San=\r\nskrit. In Sanskrit language Allah, Akka and Amba are synonyms. They\nsignify=\r\n a goddess or mother. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=99 forms part of Sanskr=\r\nit chants\ninvoking goddess Durga, also known as Bhavani, Chandi and Mahisha=\r\nsurmardini.\nThe Islamic word for God is., therefore, not an innovation but =\r\nthe ancient\nSanskrit appellation retained and continued by Islam. Allah mea=\r\nns mother or\ngoddess and mother goddess.\n\nOne Koranic verse is an exact tra=\r\nnslation of a stanza in the Yajurveda. This\nwas pointed out by the great re=\r\nsearch scholar Pandit Satavlekar of Pardi in\none of his articles.\n\n[Note: A=\r\nnother scholar points out that the following teaching from the Koran\nis exa=\r\nctly similar to the teaching of the Kena Upanishad (1.7).\n\nThe Koran:\n\n&quot;Sig=\r\nht perceives Him not. But He perceives men&#39;s sights; for He is the\nknower o=\r\nf secrets, the Aware.&quot;\n\nKena Upanishad:\n\n&quot;That which cannot be seen by the =\r\neye but through which the eye itself sees,\nknow That to be Brahman (God) an=\r\nd not what people worship here (in the\nmanifested world).&quot;\n\nA simplified me=\r\naning of both the above verses reads:\n\nGod is one and that He is beyond man=\r\n&#39;s sensory experience.\n\nThe identity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows t=\r\nhat Unani is just the\nArabic term for the Ayurvedic system of healing taugh=\r\nt to them and\nadministered in Arabia when Arabia formed part of the Indian =\r\nempire.\n\nIt will now be easy to comprehend the various Hindu customs still =\r\nprevailing\nin West Asian countries even after the existence of Islam during=\r\n the last\n1300 years. Let us review some Hindu traditions which exist as th=\r\ne core of\nIslamic practice.\n\nThe Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People =\r\nin Asia Minor too worshipped\n33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar =\r\ncalendar was introduced in\nWest Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim mon=\r\nth =E2=80=98Safar=E2=80=99 signifying the\n=E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Ad=\r\nhik Maas) in the Hindu calendar. The Muslim month Rabi is\nthe corrupt form =\r\nof Ravi meaning the sun because Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into\nP=\r\nrakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (Prakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit l=\r\nanguage). The\nMuslim sanctity for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu E=\r\nkadashi (Gyrah\n=3D elevan or Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning.\n\nThe =\r\nIslamic practice of Bakari Eed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh\nYagn=\r\nas or sacrifices of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The\nIslamic=\r\n word Eed for festive days, signifying days of worship, is therefore\na pure=\r\n Sanskrit word. The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb.\nSince i=\r\nn ancient times the year used to begin with the entry of the sun in\nAries, =\r\nthe occasion was celebrated with mutton feasting. That is the origin\nof the=\r\n Bakari Eed festival.\n\n[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word fo=\r\nr a goat.]\n\nSince Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99=\r\n, the Islamic word Idgah\nsignifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 whi=\r\nch is the exact Sanskrit connotation of\nthe term. Similarly the word =E2=80=\r\n=98Namaz=E2=80=99 derives from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99\nan=\r\nd =E2=80=98Yajna=E2=80=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping.\n\nVed=\r\nic descriptions about the moon, the different stellar constellations and\nth=\r\ne creation of the universe have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran\np=\r\nart 1 chapter 2, stanza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37\na=\r\nnd chapter 10, stanzas 4 to 7.\n\nRecital of the Namaz five times a day owes =\r\nits origin to the Vedic\ninjunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- P=\r\nanch-Maha-Yagna) which is\npart of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all=\r\n individuals.\n\nMuslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body b=\r\nefore commencing\nprayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Sh=\r\nareer Shydhyartham\nPanchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99.\n\nFour months of the year are =\r\nregarded as very sacred in Islamic custom. The\ndevout are enjoined to absta=\r\nin from plunder and other evil deeds during that\nperiod. This originates in=\r\n the Chaturmasa i.e., the four-month period of\nspecial vows and austerities=\r\n in Hindu tradition. Shabibarat is the corrupt\nform of Shiva Vrat and Shiva=\r\n Ratra. Since the Kaaba has been an important\ncentre of Shiva (Siva) worshi=\r\np from times immemorial, the Shivaratri\nfestival used to be celebrated ther=\r\ne with great gusto. It is that festival\nwhich is signified by the Islamic w=\r\nord Shabibarat.\n\nEncyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the =\r\nside of the Kaaba\nwalls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, =\r\naccording to the\ncorrespondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. B=\r\nut according to\nhearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit=\r\n, and some of\nthem are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nAccording to extant=\r\n Islamic records, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia,\nparticularly in Y=\r\nemen, and their life and manners deeply influenced those\nwho came in touch =\r\nwith them. At Ubla there was a large number of Indian\nsettlements. This sho=\r\nws that Indians were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient\nstrength and command=\r\ning position to be able to influence the local people.\nThis could not be po=\r\nssible unless they belonged to the ruling class.\n\nIt is mentioned in the Ab=\r\nadis i.e., the authentic traditions of Prophet\nMohammad compiled by Imam Bu=\r\nkhari that the Indian tribe of Jats had settled\nin Arabia before Prophet Mo=\r\nhammad=E2=80=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of\nthe Prophet, was t=\r\naken ill, her nephew sent for a Jat physician for her\ntreatment. This prove=\r\ns that Indians enjoyed a high and esteemed status in\nArabia. Such a status =\r\ncould not be theirs unless they were the rulers.\nBukhari also tells us that=\r\n an Indian Raja (king) sent a jar of ginger\npickles to the Prophet. This sh=\r\nows that the Indian Jat Raja ruled an\nadjacent area so as to be in a positi=\r\non to send such an insignificant\npresent as ginger pickles. The Prophet is =\r\nsaid to have so highly relished it\nas to have told his colleagues also to p=\r\nartake of it. These references show\nthat even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=\r\n=99s times Indians retained their influential\nrole in Arabia, which was a d=\r\nwindling legacy from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times.\n\nThe Islamic term =E2=80=\r\n=98Eed-ul-Fitr=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 th=\r\nat is\nworship of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commem=\r\norate\ntheir ancestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved=\r\n for\ntheir remembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-u=\r\nl-Fitr=E2=80=99\n(worship of forefathers).\n\nThe Islamic practice of observin=\r\ng the moon rise before deciding on\ncelebrating the occasion derives from th=\r\ne Hindu custom of breaking fast on\nSankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only af=\r\nter sighting the moon.\n\nBarah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating =\r\nthose dead in battle or\nby weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit traditi=\r\non because in Sanskrit\n=E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=\r\n=99. Hindus observe Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those\nwho have died in =\r\nbattle.\n\nThe word Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. The=\r\n original\nword is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=\r\n=80=99 is Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original\nSanskrit name of the la=\r\nnd is =E2=80=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit means=\r\n a horse.\nArvasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, Arab=\r\nia is\nfamous for its horses.\n\nThis discovery changes the entire complexion =\r\nof the history of ancient\nIndia. Firstly we may have to revise our concepts=\r\n about the king who had the\nlargest empire in history. It could be that the=\r\n expanse of king\nVikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that of all=\r\n others. Secondly, the\nidea that the Indian empire spread only to the east =\r\nand not in the west\nbeyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned. Thir=\r\ndly the effeminate\nand pathetic belief that India, unlike any other country=\r\n in the world could\nby some age spread her benign and beatific cultural inf=\r\nluence, language,\ncustoms, manners and education over distant lands without=\r\n militarily\nconquering them is baseless. India did conquer all those countr=\r\nies\nphysically wherever traces of its culture and language are still extant=\r\n and\nthe region extended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the Balti=\r\nc in\nNorthern Europe and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was that =\r\nwhile\nIndian rulers identified themselves with the local population and\nest=\r\nablished welfare states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lands\nperpe=\r\ntuated untold atrocities over the vanquished.\n\n=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=\r\n=99 tells us that a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held\nin Mecca at=\r\n the annual Okaj fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets\nused to parti=\r\ncipate in it.\n\nPoems considered best were awarded prizes. The best-engraved=\r\n on gold plate\nwere hung inside the temple. Others etched on camel or goats=\r\nkin were hung\noutside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba was the treasu=\r\nre house of the\nbest Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Indian Vedic tr=\r\nadition.\n\nThat tradition being of immemorial antiquity many poetic composit=\r\nions were\nengraved and hung inside and outside on the walls of the Kaaba. B=\r\nut most of\nthe poems got lost and destroyed during the storming of the Kaab=\r\na by Prophet\nMohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s court poet, H=\r\nassan-bin-Sawik, who was among\nthe invaders, captured some of the treasured=\r\n poems and dumped the gold plate\non which they were inscribed in his own ho=\r\nme. Sawik=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to\nearn a reward carried those gold pl=\r\nates to Khalif=E2=80=99s court where he met the\nwell-known Arab scholar Abu=\r\n Amir Asamai. The latter received from the bearer\nfive gold plates and 16 l=\r\neather sheets with the prize-winning poems engraved\non them. The bearer was=\r\n sent away happy bestowed with a good reward.\n\nOn the five gold plates were=\r\n inscribed verses by ancient Arab poets like\nLabi Baynay, Akhatab-bin-Turfa=\r\n and Jarrham Bintoi. That discovery made\nHarun-al-Rashid order Abu Amir to =\r\ncompile a collection of all earlier\ncompositions. One of the compositions i=\r\nn the collection is a tribute in\nverse paid by Jarrham Bintoi, a renowned A=\r\nrab poet, to king Vikramaditya.\nBintoi who lived 165 years before Prophet M=\r\nohammad had received the highest\naward for the best poetic compositions for=\r\n three years in succession in the\npan-Arabic symposiums held in Mecca every=\r\n year. All those three poems of\nBintoi adjudged best were hung inside the K=\r\naaba temple, inscribed on gold\nplates. One of these constituted an unreserv=\r\ned tribute to King Vikramaditya\nfor his paternal and filial rule over Arabi=\r\na. That has already been quoted\nabove.\n\nPre-Islamic Arabian poet Bintoi=E2=\r\n=80=99s tribute to king Vikramaditya is a decisive\nevidence that it was kin=\r\ng Vikramaditya who first conquered the Arabian\nPeninsula and made it a part=\r\n of the Indian Empire. This explains why\nstarting from India towards the we=\r\nst we have all Sanskrit names like\nAfghanisthan (now Afghanistan), Baluchis=\r\nthan, Kurdisthan, Tajikiathan,\nUzbekisthan,  Iran, Sivisthan, Iraq, Arvasth=\r\nan, Turkesthan (Turkmenisthan)\netc.\n\nHistorians have blundered in not givin=\r\ng due weight to the evidence provided\nby Sanskrit names pervading over the =\r\nentire west Asian region. Let us take a\ncontemporary instance. Why did a pa=\r\nrt of India get named Nagaland even after\nthe end of British rule over Indi=\r\na? After all historical traces are wiped\nout of human memory, will a future=\r\n age historian be wrong if he concludes\nfrom the name Nagaland that the Bri=\r\ntish or some English speaking power must\nhave ruled over India? Why is Port=\r\nuguese spoken in Goa (part of India), and\nFrench in Pondichery (part of Ind=\r\nia), and both French and English in Canada?\nIs it not because those people =\r\nruled over the territories where their\nlanguages are spoken? Can we not the=\r\nn justly conclude that wherever traces\nof Sanskrit names and traditions exi=\r\nst Indians once held sway? It is\nunfortunate that this important piece of d=\r\necisive evidence has been ignored\nall these centuries.\n\nAnother question wh=\r\nich should have presented itself to historians for\nconsideration is how cou=\r\nld it be that Indian empires could extend in the\neast as far as Korea and J=\r\napan, while not being able to make headway beyond\nAfghanisthan? In fact lan=\r\nd campaigns are much easier to conduct than by sea.\nIt was the Indians who =\r\nruled the entire West Asian region from Karachi to\nHedjaz and who gave Sans=\r\nkrit names to those lands and the towns therein,\nintroduce their pantheon o=\r\nf the fire-worship, imparted education and\nestablished law and order.\n\nIt m=\r\nay be that Arabia itself was not part of the Indian empire until king\nVikra=\r\nma , since Bintoi says that it was king Vikrama who for the first time\nbrou=\r\nght about a radical change in the social, cultural and political life of\nAr=\r\nabia. It may be that the whole of West Asia except Arabia was under Indian\n=\r\nrule before Vikrama. The latter added Arabia too to the Indian Empire. Or a=\r\ns\na remote possibility it could be that king Vikramaditya himself conducted=\r\n a\nseries of brilliant campaigns annexing to his empire the vast region bet=\r\nween\nAfghanisthan and Hedjaz.\n\nIncidentally this also explains why king Vik=\r\nramaditya is so famous in\nhistory. Apart from the nobility and truthfulness=\r\n of heart and his impartial\nfilial affection for all his subjects, whether =\r\nIndian or Arab, as testified\nby Bintoi, king Vikramaditya has been permanen=\r\ntly enshrined in the pages of\nhistory because he was the world=E2=80=99s gr=\r\neatest ruler having the largest empire.\nIt should be remembered that only a=\r\n monarch with a vast empire gets famous\nin world history. Vikram Samvat (ca=\r\nlendar still widely in use in India\ntoday) which he initiated over 2000 yea=\r\nrs ago may well mark his victory over\nArabia, and the so called Kutub Minar=\r\n (Kutub Tower in Delhi), a pillar\ncommemorating that victory and the conseq=\r\nuential marriage with the Vaihika\n(Balkh) princess as testified by the near=\r\nby iron pillar inscription.\n\nA great many puzzles of ancient world history =\r\nget automatically solved by a\nproper understanding of these great conquests=\r\n of king Vikramaditya. As\nrecorded by the Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars=\r\n, preachers and social\nworkers spread the fire-worship ceremony, preached t=\r\nhe Vedic way of life,\nmanned schools, set up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, t=\r\nrained the local people\nin irrigation and agriculture and established in th=\r\nose regions a democratic,\norderly, peaceful, enlightened and religious way =\r\nof life. That was of\ncourse, a Vedic Hindu way of life.\n\nIt is from such an=\r\ncient times that Indian Kshtriya royal families, like the\nPahalvis and Barm=\r\naks, have held sway over Iran and Iraq. It is those\nconquests, which made t=\r\nhe Parsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshippers. It is\ntherefore that we find =\r\nthe Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sanskritised\ndialect, fire temples exist=\r\ning thousands of miles away from India, and\nscores of sites of ancient Indi=\r\nan cultural centres like Navbahar in West\nAsia and the numerous viharas in =\r\nSoviet Russia spread throughout the world.\nEver since so many viharas are o=\r\nften dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient Indian\nsculptures are also found in e=\r\nxcavations in Central Asia. The same goes for\nWest Asia.\n\n[Note: Ancient In=\r\ndian sculptures include metal statues of the Hindu deity\nGanesh (the elepha=\r\nnt headed god); the most recent find being in Kuwait].\n\nUnfortunately these=\r\n chapters of world history have been almost obliterated\nfrom public memory.=\r\n They need to be carefully deciphered and rewritten. When\nthese chapters ar=\r\ne rewritten they might change the entire concept and\norientation of ancient=\r\n history.\n\nIn view of the overwhelming evidence led above, historians, scho=\r\nlars,\nstudents of history and lay men alike should take note that they had =\r\nbetter\nrevise their text books of ancient world history. The existence of H=\r\nindu\ncustoms, shrines, Sanskrit names of whole regions, countries and towns=\r\n and\nthe Vikramaditya inscriptions reproduced at the beginning are a thumpi=\r\nng\nproof that Indian Kshatriyas once ruled over the vast region from Bali t=\r\no\nBaltic and Korea to Kaaba in Mecca, Arabia at the very least.\n\r\n--0016363ba32cad1d2d0484bdb67f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dutf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;m=\r\neta name=3D&quot;ProgId&quot; content=3D&quot;Word.Document&quot;&gt;&lt;meta name=3D&quot;Generator&quot; cont=\r\nent=3D&quot;Microsoft Word 12&quot;&gt;&lt;meta name=3D&quot;Originator&quot; content=3D&quot;Microsoft Wo=\r\nrd 12&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=3D&quot;File-List&quot; href=3D&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5Ctrivedi%5CAppDa=\r\nta%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=3D&quot;the=\r\nmeData&quot; href=3D&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5Ctrivedi%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmso=\r\nhtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx&quot;&gt;&lt;link rel=3D&quot;colorSchemeMapping&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;file:///C:%5CUsers%5Ctrivedi%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C=\r\n01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml&quot;&gt;&lt;style&gt;\n&lt;!--\n /* Font Definitions */\n @fo=\r\nnt-face\n\t{font-family:Mangal;\n\tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 2 3 3 2 2;\n\tmso-font-char=\r\nset:0;\n\tmso-generic-font-family:roman;\n\tmso-font-pitch:variable;\n\tmso-font-=\r\nsignature:32771 0 0 0 1 0;}\n@font-face\n\t{font-family:&quot;Cambria Math&quot;;\n\tpanos=\r\ne-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;\n\tmso-font-charset:0;\n\tmso-generic-font-family:roma=\r\nn;\n\tmso-font-pitch:variable;\n\tmso-font-signature:-1610611985 1107304683 0 0=\r\n 415 0;}\n@font-face\n\t{font-family:Calibri;\n\tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;\n=\r\n\tmso-font-charset:0;\n\tmso-generic-font-family:swiss;\n\tmso-font-pitch:variab=\r\nle;\n\tmso-font-signature:-520092929 1073786111 9 0 415 0;}\n@font-face\n\t{font=\r\n-family:default;\n\tpanose-1:0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0;\n\tmso-font-alt:&quot;Times New Ro=\r\nman&quot;;\n\tmso-font-charset:0;\n\tmso-generic-font-family:roman;\n\tmso-font-format=\r\n:other;\n\tmso-font-pitch:auto;\n\tmso-font-signature:0 0 0 0 0 0;}\n /* Style D=\r\nefinitions */\n p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal\n\t{mso-style-unhide:=\r\nno;\n\tmso-style-qformat:yes;\n\tmso-style-parent:&quot;&quot;;\n\tmargin:0cm;\n\tmargin-bott=\r\nom:.0001pt;\n\tmso-pagination:widow-orphan;\n\tfont-size:11.0pt;\n\tfont-family:&quot;=\r\nCalibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;\n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-ascii-theme-fon=\r\nt:minor-latin;\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-fareast-theme-font:mi=\r\nnor-latin;\n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-lati=\r\nn;\n\tmso-bidi-font-family:Mangal;\n\tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;\n\tmso-bidi=\r\n-language:AR-SA;}\n.MsoChpDefault\n\t{mso-style-type:export-only;\n\tmso-default=\r\n-props:yes;\n\tmso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;\n\tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;\n\tms=\r\no-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-fare=\r\nast-theme-font:minor-latin;\n\tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;\n\tmso-hansi-them=\r\ne-font:minor-latin;\n\tmso-bidi-font-family:Mangal;\n\tmso-bidi-theme-font:mino=\r\nr-bidi;\n\tmso-bidi-language:AR-SA;}\n@page Section1\n\t{size:612.0pt 792.0pt;\n\t=\r\nmargin:72.0pt 72.0pt 72.0pt 72.0pt;\n\tmso-header-margin:36.0pt;\n\tmso-footer-=\r\nmargin:36.0pt;\n\tmso-paper-source:0;}\ndiv.Section1\n\t{page:Section1;}\n /* Lis=\r\nt Definitions */\n @list l0\n\t{mso-list-id:1470709792;\n\tmso-list-template-ids=\r\n:2100850954;}\nol\n\t{margin-bottom:0cm;}\nul\n\t{margin-bottom:0cm;}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/style=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;table class=3D&quot;MsoTableGrid&quot; style=3D&quot;background: none repeat scroll 0%=\r\n 0% rgb(253, 233, 217); border-collapse: collapse; border: medium none;&quot; bo=\r\nrder=3D&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;=\r\ntd style=3D&quot;width: 478.8pt; border: 1pt solid black; padding: 0cm 5.4pt;&quot; v=\r\nalign=3D&quot;top&quot; width=3D&quot;798&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\nize: 10pt; color: rgb(79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;I do not wish to create any\n  controver=\r\nsy.

This conclusion is strengthened b=\r\ny two\n  pointers. Firstly, the inscription on the iron pillar near the so-c=\r\nalled\n  Kutub Minar refers to the marriage of the victorious king Vikramadi=\r\ntya to the\n  princess of Balhika. This Balhika is none other than the Balkh=\r\n region in West\n  Asia. It could be that Arabia was wrestled by king Vikram=\r\naditya from the\n  ruler of Balkh who concluded a treaty by giving his daugh=\r\nter in marriage to\n  the victor. Secondly, the township adjoining the so ca=\r\nlled Kutub Minar is\n  named Mehrauli after Mihira who was the renowned astr=\r\nonomer-mathematician of\n  king Vikram=E2=80=99s court. Mehrauli is the corr=\r\nupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99\n  signifying a row of h=\r\nouses raised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants\n  working on astrono=\r\nmical observations made from the tower.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;=\r\n,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;Having seen the far reach=\r\ning and history shaking\n  implications of the Arabic inscription concerning=\r\n king Vikrama, we shall now\n  piece together the story of its find. How it =\r\ncame to be recorded and hung in\n  the Kaaba in Mecca. What are the other pr=\r\noofs reinforcing the belief that\n  Arabs were once followers of the Indian =\r\nVedic way of life and that\n  tranquillity and education were ushered into A=\r\nrabia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s\n  scholars, educationists from an unea=\r\nsy period of &quot;ignorance and turmoil&quot;\n  mentioned in the inscripti=\r\non.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size=\r\n: 9.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(=\r\n79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;In Istanbul, Turkey, there is a famous library called\n  Makha=\r\ntab-e-Sultania, which is reputed to have the largest collection of\n  ancien=\r\nt West Asian literature.

The book also contains an elaborate description of the anci=\r\nent shrine\n  of Mecca, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which use=\r\nd to be held\n  every year around the Kaaba temple in Mecca.

Mecca, therefore, followed the\n  Varanasi tradition (of India)=\r\n of providing a venue for important discussions\n  among the learned while t=\r\nhe masses congregated there for spiritual bliss. The\n  principal shrines at=\r\n both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in Arvasthan\n  (Arabia) were Siva temp=\r\nles. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Siva) emblems\n  can be seen. It is t=\r\nhe Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgrims reverently\n  touch and kiss i=\r\nn the Kaaba.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-size: 9.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; co=\r\nlor: rgb(79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;Arabic tradition has lost trace of the founding of t=\r\nhe\n  Kaaba temple.

In India the\n  practice of =E2=80=98Nav=\r\nagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine planets, is still in\n  vo=\r\ngue.

The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=\r\n=99 forms part\n  of Sanskrit chants invoking goddess Durga, also known as B=\r\nhavani, Chandi and\n  Mahishasurmardini. The Islamic word for God is., there=\r\nfore, not an innovation\n  but the ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and=\r\n continued by Islam.

T=\r\nhe Muslim\n  month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi meaning the sun because =\r\nSanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99\n  changes into Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (Pr=\r\nakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit\n  language). The Muslim sanctit=\r\ny for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu\n  Ekadashi (Gyrah =3D elevan =\r\nor Gyaarah). Both are identical in meaning.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNor=\r\nmal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&q=\r\nuot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; color: rgb(79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;The Islamic practice =\r\nof Bakari Eed derives from the\n  Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sacrifice=\r\ns of Vedic times. Eed in Sanskrit\n  means worship. The Islamic word Eed for=\r\n festive days, signifying days of\n  worship, is therefore a pure Sanskrit w=\r\nord. The word MESH in the Hindu zodiac\n  signifies a lamb. Since in ancient=\r\n times the year used to begin with the\n  entry of the sun in Aries, the occ=\r\nasion was celebrated with mutton feasting.\n  That is the origin of the Baka=\r\nri Eed festival.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;=\r\n; color: rgb(79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;[Note: The word Bakari is an Indian language wor=\r\nd for a\n  goat.] &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot=\r\n;; color: rgb(79, 98, 40);&quot;&gt;Since Eed means worship and Griha means =E2=80=\r\n=98house=E2=80=99, the\n  Islamic word Idgah signifies a =E2=80=98House of w=\r\norship=E2=80=99 which is the exact Sanskrit\n  connotation of the term.

Once when\n  Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was t=\r\naken ill, her nephew sent for a Jat\n  physician for her treatment.

The=\r\n Prophet is said to have so highly relished it as to\n  have told his collea=\r\ngues also to partake of it.
