The  boy is initiated into Gayatri Mantra.  By this Mantra the boy becomes eligible to begin a life of Brahmachari,whoshould  reside  in a Gurukulam  away from his parents for a period of 12 years and study Vedas.  The term  Brahmachari  does not mean only &quot;unmarried&quot; or &quot;celebate&quot; . Brahmacharya  is the conduct by which one attains or reaches Brahman (Self-Realization).  In the vedic period ,not only boys but girls also are also said to have been  initiated to Brahmacharya  through Upanayana Samskaram.   According to Haarita Samhita,  girls are stated to have studied the Vedas  and were known as Brahmavadins, woman well-versed in Vedas.  Later, this practise  was discontinued.   It is understood that this is still practised by some Brahmin communities in Kerala. \n But this practice is being vehemently disputed/opposed  by most Brahmins stating that ladies have no  Upanayanam and that  they have no eligiblity (adhikara) to learn Vedas.  They  hold that marriage  (Vivaham)  is the ritual that takes the place of  Upanayanam  in the case of ladies.\n\n\nComing back to the Upanayana Samskaram  we find references to this and the Mantras  connected with the ceremony  in Rigveda,Yajurveda,Atharvaveda,Taitreeya Aranyaka,Gopatha Brahmana, Satapata Brahmana, Chandogya Upanishad,and Brihadaranyaka Upanishad.  As pointed out earlier, the derivation of the wordUpanayanam  in Samskrit language means that act by which one is led near to the teacher and Veda---Vedam gurm upa sameepam neeyate yena karmana tat.  The Upanayan Samskaram includes yagnopaveetha dharanam i.e., wearing of the sacred thread by uttering relevant Mantras. I has a also a pankti Bhojanam or Kumara Bhojanam, shaving the head (vapanam) as a symbol of giving up egos, bachelorhood dress attiring (vatu vastra dhaaranam), initiation into Gayatri Mantra (Brahmopadesam     or Gayatri Mantropdesam), the teacher taking assurances from the student to perform duties  of Brahmacharya regularly with devotion(Gurorupadesam and sishya vignaapanam), holy fire\n sacrifice (samidadanam, homam) etc.  The ceremony ends with what is known as Bhikshaatanam--begging for alms from mother and other ladies and seeking blessings of elders(Aaseervaadam).  The significance of Bhikshaatanam  is  that the student during his brahmacharya life has to raise satvik  food through alms, as sanyasins do, for him and his guru ,just enough for the day.  The boy is now called a  DWIJA,twice born.\n(tobe continued)\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-621513129-1251538662=:53564\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;In the previous posting&nbsp;
