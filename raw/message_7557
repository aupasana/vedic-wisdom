In our present age, however, find=\r\ning such a rare person has become a tremendous challenge. Indeed, it has be=\r\nen estimated that 95% of individuals who claim to be legitimate gurus, Swam=\r\nis, Acharyas, and enlightened spiritual mentors are not! The precise unders=\r\ntanding, then, of what constitutes a real and authentic guru is crucial for=\r\n all sincere spiritual seekers if they wish to avoid falling into the trap =\r\nof fake teachers. In this very direct, authoritative and no nonsense talk, =\r\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya provides the conclusive criteria necessary to=\r\n recognize who is - and is not! - an authentic and legitimate guru. Even if=\r\n you have been on the path of Sanatana Dharma for decades and feel that you=\r\n already know what a real guru is, prepare to have your understanding radic=\r\nally expanded!
