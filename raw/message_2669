Yes, sadhana is=\r\n the only way to know this for sure. And so also for everything else that i=\r\ns below the reach of the senses (e.g. Atma, sookshma sarira etc). But we do=\r\n read about them (all these things e.g Atma etc), and about the significanc=\r\ne of the vedic gods anyway, dont we? They do offer a mild complement to sad=\r\nhana, dont they? They do help make the mind more receptive toward the benef=\r\nits of sadhana..\n\nAlso wanted to assure you that I really want to know the =\r\nanswer to the question. I am not interested in a he-said/she-said type game=\r\n (if perhaps that is what you were hinting at?). I am extremely curious as =\r\nto why there is an order and not a parallelism, for e.g. why are the mahabh=\r\nutas not simultaneously formed. There is some lesson in there (at least for=\r\n me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation betwee=\r\nn that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get=\r\n ahead of myself..\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt;  \n&gt; With =\r\nall due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how does it matter? Can any=\r\none here really know for sure which came after which? We can only speculate=\r\n and guess and retrofit logic and quote one scripture vs another scripture.=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; Only practical way to really find out the truth is sadhana.

I have heard differing opinions though, perhaps in Sanjay R=\r\nathji&#39;s Brhat Nakshtra but since I dont have the book in front of me, I can=\r\nt confirm. Do you agree with the interpretation above, if not what is your =\r\nbelief, source and justification?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add whatever you love to the=\r\n Yahoo!
