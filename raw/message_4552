The\nmaterialistic relationship solves worldly problems, whi=\r\nle spiritual\nrelationship leads towards self-realization. This is one way o=\r\nf leading\nlife.\n\nTo my understanding, Narasimha spreads the message to live=\r\n with only one\nrelationship which is spirituality or love/surrender to God.=\r\n Yes, Narasimha\ncertainly believes homam as the vehicle for this relationsh=\r\nip and teaches\nthe same since he has first hand great experiences through h=\r\nomam.\n\nIn spirituality, there is no problem of counting gives and takes fro=\r\nm\nYajamana. A saadhaka accepts whatever he gets due to his karmic baggage a=\r\nnd\nleads his life. If he still has desires, he uses the same relationship n=\r\not\nwith a staunch give or take attitude, but with a surrender attitude.\nSur=\r\nrender is a tough path. Belief is that homam creates exactly such an\nattitu=\r\nde over time and all the material needs are taken care without paying\nmuch =\r\nattention to them. Once in spirituality path, one may learn shastras\nbased =\r\non his conditioning, but I don=E2=80=99t see it being discouraged here. In\n=\r\nfact, learning homam ritual is increasing awareness of shastras.\n\nComing to=\r\n priest as a mediator or technician, I believe, his message is to\nfind a ca=\r\npable technician or priest for the job. Don=E2=80=99t we want a plumber who=\r\n\nfixes the plumbing problem rather than to see that the problem comes back\n=\r\nafter he leaves with money? We want to hire capable plumber and also need t=\r\no\ndo some maintenance ourselves. If one thinks it is an important desire to=\r\n be\nfulfilled, the message is to attain it through spirituality or the next=\r\n best\nis to hire a spiritually inclined priest while still maintaining love=\r\n\nrelationship with God. In fact, I have seen Narasimha encourages such\ncapa=\r\nble priests. So, he has nothing against priests who perform their job.\n\nThi=\r\ns mail on remedies and priests is inline with spreading spirituality.\nThis =\r\nwill help some people who are confused with many solutions and point\nthem t=\r\nowards spirituality. To me, the message delivered is consistent with\nearlie=\r\nr messages.\nBest Regards,\n-Kishore\n\nOn Thu, Jun 24, 2010 at 3:43 AM, Satish=\r\n Deshpande &lt;satishdesh@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji and all =\r\nrespected members - Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; Astrologers routinely recommend remedial me=\r\nasures involving mantras and\n&gt; poojas and people spend a lot of money on th=\r\nem.\n&gt;\n&gt; Do they work? I will give my 2 cents of views based on my experienc=\r\ne and\n&gt; insights. I will be honest, straight-forward and blunt.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Li=\r\nke me and all others who respect Shri PVR Narsimhaji as a noble,\n&gt; honest, =\r\nintelligent, spiritual person and Sanskrit scholar must be feeling\n&gt; sad af=\r\nter reading contents in the post heading efficacy of astro remedies.\n&gt; It=\r\n=E2=80=99s really painful to read such thing from a person of his status wh=\r\nom lot\n&gt; of people considered as a good astro-spiritual personality. Though=\r\n I am not\n&gt; having scripture references i=E2=80=99ll try to post my humble =\r\nprotest and request\n&gt; to all members to understand and study shastra deeply=\r\n for better\n&gt; understanding. *\n&gt;\n&gt; Though believers call priests and get po=\r\nojas done, in the hope that their\n&gt; problems will be solved, many priests t=\r\noday are incapable of producing any\n&gt; results. As a result, some believers =\r\ngot accustomed to accepting that a\n&gt; pudding exists even without eating it =\r\nand remain hungry throughout life. And\n&gt; some intelligent people stopped be=\r\nlieving in god and in remedies. Let me\n&gt; first address why this has come to=\r\n be and then talk about what we should do.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Results are produced rath=\r\ner bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding\n&gt; devata or deity and blessings =\r\nare called** **=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE** [** krupA] Here we\n&gt; =\r\nthink results are produced; so let us understand the method. If somebody\n&gt; =\r\nwants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to perform\n=\r\n&gt; remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the focal\n=\r\n&gt; point is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=\r\n=80=99s\n&gt; behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desi=\r\nre and in return\n&gt; get paid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere med=\r\niator or a\n&gt; technician who can interact with both parties. And interaction=\r\n means correct\n&gt; rituals with appropriate mantras. So his spiritual or ment=\r\nal strength is not\n&gt; required but his skill and knowledge is of prime impor=\r\ntance. Can we consider\n&gt; a mortal priest to bless a yajamana? And if a prie=\r\nst can bless yajamana what\n&gt; is the role of rituals, mantras? The truth is;=\r\n Blessings are bestowed upon\n&gt; the human beings by devatas as only divinity=\r\n is capable of this. And many\n&gt; times fruits are not received due to karmic=\r\n blockages of yajamana. **=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=\r\n=A4=97=E0=A5=87\n&gt; =E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=\r\n=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82** **[ in kaliyuga four times efforts are needed] a=\r\nnd\n&gt; this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for doing bhushudhhI, sharIrashu=\r\ndhhI\n&gt; etc.** And this is not an easy task on the part of astrologer to fix=\r\n the\n&gt; amount of prArabdha karma of yajamana.*\n&gt;\n&gt; If one has one million d=\r\nollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one\n&gt; for thousand dollars i=\r\ns meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what\n&gt; good is a thousand dol=\r\nlar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly,\n&gt; poojas done and blessi=\r\nngs given by a priest without enough spiritual energy\n&gt; cannot bring one an=\r\ny benefits.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yajamana get fruits of the rituals from the inbuilt ba=\r\nnk balance of\n&gt; deities and not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine energy,=\r\n called devata\n&gt; can give million dollar check to unlimited no of people as=\r\n GOD has\n&gt; sanctioned rather appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tradi=\r\ntion in\n&gt; vedic rituals in any pooja with or without homa in the beginning =\r\nthere is\n&gt; one ritual called aAchAryavarana [**=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BE=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3**] means yajamana no=\r\nminate a\n&gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf and in the=\r\n end before\n&gt; visarjana of pooja [**=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=\r\n=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8**] shreyodAn ritual is performed=\r\n in which\n&gt; priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to yaja=\r\nmana. Here we\n&gt; can clearly understand the role of priest and the role of d=\r\neity. As per\n&gt; karmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya and bl=\r\nessed one get\n&gt; that share of punya reducing your strength on all levels. C=\r\nan a mortal\n&gt; though highly qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he i=\r\nnteracts with\n&gt; many in his lifetime? This could be possible only for highl=\r\ny evolved soul\n&gt; like saints and yogis as due to great penance they do have=\r\n such powers. But\n&gt; even for them also some time loss of spiritual energy l=\r\neads for further\n&gt; penance. We read lot of stories in ancient mythology of =\r\nsages enticed by\n&gt; apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if they cursed so=\r\nme body results in\n&gt; renewed penances to regain there status.***\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On=\r\ne important note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)\n&gt;=\r\n or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that\n=\r\n&gt; FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical\n=\r\n&gt; actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to=\r\n\n&gt; wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals a=\r\ns\n&gt; the focus points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is=\r\n\n&gt; focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes wi=\r\nth a\n&gt; lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casual practice w=\r\nhen they\n&gt; go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense sadhana a=\r\nnd brought\n&gt; that energy to the table when they did rituals at the houses o=\r\nf people or in\n&gt; temples.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *=E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0** [ science of pathway to GOD] and [science of full\n&gt;=\r\n feeling desires through devata] i.e.** **=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=\r\n=A4=E0=A4=BE**=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=B0** ** are two\n&gt; different things. This science of mantra and devata is n=\r\not easy to\n&gt; understand. Divinity is beyond logic and human mind is not cap=\r\nable to\n&gt; experience it easily. As per smruti **=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=9A =\r\n=E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82** **is a** **dictum.\n&gt; We are=\r\n having four types of vak [ vani]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyantI\n&gt; and p=\r\narA** **[**=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=96=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=\r\n=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE**] and last one=\r\n is the most\n&gt; subtle and imp. We see picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lo=\r\ntus which\n&gt; originates from naval of Vishnu indicating creation origin of u=\r\nniverse. This\n&gt; is puran based concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradit=\r\nion are having\n&gt; same concept with different terminology. The subtle seat o=\r\nf paravak is at\n&gt; naval and creator brahma creates this world with the help=\r\n of saraswati and\n&gt; sarsawati is nothing but 52 syllable; **=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=\r\n=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE**. Saraswati is\n&gt;=\r\n embodiment of syllables. When two unknown person meets first time how they=\r\n\n&gt; get connected? Through communication and thought is a form of vak,\n&gt; pas=\r\nhyanti. First there is desire to know each other and then communication\n&gt; s=\r\ntarts. And in communication if some body express negativity communication\n&gt;=\r\n stops. So for communication soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how c=\r\nan\n&gt; we assume that mantra or rituals are of no importance? These show qual=\r\nities,\n&gt; tools necessary to get connected with devatas in right perspective=\r\n. In\n&gt; scriptures every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. which denot=\r\nes the\n&gt; nature of that syllable resulting in typical energy. To be precise=\r\n power\n&gt; rest with desire and mind is a mere tool to channalise that power =\r\nand\n&gt; strength of desire will decide depth of focused mind. So desire is fr=\r\nom\n&gt; yajamana, mind is of priest and blessings are from pleased devata. Eve=\r\nn in\n&gt; great astro treaty like BPHS, sage parAsharA recommended various rit=\r\nuals of\n&gt; various devatas for removing bad effects of bad dashas or bad pla=\r\nnetary\n&gt; placements. I wonder if mantra and rituals do not count why Narsim=\r\nhaji is\n&gt; having so many homa manuals. *\n&gt;\n&gt; *To consider spiritual aspect =\r\nof it, persons like saint or yogis who do\n&gt; have dharanA like a solid rock =\r\nwho always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need\n&gt; not require mantra or tantr=\r\na, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of\n&gt; them can do work. Normal p=\r\neople like me; require all earlier six steps of\n&gt; ashtAngyOgA of patanjali =\r\nlike yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and\n&gt; dharanA. And these all=\r\n steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja\n&gt; traditions as mantra, tantr=\r\na, nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled\n&gt; by devata many many thing=\r\ns count.  *\n&gt;\n&gt; * *\n&gt;\n&gt; * This whole confusion is due to Narsimhaji=E2=80=\r\n=99s sincere wish to spread\n&gt; spirituality and he is doing this with pure h=\r\neart. Yes, focus mind is one of\n&gt; the factors in this whole exercise. Many =\r\nhave seen shatachandI or mahArudra\n&gt; anushathAna where many priest at a tim=\r\ne read or chant mantras with different\n&gt; level of mind focus still yajamana=\r\n get fruits of it in terms of desires.\n&gt; This is because devata is pleased =\r\nby offerings, japa and hOme which in turn\n&gt; bless the yajamana with HIS ble=\r\nssings.  For spirituality focus, pure heart\n&gt; and continuous efforts are of=\r\n prime importance but for getting our desires\n&gt; to be fulfilled we need cor=\r\nrect procedure, appropriate deity and correct\n&gt; mantra.

The proc=\r\nedures have evolved to become quite\n&gt; complicated over the time too! Howeve=\r\nr, complexity of rituals should never\n&gt; be a deterrent. Suppose rules dicta=\r\nte that you MUST eat 2000 calories\n&gt; everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many=\r\n grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you\n&gt; have no access to such balanced food=\r\n. Will you starve yourself until you\n&gt; find a balanced meal or will you man=\r\nage with whatever you have? If you just\n&gt; have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) =\r\nand rice,\n&gt;\n&gt; you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarl=\r\ny, if you do\n&gt; not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need n=\r\not wait till you\n&gt; know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. =\r\nIt will only give\n&gt; you energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect=\r\n knowledge&quot; stems from the notion\n&gt; that some mantras/rituals can be danger=\r\nous. That notion is not totally\n&gt; baseless, but it is irrelevant today. It =\r\nis possible to focus the mind on\n&gt; some mantras and rituals and get specifi=\r\nc results. When used by someone with\n&gt; a high level of spiritual energy, so=\r\nme mantras and rituals may work very\n&gt; fast and give specific powerful resu=\r\nlts. However, Nature has purposely\n&gt; hidden (almost) such things in this ag=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and should be done by ex=\r\nperts only\n&gt; as these are for special purposes and should be done by traine=\r\nd people.\n&gt; There are hundreds of ways for GOD realization and a single way=\r\n to fulfill\n&gt; our desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know how to drive a car why=\r\n opt for a fighter\n&gt; plane?   Only if you elders, gurus have sanctioned it =\r\nthen its ok. Nature\n&gt; has not purposely hidden anything but due to loss of =\r\nenergy in doing\n&gt; bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. for removing karmic blocks=\r\n we feel we need\n&gt; more energy and we are not getting it. Yes, we should no=\r\nt wait for perfect\n&gt; thing as perfection is subjective matter but we must r=\r\nead study, think,\n&gt; analyze before accepting any concept. I do fully agree =\r\nwith homA sadhana\n&gt; concept as this is one of the best ways for acceleratio=\r\nn according to my\n&gt; experiences in my twenties but it is for spirituality a=\r\nnd for desires to get\n&gt; full filled through deities every thing counts.*\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different=\r\n shapes.\n&gt; They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bo=\r\nwl you use,\n&gt; you may be given different kind of alms. But it is important =\r\nto start\n&gt; begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending=\r\n years\n&gt; looking for the perfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting for astro=\r\nlogers\n&gt; with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect=\r\n mantra or\n&gt; ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an =\r\nelder you\n&gt; respect) tells you.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but =\r\nanshA of GOD. **=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83** .

And who=\r\nle karma done for this in a pious manner is a sattvic\n&gt; karma. Even for get=\r\nting fulfilled our desires we do have a relationship of\n&gt; respect, love, gr=\r\natitude with devatas.

For example, Vishnu s=\r\nahasranaama stotra explicitly says\n&gt; it can solve ANY problem. Instead of l=\r\nooking for a\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;perfect mantra recommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic ma=\r\nntra like that\n&gt; and start sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nf your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount energy may be\n&gt;=\r\n enough to move it away. If it is the size of a big\n&gt;\n&gt; boulder on the othe=\r\nr hand, much more energy may be needed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *It seems Narsimhji is in t=\r\noo much hurry to spread concept of homa in this\n&gt; world. Yes, as this conce=\r\npt is blessed by divine mother homa is going to be\n&gt; popular sadhana in com=\r\ning years. In his anxiety to spread this blessing he\n&gt; is contradicting his=\r\n own words. Mantras do have vargabheda and can be\n&gt; broadly categorized as =\r\n shrutimantra, smritimantra, puranmantrra and\n&gt; varadamantra. For ex. We ca=\r\nn broadly classify savitur gayatri as\n&gt; shrutimantra; chandipatha as smruti=\r\nnmantra; vishnusahastranam as puranmantra\n&gt; and shabarimantra[created by gr=\r\neat navanath yogis] as varadamantra. The term\n&gt; generic is itself illusive.=\r\n Every devata, every mantra is assigned different\n&gt; power, different work b=\r\ny cosmic mother. It is HER wish for this\n&gt; classification. **=E0=A4=89=E0=\r\n=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=82 =E0=\r\n=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=A5=E0=A4=82( =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A5=87 ) =E0=A4=AC=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=\r\n=A3=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=AA=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE** **[\n&gt; For fulfilling jiva=E2=80=99s desires and sub=\r\nsequent karma GOD manifest in different\n&gt; form ] is the nucleus of all deva=\r\ntabheda and related different forms,\n&gt; mantra, rituals etc.  Why remedies a=\r\nre needed, how they can give desirable\n&gt; fruits, how can we achieve this an=\r\nd last but imp how this happen should be\n&gt; focal point here. Remedies are n=\r\needed to full fill desires, by removing\n&gt; karmic blocks we can get this, by=\r\n doing various correct procedures we can\n&gt; achieve this and this happens du=\r\ne to generated punya in this whole exercise.\n&gt; For full filling desires we =\r\nshould know the depth of karma, to remove karmic\n&gt; blocks we need appropria=\r\nte devata, to achieve this we must have exact tools\n&gt; in the form of mantra=\r\n, tantra, rituals etc; and at last generation of punya\n&gt; in real timeframe.=\r\n *\n&gt;\n&gt; *Let us have a quick look at Narsimhji=E2=80=99s post on remedy for =\r\nbegetting a\n&gt; child. He has suggested main remedy as santangopal*\n&gt;\n&gt; *mant=\r\nra a well known proven remedy. Why he suggested that? If every mantra\n&gt; fro=\r\nm his generic list can do this he should have suggested any one. As per\n&gt; t=\r\nhe shashtra the analogy should be like this. Here we will sidetrack depth\n&gt;=\r\n of karma as this is near impossible to understand **=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=B9=E0=\r\n=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=A4=E0=\r\n=A5=80** [\n&gt; gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a childless coup=\r\nle aged 35\n&gt; years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately need a baby. =\r\nSnatangopal is\n&gt; a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity responsible for su=\r\nstenance of\n&gt; universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the mantra itself =\r\nis self\n&gt; explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the most imp it w=\r\nill\n&gt; generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called generic ma=\r\nntra is\n&gt; capable of giving everything to everybody but the main hurdle is =\r\ntimeframe.\n&gt; If we do any sadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy=\r\n to have all\n&gt; pleasures in the world whereas the use of this punya depends=\r\n upon the\n&gt; individual. In this case punya required to beget a child is mis=\r\nsing so we\n&gt; need that energy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlik=\r\nely that lady\n&gt; will be capable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mant=\r\nra will give\n&gt; child but in next birth as specific form of punya required t=\r\no beget a baby\n&gt; will be accumulated after doing generic mantra for long ti=\r\nme rather whole\n&gt; life time. As said in vishnusahasranama couple will get a=\r\nll fruits in next\n&gt; birth including baby and major part of that punya will =\r\nbe consumed for said\n&gt; cause of baby leaving small part for other pleasures=\r\n. If we use wooden\n&gt; hammer to fix a nail it might take one hour to finish =\r\njob but metal hammer\n&gt; can do this in five minutes. This science, not logic=\r\n is behind different\n&gt; mantra, rituals sanctioned by sages for different pu=\r\nrposes as karma is never\n&gt; generic.*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Dear Narsihmaji you are doing ver=\r\ny noble karma in a sattvic manner so\n&gt; thousands will read you, hundreds wi=\r\nll follow you; so for them and to our\n&gt; scientific spiritual tradition i th=\r\nink you should do justice by rethinking\n&gt; on this topic.

The materia=\r\nlistic relationship solves worldly problems, while spiritual relationship l=\r\neads towards self-realization. This is one way of leading life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;To my understanding, Narasimha spreads the message to liv=\r\ne\nwith only one relationship which is spirituality or love/surrender to God=\r\n. Yes,\nNarasimha certainly believes homam as the vehicle for this relations=\r\nhip and teaches the same since he\nhas first hand great experiences through =\r\nhomam.=C2=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In spirituality, there is no probl=\r\nem of counting gives and\ntakes from Yajamana. A saadhaka accepts whatever h=\r\ne gets due to his karmic\nbaggage and leads his life. If he still has desire=\r\ns, he uses the same\nrelationship not with a staunch give or take attitude, =\r\nbut with a surrender\nattitude. Surrender is a tough path. Belief is that ho=\r\nmam creates exactly\nsuch an attitude over time and all the material needs a=\r\nre taken care without\npaying much attention to them. Once in spirituality p=\r\nath, one may learn\nshastras based on his conditioning, but I don=E2=80=99t =\r\nsee it being discouraged here.\nIn fact, learning homam ritual is increasing=\r\n awareness of shastras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Coming to priest as a m=\r\nediator or technician, I believe, his\nmessage is to find a capable technici=\r\nan or priest for the job. Don=E2=80=99t we want a\nplumber who fixes the plu=\r\nmbing problem rather than to see that the problem\ncomes back after he leave=\r\ns with money? We want to hire capable plumber and also\nneed to do some main=\r\ntenance ourselves. If one thinks it is an important desire\nto be fulfilled,=\r\n the message is to attain it through spirituality or the next\nbest is to hi=\r\nre a spiritually inclined priest while still maintaining love\nrelationship =\r\nwith God. In fact, I have seen Narasimha encourages such capable priests.\nS=\r\no, he has nothing against priests who perform their job.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;M=\r\nsoNormal&quot;&gt;This mail on remedies and priests is inline with spreading\nspirit=\r\nuality. This will help some people who are confused with many solutions\nand=\r\n point them towards spirituality.

As a result, so=\r\nme believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding\nexists even without=\r\n eating it and remain hungry throughout life.

If\nsomebody =\r\nwants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to\nperform =\r\nremedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the\nfocal po=\r\nint is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=99=\r\ns\nbehalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire and i=\r\nn return get\npaid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediator or a=\r\n technician who\ncan interact with both parties. And interaction means corre=\r\nct rituals with\nappropriate mantras.

The subtle seat of paravak is at naval and creator\n=\r\nbrahma creates this world with the help of saraswati and sarsawati is nothi=\r\nng\nbut 52 syllable; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:10pt;font-family=\r\n:Mangal;color:black&quot; lang=3D&quot;MR&quot;&gt;=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=\r\n=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;c=\r\nolor:black&quot;&gt;. Saraswati is embodiment of syllables. When two unknown person=\r\n meets first\ntime how they get connected? Through communication and thought=\r\n is a form of\nvak, pashyanti. First there is desire to know each other and =\r\nthen communication\nstarts. And in communication if some body express negati=\r\nvity communication\nstops. So for communication soft speech, good words, etc=\r\n are imp. So how can we\nassume that mantra or rituals are of no importance?=\r\n These show qualities, tools\nnecessary to get connected with devatas in rig=\r\nht perspective. In scriptures\nevery syllable is assigned colour, form, etc.=\r\n which denotes the nature of that\nsyllable resulting in typical energy. To =\r\nbe precise power rest with desire and\nmind is a mere tool to channalise tha=\r\nt power and strength of desire will decide\ndepth of focused mind. So desire=\r\n is from yajamana, mind is of priest and\nblessings are from pleased devata.=\r\n Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage\nparAsharA recommended various r=\r\nituals of various devatas for removing bad\neffects of bad dashas or bad pla=\r\nnetary placements. I wonder if mantra and\nrituals do not count why Narsimha=\r\nji is having so many homa manuals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;color:black&quot;&gt;To consider spiritual aspect =\r\nof it, persons like saint or yogis who do have\ndharanA like a solid rock wh=\r\no always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not\nrequire mantra or tantra, r=\r\nituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can\ndo work. Normal people =\r\nlike me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of\npatanjali like yam=\r\na, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these\nall steps are=\r\n embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tantra,\nnyas, etc=\r\n. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many many things count. &lt;span=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-size:12pt;color:black&quot;&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;color:black&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;This whole con=\r\nfusion is due to\nNarsimhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality a=\r\nnd he is doing this with pure\nheart.
