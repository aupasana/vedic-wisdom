Someone sent me a few snippets from \nan=\r\n \n&gt; interview posted on her website. Please see below.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesti=\r\nng that she considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her \nguru. It \n&gt; is intere=\r\nsting that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire \nceremonies and \n&gt; show=\r\n what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be \npeace&quot;. This \n&gt; =\r\nis similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she \nappeared to =\r\n\n&gt; him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n&gt; \n&gt; She told him that many pe=\r\nople are and will be born who will perform \na short \n&gt; fire ritual on a reg=\r\nular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace \nin the \n&gt; world and also m=\r\nake quick spiritual progress individually in that \nprocess. \n&gt; Shree Maa&#39;s =\r\nstatement about what Ramakrishna told her is along \nsimilar \n&gt; lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMy guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular \nChandi homam=\r\n \n&gt; should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is done \n3 t=\r\nimes a \n&gt; day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous \np=\r\nlaces and \n&gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example=\r\n, \nthere is no \n&gt; need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual wi=\r\nth bare \nminimum \n&gt; offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 tim=\r\nes everyday. \nWhen a \n&gt; few such centres are established, it will apparentl=\r\ny lead to a \nchain of \n&gt; events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam \neve=\r\nryday for \n&gt; 3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That i=\r\ns \nfantastic! \n&gt; It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates ener=\r\ngy and \nbrings \n&gt; deities to a place. While several ancient temples are wit=\r\nhout any \ndivine \n&gt; presence these days, new places of divine presence may =\r\nbe created \nby pure \n&gt; souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing d=\r\nharma in the \nworld.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata=\r\n Chandi homam \nduring which \n&gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my =\r\nguru on spreading homam \nwas \n&gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary a=\r\nnd the time of sankalpa \nwas within \n&gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi =\r\nPravesha time of the birth \nanniversary. \n&gt; All of this was a coincidence a=\r\nnd we were unaware of this \nsignificance when \n&gt; we decided the muhurta. It=\r\n is interesting to know that Ramakrishna \ndid \n&gt; mention fire ceremonies sp=\r\necifically to somebody and that his words \nare \n&gt; similar to the words of M=\r\nother.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- w=\r\nisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; She considers Shri=\r\n Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; &gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n pasted for your benefit), from an interview found here\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shre=\r\nemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakr=\r\nishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You have to go now \nfor\n&gt; &gt; our country, and =\r\nall other country, you have to go do fire \nceremonies\n&gt; &gt; and show what is =\r\ntruth, what is dignity, and at that time the \nwhole\n&gt; &gt; world will be peace=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of =\r\nAmerican \ndescent),\n&gt; &gt; that same page describes his background, how he met=\r\n her and all \nthat;\n&gt; &gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &gt; &lt;sni=\r\np&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at \nbe=\r\nst,\n&gt; &gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he \nstud=\r\nied\n&gt; &gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi \nan=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of \nworshi=\r\np\n&gt; &gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities in the \nprocess.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire=\r\n \nceremony\n&gt; &gt; and worship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside fro=\r\nm the\n&gt; &gt; humble temple grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add =\r\nmore friends to your messenger and enjoy!
