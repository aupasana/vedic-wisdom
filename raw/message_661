This is too literal a=\r\n way to create &quot;vibrations&quot; of the mantra. Vibrations of a mantra are subtl=\r\ne and created by the subtle body as one repeats a mantra.\n \nHowever, the pe=\r\nrson in question may indeed have cured some people like this! As somebody d=\r\noes spiritual sadhana, Nature may give one some abilities. Curing people wi=\r\nth a specific procedure - however illogical - CAN be one such ability confe=\r\nrred by Nature after one does sadhana. The shakti generated by his previous=\r\n sadhana may be slowly being put to use with each patient. Fan with Gayatri=\r\n mantra stickers is only an instrument and the result comes because of the =\r\nperson&#39;s previous sadhana and not the procedure.\n \nThere may be people with=\r\n very minor siddhis and abilities like this, who use weird and illogical pr=\r\nocedures to achieve tangible results. There is nothing wrong with it. Howev=\r\ner, most of them fall intro the trap of thinking &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;that procedur=\r\ne did it&quot; etc and feel a sense of ownership, entitlement or superiority. Th=\r\ney may take pride in what they do. This whole thing promotes ego. In the pr=\r\nocess, they get stuck. They accumulate some people who admire them, but the=\r\ny do not free themselves. This may happen to people with more advanced sidd=\r\nhis also.\n \nHowever, all kinds of people are needed by Nature. People like =\r\nthis are also needed. Not everyone is going to be liberated in the current =\r\nlife. Every soul passes through various stages.\n \nRegarding 2:\n \nVibrations=\r\n are not generated by the *vaikhari* sound of a mantra repeated by a machin=\r\ne or even a person. They are generated by the subtle body of a person whose=\r\n consciousness is focused on a mantra. If one plays a mantra in a CD, liste=\r\nns to it actively and focuses the mind on what one is listening, then the p=\r\nerson&#39;s thoughts while listening can produce good vibrations and generate p=\r\nurity. But, in general, playing CDs and tapes in a room with nobody listeni=\r\nng to them does not do much.\n \nHowever, suppose a person of sufficiently hi=\r\ngh level of purity recorded it and he intended some good results for these =\r\npeople. His strong intention may be sufficient to transfer some of his ener=\r\ngy to them and help them. Then playing of the CD can work as a nimitta or a=\r\nn instrument (like the fan in case 1 above) and slowly release the shakti o=\r\nf the person.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWe can appreciate the work of all peo=\r\nple. If one listens to us, we can try to impress upon one some spiritual te=\r\nachings of rishis and great saints and try to help one see things in proper=\r\n light and not get stuck. If other people foolishly try to imitate someone&#39;=\r\ns illogical procedure, because it seems to work, we can try to educate them=\r\n and remove their misconceptions.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWe can advise oth=\r\ners and try to help others, but we cannot really change anybody. But each o=\r\nf us can definitely change ONE person and correct the attitude of that pers=\r\non. And, that person is oneself.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message -=\r\n---- \n  From: ashwinrawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thur=\r\nsday, November 13, 2008 12:32 PM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] CD or Cassette p=\r\nlaying\n\n\n  Dear Sir, \n\n  1. I had visited one Gentleman in 1980 who was cur=\r\ning the patients by simply their photographs. He was demamding photo of the=\r\n patient. He had pasted Gayatri Mantra sticker on all the three wings of a =\r\ntable fan and he was keeping the photograph of the patient just opposit the=\r\n fan. He was switching his fan on for 1 or 2 hours daily for couple of days=\r\n and as per his say, he was throwing the vibrations of Gayatri Mantra direc=\r\ntly to the photograph. He was claiming that he has cured so many patients b=\r\ny Gayatri Mantra vibrations. \n\n  2. Some people are arranging some Mantra c=\r\nassette or CD in their worship room and playing them for couple of hours da=\r\nily and believing that the room is charged due to Mantra vibrations. Some a=\r\nre playing these type of  CDs in their Car to get protection from accidents=\r\n and like. All are doing these as per their believes.\n\n     What I want to =\r\nknow from you Sir is whether this is really working? Can anybody be cured b=\r\ny  Gayatri Mantra-written Fan?\n\n    Can a CD or Cassette create vibrations?=\r\n If someone is sleeping in the room where whole night one CD of a cerain Ma=\r\nntra is played. The person is unaware of it. Whether Mantra will crerate an=\r\ny positive effect on him?\n\n  Dr. Ashwin Rawal\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01E4_01C945E0.89F70D30\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3429&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Regarding 1:&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In general, if anybody pastes Gay=\r\natri mantra \nstickers on a fan and runs the fan in front of a photo or even=\r\n the person \ndirectly, you can be sure that it does nothing whatsoever.
