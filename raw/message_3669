I was also t=\r\nhinking that.\n=C2=A0\nFew days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is =\r\nthe staple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in e=\r\nating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on =\r\nthe=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man=\r\n came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna s=\r\naid first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. =C2=A0Also a s=\r\nimilar examples was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a =\r\ncertain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish ea=\r\nting and rather just focus mind on God.\n=C2=A0\nWhen I tried to reason with =\r\nthem that if these people were to come back again on planet earth they may =\r\nnot recommend non veg eating - considering the state of the world today - I=\r\n=C2=A0 was catergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is som=\r\nething wrong in eating fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\n=\r\nThen I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to w=\r\nhich I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such examples e=\r\nven today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve f=\r\nish. This statement is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad in many=\r\n Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, the mon=\r\nks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarad=\r\na better than us ordrinary people. \n=C2=A0\nI could make no further argument=\r\ns and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my parents =\r\nthat I have quit non veg food. \n=C2=A0\nA lot of Bengalis may not have been =\r\nable to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, howeve=\r\nr they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Thakur&quot; and &quot;S=\r\nri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\nPS: No disr=\r\nespect to anyone.

Ho=\r\nwever, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept =\r\nit hence forth.\n\nI just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He say=\r\ns (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (B=\r\ninding to one) when one self-identifies with it.\nAlthough, it may seem easy=\r\n to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult to ach=\r\nieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer our que=\r\nries.\n\nImportant information about Vimalananda which I came to know only ye=\r\nsterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day pas=\r\nsed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his de=\r\nparture from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently an=\r\nd occasionally ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed ou=\r\nt (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thought=\r\ns crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Agh=\r\nori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says and =\r\nnot try to do what he does.\n\nNow whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to=\r\n answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind yo=\r\nu, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next to =\r\nnothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or=\r\n Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forge=\r\nt that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spiritua=\r\nl realization. They are knower of everything or many things in the universe=\r\n. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. =\r\nIn short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Rele=\r\nvant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke=\r\n cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they are =\r\ndoing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every actio=\r\nn of theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind their e=\r\nach action and\n moreover their self identification is missing from the acti=\r\non and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a specia=\r\nl purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\nRamakrishna used =\r\nto frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different from ot=\r\nhers. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can consume =\r\nanything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat a=\r\nnything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food=\r\n intake is extremely important.\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in =\r\nwest, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not possible for major=\r\nity of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that level. He migh=\r\nt be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that h=\r\ne can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate t=\r\nheir habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It is also po=\r\nssible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha wi=\r\nth the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he would have s=\r\nhowered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It=\r\n&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but just a natural=\r\n inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother=\r\n Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in=\r\n USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go to USA. Whe=\r\nn the boy, after some\n years actually met Swami in USA for the first time, =\r\nswami immediately told him to stay away from water and when he requested sw=\r\nami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him =\r\nthat he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will give him Silv=\r\ner Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda an=\r\nd after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda w=\r\nhich literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n\nSw=\r\nami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n\nSo moral of my who=\r\nle writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of=\r\n the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalanan=\r\nda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and ju=\r\nstify our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actio=\r\nns.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna =\r\nKanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Great c=\r\noincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today =\r\non Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eati=\r\nng is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a bo=\r\nok on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote tha=\r\nt he survived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also =\r\nrelished it.

Then it =\r\nwill be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone w=\r\nill curse it for not satisfying their palates. How many humans would give b=\r\neautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and s=\r\nerved?\n&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too love their=\r\n children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her chic=\r\nks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness=\r\n, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the slaughter of her =\r\nbeloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourished with her milk=\r\n, whom she loves more than her own life?\n&gt; Do these so called humans ever t=\r\nhink of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they endure their=\r\n own children being murdered before their own eyes?\n&gt; How is Ma to teach su=\r\nch donkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subtle enough to self-i=\r\ndentify with another being of a different species and experience its person=\r\nal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make them suffer, allowin=\r\ng the animals they have tortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, af=\r\nter all.

I was also thinking that.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Few days back=\r\n when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the staple diet), one person told =\r\nme confidently that there is no harm in eating fish or meat because Swamiji=\r\n used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the&nbsp;life of Sri Ramakrishna t=\r\nhere is one example mentioned where a man came to ask him if should quite n=\r\non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanc=\r\nhana&quot;, then think of food. &nbsp;Also a similar examples was quoted to me f=\r\nrom&nbsp;the life of Ma Sarada where - a certain book says - she advised an=\r\n ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating and rather just focus mind on=\r\n God.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;When I tried to reason with them that if=\r\n these people were to come back again on planet earth they may not recommen=\r\nd non veg eating - considering the state of the world today - I&nbsp; was c=\r\natergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong=\r\n in eating fish they would have told right then.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Then I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual c=\r\nases, to which I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such =\r\nexamples even today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat a=\r\nnd serve fish. This statement is a fact. I&nbsp;have had fish meals as pras=\r\nad in many Ramakrishna Missions across&nbsp;West Bengal.&nbsp;So, I was tol=\r\nd, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna an=\r\nd Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary people. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nI could make no further arguments and of course had a harrowing time at hom=\r\ne trying to convince my parents that I have quit non veg food. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A lot of Bengalis may not have been able to implement the=\r\n basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives, however they faithfully fol=\r\nlow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Thakur&quot; and &quot;Sri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swami=\r\nji&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;PS: No disrespect to anyone.

However, you are free to address me as you feel like an=\r\nd I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I just came across Vimalananda=\r\n&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) tha=\r\nt Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is =\r\nmultiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely import=\r\nant statement to answer our queries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Important information about Vim=\r\nalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smok=\r\ner and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smok=\r\ning except on the final day of his departure from physical body. He used to=\r\n as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally\n ate meat. I gave this =\r\ninformation, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an in=\r\nteresting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please=\r\n also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to al=\r\nl his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No=\r\nw whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked=\r\n. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unr=\r\nealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example =\r\ncases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such ack=\r\nnowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized so=\r\nuls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower =\r\nof everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfe=\r\nctly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they =\r\nare doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n Relevant to our topic of discussio=\r\nn, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or kill=\r\ned animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a=\r\n specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said,=\r\n they know complete background behind their each action and moreover their =\r\nself identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature =\r\noperates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them =\r\nin any cause-effect chain.&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his=\r\n disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiri=\r\ntual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A f=\r\nood restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spir=\r\nitually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely importa=\r\nnt.&lt;BR&gt;If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have s=\r\nome subtle purpose which is not\n possible for majority of us to comprehend =\r\nunless explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; fr=\r\nom the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by the=\r\nm as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eati=\r\nng and such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time =\r\nthat he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose me=\r\nat he ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen bless=\r\nings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there w=\r\nere no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We=\r\n&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way=\r\n Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still =\r\nin India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some ye=\r\nars actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told hi=\r\nm to stay away from water\n and when he requested swami to accept him as his=\r\n disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru =\r\nand his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That m=\r\nan later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was=\r\n actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled=\r\n what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swami Vivekananda wa=\r\ns all knowing and most of us are NOT.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So moral of my whole writings =\r\nis that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconve=\r\nntional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana=\r\n Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our co=\r\nmpletely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B=\r\nest Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.ya=\r\nhoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@=\r\n... &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82&nbsp;I was abo=\r\nut to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82&nbsp; It is clear fr=\r\nom the below passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; I was=C3=82&nbsp;reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadh=\r\na - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating =\r\nmeat when he was living in USA also relished it.

Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes th=\r\nrough when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodim=\r\nent of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees th=\r\ne slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nour=\r\nished with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do thes=\r\ne so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow=\r\n? Could they endure their own children being murdered before their own eyes=\r\n?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose intel=\r\nlect is subtle enough to self-identify\n with another being of a different s=\r\npecies and experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative =\r\nbut to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to torture=\r\n them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all.
