S=\r\nuggested / Suitable time to perform ganapati homam(currently, I am performi=\r\nng around the time of sunrise, is it suitable at night or before sunrise to=\r\no?)\n\n2. What substance should not be offered in Ganapati homam (bel-leaves =\r\nshould be one in the list, I unknowingly used it and experience very bad ef=\r\nfects!) \n\n3. When the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, is it really needed to =\r\nperform &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam? if someone can control hi=\r\ns/her thinkings during ganapati homam, sex/masturbating/consume non-veg foo=\r\nd is really needed? (In my practical experience, consume very low-diet litt=\r\nle food at last night are excellent for performing Ganapati Homama in the m=\r\norning. my point is, readying our body/mind 5-6 hours before the homama pro=\r\ncedure by controlling sex/food are very much useful for me!)\n\n4. Is there a=\r\nny practical methods to keep the fire more times in the homam kundam so tha=\r\nt more time to spend on meditation?\n\n5. Is there any cost effective solutio=\r\nns for daily homam in Kolkata, India? Sometimes I find expensive for daily =\r\nganapati homam. We may ask to create a group in Kolkata to use our cumulati=\r\nve purchasing capacity for cheap rate. \n\nbest regards,\nBiswajit\n\n\n"}}
