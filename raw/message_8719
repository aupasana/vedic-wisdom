When he was young he heard f=\r\nrom a pandit that standing in the Gangaji and doing the Gaytari mantra give=\r\ns certain siddhis. So he would come to Haridawar and stand in water and wou=\r\nld do Gaytarijapa. How long ago this happened I do not know,150 years and m=\r\nore may be. One day he heard that somebody was saying to him,--Your japa ha=\r\ns been successful. I am pleased with you. you can go now. So his desires we=\r\nre fulfilled.\n\nAgain I saw in a book written by a jyotishi in Pune area per=\r\nhaps, that he would do Gaytarijapa in the river near his town.\n\nIn 2000 I w=\r\nas in Vrindavan=A0 a old Vaidji told me that during Sun eclipse, he would s=\r\ntand in the water of certain pond and try to get siddhi of those mantra by =\r\nwhich he could help childless couple.\n\nSo it is a genuine method of making =\r\nspiritual progress fast but it is not for everybody. I would not ask others=\r\n to do. If people get cold or pneumonia or other illness then what? When I =\r\nwas doing it I felt very good Once you get in water and go chest deep, wate=\r\nr feel hot. Only the air which is hitting the face and head is very cold. A=\r\nnd you feel so much peace and joy which is amazing.Yes, you again feel very=\r\n cold when you come out and wear dry clothes.=A0\n\nAnd there are other diffi=\r\ncult things as well.\nOne day when I was in water I smelled smoking. I turne=\r\nd round and saw a man was standing at a distance and staring at me and smok=\r\ning as well. Although he was quite far away but because the air was so puri=\r\nfied, it was affecting me. I could not concentrate on japa and became nervo=\r\nus, came out of water and changed in to dry clothes and went to get some te=\r\na. I did not speak to him and he did not say a thing, just kept staring at =\r\nme. Later a priest told me about him saying he had left home and wanted to =\r\nbecome a sadhu. But on that day for some unknown reason he blocked my path.=\r\n\n\nAnother time I was in a different place where lot of people were taking t=\r\nheir dip in water. I had heard that 4/5 men and women were in water, when s=\r\nome local boys ran away with their clothes. They had to go to police statio=\r\nn in their wet cloths.So I was nervous myself and came out of water quickly=\r\n. Immediately a young man who was standing near my clothes said, you did no=\r\nt spend much time in water today. I guess he was keeping a eye on me and I =\r\nwas saved by The Grace on that day.\n\nThanks\nLaxmiNarayan\r\n--1972604429-1541450175-1349262466=:34447\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv583674037&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font=\r\n-family: tahoma, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv583674037yui_3_2=\r\n_0_17_134917431924142&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-s=\r\nerif; &quot; id=3D&quot;yiv583674037yui_3_2_0_17_134917431924160&quot; class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_=\r\n17_134925683229260&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 13px; &quot;&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv583674037yui_3_2_0_17_134917431924142&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0=\r\n, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; backgr=\r\nound-color: transparent; font-style: normal; &quot;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once I s=\r\naw a article about the teacher/guru of the person who started the aryasamaj=\r\n movement and was blind.
