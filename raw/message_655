This list should also include saints from sufism and\nother reli=\r\ngions\nWe have a good history and books to refer too but we donot have a \nli=\r\nst of top 50 or so of living saints.\n\nSo I request you all to contribute if=\r\n you know and are impressed with \nthem.\n\nThis would be a good thing to have=\r\n so that many of us can seek \ndarshan and also seek guidance in future.\n\nTh=\r\ne idea here is about quality and not so much about quantity meaning\nvery re=\r\nputed saints with thousands of disciple are already wellknown,\nI would not =\r\nmind having them in the list but more important is\nrealized saints who have=\r\n chosen to remain hidden or have shun\npublicity.\n\n\nTo Start of I shall star=\r\nt with a very realized saint shri Ganapathy\nSacchianand Swamiji of Mysore, =\r\na living Datta Avatar. He is the \nmiracle man. I have had his darshan in US=\r\n a few times.\n\nOnce while I was on a pilgrimage to Pushkar about 8 years ag=\r\no, I did \nvisit a saint known as bengali baba, a very realzied saint in his=\r\n \n90s. He is still alive and has built a very unique hanuman temple in \nPus=\r\nhkar Rajasthan.\n\nIt was a very interesting meeting. He spoke bengali only a=\r\nnd I\nspoke hindi. He spoke for an hour. he understood all of what I said \na=\r\nnd asked and answered very sincerely in bengali in a very passionate \nway, =\r\nhowever I could only understand 10% when the translator was able \nto keep u=\r\np with him.\nMy idea  here is to find great saints in India who are also not=\r\n \nwellknown as they may have chosen not to publize themselves too.\n\nI thoug=\r\nht about this because while growing up, I missed a lot of \noppurtunities to=\r\n meet and seek darshan of many well known saints that \nI am finding out now=\r\n about their greatness. I feel like I missed many \nboats and still remain o=\r\nn the same shore and waiting to cross the \nocean.\n\nHope to get this list go=\r\ning\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n"}}
