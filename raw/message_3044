Is there any harm in it?=94 I then remembered an incident t=\r\nhat\nhappened in Bhagavan=92s presence in 1944-45.\n\nA lady devotee from Andh=\r\nra Pradesh came to the Ashram and stayed for some\ntime. Her devotion was of=\r\n a peculiar nature. Her conception of Bhagavan was\nthat he was Lord Sri Kri=\r\nshna and she was a Gopika (shepherdess).\n\nThe devotees here however felt th=\r\nat such a concept had no place here as\nBhagavan was a brahmachari from birt=\r\nh and a Jivanmukta. But then she would\nnot keep her view to herself but pub=\r\nlicised it and even wrote to Bhagavan\naccordingly.\n\nBhagavan was as usual i=\r\nndifferent to such writings. He however gave me those\npapers to read.He rem=\r\nained untouched by all such trivialities but I could\nnot keep quiet after s=\r\neeing such atrocious writings. So I quietly rebuked\nthe lady.\n\nShe flared u=\r\np and began writing all sorts of nasty things about me. On\nseeing them Bhag=\r\navan said laughingly, =93Here are the papers from her. All\nabout you only,=\r\n=94 and handed over the papers to me.\n\nI was completely upset, but what to =\r\ndo? At last one day with tears in my\neyes I told Bhagavan, =93I cannot read=\r\n such letters any longer and keep quiet.\nLet her damn herself. Please do no=\r\nt give me her letters any more.=94 =93All\nright. I won=92t given them,=94 s=\r\naid Bhagavan and stopped giving me her letters.\n\nSome days later, that lady=\r\n began tearing her clothes and started running\nabout in the streets shoutin=\r\ng, perhaps because of mental imbalance or\ndeliberately.\n\nWhen Bhagavan came=\r\n to know of it he remarked, =93Somebody must take pity on\nher and do someth=\r\ning, otherwise how can she get on?=94 Taking it as an order,\nI spoke to a f=\r\new of the well-to-do Andhra devotees and with their help sent\na telegram to=\r\n her husband\nand also arranged a person to look after her until the arrival=\r\n of her\nhusband. In a few days her husband came and took her away.\n\nSometim=\r\ne later she sent registered notices to four or five of us saying we\nhad out=\r\n of envy at her attaining siddhi (deliverance) dubbed her as a mad\nperson a=\r\nnd that she\nwould file a suit against us for defamation. She followed it up=\r\n with a visit\nto the Ashram with her lawyer.\n\nWhen Bhagavan explained to hi=\r\nm all that had happened, the lawyer spoke\napologetically to us all and scol=\r\nded her saying, =93What nonsense! Enough.\nEnough of it,=94 and left. Realis=\r\ning she could not bluff any more, she also\nleft for her native place in\nAnd=\r\nhra Pradesh.\n\nSubsequently, sometime in November 1949, I received a letter =\r\nfrom her\nenquiring about Bhagavan=92s health, as she had received alarming =\r\nreports\nabout his health.\n\nShe wrote,=93I have heard that Bhagavan=92s heal=\r\nth is not satisfactory. Please\nlet me know how he is now. I had earlier wri=\r\ntten to you abusive letters.\n\nI am sorry for what I had done. You are reall=\r\ny Bhagavan=92s child. Please\nexcuse me and favour me with an immediate repl=\r\ny. I have given below my\naddress.=94\n\nI informed Bhagavan about the letter.=\r\n He simply said, =93Is it so?=94 and kept\nquiet for about three days. Durin=\r\ng those days the usual graciousness in his\nlook was absent whenever I prost=\r\nrated before him; instead he used to turn\nhis face away from me.\n\nIt then o=\r\nccurred to me that the cause of his displeasure was perhaps because\nof the =\r\ninternal impurity of my mind in still harbouring ill-will towards\nthat lady=\r\n and\nnot replying to her.\n\nI therefore bought a postcard immediately and wr=\r\note to her. =93There is\nnothing particular now to worry about Bhagavan=92s =\r\nhealth.\n\nI will write again in case there is any cause for anxiety.=94 I po=\r\nsted the\ncard and\ncame to Bhagavan. When I got up after prostrating before =\r\nhim, he looked at\nme graciously. I told him that I had just posted a reply =\r\nto that Andhra\nlady.\n\nIn a pleasant tone, he remarked, =93Yes, yes,=94 and =\r\ncalling Rangaswamy,\nSatyanandam\nand other attendants that were there said, =\r\n=93Look. She has written a letter\nto that Telugu lady. It seems that the la=\r\ndy had stated in her letter to\nNagamma, I had abused you some time back but=\r\n now I have realised my\nmistake.\n\nPlease excuse me and let me know about Bh=\r\nagavan=92s health.=92 Nagamma has just\nsent her a reply. So that lady has n=\r\now expressed her regret.=94 He thereafter\nturned towards me with a benign a=\r\nnd benevolent look.\n\nI was extremely happy and pleased. So this is the resu=\r\nlt of living at the\nfeet of the Guru =97 all the impurities of the mind get=\r\n washed away thus.\n\nNarrating this incident I told that lady devotee from A=\r\nndhra Pradesh that\nrenunciation can never be real if anger and resentment r=\r\nemain in the mind.\n\nThat lady wondered if such impure thoughts occur even i=\r\nn the presence of\nBhagavan\nand if he would treat such people with sympathy =\r\nand tolerance.\n\nThe saying that Mahatmas are Patitapavanas (saviours of fal=\r\nlen people) has\nbeen illustrated in Bhagavan=92s presence.\n\nThough the lady=\r\n had behaved senselessly,Bhagavan always had compassion for\nher, and he mad=\r\ne me understand in his inimitable way that I should not\nharbour any ill wil=\r\nl towards her; he kept up a cool attitude towards me\nuntil my anger and res=\r\nentment towards that lady were given up.
