Be dispassionate, keep the se=\r\nnses under control and let the mind not\nwander; sit in a solitary place and=\r\n meditate on the Self as infinite and one\nalone.\n\n39. Keep the mind pure; w=\r\nith keen intellect, resolve all that is objective\ninto the Self and always =\r\nmeditate on the Self as clear and single like\nether.\n\n40. Having discarded =\r\nall names and forms, you are now the knower of the\nSupreme Being and will r=\r\nemain as perfect Consciousness-Bliss.\n\n41. Being the same as Consciousness-=\r\nBliss, there is no longer any\ndifferentiation such as the knower and the kn=\r\nown; and the Self shines forth\nas Itself.\n\n42. If in this manner by process=\r\n of constant meditation,the two pieces of\nwood, namely the Self and the ego=\r\n are rubbed together, the flames from the\nfire of knowledge burn away the w=\r\nhole range of ignorance.\n\n43. On knowledge destroying ignorance in this way=\r\n, like the light of dawn\nscattering the darkness of night, the Self will ri=\r\nse like the sun in all its\nglory.\n\n44. True, the Self is always here and no=\r\nw; yet it is not apparent, owing to\nignorance. On ignorance being destroyed=\r\n the Self seems as if it were gained,\nlike the necklace on one=E2=80=99s ow=\r\nn neck.\n\n45. Just as in darkness a post is mistaken for a man, so is Brahma=\r\nn in\nignorance mistaken for a jiva. If, however, the true nature of a jiva =\r\nis\nseen, delusion vanishes.\n\n46. Knowledge arising on the experience of rea=\r\nlity immediately destroys the\nignorant perception of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 an=\r\nd =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, which resemble the delusion of\ndirection in darkn=\r\ness.\n\n47. A jnani who is a perfectly Self-realized yogi, sees by the eye of=\r\n wisdom\nall objective phenomena to be in and of the Self and thus the Self =\r\nto be the\nsole being.\n\nHow does he then act in the world?\n\n48. Just as clay=\r\n is the only material from which different utensils are\nformed (such as pot=\r\ns, jars, etc.), so he sees that the Self, too, is the\nwhole universe and th=\r\nere is nothing but the Self.\n\n49. In order to be liberated while yet alive,=\r\n the sage should completely\neschew the adjuncts (upadhis), and thus gain th=\r\ne real nature of\nBeing-Consciousness-Bliss, like the maggot that turns into=\r\n a wasp.\n\n50. Having crossed the ocean of illusion and having killed the de=\r\nmons of\nlikes and dislikes, the yogi, now united to shanti (peace), finds d=\r\nelight in\nthe Self and so remains in his own glory.\n\n51. The jivanmukta, fr=\r\need from all desire for transient,external pleasures,\ndelights in his own S=\r\nelf and remains clear and steady a like lamp in a pot.\n\n52. Like the akasa =\r\n(ether) which remains untainted by the objects contained\ntherein, the muni =\r\n(sage) remains untainted by the adjuncts (upadhis)\ncovering him. Being the\n=\r\nall-knower he remains like one that knows not, and moves about like the air=\r\n\nuncontaminated by the objects it touches.\n\n53. On the dissolution of the a=\r\ndjuncts (the body, senses,etc.), the sage now\nfreed from particularities me=\r\nrges in the all-permeating Being (Vishnu), like\nwater in water, ether in et=\r\nher or fire in fire.\n\n54. There is no gain over and above this gain, no ple=\r\nasure over and above\nthis bliss, no knowledge over and above this knowledge=\r\n, know this to be\nBrahman.\n\n55. That on seeing which nothing remains to see=\r\n, on becoming which there is\nno more return to samsara, on knowing which no=\r\nthing remains to know, know\nthat to be Brahman.\n\n56. What fills everything,=\r\n above, below and around, itself\nBeing-Consciousness-Bliss, non-dual, infin=\r\nite, eternal, one only, know that\nto be Brahman.\n\n57. What remains as immut=\r\nable, unbroken Bliss, and as one only, that which\neven the scriptures indir=\r\nectly denote by the process of elimination as =E2=80=98not\nthis, not this=\r\n=E2=80=99, know the same to be Brahman.\n\n58. Dependent on a fraction of the=\r\n inexhaustible Bliss of the Atman, all the\ngods such as Brahma enjoy bliss =\r\naccording to their grades.\n\n59. Like the butter in milk, the objective univ=\r\nerse is contained in it; all\nthe activities are based on it alone. Therefor=\r\ne Brahman is all-pervading.\n\n60. What is neither subtle nor gross, short no=\r\nr long,produced nor spent,\nwhat is devoid of form, attribute, caste and nam=\r\ne, know it to be Brahman.\n\n61. By whose light the sun and other luminaries =\r\nshine forth, but which is\nnot itself illumined by them and in whose light a=\r\nll this is seen, know it to\nbe Brahman.\n\n62. Like fire in a piece of red-ho=\r\nt iron, Brahman permeates the whole world\nin and out and all through, makes=\r\n it shine and itself also shines by itself.\n\n63. Brahman is distinct from t=\r\nhe universe, yet there remains nothing apart\nfrom Brahman. Should any other=\r\n than Brahman appear, it is only an illusion\nlike water in a mirage.\n\n64. W=\r\nhatever is seen or heard, it cannot be different from Brahman. True\nknowled=\r\nge finds Brahman to be Being-Consciousness-Bliss and one without a\nsecond.\n=\r\n\n65. Only the eye of wisdom can see the omnipresent\nBeing-Consciousness-Bli=\r\nss, but not the eye of ignorance for a blind eye\ncannot see the sun.\n\n66. L=\r\nike gold freed from dross, the jiva (sadhaka) has all his impurities\nburnt =\r\naway by the fire of knowledge bursting into flames fanned by sravana,\nmanan=\r\na and nidhidhyasana (hearing, reflection and contemplation) and now he\nshin=\r\nes forth by himself.\n\n67. Because the sun of knowledge, the chaser of darkn=\r\ness has risen, the\nAtman shines in the expanse of the Heart as the omnipres=\r\nent sustainer of all\nand illumines all.\n\n68. He who bathes in the clear, wa=\r\nrm, ever-refreshing waters of the Atman,\nwhich being available everywhere, =\r\nhere and now, need not be sought for in\nspecial centres and seasons; such a=\r\n one remains actionless. He is the knower\nof all; he pervades all and is ev=\r\ner immortal.\n\nSource: Collected Works Of Sri Ramana Maharshi\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd6147cbb26260488a808a7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n35. =E2=80=98Like ether, I am always pervading all, in and out, =\r\nunswerving, ever equal in all, pure, untainted, clear and unshaken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n36. =E2=80=98That which remains eternal, pure, ever-free, all alone, unbrok=\r\nen bliss, non-dual, Being-Consciousness-Bliss, transcendent Brahman (the sa=\r\nme) am I=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;37.
