Even a very powe=\r\nrful mantra can be \noffered in homam. On the Vedic side, Rudra namakam and =\r\nGayatri \nmantra are very very powerful mantras and they are offered in homa=\r\nm. \nOn the Tantrik side, Pratyangira mantra, Mahasudarsana mantra, \nPaashup=\r\nata mantra etc=C2=A0are very very powerful astra mantras=C2=A0and \nthey are=\r\n offered in homam. As these examples show, even very \npowerful mantras can =\r\nbe offered in fire for amplification.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; The power of powerful mantras is a mirage for most people. The \nexper=\r\nience given by a mantra and the internal/external results \nbrought by a man=\r\ntra vary from mantra to mantra. But, even with a \nvery powerful mantra, one=\r\n needs to be ready for the mantra to \nactually work.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When one is=\r\n able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with \na mantra (i.e. no t=\r\nhoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind \nconstantly), then one exp=\r\neriences the mantra. This perfect \nabsorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the=\r\n mantra then causes internal \nchanges by the flow of energy internally in s=\r\npecific ways (specific \nto the mantra) and that causes corresponding extern=\r\nal changes in the \nuniverse and corresponding karmic interactions between v=\r\narious \nobjects. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There may be thousands of paths to climb a mou=\r\nntain. Each path \ntakes one to a different spot atop the mountain. The view=\r\n one has \nfrom the top may be different accordingly. One view may be more \n=\r\nbreathtaking and amazing than another. However, one taking a path \nleading =\r\nto a breathtaking view and one taking a path leading to a \nnormal view both=\r\n have to struggle on their paths and reach the top \ndespite obstacles. Some=\r\n paths may be slightly shorter, but none is \ntoo easy. All paths are diffic=\r\nult to walk, but some result in a more \nbreathtaking view than the others.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, one chanting a &quot;powerful mantra&quot; and a &quot;normal mantra=\r\n&quot; \nwill both have to put in effort and overcome the weaknesses and get \ncon=\r\ntrol over mind. The power of the powerful mantra refers to a more \npowerful=\r\n experience after one succeeds with the mantra (more \nbreathtaking scenery =\r\non reaching the mountain top). It is not \ncorrect to think that things will=\r\n happen automatically and easily \nbecause one if chanting a powerful mantra=\r\n 11 (or whatever) times.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Coming back=\r\n to Rajarshi&#39;s question, I do not recommend homam with \nKunjika stotra. Kun=\r\njika stotra is a coded stotra containing several \nmantras in coded form. It=\r\n is not what it may seem to be. It is for a \nreason that Shiva tells Parvat=\r\ni that this prayer should be hidden \nlike one&#39;s privates. It is weird that =\r\nwe are discussing such a \nsecretive mantra on a public forum. It is a colle=\r\nction of powerful \nmantras for specific prayogas that would be considered \n=\r\nraajasik/taamasik unless a realized soul without attachment to the \nactions=\r\n is acting them out as an instrument of the Divine.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I see no poi=\r\nnt in wanting to do homam with it. If you are meant to \ndo a homam with Kun=\r\njika stotra to stop the army of a country in \ntheir tracks or kill someone =\r\nor delude someone etc and if you are \ndetached enough to carry it off succe=\r\nssfully, then you will be given \nan opportunity by nature to learn it and d=\r\no it. Otherwise, why even \ntry?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My advice is to drop the idea of=\r\n doing a homam with Kunjika \nstotra. Just stick to saptashati (700 verses).=\r\n If that is too long \nfor you, try saptashloki (7 verses) or just the 4th c=\r\nhapter or just \nthe 11th chapter. Another option is to do a homam with just=\r\n the \nmoola mantra (navaakshari) .\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one can pronounce the 8 ve=\r\nrses of Devi sooktam well,=C2=A0a homam \nwith Devi sooktam is a great idea =\r\ntoo.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A few mails from the last coupl=\r\ne of weeks are pending reply.
