It is a tradeoff ... if yo=\r\nu want less smoke, it is better\nto clean it, but there are also likely to b=\r\ne some partially burnt\nparticles in the ash. If you leave it, some small pa=\r\nrtially burnt\nparticles may finish burning, but there is likely to be a lit=\r\ntle more\nsmoke.\n\n(3) Disposing of ashes. As Narasimha has written, you want=\r\n to\ndistribute the energy in the ashes back to nature in a respectful way.\n=\r\nDo whatever is possible given your constraints. If no other\nalternative pre=\r\nsents itself, throw them out in the garbage.\n\n(4) Twigs & Ghee -- The twigs=\r\n are dipped in ghee before they are\noffered. After that you offer ghee ahut=\r\nis to the fire (and thus, the\ntwigs) until they burn.\n\n(5) Copper vs Iron -=\r\n- Narasimha has told us that iron is unlikely to\nhave a good mix of gunas, =\r\nand copper is a much better choice. If you\nhave to get a new kunda, why not=\r\n get a copper one?\n\n(6) Size -- The size of the homa kinda is a matter of p=\r\nreference based\non the size of the fire that you light. With a smaller kund=\r\na, you may\nhave trouble  exposing all sides of all ahutis to air, which mig=\r\nht\nprevent them from burning well. With a larger kunda, if you don&#39;t keep\na=\r\nn equivalently large fire ablaze, you may have more smoke. Once you\ndo homa=\r\nm repeatedly, you will figure out if you need (or want) a kunda\nof a differ=\r\nent size.\n\n(7) Washing & Cleaning -- You do not have to wash the kunda dail=\r\ny\n(though you can if you choose to). It is a good idea to keep the\nprayer a=\r\nrea relatively clean ... you should be comfortable with it.\nUsing something=\r\n like aluminum foil can make regular cleanup easy.\n\n(8) Bali -- After puja,=\r\n bali is offered to animals, and is not\nconsumed by us. If this is not poss=\r\nible, you can throw it out.\n\n(9) Base of the kunda -- Putting the kunda on =\r\nnewspaper is a bad idea\n... it may easily catch on fire. A wooden plank may=\r\n work, though it is\nbetter if it is raised (i.e. has a gap of air between t=\r\nhe main plank\nand the ground). Even with a wooden plank, two bricks between=\r\n the\nplank and kunda is a good idea.\n\nWhen you have extra free time, consid=\r\ner searching the group archives\nfor these same questions. You&#39;ll come acros=\r\ns many other interesting\npoints from previous discussions on the same topic=\r\ns.\n\nbhavadiiyaH,\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Jun 24, 2011 at 11:45 PM, Rama=\r\n V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Oh ! and lastly, what do I do with the =\r\n&quot;bali&quot; fruit pieces ?\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also, I bought a metal homa =\r\nkund (not copper, probably iron), 6x6 inches in the interior and probably a=\r\n sq.ft exterior.

What is the ideal siz=\r\ne for a daily homam kumd? If I cannot use bricks, can I just place the copp=\r\ner kund on a wooden plank or newspaper piece !\n&gt;&gt; Also, do we need to wash =\r\nand clean the homa kund, the wooden ladle and the whole prayer area daily ?=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;&gt; rAma\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; =\r\n&lt;vsra_prasad@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Sh Narasimha, et al. - I have done =\r\nmy first homam (SriKrsna homam) today, hopefully it was fine, as I made som=\r\ne minor mistakes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; First of all, the fire got put off twice, as the twi=\r\ngs did not catch fire easily. I learnt that the twigs need to be cut vertic=\r\nally for them to burn better.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Secondly, the full dry coconut did not b=\r\nurn completely in the poornahuti and if I put a half one or a piece it woul=\r\nd have burnt completely.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, the dharbhas I have were a bit bent and=\r\n I could not put them pointed to north or south or the other directions cor=\r\nrectly. Hope that was ok too !\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Now some questions (I am sure thes=\r\ne have been answered, I apologize, but would appreciate if you respond agai=\r\nn); btw, if these could be put in FAQ, will be much obliged.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. what d=\r\no I do with the partially burnt poornahuti ? Can I use it tomorrow ? Also, =\r\nwhat does one do with all the ash and the burnt part? What is the holy way =\r\nto dispose it off ? No lakes or river by in Bangalore ! Do I put them under=\r\n a tree and pour water ? Not many trees, only plants, in the apts I live he=\r\nre.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If there are any unburnt part of the twigs, can I use them agai=\r\nn? Or do they need to be disposed off ?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. Is it advisable to dip (not=\r\n pour) the twigs in the ghee so that they burn well ?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Let me know=\r\n of other points I might have known for a beginner.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally, a mi=\r\nllion thanks and appreciations for all who are responsible (Sh MMP, Sh PVR,=\r\n etc.) for the KT.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rAma\n\n"}}
