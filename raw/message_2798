This avathara took place during Treta Yuga befor=\r\ne Sri Parashurama\n&gt; Avathara. Lord Maha Vishnu took this avathara in order =\r\nto suppress the\n&gt; arrogance, vanity and pride of Emperor Bali (Bali Chakrav=\r\narthi) and to\n&gt; restore the glory, power and authority of Lord Indra over t=\r\nhe Heaven who had\n&gt; lost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to King Bali. Sri V=\r\nishnu Sahasra Nama\n&gt; Sthothra describes in sloka # 17 and 56, the Lord asUp=\r\nendro Vaamanah and\n&gt; Trivikramah.*\n&gt; *Lord in this avathara was known as Va=\r\nmana because he was dwarf in form at\n&gt; the beginning. He was known as Trivi=\r\nkrama because he is the one who has\n&gt; conquered the three worlds, Earth, Up=\r\nper worlds and Nether worlds. He grew\n&gt; to a gigantic size while suppressin=\r\ng the King Bali and conquered the\n&gt; Universe with just three paces of his f=\r\noot. He was also referred as Upendra\n&gt; as he was known to be the younger br=\r\nother of Indra. We find all the three\n&gt; names Trivikrama, Vamana and Upendr=\r\na while reciting 24 Kesava Namas. An\n&gt; exclusive Purana named after Lord Va=\r\nmana called Sri Vamana Purana scripted\n&gt; by Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms =\r\npart of 18 great Puranas called Ashtadasa\n&gt; Puranas.*\n&gt; \n&gt; *Lord Vamana was=\r\n born as the son of Sage Kashyapa (Kashyapa Prajapathi) and\n&gt; his wife Adit=\r\ni in accordance to the penance done by the couple and prayers\n&gt; of Indra an=\r\nd other Deities. He was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi day\n&gt; under the st=\r\nar constellation of Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year is\n&gt; celebrated =\r\nas Vamana Jayanthi the day on which Lord Sri Vamana was born. As\n&gt; soon as =\r\nhe was born He took no time in attaining the boyhood becoming a Vatu\n&gt; (Bra=\r\nhmachari). Lord Brahma himself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to Sri\n&gt; Vama=\r\nna. His attire was that of a typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing a\n&gt; Koupe=\r\nena (Loin cloth), a sacred thread, holding a Chatthra (Umbrella) in one\n&gt; h=\r\nand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick and water jug) in the other, his upper body=\r\n\n&gt; covered with Deer skin, wearing a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his th=\r\nird\n&gt; finger.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; \n&gt; *Significance of Three Steps*\n&gt; *Lord Vamana went =\r\nto King Maha Bali and asks for three steps of land\n&gt; measured by his foot a=\r\ns charity. Initially Bali hesitated to donate just\n&gt; three paces of land as=\r\n it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty to give\n&gt; such charity. But =\r\nlater agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and promised\n&gt; to give three pa=\r\nces of land as charity measured by Sri Vamana&#39;s foot. When\n&gt; Maha Bali comp=\r\nleted the ritual process of donating the land, Lord Vamana\n&gt; assumed his co=\r\nsmic form (Trivikrama), measured the entire Earth including\n&gt; the nether wo=\r\nrlds by his first step.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; With his second step He measured the entire =\r\nupper worlds. When his foot\n&gt; reached the zenith it crossed the Sathya Loka=\r\n where Lord Brahma stays.\n&gt; Seeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu, Lord Brahm=\r\na offered abhishekam and\n&gt; washed the Lord&#39;s foot and the water that fell f=\r\nrom His foot sanctified the\n&gt; entire Universe. We find in the verses of gre=\r\nat composer and Saint Sri\n&gt; Annamacharya referring to the foot washed by Lo=\r\nrd Brahma (Brahma Kadigina\n&gt; Padamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri Venka=\r\nteswara.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; When the entire Universe was conquered by just two paces of=\r\n Lord Sri Maha\n&gt; Vishnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Universe to=\r\n keep Vamana&#39;s\n&gt; third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space to =\r\nkeep his third\n&gt; pace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had vanished a=\r\nnd he had no\n&gt; hesitation in surrendering before the Supreme Lord. Having r=\r\nealised the\n&gt; Supreme Reality, Bali readily offered his own head to keep th=\r\ne Lord&#39;s third\n&gt; step. Lord Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his f=\r\noot) on the head\n&gt; of Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the ahan=\r\nkara (egoism) of\n&gt; Maha Bali was suppressed and Indra was restored with his=\r\n kingdom.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; \n&gt; *Uniqueness*\n&gt; \n&gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Av=\r\nathara where Lord Sri Maha Vishnu took\n&gt; complete human form though dwarf a=\r\nt the beginning. The uniqueness of this\n&gt; Avathara is that the Lord did not=\r\n use any weapon. The only weapon he used\n&gt; was that of begging in front of =\r\nKing Bali in accordance to the Brahmanic\n&gt; (Brahmachari) form he had attain=\r\ned. The Lord did not kill the King Bali even\n&gt; though he was an Asura. He c=\r\nonquered him in a Vedic way with his\n&gt; intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas=\r\n, Vamana Avathara was a Sattvik\n&gt; Avathara. Lord had to resort to this stra=\r\ntegy due to the promise he had made\n&gt; to his beloved devotee Prahlada not t=\r\no kill any of his descendants.\n&gt; Astrologically Jupiter (Guru) is said to b=\r\ne the Paramatma Amsa of Vamana\n&gt; Avathara.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; *Message from Vamana Ava=\r\nthara\n&gt; *\n&gt; \n&gt; *Hidden behind every Avathara of Paramatma there is a messag=\r\ne/moral\n&gt; conveyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the message is total surren=\r\nder to the\n&gt; God however mighty one may be. When once you shed your ego and=\r\n surrender\n&gt; totally with devotion at the feet of the supreme Lord there is=\r\n nothing one\n&gt; can worry about and will get total protection. This is what =\r\nexactly has\n&gt; happened in case of Bali who had no other alternative but to =\r\nsurrender to\n&gt; the Lord Trivikrama who had conquered the three worlds.*\n&gt; *=\r\nWhen King Bali surrendered in front of Lord Vamana with total devotion, the=\r\n\n&gt; Lord was very much pleased and gave him boons voluntarily without being\n=\r\n&gt; asked by King Bali. He not only made him the ruler of the nether world\n&gt; =\r\nSuthala but also assured him that He would always protect his kingdom. He\n&gt;=\r\n also assured Bali that he would become the Indra in the next Manvanthara. =\r\nBy\n&gt; the touch of Lord&#39;s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got cle=\r\naned\n&gt; up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi). This is what one should unders=\r\ntand\n&gt; that we should never ask for alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask yo=\r\nu will\n&gt; get only what you had asked. It you don&#39;t ask you will get everyth=\r\ning that\n&gt; you require.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; The story of Bali also bring out the reality=\r\n that, there is nothing\n&gt; permanent and nothing to be taken for granted in =\r\nthis world be it wealth,\n&gt; beauty, power, status, position or family and no=\r\nthing belongs to anyone.\n&gt; Even the mighty have to fall on one day or the o=\r\nther. We have several such\n&gt; historical examples that we are also seeing in=\r\n this modern world.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; \n&gt; *Festivals related to Vamana Avathara:\n&gt; *\n&gt;=\r\n *The day on which Lord Vamana was born is celebrated every year on\n&gt; Bhadr=\r\napada Sukla Dwadasi Day as Vamana Jayanthi.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; \n&gt; *Temples of Vamana A=\r\nvathara: Some of the famous temples of Lord Vamana are,\n&gt; *\n&gt; *Ulagalanda P=\r\nerumal temple: It is a temple of Lord Sri Maha Vishnu in\n&gt; Trivikrama roopa=\r\n (Vamana Avathara). The statue is 35 ft. height and 24 ft.\n&gt; width. It is s=\r\naid that during Vamana Avathara Lord Vishnu appeared to King\n&gt; Bali at this=\r\n place. It is also said that the Lord showed his Trivikrama\n&gt; roopa to Lord=\r\n Aadisesha at this place. This temple is located in Shiva\n&gt; Kanchi (Kaanche=\r\nepuram) in Tamil Nadu state.\n&gt; *\n&gt; \n&gt; *Thrikkara Temple: The only Vamana te=\r\nmple in Kerala near Cochin famous for\n&gt; Onam festival.
