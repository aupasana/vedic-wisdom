A Short Life Sketch \n1. Bi=\r\nrth:\n\nSivapuri Baba was born on Moolam Nakshathram (star) in the month of \n=\r\nBhadra 1883, corresponding to AD 1826, as the son of Narayanan \nNambudiripa=\r\nd of Oruvannur Mana, near Guruvayur, Kerala. \n2. Childhood: He was named as=\r\n Jayanthan. Since parents died early, \nhis grandfather brought him up. \n\n3.=\r\n Brahmacharyam: As per custom, he entered the Brahmacharyam stage \n(Upanaya=\r\nnam) at the early age of 6 or 7, and started studying Vedams \nand Sanskrit.=\r\n By the time he completed Brahmacharyam in 1840, \nsufficient knowledge had =\r\nbeen acquired in Sanskrit, Vedams \nBraahmanams, Ayurvedam and Astrology. \n\n=\r\n4. Married Life: Immediately after completing his Brahmacharyam, he \ngot ma=\r\nrried and was blessed with two sons and two daughters. \n\n5. Rejection of Fa=\r\nmily : While in his twenties, Jayanthan \nNambudiripad left his family so as=\r\n to be free from the worldly ties. \nIn search of the eternal truth, he reac=\r\nhed Sringeri Mutth of Aadi \nSankaracharya. \n\n6. Spiritual Institution: He m=\r\net Achuthan, a great scholar in \nMathematics and Astrology and a teacher at=\r\n the Mutth. Achuthan \nforesaw a great Samnyaasi in Jayanthan and accepted h=\r\nim as his \nstudent. The future Sivapuri Baba also accepted Achuthan as his =\r\n\nDaadaaji (grandfather) and learnt from him, as much as a spiritual \ninstit=\r\nution could provide. \n\n7. The Last Wish of Daadaaji: Later, both he and Daa=\r\ndaaji left \nSringeri Mutth and reached the shores of Narmada River for \ndoi=\r\nng &quot;Thapasya&quot;. One day Achuthan told him that he should undertake \na pilgri=\r\nmage around the world. \n\n8. The End of Daadaaji: That was his last wish. A =\r\nfew days  later, \nDaadaaji breathed his last, leaving Jayanthan all alone. =\r\n\n\n9. The Great &quot;Thapasya&quot;: Thereafter he  walked through the shore of \nthe =\r\nRiver Narmada and reached the thick forest where human contact \nwas impossi=\r\nble. There, at a place of complete solitude, he began his \ngreat &quot;Thapasya&quot;=\r\n in search of the absolute truth. For nearly 20 \nyears, he observed deep me=\r\nditation. He had lost count of time, \nseasons and years. \n\n10. Realisation =\r\nof the Absolute: During the last stages of this deep \nmeditation with point=\r\ned objective of realisation of God, and with \nprogressive elimination of al=\r\nl that can support and comfort the \nsenses and the mind, he was blessed wit=\r\nh the beatific vision or the \nfinal enlightenment, the &quot;Ithambara prajna&quot;. =\r\n\n\n11. What Next ?: How can a man who had spent so many years in almost \ncom=\r\nplete solitude, re-emerge into the world of reality? But in his \ncase, the =\r\nre-emergence was with more vigour, highest wisdom and great \ndetermination =\r\nto execute the programmed decisions. Only an \nenlightened  soul could do it=\r\n. He decided to undertake a long \npilgrimage around the length and breadth =\r\nof the world by foot, as per \nthe last wish of his Daadaaji. \n\n12. Bharat D=\r\narshan: Thus decided, from his forest retreat, he went to \nGujarat in the w=\r\nest, Calcutta in the east, Kanyakumari in the south \nand the Himalayas in t=\r\nhe north. \n\n13. Non-attachment: After the &quot;realisation&quot;, he was a fully lib=\r\nerated \nSamnyaasi who was above all the worldly ties. He influenced Aurobin=\r\nda \nGhosh at Baroda, taught Nirukalpa Samaadhi (practical) to Ramakrishna \n=\r\nParamahamsa at Calcutta, and taught Astrology to B G Tilak at Pune. \nBut he=\r\n never accepted the position of a Guru (teacher) which \nconnoted &quot;attachmen=\r\nts&quot;. \n\n14. Samnyaasam: During the Indian pilgrimage, he accepted Samnyaasam=\r\n \nfrom Sringeri Mutth and became &quot;Govindaananda Bharathi&quot;. \n\n15. In Afghani=\r\nstan: After India, the world pilgrimage on foot began, \nstarting with Afgha=\r\nnistan through the Khyber Pass. There he met \nAgakhan (Hassan Ali Shah), an=\r\nd lived with him for a few days. \n\n16. The First Hindu to Visit Mecca: From=\r\n Afghanistan, he went to \nMecca through Persia, where he established contac=\r\nt with Shah \nNassiruddin. During those times, entry to the holy city of Mec=\r\nca was \ngranted only to pure Muslims who surrendered wholly to God. But he =\r\n\nhad obtained a special permission due to his total submission to God, \nand=\r\n his arguments - &quot;God is the same for all. Mohammed was a prophet \nof God, =\r\nand not God. Who is a pure Muslim? - He who is completely \nsurrendered to G=\r\nod. I am fully surrendered to God.&quot; He spent a few \nmonths at Mecca in deep=\r\n meditation. \n\n17. From Mecca to Jerusalem and Rome: From Mecca he went to =\r\nRome via \nthe holy land of Jerusalem, Istanbul and Athens. It is a wonder a=\r\ns to \nhow he travelled on foot through the Arabian desert, which is \ndaunti=\r\nng even for camels, and how he travelled across mountains, \nvalleys and ran=\r\nges over and over again through the Anatolian Steppe. \n\nIn those days, the =\r\nholy city of Vatican was prohibited for non-\nChristians. But, Govindaananda=\r\n Bharathi managed to stay for a few \ndays at Vatican. \n\n18. That Long Pilgr=\r\nimage: That enlightened soul continued his \npilgrimage on foot, covering co=\r\nuntries of Europe, England, Greenland, \nCanada, United States, countries of=\r\n South America, Pacific Islands, \nNew Zealand, Australia, Japan, China, etc=\r\n., and finally reached back \nin India via Tibet and Nepal. Again he took a =\r\nfinal pilgrimage of \nIndia. During this time, he visited Kerala and his own=\r\n ancestral \nhouse where he found that nobody of his generation was living. =\r\n\n\n19. From the Poorest to the Emperor: In this great pilgrimage of \nsuper-h=\r\numan character, he visited more than 50 countries and the \nheads of nations=\r\n. He visited queen Victoria as an adviser and the \nqueen found him as a man=\r\n beyond the curtain of death. In Germany, he \nstayed in the Garden of Wilhe=\r\nlm Kaiser II. While in Germany, once he \ntold Einstein : &quot;Absolutely speaki=\r\nng, only God exists. So, the \nquestion of adding one thing to another canno=\r\nt be entertained. \nRelatively speaking, no two things or beings are exactly=\r\n alike. Thus, \nto say that, 1 + 1 equals 2, is convincing and convenient, b=\r\nut not \nprecise.&quot; \n\nWhen he was introduced to the materialist George Bernar=\r\nd Shaw, Shaw \nsaid: &quot;I hate Indian Samnyaasis who have no value for time.&quot; =\r\nHe \nimmediately responded: &quot;You are the slaves of time. We are much \nbeyond=\r\n the constraint of time&quot;. \n\nBut his stay was not confined only to big citie=\r\ns like London, Berlin \nor New York, or great houses. He used to wander on f=\r\noot from village \nto village meeting all types of people. \n\n20. Sivapuri Ba=\r\nba: When he returned after the long and great \npilgrimage, he was about 99 =\r\nyears old. He, then decided to spend the \nrest of his life in the forest of=\r\n Sivapuri, near Kathmandu, Nepal. \nThereafter, Govindaananda Bharathi becam=\r\ne Sivapuri Baba. Even after \nthe age of 100, he often used to undertake pil=\r\ngrimage to Kasi and \nother places, on foot. \n\n21. At Dhruvasthali: At the a=\r\nge of 120, he shifted to Dhruvasthali - \nanother forest retreat - nearly 1.=\r\n5 km from Pasupathinath Temple, \nKathmandu, due to cancer which he himself =\r\nlater cured with Yoga, \nafter medical advice failed. \n\n22. Mahaasamaadhi: O=\r\nn the morning of 28-01-1963 (Monday) at 6.15, he \ntold his devotees : &quot;Now =\r\nI am going&quot;. he also gave his last \nadvice : &quot;Live right life; worship God;=\r\n that is all, that is enough&quot;. \nThen he drank some water and rested on both=\r\n his hands and breathed \nhis last in the sitting position at 6.30. \n\nII. Si=\r\nddhis (Super-human Powers) \n1. Astral Vision: Being a man who had realised =\r\nthe &quot;Absolute Truth&quot;, \nSivapuri Baba had astral vision and omnipotent power=\r\n. But he was \nextremely calm and serene, and never felt tense or anxious. V=\r\nery \nrarely did he use his powers, believing that it may create reactions \n=\r\nand disturb the serenity. Yet it will be appropriate to mention a few \nof h=\r\nis super-human character. \n\n2. Friendship with Wild Animals: In Sivapuri fo=\r\nrest, wild animals \nlike tiger used to terrify the visitors. But, Baba will=\r\n say : &quot;They \nwill not harm you, if friendship is extended&quot;. Sometimes the =\r\ntigers \nwould take a few rounds of Babaji and return. Baba would often offe=\r\nr \nthem sugar cane chips, which they would eat before retreating to the \nfo=\r\nrest. \n\n3. Meditation: Timilsina had served Babaji for nearly 37 years. One=\r\n \nday Babaji asked him to bring provision from the market downhill, and \nth=\r\nen went into deep meditation. From the 10,000 ft. high Sivapuri, it \nwould =\r\ntake 5 or 6 hours to reach the town. By the time Timilsina \nreached the tow=\r\nn, he had high fever, and therefore, could not return \nfor the next 9 or 10=\r\n days. Worrying what Baba would say for such a \nlong delay, when he reached=\r\n the Aasram, Baba was still in meditation. \nIt was nearly a day later that =\r\nBabaji opened his eyes, saw him, and \nasked : &quot;Have you not gone yet?&quot; He w=\r\nas not aware of the passage of \ntime. \n\nEven in the normal course, Babaji u=\r\nsed to take meals only once or \ntwice a month. \n\n4. The Experience of the M=\r\naharaja of Travancore: When Babaji was in \nKerala, he visited the Maharaja =\r\nof Travancore. When they were \ntalking, Babaji suddenly felt a shock. The M=\r\naharaja asked for the \nreason, and was told that at that moment, somebody e=\r\nxpired in Nepal, \n3,000 km away. The Maharaja was astonished when he confir=\r\nmed it over \nthe phone. Then the Maharaja asked him to predict when he (the=\r\n \nMaharaja) will die. Babaji said such predictions are not appropriate, \nbu=\r\nt when insisted, said : &quot;A great son of Kerala will die in an \naccident and=\r\n yours will be soon after.&quot; This prediction was true, the \nperson referred =\r\nto was Kumaran Asan.\n\nIII. Babaji&#39;s Teachings in Brief \n1. Do the necessary=\r\n duties for maintaining life, and think mostly of \nGod. \n2. Every thing can=\r\n go against us till we know God. \n3. God can be experienced, but never expl=\r\nained. \n4. If God is seen and known, there are no more troubles; fears; pai=\r\nns \nand doubts are gone for ever. \n5. Intensify your longing for God. Let t=\r\nhe thought of God alone be in \nyour mind; destroy all other thoughts. You w=\r\nill see God, and all    \nyour problems are solved. \n\n\nWikipedia also has so=\r\nme info, please visit:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivapuri_Baba\n\n--- End=\r\n forwarded message ---\n\n\n\n"}}
