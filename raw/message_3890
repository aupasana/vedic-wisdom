If such a knowledgeble person can fall like this (=\r\n provided the news is true) how about a normal person like me !! How many t=\r\nests we need to face in our life time? This is not just about lust. How abo=\r\nut greed, anger, being too emotional ? I sincerely pray God to give me stre=\r\nngth to fight with these inner enemies of mine. \n\nI also think this should =\r\nbe a lesson to everyone who concentrates more on the Swamijis than on their=\r\n teachings. People show more interest in getting the attention of the Guru,=\r\n they want to touch him, they want miracles from him, they praise the glow =\r\nin his face and in his eyes. They feel proud if the Guru gives a little att=\r\nention to them. While doing all this they completely forget God. If the fol=\r\nlowers of swamiji are really God minded, they would have forgiven him rathe=\r\nr than destroying the Dhyana Peethams and burning his photos and developing=\r\n so much ill feelings towards him. This shows they didn&#39;t digest his teachi=\r\nngs. They want their Guru to be perfect not themselves. \n\nRegards,\nPadmaja\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear=\r\n Devotees,\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0Firstof all my humble apologies to God.=C2=A0What I s=\r\naid was just a opinion not a judgement or conclusion I still take my words =\r\nback for even passing an opinion on a highly spiritual=C2=A0person=C2=A0for=\r\n which I am least qualified.=C2=A0Sorry to the members also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Shanti=\r\nh, Shantih,Shantih !!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; PRM=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________=\r\n________________\n&gt; From: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;\n&gt; To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Thu, March 4, 2010 1:29:46 PM\n&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Utpal =\r\nji and Rajarshi ji\n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda says in book1 Page 97 Chapter: Shiva\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;This is one of the many reasons I hate communism .Communists are taught=\r\n to forget their parents ,culture to denounce them .If you destroy your par=\r\nents and culture which is your root how do you ever expect to prosper &quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 1.I agree on Tehelka and Sun tv.Both are politically affliated entities w=\r\nith parties hell bent on atheism which wait for a chance to use any occassi=\r\non to denigrate sanatana dharma. I do not wish to deviate the discussion bu=\r\nt interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by=\r\n dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon cop=\r\ny of Communist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used the cover of this oc=\r\ncasion to once again lash out at dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; The same Karunanidhi also las=\r\nhed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspap=\r\ner which is praised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles every=\r\n day with so called details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern =\r\n...That is the media war of modern India controlled by vested interests who=\r\n would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this =\r\ndrama are the missionary orgs.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.In Nithyananda&#39; s defense he never sa=\r\nid he was god . He also never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His adv=\r\nice was very simple ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long as=\r\n fantasies are not involved it does not become a addiction. \n&gt; \n&gt; He could =\r\nvery well be repaying a rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Two of his gurus were an old woman and a female tantrik which he mention=\r\ns in his youtube video on divine consciousness and feminity.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.Like Na=\r\nrasimha ji pointed out , he has a very good way of explaining higher level =\r\ntruths.\n&gt; \n&gt; What he did or did not do is only his karma alone .This does n=\r\not take away anything from his lectures or messages.\n&gt; \n&gt; and like Utpal ji=\r\n rightly pointed out...When we are prepared to sit on a high moral horse to=\r\n judge others...we better be prepared when the divine mother tests us.By ju=\r\nding we will incurr a share of the karma others committed and also will be =\r\njudged quite harshly when our turn comes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kisho=\r\nre \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_patha=\r\nk@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha aptly worte:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one has &gt;unders=\r\ntood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how &gt;many good kar=\r\nmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences &gt;one had, no matter =\r\nhow blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt;of the time, no matter ho=\r\nw elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still fall. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I learnt a ve=\r\nry good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s message.

Period.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; You have passionate=\r\nly raised some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One =\r\nthing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episod=\r\nes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, i=\r\nf a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many follo=\r\nwers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and=\r\n does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Bra=\r\nhmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.\n&gt; &gt; I w=\r\nhole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthf=\r\nul in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sex=\r\nual matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a statur=\r\ne in society. He really was a Saadhu.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is a big difference be=\r\ntween fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ra=\r\nvishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarra=\r\nssment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, i=\r\nn front of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a b=\r\nigger blow to faiths of general public.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not specific on Satya=\r\nnanda here because i do not know if it is really true.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the foot=\r\nage is right, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are =\r\nneeded to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitte=\r\nr pills so that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimu=\r\nm.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become =\r\nso &gt;twisted and \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You have spoken the truth. The world today is man=\r\ny times more tempting then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a ma=\r\nrried person (Even for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back)=\r\n and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally, i wou=\r\nld say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Ma=\r\nsters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold appro=\r\nach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilim=\r\nianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaara=\r\nm&#39;s famous line\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nit=\r\nyananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation,=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) S=\r\necond, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say so=\r\nme sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss =\r\nif a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost imposs=\r\nible for even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth=\r\n till death. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births,=\r\n would=C3=82=C2=A0probably=C3=82=C2=A0 not be able to remain so when born i=\r\nn thid age=C3=82=C2=A0is a simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kal=\r\ni Yuga to be different from other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is=\r\n that way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas=\r\n and rnas have become so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the r=\r\nnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our soci=\r\nety too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust=\r\n and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada =\r\n- whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years=\r\n of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nit=\r\nyananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the =\r\nidea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her=\r\n guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way=\r\n. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homa=\r\ns for some years. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Raja=\r\nrshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take away =\r\nthe me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr=\r\n@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:2=\r\n6 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste K=\r\nK,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the b=\r\nenefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as s=\r\nomeone said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video =\r\nis genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web. =\r\nHe is a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts.

Take your mind off god f=\r\nor a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focu=\r\nsed on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall.

The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following,=\r\n respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the m=\r\nidst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, eg=\r\no and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and one =\r\nfalls in the web of Mahamaya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even if a spi=\r\nritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever =\r\nby discussing those weaknesses.
