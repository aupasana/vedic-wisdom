Fortunately o=\r\nr unfortunately you have repeatedly broken the decorum yourselves. \n&gt; 2.   =\r\n  While it has been told explicitly in a mail addressed to you, that the de=\r\nbate is over as far as you are concerned, you continue to send me mails on =\r\nthe same topic, without any reason whatsoever.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.     By virtue of my =\r\nspending precious time on writing these mails, I have a right to exercise o=\r\nn whom I entertain for further discussion.\n&gt; 4.    If you are left with eve=\r\nn a little respect for the individuality of another person, please ensure t=\r\nhat you don&#39;t send unsolicited intercepting mails particularly when your na=\r\nme has not been mentioned inside the mail.\n&gt; 5.    If you are interested in=\r\n propagating your ideas, take up a new thread, on a part of the mail and in=\r\nvite responses or criticism or what ever you want to.\n&gt; 6.     You have no =\r\nright to tell others that they have a limited understanding - as you just d=\r\nid in your mail on Ahamkara =3D Asmita - till you are an omniscient being y=\r\nourselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7.    If you tried this sort of a thing again, I will ensur=\r\ne that I don&#39;t reply to any of your mails ever again.\n&gt; \n&gt; 8.    If you don=\r\n&#39;t give space to members, then, as a moderator, you won&#39;t ever be able to a=\r\nchieve the &quot;state of discipline and decorum&quot; and &quot;participation of group me=\r\nmbers&quot; at the same time.\n&gt; 9.

UtpalJi\n&gt; \n&gt; c. prob=\r\nably those who have not yet replied.\n&gt; 10.     As far as a ban or moderatio=\r\nn is concerned, there is no dearth of people, nor is it an issue to run a y=\r\nahoo group of ones&#39; own.
