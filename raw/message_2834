The mistaken notion that a person is born with a g=\r\nenetically-inherited &quot;caste&quot; is an inherently anti-Dharmic, anti-Hindu, and=\r\n anti-human fallacy that is not supported by the scriptures of Sanatana Dha=\r\nrma, and that has repeatedly led to Sanatana Dharma being wrongly accused o=\r\nf being backward and unjust.  Sanatana Dharma is neither.\n\nIf we, as Hindus=\r\n, refuse to vociferously denounce such ludicrous and anti-Dharmic theories =\r\nas the caste system within our own ranks, then we have lost all rights to d=\r\nenounce those anti-Hindu bigots who, in turn, wish to tarnish our religion =\r\nwith unfounded stereotypes.  If we support bigotry against our very own peo=\r\nple, then we must fully expect to become the victims of bigotry ourselves. =\r\n Such is the nature of karma.  If we wish to be treated justly, then we mus=\r\nt treat others with justice.  Let us be worthy of our Dharmic heritage and =\r\nend all caste-based bigotry against our fellow Hindus now.\n\nI would urge an=\r\nyone who considers themselves to be Hindu, who has any modicum of pride in =\r\nour religion, or who cares in any way about preserving Sanatana Dharma to d=\r\nenounce the anti-Hindu caste system once and for all, and to support the ba=\r\nnning of all caste discrimination globally.\n\nPlease read the news article b=\r\nelow for more information.\n\n\n\nUN Set to Treat Caste as Human Rights Violati=\r\non\nTimes of India\nManoj Mitta, TNN 28 September 2009, 06:10am IST\n\nhttp://t=\r\nimesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/india/UN-set-to-treat-caste-as-human-rights=\r\n-violation/articleshow/5063457.cms\n\nNEW DELHI: If the recent genome study d=\r\nenying the Aryan-Dravidian divide has established the antiquity of caste se=\r\ngregations in marriage, the ongoing session of the UN Human Rights Council =\r\nin Geneva looks set to recognize caste-based discrimination as a human righ=\r\nts violation. This, despite India&#39;s opposition and following Nepal&#39;s breaki=\r\nng ranks on the culturally sensitive issue.\n\nNepal has emerged as the first=\r\n country from South Asia -- the region where untouchability has been tradit=\r\nionally practiced -- to declare support for the draft principles and guidel=\r\nines published by UNHRC four months ago for ``effective elimination of disc=\r\nrimination based on work and descent&#39;&#39; -- the UN terminology for caste ineq=\r\nuities.\n\nIn a side-event to the session on September 16, Nepalese minister =\r\nJeet Bahadur Darjee Gautam said his county welcomed the idea mooted by the =\r\nUNHRC document to involve ``regional and international mechanism, the UN an=\r\nd its organs&#39;&#39; to complement national efforts to combat caste discriminatio=\r\nn. This is radically different from India&#39;s stated aversion to the internat=\r\nionalization of the caste problem.\n\nMuch to India&#39;s embarrassment, Nepal&#39;s =\r\nstatement evoked an immediate endorsement from the office of the UN high co=\r\nmmissioner for human rights, Navanethem Pillay, a South African Tamil. Besi=\r\ndes calling Nepal&#39;s support ``a significant step by a country grappling wit=\r\nh this entrenched problem itself&#39;&#39;, Pillay&#39;s office said it would ``like to=\r\n encourage other states to follow this commendable example&#39;&#39;.\n\nThe referenc=\r\ne to India was unmistakable especially since Pillay had pressed the issue d=\r\nuring her visit to New Delhi in March. Pillay not only asked India to addre=\r\nss ``its own challenges nationally, but show leadership in combating caste-=\r\nbased discrimination globally&#39;&#39;. The granddaughter of an indentured laboure=\r\nr taken to South Africa from a village near Madurai, Pillay recalled that i=\r\nn 2006, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had compared untouchability to aparth=\r\neid.\n\nAdding to India&#39;s discomfiture, Sweden, in its capacity as the presid=\r\nent of the Europeon Union, said, ``caste-based discrimination and other for=\r\nms of discrimination based on work and descent is an important priority for=\r\n EU&#39;&#39;. If this issue continues to gather momentum, UNHRC may in a future se=\r\nssion adopt the draft principles and guidelines and, to impart greater lega=\r\nl force, send them for adoption to the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe draft prin=\r\nciples specifically cited caste as one of the grounds on which more than 20=\r\n0 million people in the world suffer discrimination. ``This type of discrim=\r\nination is typically associated with the notion of purity and pollution and=\r\n practices of untouchability, and is deeply rooted in societies and culture=\r\ns where this discrimination is practiced,&#39;&#39; it said.\n\nThough India succeede=\r\nd in its efforts to keep caste out of the resolution adopted by the 2001 Du=\r\nrban conference on racism, the issue has since re-emerged in a different gu=\r\nise, without getting drawn into the debate over where caste and race are an=\r\nalogous.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\nSanatana Dharma Jayate!\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/www.dharmacentral.com\nhttp://twitter.com/SriAcharyaji\nhttp://www.youtube.c=\r\nom/DharmaNation\n\n\nPlease forward this important message to all Hindu Dharma=\r\n related discussion groups, forums, websites and blogs.\n\n\n"}}
