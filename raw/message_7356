Ramu Setty and Smt.Muniammal,\nwould take me for Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s d=\r\narshan.\n\nThus I started visiting the Maharshi right from my childhood. Bein=\r\ng a native\nof Tiruvannamaiai,it was my great good fortune that I was able t=\r\no have\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s darshan till His Mahasamadhi in 1950.\n\nWhen Bhaga=\r\nvan was staying at Virupaksha Cave, devotees would come to town\nsinging Aks=\r\nharamanamalai. We would eagerly wait for their arrival to offer\nthem cooked=\r\n food. Only after such offering would we eat. This continued\nwithout a day=\r\n=E2=80=99s break till Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mother started cooking at Skandash=\r\nram.\nOur house was open to devotees of Bhagavan at all times.\n\nEven while B=\r\nhagavan was at Virupaksha Cave, occasionally we used to go there\nand offer =\r\nbiksha. On one such occasion the leaf-plates we had brought were\njust enoug=\r\nh for the devotees present and there was none for me. Being young,\nI starte=\r\nd crying. Bhagavan called me and coming to know the reason, consoled\nme by =\r\nproviding me with a leaf. Bhagavan understood a child=E2=80=99s feelings, a=\r\nnd\nHe has been gracious to me throughout my life!\n\nIt was Bhagavan who intr=\r\noduced me into religious texts. Once Bhagavan wrote\nthe first verse of Daks=\r\nhinamurti Stotra on a slip of paper and told me to\nlearn it by heart and re=\r\npeat it on my next visit.Thus I learnt the\nDakshinamurti Stotra. I would of=\r\nten forget the first word of a verse and\nBhagavan would help me. Then writi=\r\nng down the first word of each verse of\nDakshinamurti Stotra, Bhagavan gave=\r\n me the slip of paper to help remember\nthe sequence.\n\nOn the first of each =\r\nTamil month I would go round the Hill along with my\nmother, and on the way =\r\nwe would walk into the Ashram to pay homage to\nBhagavan who would receive u=\r\ns with a smile and sometimes ask us to take\nbreakfast. Once, when as usual =\r\ntwo iddlies were served on my plate, I asked\nfor one more.\n\nBhagavan turned=\r\n to me and said that I could have one more after eating the\ntwo. When I had=\r\n finished eating them, Bhagavan asked whether I would like to\nhave more, an=\r\nd I replied No. Bhagavan, said with a smile: Why did you ask\nfor more even =\r\nbefore starting to eat? Thus Bhagavan taught the lesson that\none should not=\r\n be greedy.\n\nWhen my mother passed away, I went to the Ashram to convey the=\r\n news to\nBhagavan. Bhagavan graciously looked at me and relieved me of my i=\r\nntense\ngrief.Bhagavan smilingly told me that my mother was as old as his st=\r\nay at\nArunachala.
