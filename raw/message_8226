When he was 15, Milarepa&#39;s mother demanded that he =\r\nvisit a certain sorcerer and learn black magic to extract revenge.  If he d=\r\nidn&#39;t do her bidding, she threatened to kill herself in front of him.\n\nTo u=\r\nnderstand Milarepa&#39;s story at all, we have to imagine a culture where famil=\r\ny honor was more important than life itself.  Where a human incarnation was=\r\n held to be infinitely precious, and your mother was revered as the chief g=\r\niver of this gift.  Where allowing harm to come to your mother if you had t=\r\nhe power to prevent it was an unimaginable sin.\n\nMilarepa chose to obey his=\r\n mother.  He went to the sorcerer and learned a complex practice that allow=\r\ned him to invoke spirts who pulled down the stone house where his uncle&#39;s f=\r\namily was celebrating a wedding.  Thirty-five people were in the house.  Ir=\r\nonically, only the aunt and uncle survived.\n\nAll hell broke loose.  The rel=\r\natives of the dead were furious and gave chase.  Milarepa barely escaped pu=\r\nrsuit, but he couldn&#39;t escape his own conscience or the negative karma for =\r\n33 murders that was sure to land him in Buddhist hells for quite a few inca=\r\nrnations.  His sorcerer contact advised him to seek out a famous guru named=\r\n Marpa.  When he heard the name, a thrill went through Milarepa, as if a gl=\r\nimpse of his destiny had just opened up.  The night before he arrived, the =\r\nguru dreamed of someone very special coming into his life.  Though he insta=\r\nntly recognized Milarepa&#39;s potential, he also saw the dark karma and knew t=\r\nhe boy would have to work it out before anything else could take place.\n\nMi=\r\nlarepa asked for initiation into spiritual practice, but Marpa refused, say=\r\ning such treasures were not for someone as &quot;worthless&quot; as he.  Instead, he =\r\ntold Milarepa to move a stone tower to another location three miles away.  =\r\nIt took Milarepa three years to carry the rocks on his back.  Marpa looked =\r\nat his work, scratched his chin, and said, &quot;You know what?  I think I liked=\r\n it better at the first location.  Move it back.&quot;\n\nAt that point, most of u=\r\ns would probably run away, but Milarepa did what he was told.  In those day=\r\ns, spiritual seekers sometimes endured great hardships and life-threatening=\r\n journeys for spiritual instruction.  It was all right; for a Guru like Mar=\r\npa would never wind up on the news with charges of fraud or scandal. Marpa =\r\nhimself was the disciple of Naropa, another legendary Indian Buddhist yogi,=\r\n mystic and monk.\n\nMilarepa toiled for twelve years before receiving spirit=\r\nual initiation.  After that, he undertook an eleven month retreat in a seal=\r\ned cave with only a butter lamp for light, and a little slot where someone =\r\npassed him one meal a day.  Later he moved to another remote cave where he =\r\nlived on nothing but nettles and local vegetation.  He looked like a living=\r\n skeleton, but there he attained final awakening.  \n\nMilarepa&#39;s tale assert=\r\ns that no one is beyond redemption once they sincerely turn in that directi=\r\non.\n\n*   *    *\n\nNaturally many miracles are associated with Milarepa. Once=\r\n Milarepa had placed his open hand against the cave&#39;s wall (where he medita=\r\nted) at about shoulder level . . . and then continued to push his hand fart=\r\nher into the rock in front of him, as if the wall did not exist! When he di=\r\nd so, the stone beneath his palms became soft and malleable, leaving the de=\r\nep impression of his hand for all to see=85\n\nMilarepa believed that he and =\r\nthe rock are not separate. His meditation taught him that he was a part of =\r\nthe rock, and everything else too, and therefore his hand could pass into/t=\r\nhrough the rock!\n\n*   *    *\n\nAfter becoming a Jeevanmukta, Milarepa would =\r\nroam around the villages composing spontaneous poems. A few lines from one =\r\nof his poetry follows:\n\n&quot;May I be far removed from contending creeds and do=\r\ngmas.\nEver since my Lord&#39;s grace entered my mind,\nMy mind has never strayed=\r\n to seek such distractions.\nAccustomed long to contemplating love and compa=\r\nssion,\nI have forgotten all difference between myself and others.\nAccustome=\r\nd long to meditating on my Guru as enhaloed over my head,\nI have forgotten =\r\nall those who rule by power and prestige.\nAccustomed long to meditating on =\r\nmy guardian deities as inseparable from myself,\nI have forgotten the lowly =\r\nfleshly form.\nAccustomed long to meditating on the secret whispered truths,=\r\n\nI have forgotten all that is said in written or printed books.\nAccustomed,=\r\n as I have been, to the study of the eternal Truth,\nI&#39;ve lost all knowledge=\r\n of ignorance.\nAccustomed, as I&#39;ve been, to contemplating both nirvana and =\r\nsamsara as inherent in myself,\nI have forgotten to think of hope and fear.\n=\r\nAccustomed, as I&#39;ve been, to meditating on this life and the next as one,\nI=\r\n have forgotten the dread of birth and death.\nAccustomed long to studying, =\r\nby myself, my own experiences,\nI have forgotten the need to seek the opinio=\r\nns of friends and brethren.\nAccustomed long to applying each new experience=\r\n to my own spiritual growth,\nI have forgotten all creeds and dogmas.\nAccust=\r\nomed long to meditating on the Unborn, the Indestructible, the Unchanging,\n=\r\nI have forgotten all definitions of this or that particular goal.\nAccustome=\r\nd long to meditating on all visible phenomena as the Dharmakaya,\nI have for=\r\ngotten all meditations on what is produced by the mind.\nAccustomed long to =\r\nkeeping my mind in the uncreated state of freedom,\nI have forgotten all con=\r\nventions and artificialities.\nAccustomed long to humbleness, of body and mi=\r\nnd,\nI have forgotten the pride and haughty manner of the mighty.\nAccustomed=\r\n long to regarding my fleshly body as my hermitage,\nI have forgotten the ea=\r\nse and comfort of retreats and monasteries.\nAccustomed long to knowing the =\r\nmeaning of the Wordless,\nI have forgotten the way to trace the roots of ver=\r\nbs, and the\nsources of words and phrases.\nYou, 0 learned one, may trace out=\r\n these things in your books\n[if you wish].\n\n&quot;My religion is not Buddhism. M=\r\ny religion is to live and die without regret.&quot; =96 Jetsun (meaning revered)=\r\n Milarepa.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
