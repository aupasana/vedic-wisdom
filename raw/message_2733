Kundalini remaining in sahasraara forever is moksha.=\r\n\n \nThe four internal instruments (antahkaranas) are manas, buddhi, ahamkaar=\r\na and chitta.\n \nManas (sensory-motor mind) lies in manomaya kosha (the ment=\r\nal sheath) and buddhi (intellectual/discriminating mind) lies in the vijnaa=\r\nnamaya kosha (the knowledge sheath). These two sheaths, along with the praa=\r\nnamaya kosha (the vitality sheath) form the so-called sookshma sareera (sub=\r\ntle body). Now, apart from the gross physical body and subtle body, there i=\r\ns a causal body (kaarana sareera). This contains the fifth sheath called aa=\r\nnandamaya kosha (the bliss sheath).\n \nThe antahkaranas that lie in this lay=\r\ner are chitta and ahamkaara. Chitta (conditioned/remembering mind) stores a=\r\nll previous observations of manas and judgments of buddhi and retrieves the=\r\nm when needed. What is stored to/retrieved from chitta is based on I-ness o=\r\nr ahamkaara.\n \nPlease note that ahamkaara and chitta influence each other. =\r\nWhile one&#39;s I-ness influences which experiences are added to the layer of c=\r\nonditioning in chitta, also the mental conditioning represented by chitta i=\r\nnfluences what entity one can identify with. If there is too much heavy con=\r\nditioning, one&#39;s ahamkaara cannot rise above the five elements and one cann=\r\not identify with a deity for example.\n \nNormally ahamkaara or I-ness binds =\r\nitself to an entity that has several dense properties. If chitta becomes li=\r\nghter and one can make ahamkaara bind to something with lighter and lighter=\r\n properties and if one finally succeeds in making ahamkaara not bind itself=\r\n to anything, i.e. one has no I-ness, then one is established in Brahman wi=\r\nthout a sense of &quot;this is I&quot;, &quot;this is something else&quot; etc. This is nirvika=\r\nlpa samadhi. However, at that stage, the other properties of the previously=\r\n individualized consciousness still remain, e.g. 5 jnaanendriyas, 5 karmend=\r\nriyas, 5 praanas, manas, buddhi and chitta. However, ahamkaara is not ident=\r\nifying with *anything*, not even with a manifested deity or some energy, an=\r\nd hence one is established in Brahman.\n \nSome conditioning may still be lef=\r\nt in chitta when one&#39;s Kundalini reaches sahasraara. It may have been subtl=\r\ne enough to let ahamkaara become silent and not identify with any entity fo=\r\nr a while. But it may not be empty yet and suddenly it may spring into acti=\r\non and not let ahamkaara remain silent anymore. So some thought may be retr=\r\nived from the conditioned mind and that may provoke the silenced ahamkaara =\r\ninto returning to action. One may come out of samadhi and regain individual=\r\nization.\n \nDRAM (dynamic random access memory) used in computers needs to b=\r\ne refreshed now and then. Otherwise, data in it is erased. If the CPU is ac=\r\ncessing DRAM now and then and refreshing it, the data stays there. If CPU d=\r\noes not access the data for too long, then the data is erased. Similarly, i=\r\nf one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi long enough, all the conditioning in chit=\r\nta is erased. Then one becomes free. If one stayed in nirvikalpa samadhi fo=\r\nr a little time, it makes chitta lighter but not empty.\n \nTo give a simple =\r\nanalogy, imagine ahamkaara to be the CPU of a computer. Imagine chitta to b=\r\ne the DRAM (memory). Imagine buddhi to be the ALU (arithmetic and logical u=\r\nnit) of the CPU. Imagine manas to be the I/O (input/output) interface unit.=\r\n Though imperfect, this analogy will help you understand the basics well.\n =\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\nhomam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nnnath.org\n-----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n \n---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t have the book at the moment but it is my impression that the c=\r\nhapter indicated that the souls in the suvarna lokas have earlier reached t=\r\nhe state of what we call &quot;Kundalini rised to Sahsraar Chakra&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; i haven=\r\n&#39;t given a correct idea in my earlier message when i wrote &quot;...the souls wh=\r\no depart from Sahsraar...&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; So i again repeat my query - Kundalini rea=\r\nching and established in Sahasraar chakra is *Final Realisation - complete =\r\nmoksha from all bonds* or still there needs to pass through some still high=\r\ner realm (say for instance Suvarna loka) to workout Karan Shareer/Aanandama=\r\nya Kosha. \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal   \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpalji,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Nice query. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Logically speaking, it maybe that=\r\n &quot;soul leaving the body&quot; has does not mean mearging once self awareness int=\r\no the Brahman. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Th=\r\nu, 1/10/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: vedi=\r\nc_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creati=\r\non, Physics & Reality\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursd=\r\nay, 1 October, 2009, 10:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pra=\r\nnaams,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiated consciousness (B=\r\nrahman or &gt;Aatman),where there are no I-ness or any objectification. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Does it mean that when consciousness reaches Sahasraar Chakra, one merg=\r\nes in to Brahman and that is the same state which is named varyingly as Rea=\r\nlisation/ Jeevan Mukta/Nirvikalpa Samaadhi/Merging in to brahaman etc...?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why i asked you this question is because, i am little confused here=\r\n. if i remember correctly, in &quot;Auto Biography of a Yogi&quot;, it is mentioned t=\r\nhat only the souls who depart from Sahsraar are eligible to enter to Suvarn=\r\naa loka and then there they have to still work out the bondage of their Kar=\r\nana Shareera...\n&gt; &gt; Is it not true that Chetana reaching Sahsraar means *pr=\r\nactically* end of journey.?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How to reconcile with the above to see=\r\nmingly different informations?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am only addressing the five elements men=\r\ntioned in upanishads.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Sahasrara chakra lies undifferentiate=\r\nd consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), where there are no I-ness or any objec=\r\ntification.

It seems to=\r\n be his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya=\r\n Upanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar with. Other scripture=\r\ns refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; , where=\r\n Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Ra=\r\nma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic unders=\r\ntanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The f=\r\nive chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent=\r\n ether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, ear=\r\nth element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are =\r\neffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, wat=\r\ner element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are =\r\neffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By earth a=\r\nnd water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Ea=\r\nrth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexibl=\r\ne and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a part=\r\nicular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid =\r\nstate and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thin=\r\ng (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of wat=\r\ner element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the =\r\nfive elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thi=\r\nnks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart fr=\r\nom the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qua=\r\nlities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has a=\r\nbout who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that se=\r\nlf-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* tha=\r\nt is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still =\r\nremaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* tha=\r\nt is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one i=\r\ns is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk =\r\nabout experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking merely a=\r\nbout some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may still be a n=\r\nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. =\r\nIF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body=\r\n, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini mov=\r\nes up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who =\r\none is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existence! To comple=\r\ntely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even =\r\nfor a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\norder in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - =\r\nearth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced e=\r\nlements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and e=\r\narth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and=\r\n spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross =\r\nphysical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind ca=\r\nn &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which =\r\none&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In=\r\n another example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus=\r\n and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be pe=\r\nrceived by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern scienc=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something tha=\r\nt can be perceived by the external senses, because different people can exp=\r\nerience the same reality using their senses individually and verify the obs=\r\nervation. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by=\r\n senses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and some=\r\ntimes liberating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is =\r\na big drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginat=\r\nions or hallucinations, because there is no independent validation, and cal=\r\nl them unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For e=\r\nxample, see the following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In th=\r\ne above message, one person had a specific yogic experience that was descri=\r\nbed in detail and another person seemed to know about it and supplied one t=\r\nangible detail relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed=\r\n&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external sen=\r\nses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a specific yogic experience=\r\n that was described in detail and another person seemed to know about it an=\r\nd supplied a couple of tangible details relating to the experience, suggest=\r\ning that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it wa=\r\ns beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interna=\r\nl god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message,=\r\n one person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another p=\r\nerson perceived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity,=\r\n though others in the room could not perceive anything with their external =\r\nsenses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the =\r\nfirst person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perha=\r\nps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external =\r\nsenses are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe=\r\n. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cann=\r\not be measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;rea=\r\nlity&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern scienc=\r\ne study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied=\r\n and measured is the reality involving the gross body and its senses, one m=\r\nay suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing =\r\nvarious parts of the gross physical body. For example, one can look at the =\r\nnervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain and try to corre=\r\nlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On =\r\nthe surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body =\r\nand causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondence between =\r\nwhat happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many m=\r\napping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of causal an=\r\nd subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderle=\r\nd using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a ne=\r\nighborhood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea o=\r\nf what is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and m=\r\nany cars parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular hou=\r\nse with no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what =\r\nis going on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are=\r\n doing etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signals in various points of the br=\r\nain, you may be able to see some basic things, but not much. The experience=\r\ns of the subtle mind are beyond your reach and study, if your tools are lim=\r\nited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality=\r\n which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yog=\r\nis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While ri=\r\nshis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the micro=\r\ncosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, even t=\r\nhe greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. When Kund=\r\nalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of the In=\r\nfinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes and exa=\r\nctly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have=\r\n a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tar=\r\npana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diar=\r\nies of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) -=\r\n it maybe of some help to you. He did mention in details about the process =\r\nof creation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at the begin=\r\nning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of=\r\n Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some univer=\r\nsal energies which are more commonly known as the universal deities like Sh=\r\niva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the=\r\n actual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence of the element=\r\n, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with=\r\n the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agn=\r\ni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and each one resul=\r\nting in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible =\r\nstates of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (a=\r\nt least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel there may be some correla=\r\ntion between that and the 11-dimensional physics of super string theory too=\r\n, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice idea =\r\nand I would like to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as=\r\n I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetr=\r\nate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half fo=\r\nrmed. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by mu=\r\nltiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many whi=\r\nch &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding =\r\na correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble =\r\nopinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between ba=\r\nsic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-local=\r\nity etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of =\r\npanch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permissio=\r\nn of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how exactly you can link th=\r\nese two, because I myself with my limited understand fail to see any viable=\r\n correlation at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a ve=\r\nry nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think a=\r\nbout is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe real=\r\nity? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathem=\r\natics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as rea=\r\nlity is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted tha=\r\nt everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it reall=\r\ny is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation =\r\nis almost the essence of everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there =\r\nwould be really nothing more left to do. Physics is still quite far away fr=\r\nom that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostude=\r\nnt@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Not sure if I get the thrust of your point.
