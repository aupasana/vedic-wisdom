My mother passed\n=\r\naway when I was very young. My father left my younger sister, Shantabai,\nwi=\r\nth his sister-in-law Azhagulakshmi who was settled in Tiruvannamalai. When\n=\r\nmy sister was four years old she was afflicted with polio. My father took\nh=\r\ner to Madras and put her under the care of an expert Ayurvedic doctor who\nt=\r\nreated her for six months. After this she was able to walk aided by a\nspeci=\r\nally designed brace.\n\nMy aunt and my father took Shantabai to Bhagavan and =\r\ntearfully told Bhagavan\nthat thereafter the child was his and that he shoul=\r\nd look after her. At that\ntime she was just four. Bhagavan blessed her and =\r\ntold my father not to worry\nabout her future, that she would marry at the a=\r\nge of eighteen and prosper in\nlife. Although these comforting words of Bhag=\r\navan soothed my father yet he\nhad his doubts.\n\nMy sister was again left wit=\r\nh my aunt at Tiruvannamalai. She would visit\nBhagavan daily and play there.=\r\n\n\nOnce there was a cry from the garden and Bhagavan said, &quot;It is Shantabai&#39;=\r\ns\nvoice,&quot; and sent someone to fetch her. My sister was reeling with pain. S=\r\nhe\ncame to Bhagavan crying and said that a bee had stung her hand. Bhagavan=\r\n\ntook her hand and caressed it. Immediately the pain of the sting vanished.=\r\n\n\nBeing innocent the child told Bhagavan, &quot;Why did you make me cry so long?=\r\n If\nyou had wanted it you could have stopped it then and there.&quot; My Aunt wh=\r\no was\nthere at the time was shocked at the audacity of my sister&#39;s complain=\r\nt.\nHowever, Bhagavan smilingly asked what she had done to the bee before it=\r\n\nstung her? She said that she was pelting stones at the mangoes and one of\n=\r\nthe stones disturbed the bee. Bhagavan smilingly said to her, &quot;You see, the=\r\n\nstone you threw hurt the bee and so it stung you. So hereafter never harm\n=\r\nanyone.&quot; Young as she was she understood what Bhagavan meant and thereafter=\r\n\nnever hurt any living being. Later, whenever she recalled this incident, s=\r\nhe\nfelt grateful to Bhagavan for giving her this lesson on non-violence.\n\nL=\r\nater on, as Bhagavan predicted, when Shantabai turned eighteen a boy came\nf=\r\nrom Trichy and after seeing her insisted that he would marry only this\ngirl=\r\n. The marriage went off well and her husband was very kind to her. She\nfelt=\r\n that it was all due to Bhagavan&#39;s blessing.\n\nOnce when my sister was about=\r\n nine she was in Madras. Suddenly she started\ncrying and came and told my f=\r\nather, &quot;Father! Bhagavan appeared to me and\ntook leave of me, saying, `Chil=\r\nd! I am leaving the world but I will always\nbe with you. So do not worry&#39;.&quot;=\r\n Hearing this my father slapped her for\nuttering these inauspicious words. =\r\nBut my sister kept on sobbing and refused\nto have her dinner at night.\n\nEar=\r\nly in the morning my father opened the newspaper and there the\nMahasamadhi =\r\nof Bhagavan was reported. Only then did my father realise the\npurport of my=\r\n sister&#39;s words and realising that she had the blessings of\nBhagavan he nev=\r\ner scolded her again.\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?=\r\npg=3Dmay-jun#article.5\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=\r\n  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=\r\n=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00148501705a114cc5048b8ed521\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nMy father Srinivasa Iyer was a lawyer in the High Court.=C2=A0&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;My mother passed away when I was very young.=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;My father left my younger sis=\r\nter, Shantabai, with his sister-in-law Azhagulakshmi who was settled in Tir=\r\nuvannamalai.
