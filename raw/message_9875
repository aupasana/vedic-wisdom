You can try and see for yourself. That is one example. Ther=\r\ne are others too.\n\nNeither the soul nor the Self can be possessed by imagin=\r\nation. Else, every great imaginative artist would have automatically come c=\r\nlose to realization of the soul and/.or the Self. If the mind itself is lef=\r\nt far behind when one really comes close to either the soul or the Self, wh=\r\nat instrument will be used for the imagination?\n\nHaving said that, I agree =\r\nthat psychological *placebos* can often help to cure various problems, spec=\r\nially of a mental nature.

Everyone,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I just thought of =\r\nadding some clarifications.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;First of all, when I mentioned about=\r\n the utility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for=\r\n handling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other problems =\r\nfor which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited=\r\n to the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about wh=\r\nether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about an=\r\nything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the=\r\n THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sen=\r\nse of the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still contin=\r\nue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. =\r\nThough we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but =\r\nit is the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=A0in =\r\nthe east&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we kee=\r\np on continuing with activities which\n helps in keeping life go on...It is =\r\nin this sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regres=\r\nsion&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside a sea just=\r\n by standing at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities. When we =\r\nsay that the God is infinite, we just can not say that the universe can beh=\r\nave in any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about the utilit=\r\ny of any branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincere dip into th=\r\ne same. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one really takes a =\r\nsincere dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced about the sa=\r\nme.=C2=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere=\r\n dip, I just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would prevent oneself fr=\r\nom being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in religion and relig=\r\nious practices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in science if one lo=\r\nses the scientific temper.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all=\r\n that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their problems. &quot;H=\r\nypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=C2=A0those=\r\n who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind.

Jainas used this=\r\n technique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the followers.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that=C2=A0so far as my kno=\r\nwledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, but howe=\r\nver, there are so many problems which can be handled even over phone. To ci=\r\nte one example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recurrent bad horrifying drea=\r\nm for past 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for the treatment.=C2=A0But=\r\n due to my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off place for a=\r\nround 2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsened as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 =\r\nstarted affecting her professional career adversely. So having left with no=\r\n choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone session conti=\r\nnued for around one and half an hour and she got relieved from her that rec=\r\nurrent dream and also started improving her professional life. Since that d=\r\nay the dream has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;It all depends on th=\r\ne openness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The uni=\r\nverse is much more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe=\r\n to see.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, October 26, 20=\r\n13 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;=\r\nNamaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our unders=\r\ntanding of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more proble=\r\nms. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific m=\r\noments from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external con=\r\nsciousness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any o=\r\npportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot b=\r\ne recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get disso=\r\nlved and new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Buddhists do not beli=\r\neve in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar t=\r\no our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very diffe=\r\nrent. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces toge=\r\nther\n to give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get d=\r\nisintegrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of=\r\n these can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other =\r\nparts can simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a differen=\r\nt part. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reinca=\r\nrnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body whi=\r\nle another part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously=\r\n*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, whi=\r\nle his energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body =\r\nincarnating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fi=\r\nts with their philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this ki=\r\nnd of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of ene=\r\nrgy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnaband=\r\nhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this=\r\n is to get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - S=\r\nhunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence=\r\n the tendency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its proces=\r\nses.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that =\r\nis not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from o=\r\nne life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and d=\r\nevelop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a hum=\r\nan mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individ=\r\nual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth fin=\r\nally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and e=\r\nnjoy a Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate ai=\r\nm, it is only one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a st=\r\nate \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable ai=\r\nm, then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex =\r\nlife-actions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to onl=\r\ny an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandh=\r\nana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl=\r\n and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equa=\r\ntions immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time al=\r\ngorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of=\r\n people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to act=\r\nually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had k=\r\nilled]. Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no sco=\r\npe of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical =\r\ngive and take of energy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and =\r\neverything else being perishable, the only indestructible link between past=\r\n life and present life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled,=\r\n and never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing=\r\n. Now if there have been lives when the soul had little or no frontal role =\r\nto play at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet under with=\r\n no trace.

I am sure there too one can find goo=\r\nd exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little know=\r\nledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever trie=\r\nd any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a pa=\r\nrticular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent pot=\r\nency for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, kn=\r\nown as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the=\r\n one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be foun=\r\nd in the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child=\r\n Bhairava has been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor tr=\r\naditions for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of c=\r\nremation ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variati=\r\nons of this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad =\r\nUddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10=\r\n/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be con=\r\ntinued daily till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thi=\r\nng is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as =\r\nfar as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any =\r\nexorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrifi=\r\nc shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in=\r\n front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close fa=\r\nmily members, who live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go=\r\n through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of d=\r\noing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may =\r\nnot be that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, then I have a sugg=\r\nestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either =\r\nthe Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to=\r\n the main priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, ma=\r\nny excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind =\r\nof negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and the=\r\nn ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a spe=\r\ncific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I kn=\r\now have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other=\r\n methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n he=\r\nlps.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee=\r\n in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee =\r\nlike a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_jam=\r\nnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sen=\r\nt: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ma=\r\nntra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are various classes and=\r\n kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual and some of th=\r\nem can be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many different=\r\n people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whe=\r\nther any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depends o=\r\nn multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all =\r\ndepends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and=\r\n what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the =\r\nroot, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the perso=\r\nn.\n Sometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting somewhere (where =\r\nthis being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and being=\r\n susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, o=\r\nr in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to =\r\nan individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one s=\r\ntop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the=\r\n shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help a=\r\nre able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit o=\r\nf a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying =\r\nto remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not =\r\nfall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is g=\r\netting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay=\r\n away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n han=\r\ndle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time ti=\r\nll which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of t=\r\nhe individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve s=\r\nome not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spi=\r\nrit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular indi=\r\nvidual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before star=\r\nting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as w=\r\nell as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per =\r\nthe previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would s=\r\nit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own f=\r\nree will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to re=\r\nmove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is =\r\nof a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing t=\r\no do is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possessi=\r\non and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask fa=\r\nmily members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kal=\r\ni, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - a=\r\nnd do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means=\r\n, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree =\r\nof possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana w=\r\nith the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the v=\r\nery end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and =\r\nthen either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on=\r\n him/her.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  cr=\r\neaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different e=\r\nnergies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rath=\r\ner evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would mak=\r\ne up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but =\r\nonce I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up i=\r\nn a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some=\r\n steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantl=\r\ny become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be tha=\r\nt spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more peo=\r\nple staying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so =\r\nit&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram a=\r\nt that place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able t=\r\no sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I =\r\nstarted waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some shor=\r\nt beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once t=\r\nhe sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefu=\r\nlly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kin=\r\nds of astral beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sl=\r\neep. This has been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my=\r\n life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\r\n--2124734478-1227857393-1382991571=:44994\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Dear Ajit,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have a small point to make here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;&lt;Doesn&#39;t all sadhana belong in the same bucket?

There are things beyond the m=\r\nind, beyond imagination - impossible for the normal mind to imagine - and t=\r\nhat too comes to a Yogi at some stage. Of course, as I said, that is not an=\r\n initial stage. And for most people, this initial stage continues for long,=\r\n even lifetimes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a simple example, one cannot imagine or self hyp=\r\nnotize or pep-talk oneself into a state of Absolutely thoughtless Silence a=\r\nnd the things that can happen in Perfect Silence of the mind. You can try a=\r\nnd see for yourself. That is one example. There are others too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neit=\r\nher the soul nor the Self can be possessed by imagination. Else, every grea=\r\nt imaginative artist would have automatically come close to realization of =\r\nthe soul and/.or the Self. If the mind itself is left far behind when one\n =\r\nreally comes close to either the soul or the Self, what instrument will be =\r\nused for the imagination?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said that, I agree that psychologic=\r\nal *placebos* can often help to cure various problems, specially of a menta=\r\nl nature.

Everyone,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I just thought of adding some clarifications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;First of all, when I mentioned about =\r\nthe utility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for =\r\nhandling the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other problems f=\r\nor which we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited =\r\nto\n the utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about wh=\r\nether past life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about an=\r\nything whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the=\r\n THAT...The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sen=\r\nse of the term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still contin=\r\nue with life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. =\r\nThough we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but =\r\nit is the other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises&nbsp;in =\r\nthe east&quot;, &quot;Sun&nbsp;sets&nbsp;in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we kee=\r\np on continuing with activities which helps in keeping life go on...It is i=\r\nn this sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regress=\r\nion&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;One should not=\r\n comment about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life =\r\nis full of infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we=\r\n just can not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited wa=\r\nys. Before anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=\r\n&nbsp;must first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not m=\r\nean to say that if&nbsp;one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one=\r\n would definitely be convinced about the same.&nbsp;By saying that one shou=\r\nldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that&nb=\r\nsp;by doing so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not o=\r\nnly&nbsp;blind belief in religion and religious practices&nbsp;can be terme=\r\nd as dogmatic but also in\n science if one loses the scientific temper.&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proof of pudding is in eat=\r\ning it, all that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their p=\r\nroblems. &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=\r\n&nbsp;those who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind=\r\n. Those who are interested can read &quot; Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Wei=\r\nss&quot; to start with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;T=\r\no respected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are not &quot;new a=\r\nge ideas&quot;. These were there much before in India.\n to cite concept of &quot;Jaat=\r\ni Smaran&quot; of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this technique of &quot;Jaat=\r\ni Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the\n followers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform th=\r\nat&nbsp;so far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be d=\r\none over phone, but however, there are so many problems which can be handle=\r\nd even over phone. To cite one example - One girl was having&nbsp;one recur=\r\nrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she&nbsp;approached me for=\r\n the treatment.&nbsp;But due to my&nbsp;official engagements I was camping =\r\nat a far off place for around 2 months.&nbsp;Her problem was getting worsen=\r\ned as it&nbsp;had&nbsp; started affecting her professional career adversely=\r\n. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone.=\r\n The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she got re=\r\nlieved from her that recurrent dream\n and also started improving her\n profe=\r\nssional life. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It all depends on the openn=\r\ness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe i=\r\ns much more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to see=\r\n.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none=\r\n&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Ar=\r\nial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-fam=\r\nily:HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, san=\r\ns-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=\r\n On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofoll=\r\now&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; w=\r\nrote:&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size=\r\n:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\nNamaste,&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;To add to the complexity of t=\r\nhe problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simpli=\r\nfied and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the s=\r\noul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a =\r\nrole to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a =\r\nlife where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and s=\r\nhine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process=\r\n. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need=\r\n.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in th=\r\ne existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our ide=\r\na of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. It =\r\nis like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to =\r\ngive the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegra=\r\nted and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these ca=\r\nn coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can=\r\n simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &=\r\nnbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, =\r\nto have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anothe=\r\nr part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a=\r\n Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his en=\r\nergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnati=\r\nng in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with t=\r\nheir philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those philosophies =\r\nwhich believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only =\r\nas a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balan=\r\nces - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. =\r\nThe final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move in=\r\nto a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of an=\r\ny final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciati=\r\non of life and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But th=\r\ne old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved=\r\n at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to anoth=\r\ner and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul=\r\n&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body veh=\r\nicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique s=\r\noul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to=\r\n *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Li=\r\nfe.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimat=\r\ne aim, it is only one among many possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; moving into =\r\na state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitabl=\r\ne aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform com=\r\nplex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, but it is not rest=\r\nricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the ide=\r\na of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the s=\r\noul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes th=\r\ne karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and=\r\n real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kille=\r\nd hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did no=\r\nt have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of t=\r\nhose he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the =\r\nsoul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rn=\r\nabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-color:transparent;font-fami=\r\nly:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-col=\r\nor:transparent;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being perishab=\r\nle, the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it is =\r\nonly the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cinemati=\r\nc biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been lives=\r\n when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those are=\r\n dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace.\n For Nature, those =\r\nlives\n serve no purpose at all. &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-color:transparent;font-fami=\r\nly:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n=\r\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-col=\r\nor:transparent;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts l=\r\niving in and through the soul in a very very strong manner.
