I try to Penn down as below:\n\n1=\r\n) In &quot;Autobiography of A Yogi&quot;, if i remember correctly, Its mentioned that=\r\n once Mahaavatar Babaji wished to dissolve the body i.e. physical form but =\r\nhe was advised not to do so by his divine Sister and then Babaji said that =\r\nIts a *DIVINE WISH* which has come out from the sister and so he would stay=\r\n till the end of this yuga.\n\n2) Vimalananda has categorically emphasized th=\r\nat the Final Boss is a certain Senior Rishi who is in the centre of Rishi M=\r\nandala and he controls the Adhya Shakti and hence control the complete crea=\r\ntion\n\n3) Ramakrishna used to tell one story to his gatherings - Once Krishn=\r\na took Arjuna in some other realm to show him some wonder. Both came at som=\r\ne place where Arujan saw a gigantic tree and countless fruits hangning on t=\r\nhe tree. Krishna asked Arjuna to just take a closer look at it and he was a=\r\nstonished to see the fruits were actually as many Krishnas. Krishna then to=\r\nld Arjuna that this is tree called Brahma in which produces many Krishna.\n\n=\r\nThe above 3 were the exact thoughts came one after the other in my mind. I =\r\nwas trying to synthesize and derive the essence of all these thoughts. Only=\r\n one common thing i could gather is that, there is ONE POWER HOUSE - The so=\r\nurce of all which is recognized by very very High divine beings like Shri K=\r\nrishna, Ramakrishna, Mahaavtar Babaji, Vimalananda and such many others. Vi=\r\nshnu, Brahma and Shiva and all the other we think of including ourselves ar=\r\ne from that source. The whole creation including all universes known and un=\r\nknown along with their Gods are from that single source.   \n\nI do not know =\r\nif my message was relevant to the topic but some how I thought that way. Su=\r\npra-conscious ness probably is one more stage in the hierarchy wherein your=\r\n divinity is raised to such highest level wherein the Power house called Br=\r\nahman provides you with option of retaining a *divine physical body* as lon=\r\ng as one desires or probably as per Brahman&#39;s desire while at the same time=\r\n retaining the Brahman consciousness. I have actually come round to Narasim=\r\nha&#39;s view and probably that seems to be the highest state which we one can =\r\nlook up to, which is probably Supra-consciousness of Aurobindo and which wa=\r\ns achieved by Krishna, Mahaavatar Babaji and such others. \n\nBest Regards,\n\n=\r\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks for this mail. Now, I understand better w=\r\nhere you coming from!\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; it could only be your imagination that I have=\r\n any sympathies for him\n&gt;  \n&gt; Quite possible and my apologies if so.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis question was asked because you were trying to compare apples with orang=\r\nes\n&gt;  \n&gt; Well, it is more like comparing sweet apples to gross (and yet col=\r\norful) worms.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All scriptures such as Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishads =\r\ntell us that self-realization is the only worthy goal of sadhana and that o=\r\nther abilities, siddhis and attainments are useless and not worth pursuing.=\r\n As I mentioned earlier, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa proposed to give some sidd=\r\nhis to Vivekananda and the latter rejected them because they would not help=\r\n him in realizing god. Siddhis and other abilities that come without a cons=\r\ncious pursuit can be accepted with neither excitement nor regret, but they =\r\nare not worth pursuing consciously.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see any reason, why an =\r\nafterlife would bring me\n&gt; &gt; greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt;  \n&gt; No, t=\r\nhis is not an issue of afterlife. One can do sadhana and realize Self even =\r\nwhen alive and then live as a jeevanmukta flowing with divine will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; T=\r\nhe bottomline is that as long as ego and individual will are present, one i=\r\ns moved by the force of individual will and stuck in the game of actions an=\r\nd reactions. Once they are effaced, one flows with divine will and is out o=\r\nf the game of actions and reactions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience=\r\n is not different from Ananda,\n&gt; &gt; and Physical body not different from Chi=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance wit=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbecause its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn about\n&gt; &gt; all t=\r\nhe achievements made by all those we can know of, irrespective\n&gt; &gt; of their=\r\n being recognized as good or bad\n&gt;  \n&gt; First of all, Ravana is NOT an examp=\r\nle of the attainment of the &quot;highest ideal of Aurobindo&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s=\r\n ideals have been misunderstood by many learned people to mean that he was =\r\nstriving for physical immortality. He sadly ended up attracting some wrong =\r\npeople that way.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is possible to remove the distinction between man=\r\nifested things and Brahman and view them as non-different. But that state i=\r\ns not attainable by even great yogis. Moreover, that state is not achieved =\r\nby actively pursuing it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The best course of action for any sadhaka is=\r\n to ignore the physical form, overcome the fascination for it and its needs=\r\n, realize the underlying Self and live as a jeevanmukta like a leaf flowing=\r\n in wind. If one is meant to divinize physical form like Mahavatar Babaji h=\r\nas done, divine will will then make one to do so. But, one consciously purs=\r\nuing it is likely to retain fascination for the physical form, not realize =\r\nSelf and get nowhere.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software,=\r\n Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n=\r\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish=\r\n writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- silentadmire=\r\nr_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; One thing is clear tha=\r\nt Ravana is not my kin, thus, it could only be your imagination that I have=\r\n any sympathies for him or Rama. I am amongst the general populace of the w=\r\norld - to me, only the greatness part of the two characters have any meanin=\r\ng, not their faults and fallacies, but I don&#39;t eulogize either of them neit=\r\nher demean them.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am not a philosopher. What I have tried to state=\r\n so far, w.r.t &quot;Success with Mantra&quot; topic, is that No matter how hard one =\r\ntries, Ravanas&#39; or Ramas&#39; achievements in the field of &quot;duality&quot; cannot be =\r\nerased by any amount of &quot;Highest shakti&quot; with or without Ego.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Reaso=\r\nn lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat-chid-ananda as the basis of all plan=\r\nes of existence including Physical plane of existence. Argument of Imperman=\r\nence by Advaitins has not so far been able to erase the world of duality fr=\r\nom existence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the basis of sense-mind, Chit is =\r\nthe basis of Physical consciousness, and Sat is the basis of existence of P=\r\nhysical plane, so lets not argue that there is another reality which is bet=\r\nter and happier than this one, and that this world is a myth. If physical s=\r\nense-experience is fleeting, it is because one has not progressed enough to=\r\n realize why the truth of being is expressed in such a way at this plane of=\r\n existence ?\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different from Anand=\r\na, and Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of a=\r\nbility to manipulate objects in the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot comp=\r\nete with perfect self-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does th=\r\ne &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; This question was a=\r\nsked because you were trying to compare apples with oranges, by saying that=\r\n (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego consciousness, presumin=\r\ng that they act upon each other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Truth of the matter is that Soul i=\r\ns not in competition with ego consciousness ever, because God is never in c=\r\nompetition with his creation !! If a liberated soul wants to take part in a=\r\nn ego competition (Yada Yada hee Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, however=\r\n high, like that of an avatar. Krishna took the wheel of the chariot and tr=\r\nied to kill Bhishma, not without an ego. Other people may differ with me on=\r\n this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased and\n&gt; &gt; O=\r\nTOH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than the last time. I=\r\nt is understandable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent in every mind-set, =\r\nbecause at times, it is not possible to write every little detail for the s=\r\nake of consistency.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But the happiness one gets when one achieves =\r\nsomething in the field &gt; of duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The highe=\r\nst shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is per=\r\nmanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo Ghosh has clearly stated:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;...If the immo=\r\nrtal and infinite spirit has veiled itself in Matter and is emerging, the d=\r\nevelopment of a liberated Supramental being who shall impose in Mind, Life =\r\nand Matter a higher law than that of limitation and Division, is the inevit=\r\nable conclusion from the nature of the cosmic existence. There is no reason=\r\n why such a being should not liberate and make Divine the physical existenc=\r\ne as well as the Mind and Life....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, lets attempt to divinze Phy=\r\nsical form, in accordance with highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaava=\r\ntar babaji has done, because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to =\r\nlearn about all the achievements made by all those we can know of, irrespec=\r\ntive of their being recognized as good or bad by a limited set of people, f=\r\nor a limited duration of time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These are just a few of my views bas=\r\ned on what I have read so far, because I don&#39;t see any reason, why an after=\r\nlife would bring me greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Aryama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You say that &quot;Killing Ravana=\r\n was not a great deed&quot; and yet look at &quot;binding the physical body of both R=\r\nam and Lakshman&quot; as a &quot;great deed&quot;. I see inconsistencies in your views and=\r\n a biased and sympathetic attitutde towards Ravana and his kin. Anyway, I w=\r\nill just make a couple of specific points on shakti, which is a subtle topi=\r\nc and not easy to understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is M=\r\nemory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If memory is extended the longest, the most fundamental =\r\nand first memory should say that one is Brahman. If one&#39;s memory extends th=\r\nat far, that creates the highest Shakti! In other words, self-realization b=\r\nrings the highest shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ?=\r\n Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great question!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any lo=\r\nwer shakti is an ability to perform actions with objects in the field of du=\r\nality. Why does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the field=\r\n of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the other. B=\r\nut the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the field of duali=\r\nty is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the highest bliss=\r\n, i.e. sat-chid-ananda, which is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one is pursuin=\r\ng an individual will, one may be swimming with or against the divine will. =\r\nOne will have some successes and some failures, some pleasures and some pai=\r\nns. When one&#39;s individual will has dropped off and one is flowing with the =\r\nrhythm of the divine will, one is in bliss no matter what one does. One *ca=\r\nn* do anything, but one does only what divine rhythm wills done by one!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Only the fully detached Shiva can beget Shakti in totality and dem=\r\nons like Ravana or Mahisha or Shumbha can only get some trappings of Shakti=\r\n but can never beget Shakti in totality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A demon like Hiranyaka=\r\nshipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a self-realized rishi. It may seem lik=\r\ne the demon has more shakti. But the rishi is in bliss whether he is alive =\r\nor being killed, whether he is at his hermitage or in prison. The happiness=\r\n demons got from their successes were short-lived and ended later. But the =\r\nrishi was in constant bliss. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was superior.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nnstead, just order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do things in th=\r\ne field of duality. Just as you do not give important work to irresponsible=\r\n people, any level of shakti never goes to people who do not know how to ha=\r\nndle that level of shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a rishi wanted, he could&#39;ve =\r\nsummoned Rudra to finish off Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a rishi is in b=\r\nliss no matter what and does not break divine rhythm. If Sita, Rama and Han=\r\numan have to come to earth and establish certain lessons for future and tak=\r\ne care of Ravana, a rishi will let that happen and not do anything hasty.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free J=\r\nyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for=\r\n short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;si=\r\nlentadmirer_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defea=\r\nted and killed Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Ravana had done that 10 times himself, beheading his own head, but the sha=\r\nkti of his sadhana was such that he got a new head every time to continue t=\r\nhe sadhana. On a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death o=\r\nf Physical consciousness, so even that part is not in the hands of a mortal=\r\n Physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Ravana above Rama in sha=\r\nkti, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your understanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nn a mundane level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti only afte=\r\nr he was reminded of it. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra vid=\r\nya because of the curse of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to=\r\n remember the series of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully, irre=\r\nspective of the doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not b=\r\ny the association with Rama. Ravana didn&#39;t have perfect memory, else he wou=\r\nld have attempted to kill Vibhishana sooner than later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\n use of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of both Ram and La=\r\nkshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, because even the motherly =\r\nlove of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a rope. Meghnaad was son of=\r\n Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Garuda using divine powers, the r=\r\nesult would have been different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhi=\r\nshana revealing the secrets, it was impossible to kill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even a high level of understanding of the field of duality and even &gt;=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the field of du=\r\nality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. =\r\nThe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; latter represents the highest shakti and Lord Rama had it.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti=\r\n ? Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ? Instead, j=\r\nust order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; E=\r\ngolessness is not a shakti, but a quality of Soul consciousness, in the sam=\r\ne manner as Ego is a quality of Physical creation. It reveals a manner of o=\r\nperating harmoniously with Nature, without creating conflicts, something th=\r\nat Ravana didn&#39;t know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much pur=\r\nity is enough and for what purpose ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different levels o=\r\nf purity can generate different results (and traps!),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on on=\r\ne&#39;s background.

L=\r\nord Hanuman had a perfect\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender to Rama and said that all his=\r\n power came to him due to his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devotion to Lord Rama.

The latter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; represents the highest=\r\n shakti and Lord Rama had it. Ravana was a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka who had =\r\na very high level of mastery over the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but his s=\r\nelf-control was lacking.

It is a conti=\r\nnuum. As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer and increases self-control, one may =\r\nget some results. Thus, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person still afflicted by undesirable=\r\n conditioning may acquire enough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity to get some results. Bu=\r\nt, people like Ravana, Hiranyakashipu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc fell in the end!\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I called &quot;purity&quot; can also be called &quot;self-control&quot;. Both are =\r\nnot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender of slaves is not the =\r\nsurrender I am talking about when I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; talk about surrender to god=\r\n. The instinct of self-preservation is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; another aspect of ego. A=\r\n person with ego and pride may suppress pride\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and self-importan=\r\nce out of no choice, for self-preservation. If one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a=\r\n chance to exert one&#39;s pride without sacrificing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-preservat=\r\nion, one may still do so. This is conditional surrender.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the=\r\n case of god also, surrendering to god when one&#39;s life is a mess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and one is helpless may still be conditional surrender. But, when the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender is unconditional and one sees god as the controller of a=\r\nll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any conditions attached, irrespective of whether lif=\r\ne is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or bad, one becomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-co=\r\nntrol become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A powerless person =\r\nmay also become angry. But, as you said, his anger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is powerless=\r\n to do much harm. As one&#39;s self-control increases, one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tenden=\r\ncy to become angry comes down. That increases one&#39;s power. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrson who has a perfect self-control like Shiva is infinitely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; po=\r\nwerful. From where we are to there, there is a continuum.
