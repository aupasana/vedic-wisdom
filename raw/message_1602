It just contin=\r\nues the cycle.\n&gt; But what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, it woul=\r\nd any way\n&gt; continue which ever path one choses, dharma or adharma.\n \nWitho=\r\nut discharging one&#39;s dharma, Nature will not allow one to attain moksha. Mo=\r\nksha (liberation) is attained when one is free from desires, attachments, a=\r\nttractions and aversions. As long as there are some karmik debts that need =\r\nto be settled, Nature will keep some attractions and some aversions alive i=\r\nn the person and keep one away from liberation. Thus, there is a big differ=\r\nence between following dharma and not following dharma. While following one=\r\n&#39;s dharma does not guarantee liberation, not following one&#39;s dharma does gu=\r\narantee not getting liberated and keeps liberation further away.\n \nThe key =\r\nto making spiritual progress is to follow one&#39;s dharma, without identifying=\r\n with the actions too much. If one fulfils one&#39;s dharma but identifies with=\r\n the actions strongly (i.e. has the sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot; and feels prou=\r\nd), that creates new karmas and new bondage. Any action or thought performe=\r\nd with a sense of &quot;I&quot; involved in it causes new karmas and new bondage. Eac=\r\nh such action keeps one further away from liberation.\n \nOf course, it is di=\r\nfficult to perform actions without a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;. So, to start=\r\n with, atleast remove an action and its doership from your thoughts once th=\r\ne action is finished. Keep the sense of doership while you do it (because i=\r\nt helps you do it better), but remove it from your mind once the action is =\r\ncomplete. Normally we cling on to the doership of an action for a long time=\r\n and that creates a strong self-identification.\n \nAs an example, suppose yo=\r\nu build a temple. You may do it with a sense of &quot;*I* am doing some importan=\r\nt work&quot; while the building work is going on, because that thought and resul=\r\ntant attachment motivates you overcome problems. But, once the temple is fi=\r\nnished, learn to say &quot;krishnaarpanamastu&quot; (surrendered to the Lord) and thi=\r\nnk no more of it as your work or your &quot;achievement&quot;. If people praise you f=\r\nor the great thing you have done, learn to not dwell on it mentally and not=\r\n feel proud. There may be no need to demonstrate your humility by lecturing=\r\n or saying something, but, you can just smile and keep your mind from dwell=\r\ning on that compliment and feeling proud.\n \nWe cling on to our good and bad=\r\n actions for too long, by thinking of them (&quot;I did it&quot;) for too long. If we=\r\n learn to cut off doership in the mind once the action is finished, that is=\r\n a great starting point. The next step is to not have the sense of &quot;I am do=\r\ning it&quot; even as one is doing it.\n \nIf one engages in actions without attach=\r\nment and without a sense of ownership/doership, one stops accumulating new =\r\nkarmas (new burden). As that happens, one&#39;s conscience becomes stronger and=\r\n tells one of one&#39;s dharma clearer and louder. That enables one to unload t=\r\nhe existing karmik burdens (perform correct dharma) without picking up new =\r\nburdens (no new actions with self-identification). That takes one closer to=\r\n liberation.\n \nThus, I emphasize detached action. Being able to engage in a=\r\nction with very little (or no) attachment and sense of doership is more imp=\r\nortant and urgent than finding out what one&#39;s dharma is and discharging it.=\r\n\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; that is what his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked him to d=\r\no\n \nNot every &quot;guru&quot; will have a perfect idea of what one&#39;s dharma is. As I=\r\n said, &quot;If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into one&#39;s i=\r\nnner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance&quot;. After all, one&#39;s dharma =\r\ndepends on what actions one engaged in in the past lives while identifying =\r\nwith the actions, what karmik debts were created and what mental conditioni=\r\nng was created. Those things can be known with certainty only by a guru who=\r\n is self-realized.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; When a terrorist is doing a su=\r\nicide attack he may just be doing his dharma.\n \nThat is theoretically possi=\r\nble, but very unlikely. One who kills tens or hundreds or thousands of peop=\r\nle with a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;, &quot;I am taking revenge&quot;, &quot;I am punishing =\r\nthem&quot;, &quot;I will go to heaven because of it&quot; is doing an action with a strong=\r\n self-identification. Whether this act is expected from one by Nature as a =\r\nresult of previous karmik debts to the victims or not is unknowable, but wh=\r\nat we can know for sure is that this person has created new karma and new d=\r\nebts. Any action performed with self-identification causes new karma, new d=\r\nebts and new bondage. The bondage will pull him in a future life into situa=\r\ntions where one will be paid those debts back.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBTW,=\r\n the article of Robert Svoboda given earlier can also be accessed at the fo=\r\nllowing &quot;tiny&quot; URL (thanks to Kishore for creating it):\n \nhttp://tinyurl.co=\r\nm/dblc6a\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\ntarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------- \n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi na=\r\nndy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:=\r\n21 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Nice article on dharma by Robert Svobod=\r\na\n\n\n        Namaste\n\n        I read Svoboda&#39;s article and I had a few quest=\r\nion. Theoritcal but relevant.\n\n        He has given the idea of of terroris=\r\nts. When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his dha=\r\nrma. That is what he maybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is what hi=\r\ns &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked him to do, and that is what his ideals/principles/=\r\nbooks maybe asked of him to do. So from teh point of view of dharma, how ca=\r\nn he be blamed? Therefore, the statement taht &quot;Dharmo rakshati rakshitah..&quot;=\r\n, does not make sense. How is his dharma protecting him? What is he getting=\r\n in return, other than a bag load of strong karmas to fend off at a later d=\r\nate, when he may not even be aware why he has this karmas.\n\n        Can the=\r\nre is conflicting Dharmas for one person? Or more important vs less importa=\r\nnt dharma? Swadharma should be situational. Sant Tulsidas&#39;s  broader dharma=\r\n may have been realizing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should have bee=\r\nn to keep his wife happy. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can ever full perfor=\r\nm every dharma that is expected of us. \n\n        I believe the reason this =\r\nidea of Dharma was existent in ancient times, was mostly because nature has=\r\n created various kinds of people, each with varying tendencies. This idea o=\r\nf Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or the best way to tell men that we are=\r\n all different and yet we are not incorrect in anyway. This is much better =\r\nthan the new ages philosophies which outright deny reality and claim everyt=\r\nhing and everyone is born equal. It is not so.\n\n        The word religion i=\r\ns a 13 century invention and, etymologically, and inherently competitive in=\r\n nature. Unlike Dharma.\n\n        Also, as Narasimhaji&#39;s mail shows correctl=\r\ny, following Dharma is no gaurantee of anything, least of all Moksha. It ju=\r\nst continues the cycle. But what is the big deal in continuinng the cycle, =\r\nit would any way continue which ever path one choses, dharma or adharma. \n\n=\r\n        A much better way of conduction life, I feel, is maknig a mental no=\r\nte of Karma. To know teh simple truth that that which goes out will come ba=\r\nck to you and that, if you had not been bad at some point, nothing bad will=\r\n ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a life based=\r\n on and being on the right side of karma, is much easier and profitable  th=\r\nan trying to find that elusive dharma which anyway won&#39;t help one in the lo=\r\nng run.\n\n        Just my feeling on the subject.\n\n        -Regards\n        =\r\n Rajarshi\n\n        --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

The time then was such that there was too much weight \n    =\r\n      &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tre=\r\nmendous \n          &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroy=\r\ned to a great extent, \n          &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone fo=\r\nr it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \n          &gt; it was his dharma to facil=\r\nitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \n          &gt; respected were on =\r\nthe other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n          &gt; \n          &gt;=\r\n When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of \n       =\r\n   &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in=\r\n a \n          &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was d=\r\nifferent in this \n          &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce m=\r\naterial life despite his \n          &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the =\r\nsimple life of a monk and inspire \n          &gt; generations to embrace a sim=\r\nple life of mental detachment and service to \n          &gt; others. When he i=\r\ns born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n          &gt; said), =\r\nhis dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n          &gt; \n=\r\n          &gt; *        *        *\n          &gt; \n          &gt; The tricky questio=\r\nn is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n          &gt; \n          &gt; So=\r\nme people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n=\r\n          &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though =\r\nthe concept \n          &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a =\r\nlong time, the concept of \n          &gt; caste mobility was very much there. =\r\nValmiki was a shudra who lived by \n          &gt; killing birds. He became a b=\r\nrahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n          &gt; kshatrita and =\r\na powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \n          &gt; later=\r\n. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \n    =\r\n      &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As =\r\none \n          &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what o=\r\nne does.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s =\r\nwords which tells you to know your \n          &gt; dharma from your caste is w=\r\nrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n          &gt; the world. Eac=\r\nh person has individual dharma.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s=\r\n dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n          &gt; enough,=\r\n one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n     =\r\n     &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot=\r\n of \n          &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell other thing=\r\ns. Thus, we get \n          &gt; confused.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; We should m=\r\nake the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \n         =\r\n &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but doing=\r\n \n          &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n          &gt; \n         =\r\n &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in=\r\n \n          &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we =\r\nare not \n          &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.=\r\n We should not build \n          &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing.=\r\n We should engage in the best \n          &gt; possible actions (based on our b=\r\nest judgment on what our dharma in the given \n          &gt; situation is), wi=\r\nth as little attachment and self-identification with the \n          &gt; actio=\r\nn as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result \n   =\r\n       &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;w=\r\nill it \n          &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfic=\r\nation through \n          &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and pur=\r\nify our consciousness slowly. \n          &gt; As we become purer, our mind wil=\r\nl work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n          &gt; There is a positiv=\r\ne feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n          &gt; dharma =\r\nclearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, \n    =\r\n      &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; The =\r\nbottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n =\r\n         &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in act=\r\nion with \n          &gt; little attachment.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n          &gt; \n          &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intelle=\r\nct and intuition are the inputs. \n          &gt; Another external input is the=\r\n words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n          &gt; derive one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n          &gt; mas=\r\nter. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of \n  =\r\n        &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n   =\r\n       &gt; \n          &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was an=\r\nd thought killing gurus \n          &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a=\r\n guru in Krishna who clarified his \n          &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (=\r\nSwami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n          &gt; and wanted to=\r\n renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n          &gt; =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the materia=\r\nl \n          &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n          &gt; \n      =\r\n    &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what=\r\n one&#39;s \n          &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in t=\r\nhe judgment of what \n          &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an eleva=\r\nted soul with a clear insight into \n          &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a gu=\r\nru can give perfect guidance.\n          &gt; \n          &gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n          &gt; \n          &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a=\r\n set of principles and \n          &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma =\r\nchanges from person to person, from \n          &gt; time to time and from plac=\r\ne to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \n          &gt; out what one=\r\n&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n          &gt;=\r\n dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual =\r\n\n          &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions withou=\r\nt much \n          &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine on=\r\ne&#39;s understanding of \n          &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n          &gt; \n   =\r\n       &gt; Best regards,\n          &gt; Narasimha\n          &gt; ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n          &gt; Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          &gt; Do Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          &gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          &gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          =\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n        =\r\n  &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- \n          &gt; \n          &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n          &gt; From:=\r\n &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n          &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com&gt;\n          &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n   =\r\n       &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n          &gt; \n          &gt;&gt; Namaste t=\r\no all\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n          =\r\n&gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n          &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is ver=\r\ny personal.\n          &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we ap=\r\nproach\n          &gt;&gt; towards it\n          &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something wit=\r\nh vedas and upanishads\n          &gt;&gt;\n          &gt;&gt; regards\n          &gt;&gt; jiten=\r\nder \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_023B_01C9B7CD.E3E2F390\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: smal=\r\nler; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: center 50=\r\n%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62px; =\r\nBORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 62px;=\r\n BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV=\r\n.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hover {\n=\r\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none=\r\n\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.at=\r\ntach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING=\r\n-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\nP SP=\r\nAN {\n\tCOLOR: #628c2a\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.a=\r\nttach-table DIV.attach-row DIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-=\r\ntable DIV.attach-row DIV DIV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-ti=\r\ntle {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp=\r\n{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  =\r\npadding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp=\r\n #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-heigh=\r\nt: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#yg=\r\nrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: 0 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-dec=\r\noration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=\r\n=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&gt; Also, as Narasimhaji&#39;s mail shows correctly, \nfollowing Dha=\r\nrma is no&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; guarantee of a=\r\nnything, least of all Moksha.

Moksha (liberation) is attained when=\r\n one is free \nfrom desires, attachments, attractions and aversions. As long=\r\n as there are some \nkarmik debts that need to be settled, Nature will keep =\r\nsome attractions and some \naversions alive in the person and keep one away =\r\nfrom liberation. Thus, there is \na big difference between following dharma =\r\nand not following dharma. While \nfollowing one&#39;s dharma does not guarantee =\r\nliberation, &lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM&gt; following \none&#39;s dharma does guarantee &lt;EM&gt;not&lt;/EM=\r\n&gt; getting liberated and keeps liberation \nfurther away.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The key to making spiritual progress is to follow one&#39;s dh=\r\narma, without \nidentifying with the actions too much. If one fulfils one&#39;s =\r\ndharma but \nidentifies with the actions strongly (i.e. has the sense of &quot;I =\r\nam doing it&quot; and \nfeels proud), that creates new karmas and new bondage. An=\r\ny action or thought \nperformed with a sense of &quot;I&quot; involved in it causes ne=\r\nw karmas and new bondage. \nEach such action keeps one further away from lib=\r\neration.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Of course, it is difficult to perform=\r\n actions without a sense of &quot;I am \ndoing it&quot;. So, to start with, atleast re=\r\nmove an action and its doership from \nyour thoughts &lt;EM&gt;once&lt;/EM&gt; the actio=\r\nn is finished. Keep the sense of doership \nwhile you do it (because it help=\r\ns you do it better), but remove it from your \nmind once the action is compl=\r\nete. Normally we cling on to the doership of an \naction for a long time and=\r\n that creates a strong self-identification.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As=\r\n an example, suppose you build a temple. You may do it with a \nsense&nbsp;o=\r\nf &quot;*I* am doing some important work&quot; while the building work is \ngoing on, =\r\nbecause that thought and resultant attachment motivates you overcome \nprobl=\r\nems. But, once the temple is finished,&nbsp;learn to say \n&quot;krishnaarpanamas=\r\ntu&quot; (surrendered to the Lord)&nbsp;and think no more of it as \nyour work or=\r\n your &quot;achievement&quot;. If people praise you for the great thing you \nhave don=\r\ne, learn to not dwell on it mentally and not feel proud. There may be no \nn=\r\need to demonstrate your humility by lecturing or saying something, but, you=\r\n can \njust smile and keep your mind from dwelling on that compliment and fe=\r\neling \nproud.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We cling on to our good and bad =\r\nactions for too long, by thinking of them \n(&quot;I did it&quot;) for too long. If we=\r\n learn to cut off doership in the mind once the \naction is finished, that i=\r\ns a great starting point. The next step is to not have \nthe sense of &quot;I am =\r\ndoing it&quot; even as one is doing it.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If one enga=\r\nges in actions without attachment and without a sense of \nownership/doershi=\r\np, one stops accumulating new karmas (new burden). As that \nhappens, one&#39;s =\r\nconscience becomes stronger and tells one of one&#39;s dharma clearer \nand loud=\r\ner. That enables one to unload the existing karmik burdens (perform \ncorrec=\r\nt dharma) without picking up new burdens (no new actions with \nself-identif=\r\nication). That takes one closer to liberation.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Thus, I emphasize detached action. Being able to engage in action with \n&lt;E=\r\nM&gt;very little &lt;/EM&gt;(or no)&nbsp;attachment and sense of doership is more \ni=\r\nmportant and urgent than finding out what one&#39;s dharma is and discharging \n=\r\nit.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt is what his &quot;gurus&quot; \nmay have asked him to do&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Not=\r\n every &quot;guru&quot; will have a perfect idea of what \none&#39;s dharma is.

After all, one&#39;s dharma depends on what actions one engaged \nin in t=\r\nhe past lives while identifying with the actions, what karmik debts were \nc=\r\nreated and what mental conditioning was created. Those things can be known =\r\nwith \ncertainty only by a guru who is self-realized.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&gt; When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he \nmay just be doing his =\r\n&lt;EM&gt;dharma&lt;/EM&gt;.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;That is theoretically possible, bu=\r\nt very unlikely. \nOne who kills tens or hundreds or thousands of people wit=\r\nh a sense of &quot;I am \ndoing it&quot;, &quot;I am taking revenge&quot;, &quot;I am punishing them&quot;=\r\n, &quot;I will go to heaven \nbecause of it&quot; is doing an action with a strong sel=\r\nf-identification.

So from teh point of view of dharma,=\r\n how can he be \n        blamed? Therefore, the statement taht &quot;&lt;EM&gt;Dharmo r=\r\nakshati \n        rakshitah&lt;/EM&gt;..&quot;, does not make sense. How is his dharma =\r\nprotecting \n        him?

Krishna clearly says in \n          &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to \n        =\r\n  follow someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Following the \n =\r\n         path of dharma basically means engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n   =\r\n       action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to=\r\n \n          time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what =\r\nnature \n          expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; which in turn is based on who =\r\nyou have been \n          in the past, what actions you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; did in the =\r\npast while \n          identifying with the action, who you affected in the =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; past \n          (and how) with the actions that you identified wit=\r\nh, what debts you \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; created in the process, and what ment=\r\nal tendencies you \n          accumulated until &lt;BR&gt;&gt; now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; If, based on one&#39;s \n          mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature=\r\n wants a person &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to \n          kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;=\r\ns dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n          mental &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tendencies and karm=\r\nic debts, nature wants a person to \n          spread the message of &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; uniformity of all religions, that \n          becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, ba=\r\nsed on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mental tendencies \n          and karmic debts, nature=\r\n wants a person to spread the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ritual \n          of homam in the wo=\r\nrld, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ment=\r\nal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to \n          make a =\r\nlot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes \n          one&#39;s=\r\n dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; The \n          dharma of a being may change from one life to another.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s=\r\n dharma to \n          kill his gurus, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; elders and relatives. The ti=\r\nme then was such \n          that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on eart=\r\nh and nature wanted \n          earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremend=\r\nous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; destruction \n          was to take place and civilization dest=\r\nroyed to a great extent, \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set t=\r\nhe tone for it. Arjuna being a \n          great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it was hi=\r\ns dharma to facilitate that. Some \n          people he deeply loved and &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; respected were on the other side \n          and it was his dharma to =\r\nkill them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When the same \n          Arjuna was born again =\r\nin the 19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; =\r\ns sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in \n          a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; previou=\r\ns life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was \n          different in =\r\nthis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce \n          materi=\r\nal life despite his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live \n          th=\r\ne simple life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; generations to embrace \n      =\r\n    a simple life of mental detachment and service to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; others. \n   =\r\n       When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n   =\r\n       &lt;BR&gt;&gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be \n     =\r\n     something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The \n          tricky question is: How does one decide wha=\r\nt is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some people have interpreted=\r\n Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow \n          your own dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and not=\r\n someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light \n          of castism. Though the conc=\r\nept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of caste (varna) has been \n          there in Hinduism for a l=\r\nong time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; caste \n          mobility was very much t=\r\nhere. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; killing birds. =\r\nHe became a brahmana and a maharshi later. \n          Vishwamitra was a &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a \n          brahmana and an=\r\nd a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; later. Basically varna shows \n          one&#39;s aptitud=\r\ne. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of father, \n          because tha=\r\nt is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          develo=\r\nps in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one \n          does.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words \n          whi=\r\nch tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. \n      =\r\n    Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the world. Each \n   =\r\n       person has individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s \n =\r\n         dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eno=\r\nugh, \n          one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a par=\r\nt of our \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it =\r\nis surrounded \n          by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; noise from other parts of our=\r\n minds which tell \n          other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; confused.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; We \n          should make the best judgment combining disc=\r\nrimination and intuition \n          and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; decide what is our dharma =\r\nand follow it sincerely. We may \n          err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the best=\r\n we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; More than follow=\r\ning dharma, what is of utmost importance is \n          to engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; actions without identification. *That* alone \n          ensures that we a=\r\nre not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not \n          increasing the=\r\n load. We should not build &lt;BR&gt;&gt; too much attachment \n          to what =\r\nwe are doing. We should engage in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible \n          act=\r\nions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given \n         =\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; situation is), with as little attachment and \n          self-iden=\r\ntification with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; action as possible. When the \n          action=\r\n is finished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to god. We \n          sho=\r\nuld not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n      =\r\n    work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n =\r\n         &lt;BR&gt;&gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our \n=\r\n          consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As we become purer, our mind will =\r\nwork \n          sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a po=\r\nsitive \n          feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; dharma \n          clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. =\r\nThis is not easy, \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; but not as difficult as people think.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The \n          bottomline is: Even if one is not followin=\r\ng one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense \n          of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets=\r\n refined with time if one engages \n          in action with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; little=\r\n attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In \n          deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition=\r\n are the inputs. \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Another external input is the words of=\r\n scriptures and learned \n          men. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; derive one&#39;s dharm=\r\na from them. A special place \n          is given to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; master. If one surrenders to a \n          spiritual master, one can take =\r\nthe words of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the master to \n          determine one&#39;s dharma and f=\r\nollow it sincerely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When \n          Arjuna was confused ab=\r\nout what his dharma was and thought killing \n          gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and r=\r\nelatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna \n          who clarified =\r\nhis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami \n          Vivekananda) was c=\r\nonfused about his dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and wanted to \n          renounce the wor=\r\nld and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the \n          materi=\r\nal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one \n       =\r\n   is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can \n=\r\n          err in the judgment of what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s gu=\r\nru is \n          an elevated soul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one&#39;s =\r\ninner core, \n          such a guru can give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n          *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Bottom=\r\nline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles \n          a=\r\nnd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from \n          =\r\nperson to person, from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; time to time and from place to place. \n    =\r\n      Also, there are no thumbrules to find &lt;BR&gt;&gt; out what one&#39;s dharma =\r\n\n          is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dh=\r\narma \n          by increasing internal purity.
