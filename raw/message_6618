He starte=\r\nd \nhomam and japam and got two offers within 15 days. He calls it a \n&quot;mirac=\r\nle&quot;.\n\nHe sent me several mails earlier asking for an astrological advice. I=\r\nt \ndid not feel like there was anything I could do and I ignored. He \ndisco=\r\nvered the free homam manuals  and the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, \nderived ins=\r\npiration from the mails there and used the free resources on \nthe homam web=\r\nsite. He saw immediate results.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI know some other peo=\r\nple whose problems were solved after they started \ndoing homam or intense m=\r\neditation. Exactly how much effort is needed \ndepends on the individual cas=\r\ne and the karmas involved. But, things like \nhomam and intense meditation c=\r\nan only help. God either solves one&#39;s \nproblems or creates a situation wher=\r\ne one rises above the problems, i.e. \ndoes not get affected by the problems=\r\n. If one surrenders and worships \ngod in fire, one&#39;s life will be steered b=\r\ny god in the correct direction.\n\nThough people pay too much attention to ma=\r\nny technical details and get \nworried that they may make mistakes, the most=\r\n important thing is \ndevotion and surrender and many technical aspects are =\r\nnegotiable. Many \npeople who never even lit a light in their life before ar=\r\ne now doing \ndaily homam and making brisk progress!\n\n*        *        *\n\nA=\r\n lot of people in serious problems send me their horoscope and ask for \nhel=\r\np. Sadly, I or any astrologer cannot solve their problems. Solving \ntheir p=\r\nroblems is in their own hands!! Irrespective of the exact nature \nof blocki=\r\nng karmas, doing homam or intense meditation can only benefit \none. Though =\r\npeople may think that they need an astrologer to tell them \nwhich deity to =\r\nworship and otherwise bad things can happen, this is an \nunfounded fear.\n\nI=\r\n have studied and experimented with astrology (still do) as well as \nanybod=\r\ny alive today. I can declare with utmost confidence that our \nunderstanding=\r\n is half-baked at best and one cannot rely on astrology for \nlife-changing =\r\ndecisions. On the other hand, one can rely on god. Gods \nlike Ganesha, Kart=\r\nikeya, Vishnu, Krishna, Lakshmi, Shiva, Hanuman, Durga \netc can give any ma=\r\nterial or spiritual results, including moksha. \nWorshipping any of them is =\r\nperfectly safe. Each deity puts a surrendered \ndevotee on the correct path,=\r\n in one&#39;s own way. Each of them is far \nbetter than me or any astrologer al=\r\nive today, for changing your life for \nthe better! Picking a deity based on=\r\n taste and doing homam or intense \nmeditation is faaaaaaar better than appr=\r\noaching astrologers like me for \nastrological advice.\n\n*        *        *\n=\r\n\nIf you are unsure which deity to worship, worship Ganesha with Ganapathi \n=\r\nhomam. It is a superb sadhana to set one&#39;s life on the correct path, \nboth =\r\nmaterially and spiritually. You don&#39;t have to take my word for it. \nThe pro=\r\nof of the pudding is in eating it. Try it yourself for a few \nmonths and se=\r\ne what happens. Your main problem will either be solved or \nyour mental sta=\r\nte will start to change so that the problem&#39;s impact on \nyou is reduced. Yo=\r\nu yourself will see how you are benefiting!\n\nAlso, there are many insightfu=\r\nl and inspiring mails on spiritual sadhana \non vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, whi=\r\nch have inspired many people to do homam \nand other sadhanas. A few mails o=\r\nrganized in a PDF book form by some \nseekers can be downloaded freely at:\n\n=\r\nhttp://tinyurl.com/vedicwisdom\n\nLinks to homam websites again are:\n\nSpecifi=\r\nc Hindu homam rituals:  http://tinyurl.com/homam\nGeneric fire ritual for Hi=\r\nndus and non-Hindus: \nhttp://tinyurl.com/fireritual\n\n*        *        *\n\nD=\r\non&#39;t wait till Mahakala stares in the face. Do some sadhana while this \nbod=\r\ny still has some juice in it. If you are in problems, you have an \nadded in=\r\ncentive to do sadhana. But, even otherwise, consider sadhana. A \nhomam can =\r\nbe done in just 20-30 minutes. Spending 20-30 min worshipping \ngod in fire =\r\neveryday can change your life for the better and transform \nyour personalit=\r\ny completely.\n\nIn fact, it is Mother&#39;s wish that several people should regu=\r\nlarly \nworship various deities in fire again and progress. World is going t=\r\no be \ntransformed drastically in the coming decades, at many levels. One of=\r\n \nthe changes is that thousands of simple people will actually find &quot;god&quot; \n=\r\nusing fire as the medium and show direction to many people around them. \nI =\r\nam fool and don&#39;t know much, but I know this one thing with utmost \nconfide=\r\nnce.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n--------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nHello Narsimha=\r\n ji.\nPranam.\nHomams and japams started and the miracle happened. Yes, I sta=\r\nrted doing \nhomams and japams by following guidelines from your homam websi=\r\nte and \nfrom your emails on Vedic-wisdom list and a real life miracle happe=\r\nned \nfor me. Narsimhaji I bow in front of you. I feel we, whoever, know you=\r\n, \nare so fortunate that we got a Guru like you in this world. You are a \nM=\r\nodern Age Guru who is enlightening us, showing us direction with all \nthe v=\r\nedic knowledge you got. I had known you for your Astrology wisdom \nbut not =\r\nthat much for Vedic knowledge and wisdom. But now I know that in \nthis face=\r\nbook and iphone era we have a Guru who can share Vedas \nknowledge with us a=\r\nnd show us right path in this life sitting here in \nthe US.\n... This dates =\r\nback to last year when my wife found your website over \nthe internet and ca=\r\nme to me saying she found a very easy way of doing \nhomam by ourselves. She=\r\n always thought that for all our day to day \nproblems that we were facing i=\r\nn our life, we should perform some \nhomam/pooja, but we didn=E2=80=99t know=\r\n how to do that. So when I looked at the \nlink she sent to me I told the ge=\r\nntleman who had written this was our \nNarsimha guru, and If he was recommen=\r\nding to do homams and written \nsomething for it, then we should go for it, =\r\nand for the first time we \ndid homam at our home during navratri 2010.\nAs y=\r\nou know I was searching for full time job for last 2 yrs, and had \nfailed 1=\r\n7-18 interviews thus far- I think I had sent you emails a couple \nof times =\r\nseeking some remedies- but you were busy. In 6 or 7 such \ninterviews I reac=\r\nhed close enough to think that I was going to get an \noffer letter but neve=\r\nr got any. ...\nI started searching Vedic astrology mailing list ... I found=\r\n one of your \npostings where you had written about hanuman chalisa and then=\r\n given a \nlink for vedic-wisdom list. I started looking at that list and re=\r\nad \nabout your experience with Manish Pandit, that made me read me many of =\r\n\nyour postings on that list. ... why couldn=E2=80=99t I do intense pooja an=\r\nd \nhomams and nullify that effect. I read your comment to surrender to one =\r\n\ngod and worship him same time everyday with full surrender and do \nhomams.=\r\n I discussed this with my wife and we decided to take the route \nof homam a=\r\nnd japams. We performed one homam and I started chanting \nHanuman Chalisa e=\r\nveryday with full devotion, attention and Surrender. \n...\nI started doing d=\r\naily Hanuman Chalisa. Everyday I do Hanuman Chalisa 5/7 \ntimes daily, and b=\r\nefore starting I think about you, Manish Pandit and Pt \nXX=E2=80=94all thre=\r\ne as my gurus. I start my japam by telling god that if I am \nhonest and sin=\r\ncere, haven=E2=80=99t committed anything wrong, then god should \ncome and l=\r\n help me out. To my surprise just within 15 days, I got 2 \ninterview calls.=\r\n I went and attended interviews. The Interviews went \nwell as always, but t=\r\nhis time I got the JOB OFFERs. Yeah, job offers at \n2 places. It ended my 2=\r\n years of struggle, I couldn=E2=80=99t believe it. I am \nplanning to join o=\r\nne of them next Monday 20 th June. Hence this time it \nwas not your Astrolo=\r\ngy wisdom, it is your vedic wisdom that has helped \nme. I couldn=E2=80=99t =\r\nbelieve what god has given. It was like a miracle.\nNow I am determined that=\r\n I would keep doing homams as and when possible \nbut japam daily for sure f=\r\nor my rest of the life. I am a novice for \nhomams so I am learning these th=\r\nings. I often see your youtube video on \nhomams and try to follow this. I h=\r\nope someday I will get some mastery \nover this and do homams regularly with=\r\nout errors. Your experiences and \nstories with Manish Pandit were very insp=\r\niring throughout this journey. \nYour those real time experiences with Manis=\r\nh were great, they gave me \ncredentials that if Narsimha guru is writing th=\r\nese things then there \nshould be some truth behind this. That inspired me t=\r\nhat if I surrender \nto god, god can help me too and he really helped me.\nTh=\r\nis time I had a material motive behind my homams and japams as I \nwanted to=\r\n get a full time, but I am sure this route will take me more \ntowards spiri=\r\ntuality and some day I would be able to help society and to \nthis world in =\r\nsome way.  ...\n\n"}}
