That would not take &quot;so many hours&quot; or &quot;a lot of \nti=\r\nme&quot;. In fact, one can do it in just 25-30 minutes. Spending half an \nhour e=\r\nveryday need not compromise &quot;learning about his job and career&quot;.\n\nIn fact, =\r\nmost people today complain of being busy and not having any \ntime, but they=\r\n do waste a lot of time in useless gossips, TV and other \ntemporary enterta=\r\ninment that neither enriches nor enlightens one. In \nfact, some of the ente=\r\nrtainment these days drains people&#39;s energy \ninstead of recharging. Compare=\r\nd to it, spending half an hour worshipping \nVishnu in fire is not a drag on=\r\n one&#39;s career and material life.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSpiritual sadhana is=\r\n not a waste of time otherwise spent in material \npursuits, but it focuses =\r\nthe mind better so that one can engage in one&#39;s \nmaterial pursuits better. =\r\nPeople spend 90% of their energy on things \nthat are not in their control -=\r\n either regretting past that is out of \ntheir hands or worrying about futur=\r\ne that is still hazy. As a result, \nthey do not always do the best job they=\r\n can, in the present (which is \nthe only thing in their hands right now!).\n=\r\n\nThe goal of spiritual sadhana is to teach the mind to let go what it \nneed=\r\n not be attached to and focus on its present dharma and karma. That \nis the=\r\n essence of upanishads and BhagavadGita.\n\nSpiritual sadhana burns mental co=\r\nnditioning and brings clarity and focus \nof the mind, which do not compromi=\r\nse one&#39;s material life but improve it.\n\nSadly, corruptions in spiritual con=\r\ncepts in Kali yuga made people see \nspiritual sadhana as an equivalent of r=\r\nenunciation of the material \nworld. That is not true. The goal of spiritual=\r\n sadhana is neither to run \naway from nor to run after, specific material p=\r\nursuits. The goal of \nspiritual sadhana is to engage in the material pursui=\r\nts that are \nrequired based on one&#39;s previous karmas and conditioning, and =\r\nto do so \n*efficiently*. Crying over past that is out of control and worryi=\r\nng over \nfuture that is yet to come, do not make one more efficient. On the=\r\n \ncontrary, they make one inefficient. On the other hand, focusing on the \n=\r\nbest action possible right now and doing it detachedly, will make one \nvery=\r\n efficient. It will help one fulfill one&#39;s dharma and pay off one&#39;s \nkaarmi=\r\nk debts, without incurring too many new debts.\n\nHowever, that efficiency do=\r\nes not come easily and some spiritual sadhana \nis required. There is no min=\r\nimum age limit for gaining this efficiency. \nSo anyone can do spiritual sad=\r\nhana.\n\n*        *        *\n\nNow I will make some generic comments on destin=\r\ny vs free will. These \ncomments are not necessarily about KK.\n\n&gt;&gt; Success n=\r\never depends on your decision. Your own country\n&gt;&gt; or abroad, it comes to y=\r\nou as destined. Rather, you can&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; exercise your discretion here.\n\nSometi=\r\nmes, destiny is too powerful and forces one&#39;s free will in a \nspecific path=\r\n. Sometimes, free will has more scope. In fact, destiny and \nfree will are =\r\nnot different. Yesterday&#39;s free will is today&#39;s destiny \nand today&#39;s free w=\r\nill is tomorrow&#39;s destiny!\n\n&quot;Success never depends on your decision&quot; is wro=\r\nng. Decisions taken at \nimportant kaarmik crossroads CAN and DO impact one&#39;=\r\ns life in future. \nAnybody who believes otherwise is thinking that actions =\r\nof our free will \nhave no consequences. Yes, consequences of an action can =\r\nsometimes come \nafter a life or two, but they can come in the same life too=\r\n.\n\nIf Saturn is in 8th and his dasa comes (or any other such planetary \ncom=\r\nbination), exactly what he gives cannot be fixed by anyone. There are \nseve=\r\nral possibilities and what exactly comes to happen, within the field \nof po=\r\nssibilities, IS dependent on the decisions native has taken until \nnow in t=\r\nhis very life.\n\nAnybody who believes otherwise is dismissing the whole fiel=\r\nd of remedial \nmeasures. If a remedial measure can have a consequence, then=\r\n a decision \non whether to stay in India or go to Dubai does have a consequ=\r\nence.\n\nBottomline: One who has an important decision to make and has a choi=\r\nce \nbetween two drastically different options has to realize that the \ndeci=\r\nsion made WILL impact the journey of one&#39;s life, weigh the \npossibilities, =\r\npros and cons and take the decision after due \ndeliberation.\n\nExercise of f=\r\nree will is not only a privilege, but also a \nresponsibility. If one wants =\r\nto keep the privilege in future (instead of \nbeing forced by destiny&#39;s hand=\r\n and not have a choice), one needs to take \nthe responsibility seriously.\n\n=\r\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=\r\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;rohini_ran=\r\njan@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Very nice response, and quite thoughtfully put, Pravee=\r\nn Agrawal ji!\n&gt;\n&gt; KK seems like a fairly young person (not even experienced=\r\n Saturn&#39;s age \n&gt; and year yet which is 36!) and he is already spending so m=\r\nany hours \n&gt; away from learning about his job and career but doing all thes=\r\ne \n&gt; rituals -- which surely must take a lot of time!\n&gt;\n&gt; Gee, I hope I am =\r\nnot sounding like Rahu&#39;s voice or something like that \n&gt; in the Temple of J=\r\nyotish!\n&gt;\n&gt; Rohiniranjan\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Praveen A=\r\ngrawal &lt;pkumar24@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear KK,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Let me have a say.

Your 10th lord is t=\r\nhe Sun which \n&gt;&gt; represents\n&gt;&gt; government or big corporations.
