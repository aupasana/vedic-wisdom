Thus, the tradition of using this mantra for Saturn is based on the teachings of a maharshi and certainly not a misconception.\n \nI said several times in the past that Veda mantras cannot understood literally. There are layers of meanings. One should trust a rishi&#39;s judgment more than a possibly hasty translation given by a scholar. Understanding Veda mantras requires more than scholarship.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe word aapas (aapo) is normally translated as water. But it can also indicate actions.\n \nMy independent translation of the verse is &quot;may auspicious (sham) actions (aapas) happen (bhavantu) through us (naH) for divine (devIH), i.e. driven by full awareness of the Divine Force running the universe, wishes (abhiShTaye) and protection (pItaye). Contentment (sham) and health and well-being of all kinds (yoH) flow from all directions (abhisravantu) to us (naH).&quot;\n \nSaturn is a personification of the spirit of work in us. Saturn makes us work hard and pay off our kaarmik debts. He is just an impassionate discharger of the law of karma. When one is indebted to a person or a group, one needs to work hard and pay it back. Saturn makes one do that.\n \nThe above mantra is asking for auspicious actions to be taken by one. The actions are to fulfill the divine wishes and bring protection. Divine wishes are the wishes of Nature and not selfish wishes of an individual. One knows it only when one&#39;s individual ego is effaced and one is in tune with the Divine Natural rhythm. One is asking that one should engage in actions to bring protection, that are in tune with the Divine Natural rhythm. As a result, one is asking for contentment, peace, happiness, well-being of all kinds and health to come to one. One is basically asking Nature to guide one to engage in right actions and get health and protection as a result.\n \nBeing the planet of hard work and kaarmik payback, Saturn makes one engage in actions to pay kaarmik debts back. Being tuned to the divine will and rhythm will enable one to engage in the right actions and pay back kaarmik debts without incurring new ones.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPlease feel free to forward this mail to any person or group that may be interested in this topic.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &lt;deleted&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Narasimhaji,\n \nThe Vedic Mantra for Shani is regarded by many as &quot; Sham no devirbhistaya...&quot; however when we look at the literal meaning of the mantra in the Rig Veda 10.9.4 then the translation is given as &quot;may the divine water be propitious to our worship, may they be good for our drinking, may they flow around us, and be our health and safety&quot;\n \nThere is no obvious connection to Shani in the translation unless we make a link between the Western direction with Varuna Devata as the Digpala and Shani.  \n \nIs there is a logic for this mantra to be associated with Shani ?  There are articles on the internet by people from the Arya Samaaj who are angry that this mantra is used for &quot;Shani Graha Shanti&quot; whereas they simply use this mantra for achaman and shuddhi before starting a homam.  \n \nRegards\n \n&lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
