For \nexample since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to =\r\nfive million \nyears ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requ=\r\nirement for \nlong-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - wi=\r\nthout a \ncorresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate.

Simply put, in layman =\r\nterms, our brain \nwould not have reached the size and mass as it is today, =\r\nhad it not been for \ndiet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n\n \nc)=\r\n The gut morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally \nequidi=\r\nstant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores.

I have=\r\n not studied biology or chemistry. So from layman&#39;s point of view, i have u=\r\nnderstood from what others are telling &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) meat especially clogs the=\r\n arteries and sexual reproduction in men is dependent on movement of blood.=\r\n So not only heart that is affected in non veg eaters but also sexual repro=\r\nduction system. this is surprising since non veg foods are supposed to make=\r\n men more rajasic and active. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) for the last 10 years at least the=\r\n chemicals are being used increasingly to make the animals more heavier and=\r\n tasty after cooking. accordingly even fish, prawns, chickens, goats, buffa=\r\nlo are all being fed with food that would make them grow faster and to make=\r\n their flesh tastier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3) people\n all over the world are ignoring suc=\r\nh facts to their own peril.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a born vegetarian and i do not know=\r\n the facts about non veg foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can someone explain the facts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Thanks to everyone,&lt;br&gt;Rajmohan &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntd&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1323044671-1291089944=:3901--\r\n\n"}}
