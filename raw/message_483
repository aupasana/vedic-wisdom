H=\r\ne took\nMaha samadhi in Bombay and his Samadhi is located in Phuskar \nRajast=\r\nhan.\n\nBabaji is also know as Ranchod Dasji Maharaj, Paramhans of Chirtakut =\r\n\nand some more names too. He was a Maharatrian Deshasth brahmin by \nbirth a=\r\nnd was born in Gwailor district in MP.\n\nRanchod Dasji Maharaj name was give=\r\nn to him by his disciples in \nGujarat.\n\nHe may have lived for 700 plus year=\r\ns.\n\nHe ran away from home at a very tender age and was taken up a \ndisciple=\r\n by Bala Krishna Dasji also known as Paihari Baba.\nPaihari baba was also ve=\r\nry releaized, he only drank milk and so the \nname. Paihari Baba was Gujarat=\r\ni by birth but spoke in Hindi.\n\nPaihari Baba lived in Kulu for a long time,=\r\n than in Pushkar, he was \nin Pushkar when the temple of Srinathji was moved=\r\n from Mathura to \nRajasthan. At that time he did a lot of seva of lord Kris=\r\nhna in \nPushkar. \nAfter that he lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. =\r\n\nBabaji also lived in Galtaji for about 12 years and he had the vision \nof =\r\nLord Rama in the same cave, that exists today too.\n\nIt is located a few mil=\r\nes from Jaipur, there are a few temples there \nnear the cave. I have visite=\r\nd this cave too.\n\nFrom Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and than to Kas=\r\nhmir where \nhe lived in a place called &quot;Rasayani Gufa&quot;.\n\nPaihari Baba also =\r\nmay have lived for 500 plus years too.\n\nWhile at Galtaji, the Famous Tulsid=\r\nas maharaj had visited Paihari \nBaba and give a hand written manuscipt of R=\r\namayana.\n\nThey belong to the Ramanandi Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and Godd=\r\ness \nSita devi as ishta devata. Ramanandi Sampardaya came as an offshot of =\r\n\nRamanuja Sampradaya.\n\nBabaji or Ranchod Dasji Maharaj lived for many years=\r\n in Bengal, \nChitrakot and Also visited Gujarat. He also stayed in Kashmir.=\r\n\nOne of the kings of Kashmir was a devout disciple of Paihari Baba.\n\nBoth B=\r\nabaji and Paihari Baba were adept in &quot;kaya kalpa&quot; and they also \nhad strong=\r\n connection with saints located in Tibet.\n\nPaihari Baba used to remain in s=\r\namadhi at a stretch for 2 to 3 years.\nPaihari Baba as a young brahamchari s=\r\nerved also Swami Ramananda in \nKashi.\n\nRanchoddasji Maharaj has samadhi in =\r\nPushkar, A trust in Rajkot, \nGujarat and also in Chitakut too. At these pla=\r\nces they do charitable \nactivities.\n\nRanchoddasji Maharaj had many disciple=\r\ns but he never made anybody his \nsucessor.\n\nA lot of books have been writte=\r\nn by one or two lady disciples of \nRanchoddasji Maharaj and all this inform=\r\nation written here is coming \nfrom those books. these books are avialable i=\r\nn his ashrams. They are \nwritten in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.\n\nThese book=\r\ns describe Ranchoddasji Maharaj&#39;s teachings, his view on \nmany things, his =\r\nshort speeches and kind of like biography.\n\nThese are very good books, they=\r\n describe many aspects of spirtuality \nin simple laymans language.\n\nBabaji =\r\nindicated that Lahiri Mahashaya was his disciple for 5 births\nand in this b=\r\nirth with kriya yoga he cleared all his impressions and \nwas given authorit=\r\ny to guide people and initiate in kriya yoga after \nrelalizing his true nat=\r\nure. Like him he had another disciple in \nBengal too known as &quot;Din bandhu&quot; =\r\nbut I do not have any information on \nhim.\n\nBabaji did meet Shri Yuteshwar =\r\nMaharaj a few times.\n\nHe also indicated that many advanced saints from the =\r\nNath Sampradaya \nalso took birth and followed the ramanandi sampradaya to e=\r\nxperiance \nmore bliss.\n\nMy intent here is to share information and not star=\r\nt any \ncontroversies.\n\nIf anyone needs the names of these books and also th=\r\ne address of \nashrams, I am very happy to provide that too.\n\nIf there is in=\r\nterest in more information than I shall try to write \nmore about the lineag=\r\ne and the prominent saints of the lineage too.\n\nI also have many pictures o=\r\nf Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but am not sure \nhow to load them up for you all to=\r\n see.\n\nHappy Navratri\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n"}}
