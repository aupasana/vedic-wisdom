Seeing the constant concourse of men in the prostitute&#39;s house,\nthe sannyasin one day called her and censured her, saying: &quot;You are a great\nsinner. You sin day and night. Oh, how miserable will be your lot\nhereafter.&quot;\n\nThe poor prostitute became extremely sorry for her misdeeds, and with\ngenuine inward repentance she prayed to God beseeching forgiveness. But as\nprostitution was her profession,she could not easily adopt any other means\nof earning her livelihood. And so, whenever her flesh sinned, she always\nreproached herself with greater contrition of heart and prayed to God more\nand, more for forgiveness.\n\nThe sannyasin saw that his advice had apparently produced no effect upon\nher, and thought, &quot;Let me see how many persons will visit this woman in the\ncourse of her life.&quot; And from that day forward, whenever any person entered\nthe house of the prostitute, the sannyasin counted him by putting a pebble\naside,and in course of time there arose a big heap of pebbles.\n\nOne day the sannyasin said to the prostitute, pointing to the heap: &quot;Woman,\ndon&#39;t you see this heap? Each pebble in it stands for every commission of\nthe deadly sin you have been indulging in since. I advised you last to\ndesist from the evil course. Even now I tell you: Beware of your evil\ndeeds!&quot; The poor wretch began to tremble at the sight of the accumulation of\nher sins, and she prayed to God shedding tears of utter helplessness,\ninwardly repeating, &quot;Lord, wilt Thou not free me from the miserable life\nthat I am leading?&quot; The prayer was heard, and on that very day the angel of\ndeath passed by her house, and she ceased to exist in this world. By the\nstrange will of God, the sannyasin also died on the same day.\n\nThe messengers of Vishnu came down from Heaven and carried the spirit-body\nof the contrite prostitute to the heavenly regions, while the messengers of\nYama bound the spirit of the sannyasin and carried him down to the nether\nworld. The sannyasin, seeing the good luck of the prostitute, cried aloud:\n&quot;Is this the subtle justice of God? I passed all my life in asceticism and\npoverty,and I am carried to hell, while that prostitute,whose life was a\nwhole record of sin, is going to Heaven!&quot;\n\nHearing this, the messengers of Vishnu said: &quot;The decrees of God are always\njust; as you think, so you reap. You passed your life in external show and\nvanity, trying to get honour and fame;and God has given you this. Your heart\nnever sincerely yearned after Him.\n\nThis prostitute earnestly prayed to God day and night, though her body\nsinned all the while. Look at the treatment which your body and her body are\nreceiving from those below. As you never sinned with your body,they have\ndecorated it with flowers and garlands,and are carrying it with music in a\nprocession to consign it to the sacred river. But this prostitute&#39;s body,\nwhich had sinned is being torn to pieces at this moment by vultures and\njackals.\n\nNevertheless, she was pure in heart and is therefore going to the regions of\nthe pure. Your heart was always absorbed in contemplating her sins and thus\nbecame impure. You are therefore going to the regions of the impure. You\nwere the real prostitute, and not she.&quot;\n\nSource: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--0014853dfa8bfdcd3504752a994c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nA SANNYASIN dwelt by the side =\r\nof a temple.There was the house of a harlot in front.
