Faith is needed in religion, bu=\r\nt corruptions do take place and it is useful to question. Blind faith in so=\r\nme things is useful to make progress, but one cannot place blind faith in e=\r\nverything attributed to a religion and shun logic completely. Truth is arri=\r\nved at by a combination of reason and faith. Without faith, only reason can=\r\nnot take one to the highest truths. Without reason, blind faith cannot take=\r\n one to the highest truths, especially if one starts off with faith in wron=\r\ng notions (e.g. one may believe that you reach god if you kill people not b=\r\nelonging to one&#39;s religion).\n=A0\nFortunate is one who finds the right balan=\r\nce between faith and reason, uses reason to find the right notions to place=\r\n faith in and makes quick progress.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n(1) In practical physical terms, cow milk is a simple an=\r\nd nutritious food with plenty of poteins and easy to digest. It is very saa=\r\nttwik and has many useful properties as per ayurveda.\n=A0\nHowever, if you r=\r\neplace cows that live a relaxed lifestyle feeding in open grasslands on gra=\r\nss and leaves with cows that live a hectic and stressful lifestyle in conge=\r\nsted factories feeding on chicken etc, the gunas of milk are considerably d=\r\nifferent. It&#39;s not the same anymore.\n=A0\nA cow can produce more milk than w=\r\nhat is needed by its calf. People in the old days never deprived calves of =\r\nmother&#39;s milk and took milk after the calf was fed. Instead, if one deprive=\r\ns the calf and steals all the milk (like many factories may be doing), that=\r\n karma will follow the milk and go to various people handling, using and co=\r\nnsuming that milk, in different proportions.\n=A0\n(2) Yes, a cloth made of s=\r\nilk carries a lot of negative karma. Putting so many worms in boiling water=\r\n and killing them is negative karma. I feel far more comfortable putting in=\r\n homam fire a cotton cloth made from a tree than putting a silk cloth made =\r\nby killing many worms. Though silk clothes are fashionable in religious cer=\r\nemonies now, one cannot be sure whether this was a custom in ancient times =\r\nor the current silk is a substitute for another kind of cloth made non-viol=\r\nently in ancient times.\n=A0\nWhen people cannot find something that is used =\r\ntraditionally, they try to find a substitute to feel good that they are fol=\r\nlowing the customs. If they do not clearly understand the motivation/ration=\r\nale/spirit behind a custom, they may end up with a bad substitute. For exam=\r\nple, I have seen people decorating idols with nice looking plastic flowers =\r\nand plastic flower garlands. Plastic is a really bad substitute for a real =\r\nflower. People only use them for decorating idols and do not put them in ho=\r\nmam fire, but who knows, people may start offering plastic flowers in homam=\r\n fire after a few hundred years.\n=A0\nLike that, silk clothes may have come =\r\ninto usage as a bad substitute for something else.\n=A0\n(3) Supreme god unde=\r\nrstands everything.\n=A0\nThe purpose of a mantra is not for requesting god f=\r\nor a specific thing. The purpose of a mantra is to stabilize an overactive =\r\nmind and focus it on something. Mind is like a monkey jumping up and down a=\r\nnd running here and there. Mantra is like a rope that ties it to a fixed po=\r\nle (a deity or a focus point). As one tries to focus the mind on a deity/ma=\r\nntra and give up all other thoughts, a moment will come (perhaps after minu=\r\ntes of sadhana or hours or days or years or lives) when mind will let all o=\r\nther thoughts go. Mind will then reverberate with the mantra, with no other=\r\n thoughts in it whatsoever. One forgets oneself completely and gets absorbe=\r\nd in the mantra *fully*. That is when one *experiences* a mantra and a deit=\r\ny.\n=A0\nSuch a thing is possible with any combination of sounds. One can rep=\r\neat &quot;I bow to the holy father&quot; for ever and reach such a state.\n=A0\nHowever=\r\n, depending on the mantra being repeated in the mind and the deity being fo=\r\ncused on, the experience of the mind when the mantra fills the mind and all=\r\n other thoughts cease will be different. Different mantras will give differ=\r\nent experiences. Various deities, their Sanskrit mantras and beejas were ex=\r\nperimented by many great yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. I=\r\nf you want to tie a monkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope =\r\nwas tested before, it may be good to use that rope.\n=A0\nSecondly, arrangeme=\r\nnt of sounds in Sanskrit alphabet has a deep significance and correlation t=\r\no the subtle body. Different sounds are vibrating in different parts of the=\r\n subtle body. Sanskrit alphabet and mantras are constructed beautifully. Wh=\r\nen one&#39;s self-awareness ascends from the regular plane of consciousness, on=\r\ne can experience other realms of consciousness that are vibrating with diff=\r\nerent sounds. Sanskrit captures that well.\n=A0\nThirdly, each tangible artic=\r\nle (such as a book or an email or a mantra) has some remnants of the energy=\r\n of persons who associated with it. When I say a specific combination of wo=\r\nrds, it may have one impact on you. When a saint says the same combination =\r\nof words with the same tone, it may have another impact on you. A sentence =\r\none writes when one is in a bad mood or bad spiritual state may not have an=\r\ny impact on readers. A sentence one writes in a very good state of mind aft=\r\ner a lot of sadhana and control over mind may inspire readers more\n=A0\nThat=\r\n is because one&#39;s shakti works through one&#39;s words and other tangible actio=\r\nns. For this reason, mantras that were composed by great yogis or used by g=\r\nreat yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some of their=\r\n shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of that s=\r\nhakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras composed b=\r\ny great souls like Adi Shankara.\n=A0\nSo it is a good idea to use well-known=\r\n Sanskrit mantras that were used by generations of great saints and yogis.\n=\r\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyoti=\r\nsh Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarp=\r\nana:\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil=\r\nms.org \n=A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n=A0\n--- On =\r\nThu, 12/17/09, ramypras &lt;ramypras@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: ramypras &lt;ramypras=\r\n@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Basic queries\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\nDate: Thursday, December 17, 2009, 12:02 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n=\r\n      \n      \n      Namaskara!\n\n\n\nI have some very basic questions and was =\r\nnot convinced by answers that are usually given.\n\n\n\n1.
