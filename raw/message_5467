In Stockholm syndrome the victim sympathizes with the=\r\n person perpetuating the crime and defends every action of the abuser.\n\nSub=\r\nmitting everything to the almighty and doing whatever one can do maximum in=\r\n the given bounds of the karmic situation is not the same as submitting one=\r\nself to abuse.\n\nSecond you are equating god with Abuser . Please refer to t=\r\nhis verse of the Bhagavad Gita\n\nGita Chapter 5 Verse 15\n\nnadatte kasyacit p=\r\napam\nna caiva sukrtam vibhuh\najnanenavrtam jnanam\ntena muhyanti jantavah\n\nS=\r\nYNONYMS\nna--never; adatte--accepts; kasyacit--anyone&#39;s; papam--sin; na--nor=\r\n; ca--also; eva--certainly; su-krtam--pious activities; vibhuh--the Supreme=\r\n Lord; ajnanena--by ignorance; avrtam--covered; jnanam--knowledge; tena--by=\r\n that; muhyanti--are bewildered; jantavah--the living entities.\n\nTRANSLATIO=\r\nN\nNor does the Supreme Spirit assume anyone&#39;s sinful or pious activities. E=\r\nmbodied beings, however, are bewildered because of the ignorance which cove=\r\nrs their real knowledge. \n\n\nGod does not cause one to do bad karma nor does=\r\n he cause one to do good karma. He neither punishes nor rewards.In other pl=\r\naces as well Lord Krishna says the same thing.\n\nThe current situation you a=\r\nre facing is not because of God.It is entirely because of the karma done by=\r\n oneself in the past life. God is not the perpetuator here period. \n\n\nQ2 Mo=\r\nst people with good conduct I see these days are suffering and those who ha=\r\nppily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the=\r\n supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism is a different issue, but=\r\n last year made me realize that materialistic troubles made me very weak sp=\r\niritually too. So, I dont see them to be connected somehow.\n\n\nUnfortunately=\r\n there is a time lapse between action and fruit of action.If a seed is sown=\r\n today can you expect to eat the fruits tomorrow, just as an tree grows up =\r\nin the natural order of time...there is a natural sequence in which karmas =\r\ntake fruit. The atheists you see today are wasting a golden opportunity of =\r\n utilizing this human life when the external situation is conducive to thei=\r\nr growth. The good people suffering today are doing so due to their past ka=\r\nrmas.\n\nThe pandavas themselves had to suffer even though they had Lord Kris=\r\nhna right beside them.\n\nHarishchandra had to sell his wife and children to =\r\nsurvive...what to say of us normal mortals.\n\n\nHealing begins with the first=\r\n step of realizing one is undergoing the fruits of one&#39;s own actions. It is=\r\n not the Navagrahas...it is not Krishna who is punishing us. The Navagrahas=\r\n act as mere mirrors of karmic energy to seize control of us at the right m=\r\noment to administer the fruits of our actions. They are blameless.\n\n\nPlease=\r\n take the attitude of Kunti , Draupadi, Harischandra, Ranti Deva and many o=\r\nther saints who had to suffer immense poverty and physical pain as inspirat=\r\nion.\n\nSurdas the great poet saint was born blind and in extremely trying fa=\r\nmily setup. Did he not blissfully sing of his love for Krishna.\n\n\nSuicide i=\r\ns the greatest sin ...it is not the route of courageous men.It is the route=\r\n of cowards who want to postpone the payments of their karma and this will =\r\nforce one who has committed suicide to take the body of a preta and hang wi=\r\nthout salvation torn by desires.Desires in the human body are sufficiently =\r\nvexing...think if one were submerged head down in water and were gasping fo=\r\nr breath ...that is how intense the suffering of a preta really is.Each sec=\r\nond the preta suffers from hunger , lust , anger and so on and does not eve=\r\nn have an body to express it....\n\nDear sir please do not even contemplate t=\r\nhat thought.\n\n\nMay god give you the fortitude to tide over your troubles.\n\n=\r\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ast=\r\nro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tried to make=\r\n spiritual progress for long, and made little progress (but \n&gt; not signific=\r\nant). Ever since my childhood, primarily because of my upbringing, I \n&gt; hav=\r\ne been trying and observing a lot of &quot;Good&quot; things. I have been reading tex=\r\nts \n&gt; on spirituality and was a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda&#39;s writin=\r\ngs. I \n&gt; always found Kabir&#39;s following lines, as a best (and most compact)=\r\n commentary on \n&gt; the two prominent paths of spirituality: -\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ek kahoo=\r\nn to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Hai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat kabir vi=\r\ncharee&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; i.e.\n&gt; &quot;If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is contempla=\r\ntion&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Let it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Until l=\r\nast year, my faith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs. Last \n&gt;=\r\n year made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time to think=\r\n. I \n&gt; have come up with several doubts (just a few given below) about spir=\r\nituality and \n&gt; God and Goodness, and I have started to feel getting drifte=\r\nd towards atheism \n&gt; (susprisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadash=\r\ni, when am observing a \n&gt; fast). If someone can help me understand the prob=\r\nlesm with my doubts, it would \n&gt; be great help:- \n&gt; \n&gt; - Isn&#39;t &quot;Ishwar Pari=\r\ndhaan&quot; i.e. &quot;Ishwar yat karoti shobhanam karoti&quot; same as \n&gt; stockholm syndr=\r\nome? \n&gt; - Most people with good conduct I see these days are suffering and =\r\nthose who \n&gt; happily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous lif=\r\ne. Where is the \n&gt; supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism is a di=\r\nfferent issue, but last \n&gt; year made me realize that materialistic troubles=\r\n made me very weak spiritually \n&gt; too. So, I dont see them to be connected =\r\nsomehow.\n&gt; - I do understand that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels are low=\r\n, and so called \n&gt; Godly correction of the wrong doing, takes its own time.=\r\n But doesn&#39;t that \n&gt; promotes the bad karma in itself, specially in this yu=\r\nga? And how long can one \n&gt; wait?\n&gt; - Suicide is considered a greatest sin,=\r\n as it is throwing away the best gift we \n&gt; get from the lord. But, I am no=\r\nt sure that if people do it for fun. God presents \n&gt; a person with tough si=\r\ntuations in the name of testing times, and some day the \n&gt; limit is reached=\r\n. Then isn&#39;t god accomplice in this so called crime.\n&gt; - In first place, wh=\r\ny does he need to test us?\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said that all these question make me f=\r\neel that I am losing the faith in His \n&gt; goodness. All my spiritual progres=\r\ns if any has been corrupted by these testing \n&gt; times. And no help came to =\r\nme(I could not figure out). And those who did offer, \n&gt; faced a lot of trou=\r\nbles themselves and are also suffering now. This is what \n&gt; makes me go mad=\r\n about it, as I am unable to bear this that I have passed my \n&gt; agony to so=\r\nmeone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite all these thoughts that have pre-occupied my mind for q=\r\nuite some time, I \n&gt; feel that I still survive a chance to get back to my f=\r\naith in real terms and not \n&gt; driven by materialistic desire. This is the r=\r\neason I am writing this mail. May \n&gt; be someone can make me see what I am m=\r\nissing here. Else, I see myself getting \n&gt; totally crazy, insane and moving=\r\n towards atheism and quit possibly committing \n&gt; the so called &quot;Sin&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nRegards,\n&gt; Sri\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
