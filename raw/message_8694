In his actions and teaching he oozes and completely melts in devotion=\r\n for his ParamaGuru...But even in front of a gathering of people he often s=\r\nays &quot; Unless the situation is right ...the name of the Paramaguru will not =\r\nbe even uttered&quot; because for him it is so sacred...the highest of the highe=\r\nst .\n\n\n\nI have no other way of putting it in words....am not qualified to e=\r\nxplain this.I do understand listening to experiences can motivate people an=\r\nd it is not my intention to not share...However I cannot find the words to =\r\ndescribe something so sacred and Shri Vimalananda&#39;s advice is so clear.\n\nRe=\r\ngards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi =\r\nNarayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 I still cannot unders=\r\ntand why it is wrong to have a spiritual experiences or to think about them=\r\n. After all we cannot go to a shop and just buy them. If we are doing sadha=\r\nna and we need support they are going to happen. Why deny them? Suppose som=\r\neone is doing the complete purscharan =A0of mantra, is to wrong =A0not to e=\r\nxpect something amazing might happen at the end of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some years ago =\r\nthere was a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple in their home fo=\r\nr several generations. Something happened in this authors life and he felt =\r\nlot of trauma and could not find mental peace. In his later life he took up=\r\n doing prayers and japa etc as he was taught in his younger days. One night=\r\n his daughter said to him, you are doing so much prayers etc, have you had =\r\nany experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; The author became upset and said, no, he had not any =\r\nexperiences. Many times he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in =\r\nthe temple and it is all useless. But he will not give up his prayers as hi=\r\ns time is coming nearer.\n&gt; Next morning when this author was in his Temple =\r\nand priest was doing ManglaAarti, The Deity\n&gt; Spoke to him and comforted hi=\r\nm.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0Several days later when he went to a famous Temple in Rajasthan,=\r\n again the Divine Lord spoke to him there and comforted him and said there =\r\nis no difference between Him and Deities in his home Temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I re=\r\nad this story I knew immediately it was a true story. Very similar things h=\r\nave happened with me to help me and comfort me.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; We are going from A=\r\n to B. Is it a relentless journey? Are there no breaks, petrol stations or =\r\nshops where we can get out and stretch ourselves. Are there any road signs.=\r\n Spiritual experiences are like these. They guide us and show us if we are =\r\non a right path.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was thinking of writing to this devotee who had thi=\r\ns powerful experience in Temple. Please write about it. What you experience=\r\nd and what really happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then I re=\r\nalised that I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the stream.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; =A0Many people are very young here and take NarasimhaBhai as their guru=\r\n or spiritual adviser. So if guruji is saying something, chela and clients =\r\ncannot go against it. Othewise their fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will b=\r\ne confiscated.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; I was also like this in my life. I took diksha=A0 fr=\r\nom my Late Uncle who was famous in his days.\n&gt; When I tried to talk to him =\r\nabout Darshan of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said it is not po=\r\nssible. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of saints like Tu=\r\nlsidas or others who had Darshan. I had not done any spiritual sadhana and =\r\nso no personal experiences.\n&gt; .=A0\n&gt; Since then my life has changed due to =\r\ndifferent spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not in =\r\na complete bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings can very easily =\r\ngive Darshan And having spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritua=\r\nl growth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
