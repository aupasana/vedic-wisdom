More learned ones can ignore my 2 ce=\r\nnts.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough I offer this navarna mantra in fire bef=\r\nore and after saptashati everyday as a part of my daily Chandi homam, I did=\r\n not have an attachment to this mantra and did not appreciate what it repre=\r\nsented. I could appreciate the outward and inward meanings of the stories o=\r\nf saptashati, but I was clueless on the navarna mantra and was offering it =\r\nin fire merely ritually. In contrast, I was (and am) quite attached to [Sav=\r\nitru] Gayatri mantra, meditated with it a lot more, had many experiences wi=\r\nth it and had a much better understanding of it. Even when meditating at th=\r\ne end of Chandi homam as the poornaahuti burnt, I always used Gayatri mantr=\r\na rather than navarna mantra.\n \nWhen I was at the Dakshineshwar temple in 2=\r\n008 summer with my spiritual guru, somehow I felt a strong urge to meditate=\r\n with the navarna mantra and did so. The Mother was kind and I could experi=\r\nence some things and some things became clear about that mantra.\n \nI realiz=\r\ned through experience that navarna mantra is not that different from Savitr=\r\nu Gayatri mantra! It is actually a slightly different expression of the sam=\r\ne reality, even though this may sound strange to some.\n \n*        *        =\r\n*\n \nThose who do homam know the following mantras from the uttaraangam: &quot;OM=\r\n bhUH svaahaa - agnaya idam na mama, OM bhuvH svaahaa - vaayava idam na mam=\r\na, OM suvaH svaahaa - sUryaayedam na mama&quot;. Note that the planes of conscio=\r\nusness represented by bhUH, bhuvaH and suvaH (physical, mental and spiritua=\r\nl planes or, using alternate terminology, gross, subtle and causal realms) =\r\nare associated with Fire (Agni), Wind (Vaayu) and Sun (Surya) gods. After a=\r\nll, it is Fire who transforms and transmutes things and enables physical ma=\r\ntter to come from aakaasa (space); it is Wind that causes motion and though=\r\nts in the mind; and, it is Sun who fills the entire universe and each being=\r\n in it with the essence that soul is.\n \nIn Chandipath (i.e. saptashati), we=\r\n have 3 charitras for which Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati are the=\r\n devatas. The beejas associated with the 3 charitras are Aim, Hreem and Kle=\r\nem respectively. And, Agni, Vaayu and Surya are mentioned as the tattwa (es=\r\nsence) of the three charitras respectively!\n \nIn other words, the 3 beejas =\r\naim, hreem and kleem that start the navarna mantra are associated with Agni=\r\n, Vaayu and Surya, who also represents the realms of bhUh, bhuvaH and suvaH=\r\n. Basically, &quot;aim hreem kleem&quot; in navarna mantra similar to &quot;om bhurbhuvass=\r\nuvah&quot; that is usually appended to the Gayatri mantra.\n \nThe word &quot;vid&quot; that=\r\n is part of &quot;vichche&quot; (vid + cha + ee) is an expression of &quot;dhiyo yo nah pr=\r\nachodayat&quot;. The word &quot;ee&quot; that is part of &quot;vichche&quot; is an expression of &quot;bh=\r\nargo devasya dheemahi&quot;.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe difference between nava=\r\nrna mantra and Gayatri mantra is in one way like the difference between Bha=\r\ngavad Gita and Avadhoota Gita or Ashtavakra Gita.\n \nAvadhoota Gita by Datta=\r\ntreya and Ashtavakra Gita by Ashtavakra (taught to king Janaka) are fantast=\r\nic vedantic texts that throw light on the state of a liberated being. Bhaga=\r\nvad Gita taught by Sri Krishna also does the same thing. However, the diffe=\r\nrence is that Bhagavad Gita shows practical paths that one can follow in or=\r\nder to be liberated. Of course, if you can imbibe the thinking described in=\r\n Avadhoota Gita or Ashtavakra Gita also, you can become liberated. But, it =\r\nis not easy for most people to imbibe that thinking just like that. Bhagava=\r\nd Gita shows a more practical and realistic path.\n \nSimilarly, Gayatri mant=\r\nra refers to the resplendent spiritual essence of the entire universe (gros=\r\ns, subtle and causal) and asks us to know it and be established in it. Nava=\r\nrna mantra is also referring to resplendent spiritual essence of the entire=\r\n universe (gross, subtle and causal) and asking us to know it and be establ=\r\nished in its resplendence. But, in addition, it is giving us a realistic pa=\r\nth (chaamundaayai) to achieving such a state of sat-chid-aananda from the d=\r\neeply dual state that we are in. Except for that additional recognition of =\r\ndeep duality and showing a path towards realization, it basically expresses=\r\n the same realization captured in the Gayatri mantra.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nTo answer the specific question on which deity this navarna mantra is fo=\r\nr, my answer is that it is for the root energy (aadyaa shakti) of this univ=\r\nerse, that makes every being - including Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva - be, hav=\r\ne desires, think, know, act etc. This root energy is essentially the Shakti=\r\n of the Supreme Cosmic Being (Parama Purusha). In saptashati rahasya, She i=\r\ns described thus:\n \nsarvasyaadyaa mahaalakShmIstriguNaa parameshvarI\nlakShy=\r\naalakShya svarUpaa saa vyaapya kR^itsnam vyavasthitaa\nmaatulungam gadaam kh=\r\neTam paanapaatram cha bibhratI\nnaagaM liMgaM cha yonim cha bibhratI nR^ipam=\r\nUrdhani\ntapta kaaMchana varNaabhaa tapta kaaMchana bhUShaNaa\nshUnyam tadakh=\r\nilam svena pUrayaamaasa tejasaa\n \nThis describes that Mahalakshmi of 3 guna=\r\ns was the first of all beings and supreme of all beings. She filled the ent=\r\nire universe with Her shakti. The rahasya further describes that She divide=\r\nd Herself into 3 deities - Mahaakaali, Mahaalakshmi and Mahaasaraswati - sy=\r\nmbolizing the 3 gunas. They then created Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their co=\r\nnsorts.\n \nOf course, one can question whether this aadyaa shakti is the fir=\r\nst of all beings as the verse above says or whether it should be Parama Pur=\r\nusha that is the first of all beings. The answer is that they are not actua=\r\nlly two different beings, even though we tend to look at them that way. It =\r\nis the Aadyaa shakti that makes Parama Purusha (or Aadya purusha) be, think=\r\n, desire, know and act. Without Aadyaa shakti, Aadya purusha has no thought=\r\ns, no desires, no knowledge and no action, i.e. he is non-different from un=\r\nmanifested Brahman. His very self-awareness is through Aadyaa shakti, just =\r\nas my self-awareness is through my Kundalini.\n \nThus, Aadyaa shakti and Par=\r\nama purusha are not really two different beings, but two different aspects =\r\nof one being. Narayana and Narayani are one.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne wo=\r\nrd on intellectual analysis of mantras:\n \nOne can get only a very limited u=\r\nnderstanding of mantras by analyzing them and understanding them intellectu=\r\nally. One can realize and understand the nature of a mantra through an inte=\r\nrnal experience of the mantra. One should focus the mind so completely on t=\r\nhe mantra that one&#39;s mind is eventually withdrawn from everything else, inc=\r\nluding one&#39;s body and sense inputs, and reverberates with the mantra with a=\r\nbsolutely no other thoughts running in the mind. When the mantra *fills* on=\r\ne&#39;s mind like this, one experiences and understands the mantra.\n \nIf you wa=\r\nnt to experience a mantra, try to focus your mind on the mantra and forget =\r\neverything else. Even several notions you may have in your mind about the m=\r\nantra and its deity may become blockages. Just forget everything and focus =\r\nthe mind on mantra alone.\n \nIf you spend your time contemplating your own a=\r\nctions and motivations behind them and try to root out ego whenever it rais=\r\nes its head in your mind, it will be helpful. I do not mean pride by ego he=\r\nre and mean self-identification with a body and a name. As long as such an =\r\nidentification is strong, it prevents one from being able to focus fully on=\r\n a mantra. A person with no or very subtle ego is far more likely to be abl=\r\ne to achieve what I mentioned above, than a person with a dense ego.\n \nWhen=\r\n contemplation and attitude correction go in parallel to meditation, the tw=\r\no activities enhance the effectiveness of the other and eventually one brea=\r\nks through and succeeds in lowering ego and starts to experience subtler an=\r\nd higher things. When mind is so pre-occupied with body, name etc, it canno=\r\nt experience subtler things that well.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; So you wil=\r\nl find the more samhara rupas, that is tamasik,\n&gt; raudra forms of Kali, Cha=\r\nmunda, Shivaduti under the essence\n&gt; of Mahasaraswati, whereas the Mahakali=\r\n rupa is beautiful;\n&gt; like Dakshina Kali.\n \n:-) Beauty is in the eye of the=\r\n beholder. To a devotee of Smashaana Kaali, She may be the most beautiful.\n=\r\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nS=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------- \n \n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sarbani Rath&quot; &lt;sarbani@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Hare Rama Krishna\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Visti,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahakali, Mahalakshmi a=\r\nnd Mahasaraswati are the trigunatmika form of Adya Shakti as given in the S=\r\nri Sri Chandi and other texts. This is the same as the Nila Shakti, Bhu Sha=\r\nkti and Sri Shakti as mentioned by Parasara. \n&gt; \n&gt; Adya Shakti appears in m=\r\nany forms and in Sri Sri Chandi she appears as Chandika  Devi.  As Tamas Sh=\r\nakti or Mahakali she had initially emerged from Anantashayin Vishnu as Maha=\r\nmaya to demolish the demons Madhu and Kaitabh.  Because she emerged from Vi=\r\nshnu, she was known as Vishnumaya. \n&gt; \n&gt; Later, she re-appeared as the join=\r\nt tejas emanating from Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwar. The tejas emenating fr=\r\nom Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara were of Rajasik, Sattvik and Tamasik by na=\r\nture and since the Rajas tejas from Brahma, Sattva tejas from Vishnu and Ta=\r\nmas tejas from Shiva conjoined to create Sri Durga, she is trigunatmika. Sh=\r\ne is at once Brahmi, Vaishnavi and Raudri. The tejas from the other devatas=\r\n emerged as well to add to the created being of tejas, and this heap of acc=\r\numulated tejas was visualised by the devas in Maharshi Katyayan=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2s ashram.  Since the tejas were from the bodies of the devas, t=\r\nhe accumulated tejas in this case had a predominence of rajas and sattva gu=\r\nna. Here the Devi or Sri Durga=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s mula prakriti was t=\r\nhe 18 armed Mahalakshmi.   Whereas as Vishnumaya, where she killed Madhu an=\r\nd Kaitabh,  her mula prakriti was Mahakali. So Sri Durga appeared on Krishn=\r\na Chaturdashi in Maharshi Katyayan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s ashram. On Shuk=\r\nla saptami, ashtami and navami Katyayan worshipped Sri Durga. Hence she is =\r\nknown as Katyayani. On Dashami she killed Mahishasura. Hence she is known a=\r\ns Mahishasuramardini. She is also called Chandika Devi. This Chandika Devi =\r\nthough appeared initially in a samhara murti form, later manifested her ess=\r\nential rajas nature and appeared as Mahalakshmi. So if you have a Durga man=\r\ntra, the devata maybe mentioned as Mahalakshmi. The Chamunda hrdaya bijas, =\r\naim hrim klim, is the Mahalakshmi hrdaya; hence you will see in many places=\r\n Chamunda is referred to as Mahalakshmi devata. \n&gt; \n&gt; Chandika Devi had pro=\r\nmised the devas that she would reappear whenever they would need him. At th=\r\neir calling, she appeared next as the exquisitely beautiful goddess Ambika.=\r\n This time she emanated from Parvati=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s body and was =\r\nformed from her body cells. She was the shakti inherent within Parvati, as =\r\nParvati is Adya Shakti, the unified trigunatmika form. Ambika Devi=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=84=A2s essence is Mahasaraswati. She enticed the demons Shumbha a=\r\nnd Nishumbha and after they fell in love with her, Kali emerged from her fo=\r\nrehead, in a ferocious form. She was known as Chamunda. (The Kali puja that=\r\n is performed in Assam, Bengal and Orissa during the amavasya of Deepavali =\r\nis essentially Chamunda Puja.  Elsewhere Lakshmi is worshipped on this day)=\r\n.  Now Chamunda Devi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s external form is fearful. Ski=\r\nn on bones skeletal structure, red, sunken eyes, tiger skin clad, skull-gar=\r\nlanded, huge faced, darting tongue, making loud fear inspiring sounds, she =\r\nate the demons. She was created in the extreme tamas rupa, as the demons sh=\r\ne was demolishing were very tamasik in nature. She beheaded Chanda and Mund=\r\na with the Hang bija and displayed the severed heads to Chandika Devi, who =\r\nthen told Kali that she will be henceforth famous as Chamunda. So Chandika/=\r\nAmbika/Durga is the mula goddess and Kali/Chamunda emerged from her forehea=\r\nd. In the Mahasarawati essence, there were many other Kali forms that emerg=\r\ned from Chandika Devi, like Shivaduti, who was so ferocious she made sounds=\r\n like the jackal. She was called Shivaduti as she used Shiva as a duta or a=\r\n messenger during her demon demolishing spiel. Chamunda also killed Raktabi=\r\nja but Shumbha and Nishumbha were killed by Chandika herself.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you s=\r\nee, Chamunda specifically manifested as a tamas guna form like Kali. But he=\r\nr hrdaya bija is that of Mahalakshmi like Durga. And she emerged from Chand=\r\nika, who is Adya Shakti, hence the root devata for the navarna mantra is Ma=\r\nhalakshmi, Mahakali, Mahasaraswati. The immediate form of Adya Shakti here =\r\nis Chamunda. Like in the Vishnu Sahasranama, the devata is Narayana, the im=\r\nmediate form worshipped is that of Vishnu. Because the mula is one but thei=\r\nr manifested forms are many.   \n&gt; \n&gt; The Damaratantra says this of the Nava=\r\nrna Mantra:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nidhutanikhiladhvante nityamukte paratpare\n&gt; \n&gt; Akhandabra=\r\nhmavidyayai chitsadanandarupini\n&gt; \n&gt; Anusandadhmahe nityam vayam tvam hrday=\r\nambuje\n&gt; \n&gt; Itham vishadayetyosha ya kalyani navakshari  \n&gt; \n&gt; Asya mahimal=\r\noshopi gaditung kena shakyate\n&gt; \n&gt; Vahunan janmanamante prapatye bhagyagaur=\r\navat.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Destroyer of the darkness of agyana, eternally free, paratpara,=\r\n akhanda- brahmavidyarupini, Chidanandasvarupini =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C I=\r\n meditate on you always in my heart lotus.) Brahmashakti is divided as Sat,=\r\n Chit and Ananda. There is a shloka:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahasarasvati chite mahalakshmi s=\r\nadatmake\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahakalyanandarupe tattvagyanasusiddhaye\n&gt; \n&gt; Anusandadhmahe =\r\nchandi vayam tvam hrdayambuje.\n&gt; \n&gt; (i.e. Mahasarasvati is Chidrupa, Mahala=\r\nkshmi is sadrupa and Mahakali is Anandarupa. O Chandi, in order to get tatt=\r\nvagyana, I meditate on you in my heart lotus.).\n&gt; \n&gt; To go back to the earl=\r\nier shloka:\n&gt; \n&gt; Nirdhutanikhiladhavnte =3D Aim bija =3D Chidrupa Mahasaras=\r\nwati\n&gt; \n&gt; Nityamukta =3D Hrim bija =3D Sadrupa Mahalakshmi (although Mahala=\r\nkshmi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s bija is Shrim, it is stated that sha and ha =\r\nbelong to the same category and can be used as each other=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=84=A2s replacement.)\n&gt; \n&gt; Paratpara =3D Klim bija =3D Anandarupa Mahakali\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Chamunda =3D one who is situated in a supreme seat like the munda or t=\r\nhe head which is a collection of buddhi or sukha.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vicche =3D Vi+ Che +=\r\n i, Chidanandarupini\n&gt; \n&gt; Navarna mantra =3D O sat-chit-ananda-rupini brahm=\r\na mahishi, O Chandi, to achieve Brahmavidya I meditate upon you in my heart=\r\n lotus.\n&gt; \n&gt; So here we see, that the deeper meaning of the navarna address=\r\nes Adya Shakti, as parabrahmasvarupini, but the immediate form is Chamunda,=\r\n whose external form is like Kali, but whose hrdaya bija is that of Mahalak=\r\nshmi!\n&gt; \n&gt; Narratives in the Devi Bhagavat will differ slightly, but the Ma=\r\nrkandeya is the more acknowledged source, as is the Kalika Puran. Please be=\r\n aware, the triguna division of the Devi is as follows:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahakali: Tamo=\r\n guna\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahalakshmi: Rajo guna\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahasarasvati: Sattva Guna\n&gt; \n&gt; But,=\r\n look at the trimurti co-relation:\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahakali: Brahma\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahalakshmi: =\r\nVishnu\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahasaraswati: Rudra.\n&gt; \n&gt; So you will find the more samhara ru=\r\npas, that is tamasik, raudra forms of Kali, Chamunda, Shivaduti under the e=\r\nssence of Mahasaraswati, whereas the Mahakali rupa is beautiful; like Daksh=\r\nina Kali.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is more...and a lot unsaid.

This Akalbodhan Durga Puja is followed in Bengal, Orissa a=\r\nnd Assam. Chandi is also the presiding devata of Durga Saptashati. So yes, =\r\nif you must make a choice, then it is for Durga and not for Kali. In most D=\r\nurga/Bhagavati/Chamunda temples, the deity is worshipped with this mantra. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sarbani Rath\n&gt; \n&gt; Homepage: http://sarbani.com &lt;ht=\r\ntp://sarbani.com/&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sagittarius Publications: http://sagittariuspublic=\r\nations.com &lt;http://sagittariuspublications.com/&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sohamsa: http://soha=\r\nmsa.com &lt;http://sohamsa.com/&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre: http://srijaganna=\r\nth.org &lt;http://srijagannath.org/&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: srijagannath@yahoogroups.com =\r\n[mailto:srijagannath@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of sbm_sharma\n&gt; Sent: 12 Au=\r\ngust 2009 07:38\n&gt; To: srijagannath@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: [Om Krishna G=\r\nuru] Navarna Mantra (For Durga or Kali)\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; If anybody has =\r\na moment out of their valuable time please reply.
