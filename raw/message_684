However,\nGold & Silver are very expensive and hence C=\r\nopper is good for all\npractical purposes.\n\nHoma is signified by Agni Tattva=\r\n which in astrology is signified by\nSun/Mars. Copper is signified by Sun an=\r\nd I guess copper-ore by Mars,\nand hence is very apt for Homa.\n\nIron on the =\r\nother hand is signified by Saturn and is not friendly with\nSun/Mars. So I w=\r\nould never use Iron. It is said that bracelets made of\niron/steel (Saturn) =\r\nprevent people from being possessed by certain\nlow-class of spirits, but it=\r\n also dulls the mind considerably!\n\nI too have seen Iron Homa Kundam, and i=\r\nnvariable it is very big and\nsold/leased by people who arrange marriagess o=\r\nr where you want to do a\nreasonable big homa and when you want to avoid cre=\r\nating your own\nkundam with bricks etc.\n\nMy suggestion ... Copper is the bes=\r\nt!\n\nNarasimha may add more.\n\nThanks\n-Narayan-\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Reema Patel Sriganesh&quot;\n&lt;reema_sriganesh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Sr=\r\ni Gurubhyo Namah ||\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaskaar,\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe that Arya Samaj provides=\r\n iron Homa Kunda. In fact, I got one\n&gt; such Kunda from them, and performed =\r\nmy very first Homa in this kunda. It\n&gt; was an iron kunda with some paint jo=\r\nb done on it.
