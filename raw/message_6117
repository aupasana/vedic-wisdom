If you are using dasas with natal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; charts,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; then the=\r\n paramayush of 120 years applies. If a chart is valid for 1\n&gt; &gt;&gt; year\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nor 1 month or 4 years or 5 years, then that is paramayush and the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dasa=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; needs to be compressed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (1) Take my chart (=\r\n&quot;author this software&quot; chart that comes with each\n&gt; &gt;&gt; JHora copy). On May =\r\n28, 1987, I stood first in my state with a record\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (then) score in coll=\r\nege.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-24 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1987 May 5, Sc rises =\r\nand lord\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mars is in a super-friendly (adhimitra) sign in 5th. This sho=\r\nws an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; achievement/recognition in studies.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-24 lagna is in t=\r\nhe second half of Sc and hence in Sun hora. It was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sukla paks=\r\nha. So using D-24 Shodasottari dasa, it was Mars dasa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; during\n&gt; &gt;&gt; May =\r\n26-29!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (2) On 1991 August 15, I left India for the first time and=\r\n came to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; USA.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-4 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1991 Aug=\r\nust 8, Pi rises. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 9th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord Ketu is in Pi with another function=\r\nal benefic. Rahu is the 12th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord in 7th and aspects him. So Ketu and =\r\nRahu are the perfect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; canidates.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Again Shodasottari dasa appl=\r\nies in D-4 (Moon hora and Krishna\n&gt; &gt;&gt; paksha).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It was Ketu dasa durin=\r\ng August 13-17! In Shodasottari dasa, Ketu\n&gt; &gt;&gt; gives\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rahu&#39;s results a=\r\nlso, as the latter does not have a dasa.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (3) On 1998 August 21, m=\r\ny son was born.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-7 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1998 August=\r\n 8, Pi rises. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 5th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord Moon is in a super-friendly (adhimitra=\r\n) sign in 9th. Moon is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perfect candidate being the 5th lord in a t=\r\nrine.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Again Shodasottari dasa applies in D-7 (Sun hora and Sukla =\r\npaksha).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was Moon dasa during August 19-23!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (4) On 1=\r\n996 December 5, I had a vehicular accident in which the car\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\notalled.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-16 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1996 November 7, =\r\nTa rises.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jupiter is a functional malefic in 7th. Functional malefics =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd/7th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; become marakas. Especially the 8th lord in 7th is a cl=\r\near maraka. As\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd lord and the lone occupant of 2nd is a fun=\r\nctional benefic and 7th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord is a neutral planet occupying 9th in exal=\r\ntation, Jupiter is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; only significant maraka in this D-16.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n D-16 lagna is in Sun&#39;s hora and it is Krishna paksha. So Vimsottari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; d=\r\nasa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; applies and it is started from Ardra as per Lomasha Samhita. It wa=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jupiter dasa during December 4-8!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (5) On 2002 August 12, I=\r\n lost my job when the start-up laid off most\n&gt; &gt;&gt; engineers and went into h=\r\nibernation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-10 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 2002 August 8,=\r\n Sc rises.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mercury\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is a functional malefic and 8th lord, occupyin=\r\ng lagna. Functional\n&gt; &gt;&gt; malefic Saturn afflicts Moon in 8th and gives a du=\r\nryoga. He can show\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; disappontment. Saturn or Mercury dasa can gi=\r\nve the layoff.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-10 lagna is in Moon&#39;s hora and it is Krishna pak=\r\nsha. So\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Shodasottari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dasa applies. It was Saturn dasa during Augu=\r\nst 11-15!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (6) On 2010 Sept 5, I got a promotion at work.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; In D-10 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 2008 August 7, Pi rises. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n1st/10th lord Jupiter is exalted in 5th, while 5th lord Moon is in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 10t=\r\nh.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Either can give a promotion. But Moon is afflicted by functional\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; malefic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Saturn. So Jupiter is likely to give it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-10 lag=\r\nna is in Sun&#39;s hora and it is Sukla paksha. So Shodasottari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dasa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\napplies. It was Jupiter dasa during September 4-7!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (7) On 1993 Au=\r\ngust 1, I got married.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-9 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1993=\r\n July 7, Ar rises. Lagna\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mars is in 5th, while 5th lord Sun =\r\nis exalted in lagna. This\n&gt; &gt;&gt; parivartana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is a powerful raja yoga and=\r\n gives auspicious results. Mars has a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; close\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspect on the 7th lor=\r\nd. As per Parasara, functional benefics\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conjoining/aspecting 7th and 7=\r\nth lord can give marriage.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Here, people may look at Saturn in 7th=\r\n to give marriage, but he is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; functional malefic afflicting 7th and d=\r\noes not give marriage. OTOH,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mars\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can give marriage as a well-pla=\r\nced functional benefic (in 5th)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the 7th lord (98% aspec=\r\nt!!!).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When I read Parasara&#39;s directive that functional benefics =\r\nconjoining\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting 7th/7th lord/UL can give marriage, I thou=\r\nght he covered too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; many planets and the directive was unusable. But, I=\r\n missed the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; qualification &quot;functional benefic&quot; then. As it did not wor=\r\nk, I was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; used to giving importance to functional nature. I wa=\r\ns using loose\n&gt; &gt;&gt; logic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that can qualify several planets for anything=\r\n. After switching to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; SSS, I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; am realizing the clarity, simplicity =\r\nand sufficiency of Parasara&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings. The journey is not over yet, =\r\nbut it surely got a lot more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interesting (and hopefully productive).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; BTW, marriage is physical event too. During those few days, I was =\r\non\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; move *physically* and taking part in many rituals. That sh=\r\nould show\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-1. Mars, who is a functional benefic aspecting 7th=\r\n lord in D-9,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; happens to be a yogakaraka in lagna in D-1 and 9th lord.=\r\n He shows\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; part in rituals (9th) with a sense of good thing=\r\ns happening\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (yogakaraka). We can use signs and planets to connect vari=\r\nous\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-charts,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; including D-1.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-9 lagna has exalted Sun =\r\nin it. So Shashtihayani dasa applies. It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mars dasa during Jul=\r\ny 31-August 5!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (8) On 2005 June 10 evening (around 8:40 pm EDT - =\r\nUS time), I had a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; liberating spiritual experience that transformed me =\r\ncompletely.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-20 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 2005 Jun 5, Cn=\r\n rises. Moon is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lagna lord and a functional benefic, in a sup=\r\ner-friendly sign in a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; quadrant. He has a parivartana with yogakaraka M=\r\nars. But a more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; important factor is that Moon is with neutral planet S=\r\naturn, who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; happens\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to own the 8th house of Kundalini and transfor=\r\nmation! Moon-Saturn\n&gt; &gt;&gt; combination normally denotes disappointments and d=\r\nepression, but can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; denote dispassion and detachment in D-20. With 8th =\r\nlord Saturn\n&gt; &gt;&gt; aspecting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 12th and being with this Moon, he can give =\r\na liberating experience.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mental activity is what keeps one away f=\r\nrom the absolute truth and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; focused on the apparent reality involving s=\r\nense objects. Though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual practices are also based on focused men=\r\ntal activity, their\n&gt; &gt;&gt; goal is to stop mental activity, so that mind is t=\r\nurned away from the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sense objects and towards absolute truth. The goal=\r\n is sadhana is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; glimpse of the absolute in the beginning and constant=\r\n awareness of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; absolute in the long run. Mental activity is an=\r\n obstacle in it and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Moon-Saturn combination that restrains the mind is=\r\n a blessing for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-20 lagna is in Moon&#39;s hora and it is=\r\n Krishna paksha. So\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Shodasottari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dasa applies. It was Moon-Saturn=\r\n AD on June 11 from 4:30 am IST to 5\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; IST!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (9) On 200=\r\n6 August 12 early morning (US time - EDT), I started my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual prac=\r\nticie of daily homam (fire ritual).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In D-20 of the Tajaka monthly=\r\n chart of 2006 August 8, Pi rises. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 9th\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord Mars (a functiona=\r\nl benefic) and lagna lord Jupiter are in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; samasaptaka over the 8th hous=\r\ne axis (effort and sadhana). This raja\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can give its result i=\r\nn Mars-Jupiter or Jupiter-Mars antardasas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-20 lagna is in Sun&#39;s=\r\n hora and it is Sukla paksha. So Shodasottari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dasa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; applies. It wa=\r\ns Mars-Jupiter AD from August 12 (7 pm IST) to August\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 13\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (4 am IS=\r\nT)!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; My bottomline: Compressing nakshatra dasas ta=\r\nught by Parasara and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Lomasha to Tajaka annual/monthly charts is not on=\r\nly logical, but it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; produces very interesting results, IF chart is accu=\r\nrate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Teachings of rishis are like seeds. They ne=\r\ned to be planted in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; field\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (mind), regularly sprinkled with wa=\r\nter (desire to understand),\n&gt; &gt;&gt; protected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from the elements (doubts a=\r\nnd confusions), and pursued patiently over\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; long time. Plants (i=\r\nntellectual understanding) from the seeds (ideas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taught by rishis) gro=\r\nw big over time and give tasty fruits (perfect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; understanding and grasp=\r\n over the ideas).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If the plant I planted gives some fruits, I wil=\r\nl share them with you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But you can enjoy only a little bit that way. I=\r\nf you plant the seeds\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your own field, you can get many more fr=\r\nuits.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I see the debates on v-a list, but do not r=\r\nead them. Those who think\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that divisionals are not charts and everythi=\r\nng should be seen mainly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D-1 chart are free to debate to their=\r\n heart&#39;s content and write as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; theorization as they want. But=\r\n, those who want to make real progress\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; real astrology taught b=\r\ny rishis will be better off keeping the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; following\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in mind:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; - Some twins sharing the same D-1 and D-9 charts have totally\n&gt; &gt;&gt; diff=\r\nerent\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lives. D-1 and D-9 are utterly insufficient, strictly from the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; scientific angle of having enough degrees of freedom.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Divis=\r\nional charts ARE charts. They need to be taken seriously, if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ever\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n astrology is to be established as a science to the hard-core\n&gt; &gt;&gt; scientif=\r\nic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; community.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Divisional charts throw light on several abs=\r\ntract environments\n&gt; &gt;&gt; surrounding one (e.g. parental environment, profess=\r\nional environment,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual environment etc). While all charts are co=\r\nnnected and none\n&gt; &gt;&gt; exists in a vacuum, divisional chart showing a partic=\r\nular matter is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; THE\n&gt; &gt;&gt; MOST important parameter for seeing that matte=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Use divisional charts FULLY (instead of offering lip service=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; saying &quot;D-1 shows the event and so it happens. It so happens that=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; divisionals also support it&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; - Use of SSS will allow you =\r\nto harness the full power of divisional\n&gt; &gt;&gt; charts and the dasa systems ta=\r\nught by rishis.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tendulkar&#39;s technique and tempera=\r\nment was criticized by cricket\n&gt; &gt;&gt; writers\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at various times in his ca=\r\nreer. He never cared to debate with critics\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and simply kept practicing=\r\n. The guy is a legend with no realistic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; chance\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of anybody breakin=\r\ng his umpteen records anytime soon.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want to really achieve=\r\n something and do something productibe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology, experiment =\r\nand practice instead of engaging in theoretical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; debates. I never gave =\r\nthis message in the past because I did not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; think\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there was someth=\r\ning worthwhile to focus and practice. Now I think\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is.

If you are using dasas=\r\n with natal &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; charts,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; then the paramayush of 120 y=\r\nears applies. If a chart is valid for 1 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; year&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or =\r\n1 month or 4 years or 5 years, then that is paramayush and the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; dasa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; needs to be compressed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (1) Take my chart (&quot;author this software&qu=\r\not; chart that comes with each&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; JHora copy). On May 28, 1987, I=\r\n stood first in my state with a record&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (then) score in college=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-24 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1987 May=\r\n 5, Sc rises and lord&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mars is in a super-friendly (adhimitra) =\r\nsign in 5th. This shows an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; achievement/recognition in studies.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-24 lagna is in the second half of Sc and hence=\r\n in Sun hora. It was &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sukla paksha. So using =\r\nD-24 Shodasottari dasa, it was Mars dasa &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; during&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nMay 26-29!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (2) On 1991 August 15, I left India fo=\r\nr the first time and came to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; USA.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I=\r\nn D-4 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1991 August 8, Pi rises. The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; 9th&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lord Ketu is in Pi with another functional benefic. R=\r\nahu is the 12th&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lord in 7th and aspects him. So Ketu and Rahu =\r\nare the perfect &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; canidates.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Again Sh=\r\nodasottari dasa applies in D-4 (Moon hora and Krishna &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; paksha)=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was Ketu dasa during August 13-17! In Shodasottari dasa, =\r\nKetu &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; gives&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rahu&#39;s results also, as the latte=\r\nr does not have a dasa.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (3) On 1998 August 21, my=\r\n son was born.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-7 of the Tajaka monthly chart=\r\n of 1998 August 8, Pi rises. The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 5th&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lord Moon i=\r\ns in a super-friendly (adhimitra) sign in 9th. Moon is the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; per=\r\nfect candidate being the 5th lord in a trine.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Aga=\r\nin Shodasottari dasa applies in D-7 (Sun hora and Sukla paksha). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; It&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; was Moon dasa during August 19-23!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; (4) On 1996 December 5, I had a vehicular accident in which the car &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; totalled.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-16 o=\r\nf the Tajaka monthly chart of 1996 November 7, Ta rises.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jupit=\r\ner is a functional malefic in 7th. Functional malefics in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2nd=\r\n/7th&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; become marakas. Especially the 8th lord in 7th is a clear=\r\n maraka. As &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2nd lord and the lone occupant o=\r\nf 2nd is a functional benefic and 7th&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lord is a neutral planet=\r\n occupying 9th in exaltation, Jupiter is the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; only significant =\r\nmaraka in this D-16.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-16 lagna is in Sun&#39;s h=\r\nora and it is Krishna paksha. So Vimsottari &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; dasa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n applies and it is started from Ardra as per Lomasha Samhita. It was&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; Jupiter dasa during December 4-8!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (5) On 2=\r\n002 August 12, I lost my job when the start-up laid off most&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; e=\r\nngineers and went into hibernation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-10 of th=\r\ne Tajaka monthly chart of 2002 August 8, Sc rises. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mercury&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; is a functional malefic and 8th lord, occupying lagna. Functiona=\r\nl&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; malefic Saturn afflicts Moon in 8th and gives a duryoga. He =\r\ncan show &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; disappontment. Saturn or Mercury dasa=\r\n can give the layoff.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-10 lagna is in Moon&#39;s=\r\n hora and it is Krishna paksha. So &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shodasottari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ndasa applies. It was Saturn dasa during August 11-15!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; (6) On 2010 Sept 5, I got a promotion at work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; In D-10 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 2008 August 7, Pi rises. The&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; 1st/10th lord Jupiter is exalted in 5th, while 5th lord Moon is in=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 10th.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Either can give a promotion. But Moon is =\r\nafflicted by functional &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; malefic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Saturn. So Jupit=\r\ner is likely to give it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-10 lagna is in Sun&#39=\r\n;s hora and it is Sukla paksha. So Shodasottari &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; dasa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; applies. It was Jupiter dasa during September 4-7!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; (7) On 1993 August 1, I got married.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-=\r\n9 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 1993 July 7, Ar rises. Lagna &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n lord&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mars is in 5th, while 5th lord Sun is exalted in lagna. =\r\nThis &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; parivartana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; is a powerful raja yoga and giv=\r\nes auspicious results. Mars has a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; close&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; aspect o=\r\nn the 7th lord. As per Parasara, functional benefics&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; conjoinin=\r\ng/aspecting 7th and 7th lord can give marriage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; H=\r\nere, people may look at Saturn in 7th to give marriage, but he is a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; functional malefic afflicting 7th and does not give marriage. OTOH, &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mars&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; can give marriage as a well-placed functiona=\r\nl benefic (in 5th) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; aspecting&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the 7th lord (98% a=\r\nspect!!!).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I read Parasara&#39;s directive t=\r\nhat functional benefics conjoining &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; aspecting =\r\n7th/7th lord/UL can give marriage, I thought he covered too&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ma=\r\nny planets and the directive was unusable. But, I missed the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; q=\r\nualification &quot;functional benefic&quot; then. As it did not work, I was=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; used to giving importance to functional nat=\r\nure. I was using loose &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; logic&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that can qualify se=\r\nveral planets for anything. After switching to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; SSS, I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; am realizing the clarity, simplicity and sufficiency of Parasara&#39;=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; teachings. The journey is not over yet, but it surely got a =\r\nlot more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; interesting (and hopefully productive).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BTW, marriage is physical event too. During those few days, I =\r\nwas on &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; move *physically* and taking part in =\r\nmany rituals. That should show &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-1. Mars, who=\r\n is a functional benefic aspecting 7th lord in D-9,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; happens to=\r\n be a yogakaraka in lagna in D-1 and 9th lord. He shows &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; takin=\r\ng&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; part in rituals (9th) with a sense of good things happening&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (yogakaraka). We can use signs and planets to connect various =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-charts,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; including D-1.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; D-9 lagna has exalted Sun in it. So Shashtihayani dasa applies. It &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mars dasa during July 31-August 5!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (8) On 2005 June 10 evening (around 8:40 pm EDT - US time), I h=\r\nad a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; liberating spiritual experience that transformed me compl=\r\netely.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-20 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 200=\r\n5 Jun 5, Cn rises. Moon is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lagna lord and a =\r\nfunctional benefic, in a super-friendly sign in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; quadrant. He=\r\n has a parivartana with yogakaraka Mars. But a more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; important =\r\nfactor is that Moon is with neutral planet Saturn, who &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; happen=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to own the 8th house of Kundalini and transformation! Moon-S=\r\naturn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; combination normally denotes disappointments and depress=\r\nion, but can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; denote dispassion and detachment in D-20. With 8t=\r\nh lord Saturn &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; aspecting&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 12th and being with this=\r\n Moon, he can give a liberating experience.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Menta=\r\nl activity is what keeps one away from the absolute truth and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nfocused on the apparent reality involving sense objects. Though&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; spiritual practices are also based on focused mental activity, their&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; goal is to stop mental activity, so that mind is turned away from =\r\nthe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; sense objects and towards absolute truth. The goal is sadh=\r\nana is a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; glimpse of the absolute in the beginning and constant=\r\n awareness of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; absolute in the long run. Ment=\r\nal activity is an obstacle in it and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Moon-Saturn combination t=\r\nhat restrains the mind is a blessing for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-20 lagna is in Moon&#39;s hora and it is Krishna paksha. So &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Shodasottari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; dasa applies. It was Moon-Saturn AD =\r\non June 11 from 4:30 am IST to 5 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; pm&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IST!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (9) On 2006 August 12 early morning (US time - EDT), I s=\r\ntarted my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; spiritual practicie of daily homam (fire ritual).&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In D-20 of the Tajaka monthly chart of 2006 August =\r\n8, Pi rises. The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 9th&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lord Mars (a functional ben=\r\nefic) and lagna lord Jupiter are in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; samasaptaka over the 8th h=\r\nouse axis (effort and sadhana). This raja &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; yoga&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; c=\r\nan give its result in Mars-Jupiter or Jupiter-Mars antardasas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-20 lagna is in Sun&#39;s hora and it is Sukla paksha. So Sh=\r\nodasottari &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; dasa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; applies. It was Mars-Jupiter AD =\r\nfrom August 12 (7 pm IST) to August &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 13&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (4 am IST=\r\n)!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My bottomline:=\r\n Compressing nakshatra dasas taught by Parasara and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Lomasha to=\r\n Tajaka annual/monthly charts is not only logical, but it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; prod=\r\nuces very interesting results, IF chart is accurate.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Teachings of rishis are like seeds. The=\r\ny need to be planted in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; field&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (mind), regula=\r\nrly sprinkled with water (desire to understand), &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; protected&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; from the elements (doubts and confusions), and pursued patiently=\r\n over &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; long time. Plants (intellectual understa=\r\nnding) from the seeds (ideas&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; taught by rishis) grow big over t=\r\nime and give tasty fruits (perfect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; understanding and grasp ove=\r\nr the ideas).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If the plant I planted gives some f=\r\nruits, I will share them with you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But you can enjoy only a li=\r\nttle bit that way. If you plant the seeds &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; you=\r\nr own field, you can get many more fruits.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I see the debates on v-a list, but do not read th=\r\nem. Those who think&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that divisionals are not charts and everyt=\r\nhing should be seen mainly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; D-1 chart are free=\r\n to debate to their heart&#39;s content and write as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; much&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; theorization as they want. But, those who want to make real progr=\r\ness &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; real astrology taught by rishis will be b=\r\netter off keeping the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; following&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in mind:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Some twins sharing the same D-1 and D-9 charts have to=\r\ntally &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; different&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lives. D-1 and D-9 are utterly i=\r\nnsufficient, strictly from the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; scientific angle of having enou=\r\ngh degrees of freedom.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Divisional charts ARE ch=\r\narts. They need to be taken seriously, if &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ever&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a=\r\nstrology is to be established as a science to the hard-core &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; s=\r\ncientific&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; community.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Divisional ch=\r\narts throw light on several abstract environments&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; surrounding =\r\none (e.g. parental environment, professional environment,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; spir=\r\nitual environment etc). While all charts are connected and none&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; exists in a vacuum, divisional chart showing a particular matter is &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; THE&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; MOST important parameter for seeing that matter.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Use divisional charts FULLY (instead of offerin=\r\ng lip service and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; saying &quot;D-1 shows the event and so it h=\r\nappens. It so happens that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; divisionals also support it&quot;).=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; - Use of SSS will allow you to harness the full =\r\npower of divisional&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; charts and the dasa systems taught by rish=\r\nis.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Tendulkar&#39=\r\n;s technique and temperament was criticized by cricket &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; writer=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; at various times in his career. He never cared to debate wit=\r\nh critics&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and simply kept practicing. The guy is a legend with=\r\n no realistic &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; chance&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; of anybody breaking his ump=\r\nteen records anytime soon.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want to really =\r\nachieve something and do something productibe &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt=\r\n; astrology, experiment and practice instead of engaging in theoretical&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; debates. I never gave this message in the past because I did not =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; think&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; there was something worthwhile to focus an=\r\nd practice. Now I think &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; is. If you are ser=\r\nious, it is a bad idea to spend time on useless&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; theoretical de=\r\nbates.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(255, 255, 255); mi=\r\nn-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd29c929fef0804a0066981--\r\n\n"}}
