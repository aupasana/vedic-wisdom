Yogis with a deep s=\r\nense of realization have supported that restriction. Though I myself am not=\r\n fully convinced, still I suggest following the restriction.\n=C2=A0\nIn gene=\r\nral, I can say this. God is always in the heart. Just as Sun is always in t=\r\nhe sky, even when clouds block Him, similarly God is always in the heart, e=\r\nven when various things block one from seeing Him. It is our conditioning, =\r\nour attitudes, our priorities and our thinking that act as the cloud separa=\r\nting us from God.\n=C2=A0\nFor one who is able to see God in heart, there are=\r\n hardly rules. It is people who are trying to remove the clouds of conditio=\r\nning that block one from seeing the Sun of God, who need to follow rules an=\r\nd do various kinds of sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nSome rules are designed in tradition =\r\nconservatively, in order to prevent some potentially problematic situations=\r\n. It may be acceptable to break them in some situations, but it will be wis=\r\ne to follow them when one is unsure.\n=C2=A0\n(2) You are right. There is no =\r\nneed to have a kalasha (water pot) or an idol. One can invoke god only in f=\r\nire.\n=C2=A0\n(3) People who do rituals expecting some raajasik or taamasik r=\r\nesults of a selfish nature (e.g. &quot;I should become a millionnaire&quot;, &quot;my enem=\r\ny should get &quot; etc) will face the wrath of gods when they fall. One who sur=\r\nrenders to the deity and does a ritual for saattwik purposes (e.g. &quot;for the=\r\n pleasure of so and so deity&quot;, &quot;for the increase of dharma in the world&quot; et=\r\nc) need not fear. Even a very strict and disciplinarian parent will not yel=\r\nl at a selfless child who tries sincerely and fails. In fact, people doing =\r\nrituals selflessly are so few that gods will be missing such people in thus=\r\n age. They will be very pleased with each additional person who does it!\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n(4) What I mentioned regarding falling to lust applies to all people=\r\n and all sadhanas. As one progresses spiritually, one may be tested by natu=\r\nre by being placed in increasingly difficult situations that provoke lust, =\r\nanger etc in one. The shadripus (six internal enemies - lust, anger etc) ar=\r\ne not easy to conquer. Even if one floors them a big blow, they always get =\r\nup and come up with an even better effort than before. Persistence is neede=\r\nd to overcome. Men and women are slightly different in the matter of lust. =\r\nWomen usually have better control over lust than men, but, when they lose c=\r\nontrol, it can be a difficult problem.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, please remember that=\r\n passing the tests and being able to resist all temptations that provoke lu=\r\nst, anger etc is needed for self-realization.\n=C2=A0\n(5) Chandi homam is ve=\r\nry good, but do not jump into it if you are scared.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNa=\r\nrasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish=\r\n writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n=C2=A0\n--- On Mon, 12/21/=\r\n09, anonymousm12 &lt;anonymousm12@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: anonymousm12 &lt;anonym=\r\nousm12@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam questions...\nTo: vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Monday, December 21, 2009, 12:47 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      If god is within us and we call god from o=\r\nur heart in fire then why can&#39;t a woman with periods do homam.What happens =\r\nto the god in the woman&#39;s heart during periods?I find this confusing and ne=\r\ned clarification.\n\n\n\nThis might sound silly but I amn&#39;t able to understand =\r\nthat during homam why should we invoke the diety in the idol when we are al=\r\nready invoking the diety in the fire.
