What  I ha=\r\nve also observed is if one does not have a gotram but say starts following =\r\na Sadguru, than they can use their\nSadguru&#39;s Gotram and Rishi. Many times I=\r\n have Swamiji Ganapati Sacchidanandaji, the rare living avatar of Datta eve=\r\nn say this himself, i.e. use his gotram. This also means he has accepted th=\r\nem as spiritual children.\n\nPlease note that there is no relationship with R=\r\nashi, Nakshatra\nand Gotram and Rishi or Kula Devi or Kula Devta. These are =\r\northogonal concepts.\n\nI am pretty sure there is a way for all indian to fin=\r\nd thiir Gotram and Rishi.\n\nFor instance I would hope that since The sikh re=\r\nligion came from\ndirect lineage of Lord Rama, so all the followers in that =\r\nwould have gotram of Lord Rama and also the Rishi. If I am wrong here pleas=\r\ne pardon my ignorance.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, Jagmeet S Dheendsa &lt;jsdheendsa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of=\r\n all how do you find your gotra Maharishi if you are not a hindu\n&gt; or you a=\r\nre not able to trace your ancestory to the vedic times?\n&gt; \n&gt; This is very H=\r\nindu specific,I can understand that,but I am also sure that\n&gt; almighty Lord=\r\n must have some plans for others also.\n&gt; What happens to 80% of the world&#39;s=\r\n population ,(add some more because all\n&gt; hindus also don&#39;t know there Gotr=\r\na Rishis-I know PVR has said if one\n&gt; doesn&#39;t know ,one can just move on to=\r\n the next step but it has to\n&gt; remembered that human nature abhors vacum an=\r\nd specially if it concerns\n&gt; the ancestory in case of Indians)\n&gt; \n&gt; There h=\r\nas to be some way either by the Family Name or anyother name used\n&gt; in plac=\r\ne of Family name whcih maps to 12 Rashis or 27/28 nakashtras.May\n&gt; be the M=\r\naharishis can be mapped to the Rashis/Nakastras.\n&gt; \n&gt; JD\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, 20 Ma=\r\nr 2010 18:20:58 -0000 &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; writes:\n&gt;   \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; E=\r\nach one of us comes from a specific Maha Rishi and accordingly\n&gt; we have Go=\r\ntra associated with us.\n&gt; \n&gt; From my perspective the only time I have used =\r\nit is when doing some pooja\n&gt; and making the sankalpa.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am wondering =\r\nif one should everyday worship or remember the MahaRishi.\n&gt; May be with tim=\r\ne we have either forgotten doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also like we have mantra for Gods=\r\n and Goddess.
