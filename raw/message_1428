Are you really this body?\n\n\n\nOne norm=\r\nally identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that goes \n\nwith=\r\n that body. This identification is very very strong.\n\n\n\nYou are actually Br=\r\nahman, the all-pervading, all-knowing and all-being \n\nessence of the univer=\r\nse. The same essence manifests as various beings, \n\nincluding various deiti=\r\nes and various people, including your own body. And \n\n*you* really are that=\r\n essence and not the body. Still you identify only with \n\nthe body.\n\n\n\nIt i=\r\ns possible to destroy this self identification with the body and \n\nidentify=\r\n with another object such as a deity. When you identify with a \n\ndeity, you=\r\nr consciousness is in communion with that of the deity. Your will, \n\nthough=\r\nts and actions are those of the deity.\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n\n\n&gt; When som=\r\nebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I have to \n\n&gt; do ?\n\n=\r\n\n\nFirst I can tell you what exactly you have to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself=\r\n \n\nthat you will now identify with Shiva, because Shiva is great and you wa=\r\nnt \n\nto be great. In other words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact=\r\n, \n\nuntil ego completely goes, it is not even possible.\n\n\n\nBefore you can s=\r\nelf-identify with any deity, first your false \n\nself-identification with bo=\r\ndy has to cease. You should absolutely not think \n\nof your body as &quot;I&quot;.\n\n\n\n=\r\nYour will, thoughts and actions should be those of Shiva.\n\n\n\nWill Shiva thi=\r\nnk of a specific physical body as &quot;I&quot;? No. If a specific \n\nphysical body ha=\r\ns good or bad things happening to it, will Shiva feel \n\npleasure or pain? N=\r\no. If people are praising a specific person, will Shiva \n\nfeel proud? No. I=\r\nf people are attacking and criticizing a specific person, \n\nwill Shiva feel=\r\n angry? No.\n\n\n\nThe first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name e=\r\ntc. Reach a \n\nstate where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain t=\r\no the body and \n\npraise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by other=\r\n people. Reach a \n\nstate where equanimity of mind can be maintained in all =\r\ncircumstances.\n\n\n\nWHEN you reach that state, meditate with a mantra of Shiv=\r\na while thinking of \n\nShiva.\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n\n\nRamakrishna Paramaha=\r\nmsa could self-identify with not only deities, but \n\npretty much any object=\r\n of the universe.
