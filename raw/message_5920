And specially if one spends some months i=\r\nn online astrology forums, one will lose faith on astrology and astrologers=\r\n as a breed. Feels like you are watching a zoo or a circus! Exceptions are =\r\nrare. \n\nInherently weak minds use astrology as a crutch which does nothing =\r\nmore than making themselves weaker, mentally and by character. Vivekananda =\r\nhad a point. If one needs a crutch, let it be God because all knowledge in =\r\nthe field of duality is subject to change based on evidences and emperical =\r\nunderstanding. \n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, A=\r\nstro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Fellow members,\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nfore I proceed on this, let me put the disclaimer first. I have no ill inte=\r\nnt \n&gt; against the holistic science and rather have great regards towards th=\r\ne &quot;actual \n&gt; true science&quot;. This thought provoking (&quot;atleast per myself&quot;) m=\r\nail is on the \n&gt; current state of astrology and is not intended to hurt any=\r\none.\n&gt; \n&gt; And before I proceed further, I would love to rewrite a few well =\r\nknown facts as \n&gt; under: -\n&gt; \n&gt; - Best of astrologers have a success rate o=\r\nf less than 75% over their life time.\n&gt; - These days, a lot (if not most) o=\r\nf &quot;practicing&quot; astrologers have not even \n&gt; learnt astrology from authentic=\r\n sources.\n&gt; - There is lot of money laundering going on in the name of astr=\r\nological \n&gt; remedies.\n&gt; - All good astrologers believe that there are defin=\r\nitely some missing parts of \n&gt; actual science and current knowledge is inco=\r\nmplete if not corrupt.\n&gt; - And there are several examples where, very &quot;resp=\r\nected and learned&quot; astrologers \n&gt; of the day themselves have failed marriag=\r\ne&quot;s&quot;, or problem with progenies or so \n&gt; on.\n&gt; - If SSS Vs Drik debate is w=\r\non by SSS, that would pose serious questions on most \n&gt; of the predictions =\r\nmade in last so many years.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - Unfortunately despite all this, predi=\r\nctions are given day-in and day-out by \n&gt; &quot;astrologers&quot; of the day.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wi=\r\nth this background, I would like to begin my article. The sole idea is that=\r\n if \n&gt; we known from well within that the science we are practicing can be =\r\nincorrect, \n&gt; incomplete or corrupt and our accuracy is not better than 50%=\r\n (average of most \n&gt; astrologers and not the best ones) which is as good as=\r\n simple probability; then \n&gt; are we really doing the right thing. Few may a=\r\nrgue that they do it for free and \n&gt; treat it as social service while for t=\r\nhose who are charging will come up with \n&gt; great success stories of their o=\r\nwn. I dont want to get into any debate but just \n&gt; want people to be honest=\r\n to themselves and ask themselves. \n&gt; \n&gt; I dont want to sound offensive but=\r\n just want to bring in the realization. A lot \n&gt; of people approach astrolo=\r\ngers in very rough times of their lives. And with \n&gt; current state of astro=\r\nlogy the prediction they get are somewhat expected. The \n&gt; astrologer would=\r\n &quot;somehow&quot; explain the current conditions even if one is running \n&gt; the bes=\r\nt dasha of his life (per astrologer&#39;s own knowledge) and would even \n&gt; sugg=\r\nest a remedy too. And after the remedy is done, the help seeker is being \n&gt;=\r\n cheated of his faith as well as money. \n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of people in India get =\r\nmarried based on chart matching. And a thousand \n&gt; astrologers are availabl=\r\ne in every city for a task. And still a lot of marriages \n&gt; fail badly. And=\r\n then, &quot;they&quot; say that was destiny. I know of a friend who \n&gt; visited sever=\r\nal astrologers for matching his chart with her fiancee. And \n&gt; everyone was=\r\n so convinced of a great alliance. And one year later, divorce was \n&gt; being=\r\n discussed seriously. So, he approached more astrologers and all of them \n&gt;=\r\n found something or other wrong with the charts and said this was due. He a=\r\nsked \n&gt; them very honestly a very simple question, had I not told you of th=\r\ne latest \n&gt; developments, had you still figured out those problems. And the=\r\n honest ones did \n&gt; really admit the truth.\n&gt; \n&gt; All I want to bring out is=\r\n that firstly the knowledge is definitely not complete \n&gt; as of today and s=\r\necondly that the &quot;majority&quot; that is practicing it today doesnt \n&gt; have the =\r\nrequired qualities (ability, sincerity, &quot;purity&quot; etc) to do it. Please \n&gt; s=\r\nee for yourselves that actually how much good have you done to other&#39;s live=\r\ns by \n&gt; your holy practice. A tough question to answer is, &quot;Does astrology =\r\nof today does \n&gt; any good to anyone&quot;? And ofcourse I mean the querist and n=\r\not the astrologer who \n&gt; is making a lot of money out of it. Even teaching =\r\nastrology has become such a \n&gt; prosperous business. Rather astrology is als=\r\no catching up as a fashion these \n&gt; days.\n&gt; \n&gt; The actual intent is not to =\r\ncriticize the astrology or demoralize the truthful \n&gt; souls practicing it w=\r\nith uttermost sincerity. The intent is to provoke a few \n&gt; people (or a lot=\r\n) to realize the danger they possess to society with their \n&gt; &quot;impure&quot; know=\r\nledge. My humble request to those, who agree with me, stop \n&gt; practicing it=\r\n unless you are sure of it. One may keep researching but predicting \n&gt; is a=\r\n serious business IMHO.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
