(Devikalottaram, v=\r\n. 46)\n\n10. The body is like an earthen pot, inert.

(On celebrating Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s jayanti))\n\n12. Cast off th=\r\ne notion, =E2=80=98This vile flesh am I,=E2=80=99 and seek the ceaseless\nbl=\r\niss of Self. To seek the Self while cherishing this perishing flesh is\nlike=\r\n trying to cross a stream by clinging to a crocodile.\n\n13.

It is to inquire,\n=E2=80=98Whose is this action, or indifference=\r\n, or separateness, or ignorance?=E2=80=99\nInquiring thus, the ego vanishes.=\r\nTo abide as the Self, wherein these eight\nhave never been, this is True exi=\r\nstence.\n\n15. Not realizing that they themselves are moved by an energy not =\r\ntheir own,\nsome fools are busy seeking miraculous powers. Their antics are =\r\nlike the\nboasting of a cripple who says to his friends: =E2=80=98If you rai=\r\nse me to my feet,\nthese enemies are nothing before me.=E2=80=99\n\n16. Since =\r\nthe stilling of the mind is true liberation and miraculous powers\nare unatt=\r\nainable without an act of the mind,how can they whose mind is set\non such p=\r\nowers enter the bliss of liberation which is the ending of all\nactivity of =\r\nthe mind?\n\n17. While God sustains the burden of the world, the spurious ego=\r\n assumes its\nburden, grimacing like an image on a tower, seeming to support=\r\n it. If the\ntraveller in a carriage,which can carry any weight, does not la=\r\ny his luggage\ndown but carries it painfully on his head, whose is the fault=\r\n?\n\n18. Between the two paps, below the chest, above the stomach, there are =\r\nsix\norgans of various colours.
