In some paramparas, specially in North =\r\nIndia, it is consider to be equal \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;to the Saptasati. Where as in eas=\r\ntern India, Bengal/Assam areas, and also some \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Kaula sampradayas in Va=\r\nranasi, this is not considered to be equal to Saptasati. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The=\r\n reasons why these sampradayas do not consider KS to be equal to Saptasati =\r\nis \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;the same as what Narasimha stated. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In my persona=\r\nl experience, about a year before I actually started reading the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;full S=\r\naptasati, I used to do the KS for a few months. I was shown a specific \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nmethod of chanting the KS - there is some breath control required at certai=\r\nn \n&gt;&gt;&gt;lines etc etc. I had almost mugged it up. But the experience of chant=\r\ning the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;actual Saptashati (full) is vastly more powerful and different =\r\nthan the KS. I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;have serious doubts whether a person doing only the KS c=\r\nan ever experience \n&gt;&gt;&gt;samadhi at all; whereas the Saptasati by itself is c=\r\napable of bestowing the \n&gt;&gt;&gt;highest and varied types of spiritual experienc=\r\nes to a sadhaka. Therefore, I \n&gt;&gt;&gt;tend to agree with the sampradayas from B=\r\nengal and Assam that the actual \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Saptasati is anytime more powerful than=\r\n the KS when it comes to spiritual \n&gt;&gt;&gt;experiences. KS is about siddhis.
