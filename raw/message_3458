You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of ches=\r\ns game. \n=A0\nGreat analogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he=A0=\r\ncompleted a beautiful=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=A0one divine ch=\r\ness player, and it is totally His game. \n=A0\nBefore I continue with the nar=\r\nration, I would like to mention a few points which I found I had not clearl=\r\ny mentioned in my last mail:\n=A0\n\nAt the end of the third day of Chandi hom=\r\na at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, whe=\r\nn Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write about this experi=\r\nence in a public forum. Therefore my mails.\n=A0\n\nCaveat: A homa on a funera=\r\nl pyre is an extreme Aghor=A0sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Inf=\r\nact, in many paramparas it is said=A0only someone who has a direct agya fro=\r\nm Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya =\r\nfrom a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=\r\n=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts on=\r\ne should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. \n=A0\n\nMany people have a ne=\r\ngative=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack=\r\n of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadh=\r\nanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films etc of =\r\nAghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect=\r\n. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts start w=\r\nith many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach t=\r\nhe same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path.=\r\n Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but =\r\nat the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great sai=\r\nnts and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considere=\r\nd the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami =\r\nwas an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to=\r\n give a first hand objective=A0account of how a\n powerful sadhana in the sa=\r\nmshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.\n=A0\n\nThere are m=\r\nany people in this age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an at=\r\ntraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how to go about it. Thes=\r\ne accounts are ment to tell such=A0people that these sadhanas can and do ha=\r\nppen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is sti=\r\nll as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and=A0a=\r\nctually be able to do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, ther=\r\ne is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition=\r\n you are in right now=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha =\r\nand Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and on=\r\ne is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This is the eter=\r\nnal promise to every individual=A0because for Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. A=\r\nnd She is so=A0kind.=A0 In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand o=\r\nf God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n\n\n&quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let people =\r\nknow the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousands who may re=\r\nad it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn more, and then=\r\n Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just as She did fo=\r\nr me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. The progress=\r\nion will go on; there is nothing to fear&quot;.\nTherefore have faith, do sadhana=\r\n.=A0 \n\n=A0\nBack to the narration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishn=\r\na Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shakti=\r\ns are available on this night which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we=\r\n were walking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was =\r\nto be seen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Sudd=\r\nenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path.=\r\n We stopped, wondering if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I s=\r\ntarted mentally chanting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make o=\r\nur journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming =\r\nfrom the other side who chased the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Man=\r\nish said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to b=\r\nig for your breeches&quot;.\n=A0\nAs we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is=\r\n a wonderful place.=A0I did not think too much about it then since my mind =\r\nwas already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day=\r\n morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenl=\r\ny felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smile=\r\nd at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the ener=\r\ngies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the=\r\n samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say a=\r\nnything.=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Ben=\r\neras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at t=\r\nhe Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.\n=A0\n=\r\nBack to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with peopl=\r\ne. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept loo=\r\nking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people started staring at u=\r\ns, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of t=\r\nhe samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the diffe=\r\nrent chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands=\r\n of years there has not been a single minute when there has not been a body=\r\n burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There w=\r\nas one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found =\r\na mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to s=\r\nit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manis=\r\nh said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=A0=\r\n but there is something else as well. I did not ask him what. So we\n went t=\r\no another side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap lo=\r\ng=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end,=\r\n the dome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to=\r\n make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but=\r\n Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlook=\r\ners, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom ins=\r\ntructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is somethi=\r\nng very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have obje=\r\ncted, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Agh=\r\nor sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the d=\r\nomes have either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families =\r\nand thus they do not disturb. \n=A0\nThe homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre=\r\n was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus=\r\n was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten =\r\nminutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strang=\r\ne because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose th=\r\nis specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sens=\r\ne perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Ev=\r\nery now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently=\r\n for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But,=\r\n everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the=\r\n dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt=\r\n a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being =\r\nsuch an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of=\r\n the Chandi path=A0I could hear\n chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relative=\r\ns wailing as new bodies were being brought in. \n=A0\nSuddenly to my right th=\r\nere was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer bursting. The =\r\ndogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Goddess was=\r\n moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursting of the=\r\n transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Chandi was =\r\nin my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=A0the pages of the=A0book=\r\n. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=A0I looked bac=\r\nk and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And the shadow pass=\r\ned over my book once again. This time I did not look back. Just kept chanti=\r\nng with more vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=A0 Manish later s=\r\naid, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe and make his/her =\r\npresence felt, even if slightly.=A0It is not an imagination but reality and=\r\n this can=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The i=\r\ndea is to keep doing sadhana.\n=A0\nWhile offering coconuts into the fire, on=\r\ne coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the=\r\n domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondere=\r\nd if I=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt n=\r\natural stroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered if=A0there=\r\n was any company which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily=\r\n take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=\r\n=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra coconu=\r\nt while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood why.\n=A0\nIn=\r\n the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who wa=\r\ns standing nearby and told him=A0that the person whos body was in the pyre =\r\nhas just left and that=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It =\r\nwas already late in the night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenl=\r\ny Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being=\r\n done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentall=\r\ny wondering about what is going on. Then another of the relatives came forw=\r\nard and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok a=\r\nnd asked them to sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of the=\r\n homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse=A0 I saw t=\r\nhe skin on the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!=\r\n\n=A0\nThere is a tradition of pouring Ganges water=A0at the end to finsh the=\r\n fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water o=\r\nn the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at t=\r\nhe end they came to Manish and=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water=\r\n. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to the fir=\r\ne, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing h=\r\nappened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some more ahu=\r\ntis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi=A0samne khadi hai. App log p=\r\nranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to =\r\nthe fire. Then they wanted to touch=A0Manish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not l=\r\net them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower pet=\r\nals we had and told them to go home, since it was very late in the night. S=\r\nuddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earlier) ca=\r\nme\n running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubte=\r\nd. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, ev=\r\nerything is all right.=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of t=\r\nhe day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person=\r\n suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous =\r\nsaint)=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query a=\r\nsked him where was he from, the person replied interior=A0Bihar. Manish adv=\r\nised him to go back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the ordi=\r\nnary people of this land is what makes India so unique, that is why our lan=\r\nd and culture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=A0people are too r=\r\national to understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalculating.=\r\n By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt a=\r\ns if my body existed only from my head to my heart, there was nothing\n belo=\r\nw, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as if=A0I was simply floating on thin=A0air! I t=\r\nold Manish what happened, he just gave a=A0curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n=A0=\r\n\n=A0\n=A0\nAs we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;Th=\r\nere is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of de=\r\nsire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about i=\r\nt. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and perform these sadha=\r\nnas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sad=\r\nhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze o=\r\nf a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat =\r\n(as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting=\r\n on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom h=\r\ne had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She has desire, bu=\r\nt directionless.&quot; At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess =\r\nthat is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, inst=\r\nead of merely contemplating which is of no good,=A0so that you are ready wh=\r\nen\n Nature decides to give you a push. \n=A0\nAfter passing the Lalita Ghat, =\r\nnext afternoon,=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We wer=\r\ne dressed like any other tourist, specially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging fr=\r\nom his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too cl=\r\nose to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shoc=\r\nked seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.\n=A0\nThus end=\r\ned my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed =\r\nManikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n=A0\n-Regards\nRajarshi\n=A0\n\n\nRama Naam Satya Hai=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n      The INTERNET now has a personality.

Therefore my mails.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Caveat&lt;/STRONG&gt;: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme=\r\n Aghor&nbsp;sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many para=\r\nmparas it is said&nbsp;only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali=\r\n or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerfu=\r\nl Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)&nbsp;I was on=\r\nly doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should no=\r\nt, on his own, try out this sadhana. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;=\r\nMany people have a negative&nbsp;bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. T=\r\nhis is party due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy an=\r\nd efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too=\r\n have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. T=\r\nhis is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, an=\r\nd their accounts start with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the =\r\nmany path to the reach the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad=\r\n nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must fol=\r\nlow our chosen path but at the same time have a healthy respect for other p=\r\naths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru=\r\n Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Agho=\r\nris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. =\r\nMy mails are intended to give a first hand\n objective&nbsp;account of how a=\r\n powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the =\r\ncronicler.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;There are many people in th=\r\nis age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for thi=\r\ns kind of a path, but have no clue how to go about it. These accounts are m=\r\nent to tell such&nbsp;people that these sadhanas can and do happen even tod=\r\nay, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manikarnika is still as powerfu=\r\nl as it was thousands of years ago. But to go about it and&nbsp;actually be=\r\n able to do this sadhana, just like everything else in life, there is no fi=\r\nxed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in whatever condition you are i=\r\nn right now&nbsp;and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Sab=\r\nuri. Respect and patience. If the desire is genuine and deep, and one is re=\r\nady to wait, Nature will one day make arrangements.

Not a single person was to be seen anywhere =\r\non any of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack=\r\n of dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wonderi=\r\nng if there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chan=\r\nting a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. C=\r\noincidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side =\r\nwho chased the dogs away.&nbsp;Without looking at me&nbsp;Manish said, &quot;Som=\r\netimes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your br=\r\neeches&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish s=\r\naid this is a wonderful place.&nbsp;I did not think too much about it then =\r\nsince my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come=\r\n. The next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shoot=\r\ning, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm=\r\n. Manish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashy=\r\na and the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I=\r\n knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I=\r\n did not say anything.&nbsp;Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone=\r\n who was from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami =\r\nused to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a conf=\r\nirmed idiot.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Back to midnight. We reached Mani=\r\nkarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait.=\r\n We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we =\r\ncame in, again people started staring at us, but they respectfully made way=\r\n for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at t=\r\nhe middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/1=\r\n0 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a si=\r\nngle minute when there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is=\r\n one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which Ma=\r\nnish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand r=\r\night next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangero=\r\nus. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other sid=\r\ne of the samshan. It not only the bull,&nbsp; but there is something else a=\r\ns well. I did not ask him\n what. So we went to another side. The dom there =\r\ncame forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log&nbsp;kaun se chita me baithn=\r\na chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead a=\r\nnd asked the people standing around the chita to make space for us to sit. =\r\nHe said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll=\r\n sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space for=\r\n us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to dist=\r\nurb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about Manika=\r\nrnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not here. Manish =\r\nlater said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been done =\r\nin here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsleves=\r\n seen these things or heard from their families and thus they do not distur=\r\nb. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre w=\r\nas larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus w=\r\nas stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten mi=\r\nnutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange =\r\nbecause&nbsp;there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose t=\r\nhis specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sen=\r\nse perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. E=\r\nvery now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intentl=\r\ny for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But=\r\n, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, th=\r\ne dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost fel=\r\nt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I&nbsp; - be=\r\ning such an&nbsp;ordinary person -&nbsp;obviously had no clue about. In the=\r\n middle of the Chandi\n path&nbsp;I could hear chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot;=\r\n and relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of smo=\r\nke, I saw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at t=\r\nhat. Later Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and=\r\n leaving the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As t=\r\nhe Path was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shad=\r\now pass over&nbsp;the pages of the&nbsp;book. I thought it was some relativ=\r\ne who was standing behind me.&nbsp;I looked back and was a shocked to find =\r\nthere was no one behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again. =\r\nThis time I did not look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and sayin=\r\ng to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).&nbsp; Manish later said, as one does sadhana =\r\nthe deity often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if sl=\r\nightly.&nbsp;It is not an imagination but reality and this can&nbsp;happen =\r\nnot just in a samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doin=\r\ng\n sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While offering coconuts into the f=\r\nire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick wh=\r\nich the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I =\r\nwondered if I&nbsp;had been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strang=\r\nely felt natural stroking the pyre&nbsp;the way the domes do. I even wonder=\r\ned if&nbsp;there was any company which would may me for this kind of a job,=\r\n I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become a dom a=\r\nt Manikarkina!&nbsp;Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bought=\r\n one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I under=\r\nstood why.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In the middle of the homa, suddenly=\r\n Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him&nb=\r\nsp;that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that&nbsp;th=\r\ney (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in the nig=\r\nht. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, =\r\ndo not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only pra=\r\nying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what is g=\r\noing on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum lo=\r\ng ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down a=\r\nnd continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked=\r\n me to observe the skin on the corpse&nbsp; I saw the skin on the face had =\r\ncaught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;There is a tradition of pouring Ganges water&nbsp;at the end to finsh=\r\n the fire. But I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour wat=\r\ner on the pyre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally =\r\nat the end they came to Manish and&nbsp;asked if they could pour some Gange=\r\ns water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to =\r\nthe fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but no=\r\nthing happened to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some m=\r\nore ahutis, Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi&nbsp;samne khadi hai.=\r\n App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially=\r\n bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch&nbsp;Manish&#39;s feet, but Manis=\r\nh would not let them do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed so=\r\nme flower petals we had and told them to go home, since it was very late in=\r\n the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had\n address=\r\ned earlier) came running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for =\r\nhaving doubted. Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done=\r\n no wrong, everything is all right.&nbsp; Later Manish said, if it was some=\r\n other time of the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea=\r\n. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain =\r\nsaint (a famous saint)&nbsp;who used to live in Kasi. Manish without respon=\r\nding to his query asked him where was he from, the person replied interior&=\r\nnbsp;Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was late in the night.=\r\n The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what makes India so uniqu=\r\ne, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educat=\r\ned&#39;&nbsp;people are too rational to understand these things. God loves the =\r\nsimple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the f=\r\nire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my\n head to my hear=\r\nt, there was nothing below, no legs, no stomach ,&nbsp;as if&nbsp;I was sim=\r\nply floating on thin&nbsp;air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a&=\r\nnbsp;curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish sud=\r\ndenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who =\r\nhas a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know ho=\r\nw to go about it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and perf=\r\norm these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, unless she is a =\r\nYogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to =\r\nmeet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to t=\r\nhe Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreign=\r\ner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is =\r\nthe lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She=\r\n has desire, but directionless.&quot; At that time there was nothing more we cou=\r\nld do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on=\r\n your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no good,&nbsp;so tha=\r\nt you are\n ready when Nature decides to give you a push. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,&nbsp;we stood an=\r\nd observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tour=\r\nist, specially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck&nbsp;and the&nbsp=\r\n;tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, wha=\r\nt if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed a=\r\ns tourists, wondering what is going on.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thus e=\r\nnded my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the fame=\r\nd Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMso=\r\nNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Ve=\r\nrdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;=\r\nRama Naam Satya Hai&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INT=\r\nERNET now has a personality.
