However, th=\r\nere is one more angle to consider.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me long back that we sh=\r\nould guard against focusing on &quot;personalities&quot; and building awe. He said we=\r\n should focus on sadhana. He said, &quot;my message is not that I am special, bu=\r\nt it is that everyone is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but=\r\n it is that everyone can and should find god. I am a normal person. If I co=\r\nuld find god, anybody could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly f=\r\nor a few years, there will be many people who make great progress. World wi=\r\nll be a changed place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish said, &quot;people should do sadhana. Don&#39;t =\r\nwaste time when you are on earth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know=\r\n how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do ho=\r\nmam. Otherwise do japam.

I will give a few small examples in this writeup. However, I want =\r\nto re-iterate that Manish does not see himself as a special person or a &quot;ma=\r\nn of god&quot; as you say, but sees himself as a small instrument of Nature.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; When I mention any supernatural things involving Manish, the goal is to s=\r\nhow that such things are possible even now and not just limited to books an=\r\nd stories. As Rajarshi wisely said, we &quot;educated city people&quot; lack faith. T=\r\nrue, skepticism is useful as a lot of fake people do exploit the blind fait=\r\nh of people, but the pendulum has swung too far and educated people have lo=\r\nst faith so completely that it is almost cynical.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is like lazy pe=\r\nople of a village who do not have the energy and patience to climb a hill n=\r\next to the village refusing to believe that anybody can climb that hill. Th=\r\nus, if someone climbs the hill, finds something nice on the hill and wants =\r\nto inspire others to climb it, such accounts will be inspiring.\n&gt; \n&gt; The go=\r\nal is to inspire and enable a group of spiritual aspirants to do sadhana, b=\r\necome powerful instruments of Nature and end up inspiring many more people.=\r\n The ultimate goal is to uphold Veda dharma of rishis in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When we went to Calcutta to v=\r\nisit Dakshineshwar, we stayed near the Kalighat temple. We could not find a=\r\n hotel room as hotels were full and someone at a temple referred us to a ne=\r\narby house that was being converted to a lodge. House owners lived upstairs=\r\n. We checked in our luggage downstairs. Manish told me, &quot;we have a rina wit=\r\nh this couple. His wife is very sincere and spiritual. We need to do someth=\r\ning.&quot; We met his wife later and saw her horoscope. She was indeed quite spi=\r\nritual. She is a worshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and =\r\na regular visitor of Ramakrishna Mutt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish showed a very tall wall =\r\non one side of that property and asked them, &quot;is there a smashaan (cemetary=\r\n) on the other side of that wall&quot;. They said no. Manish said, &quot;hmm, it some=\r\nhow feels like that.&quot; That person clarified then, &quot;it is a house and not a =\r\nsmashaan, but this house was a small mosque several decades ago and they su=\r\npposedly buried several people of that large family in the backyard itself.=\r\n&quot; After all, Manish&#39;s &quot;perception&quot; was correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, we two ended up d=\r\noing two simultaneous Ganapathi homas on the next night next to that wall.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; On his advice, one lady=\r\n started chanting Chandipath everyday to solve some problem with her son, w=\r\nhich was bothering her very much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oneday Manish talked to her daughter=\r\n. He asked her, &quot;what is your mother doing? She is doing Chandipath alright=\r\n, but she is asking for weird things. Check with her and ask her to stop as=\r\nking those things.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When she cornered her mother on what she was askin=\r\ng, her mother finally revealed that she was frustrated with the situation w=\r\nith her son and so was asking Devi at the time of Chandipath to take her li=\r\nfe so that she does not have to see her son&#39;s situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her daughter =\r\nstraightened her out and she stopped that. As a postscript, her son&#39;s probl=\r\nem was solved after she did Chandipath for a few more weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me a few times that he =\r\n&quot;knows&quot; when someone thinks of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we were staying at a hotel in=\r\n Kurukshetra, Manish said to me one evening, &quot;the hotel owner is thinking o=\r\nf me right now. He is thinking about me and money.&quot; Interestingly, phone in=\r\n the room rang in a minute and it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if =\r\nwe wanted to pay for the next day ahead instead of paying in the morning.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish came to Seatle, U=\r\nSA for a conference in fall 2005 and I met him physically for the first tim=\r\ne then. After lunch, we were walking around. Suddenly, Manish declared, &quot;th=\r\nere is a rudraaksha maalaa meant for your son close to here. I can sense it=\r\n. Let us go and find it.&quot; We walked quite a distance. Then he said, &quot;this i=\r\ns the place.&quot; There was a big country market kind of place in a small shopp=\r\ning complex. We went in, but found nothing. We came out of the complex. Man=\r\nish looked around and said, &quot;no, this is the place. I was confused by the s=\r\nmell from the fish market inside this complex. Let us try again.&quot; We went i=\r\nn again and this time Manish took me inside a small alley and there was a s=\r\nmall mom & pop kind of shop selling some Tibetan things. They had several R=\r\nudraaksha maalaas. Manish picked one, bought it and gave it for my son.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I mentioned this earlier. =\r\nManish told me oneday that he &quot;saw me&quot; doing my daily Chandi homam while he=\r\n was driving fast on a highway in UK. He lifted one hand in abhaya mudra (b=\r\nlessing pose) while driving. His wife asked what he was doing. He said he t=\r\nold her, &quot;Narasimha is doing homam right now. I am blessing him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When=\r\n he mentioned this, I wanted to verify it. I normally wear red or yellow or=\r\n white veshti and anga vastram (lower cloth and upper cloth) for my homam. =\r\nThat day I was wearing a blue veshti and a blue T-shirt. I was gifted that =\r\nblue veshti by a priest and wore it only twice until now. So one is unlikel=\r\ny to *guess* this. I asked him, &quot;if you saw me, tell me what kind of clothe=\r\ns I was wearing.&quot; He said, &quot;Narasimha, it seemed like some shade of blue. Y=\r\nou were wearing a T-shirt and it was also another shade of blue.&quot; He was co=\r\nrrect. If one was merely guessing it, the probability of getting is correct=\r\n was very very small - almost zero.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When we went to Pune, Delhi and Kurukshetra for the Krishna m=\r\novie shooting, it rained heavily. In May, it was a bit early for the monsoo=\r\nn rains. When we reached the temple at Mayapur, Manish said that nature was=\r\n pleased with the work on Krishna and rains wherever we went was a sign. So=\r\nmetimes Manish says big-sounding things like this, which may give an impres=\r\nsion that he is proud. But I realized that it is not because of pride, but =\r\nhe was simply making observations from the plane he is in. From where other=\r\ns are, they may sound weird or proud or pretentious.\n&gt; \n&gt; I kind of dismiss=\r\ned him, &quot;well, it could be a coincidence. It is very hot here right now and=\r\n I see no clouds anywhere. If it rains here today, I will believe your theo=\r\nry.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish seriously looked at the sky and nodded his head. Because i=\r\nt was too hot, we retired into our room at the accommodation there, unpacke=\r\nd our stuff and got tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we heard loud thu=\r\nnders. In a few minutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that lasted half an=\r\n hour. There were puddles of water everywhere. Manish remarked, &quot;see, it ra=\r\nined here also. Gods are happy with this work. This film is an important wo=\r\nrk.&quot; The rest of the day and next day was perfect and we shot what we wante=\r\nd. \n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; During March 2006 S=\r\nhata Chandi homam at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Mother gave a =\r\ndarshan to Manish and asked to start a homam movement, I was meditating in =\r\nthe garbhalaya one evening, sitting in front of Manish. We were both medita=\r\nting on Savitri Gayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal awaren=\r\ness of my body and I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light. I saw=\r\n that there was a person at the center of that light, who was emiting that =\r\nlight. When I looked closer, it was Manish. After a little time, he suddenl=\r\ny transformed into a very famous saint from the past. I wondered &quot;why did M=\r\nanish change into that saint&quot;. That disturbed my focus and my regular self-=\r\nawareness returned and I became aware that I was Narasimha meditating in th=\r\nat garbhalaya and Manish was sitting in front of me. I opened my eyes. At t=\r\nhe same time, Manish also opened his eyes. Without my saying anything, he a=\r\nsked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised that he\n&gt;  knew it. However, what ba=\r\nffled me the most was why he transformed into that saint. I stuttered, &quot;but=\r\n...&quot;. Without my finishing it, he remarked, &quot;you see Narasimha, the blessin=\r\ngs of my guru of last life are still with me. That is why you saw him in me=\r\n!&quot; He not only knew what I saw, but explained it succintly.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I was sleeping oneday. In the middle o=\r\nf the night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my=\r\n shakti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first percei=\r\nved a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split =\r\nsecond, my perception of that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; t=\r\no &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My changed perception was that there was a tremendous =\r\namount of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing ev=\r\nerything that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremend=\r\nous wave. Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted to=\r\ngether by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. Tha=\r\nt wave reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived tha=\r\nt I too was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled w=\r\nith that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny pa=\r\nrticle filled with that sound\n&gt;  and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of=\r\n anything else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple an=\r\nd yet fantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a=\r\n thought that can be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? Ho=\r\nw am I hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mi=\r\nnd. That thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In=\r\n other words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again p=\r\nerceived that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and=\r\n mind was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I mentio=\r\nned this incident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was th=\r\ne middle of the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned the i=\r\nncident and said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in =\r\nthe wave in which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew i=\r\nt and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you =\r\nheard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated wit=\r\nh that beejaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to h=\r\nave a mystical experience with.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I confirmed that was the beejaaks=\r\nhara I heard, Manish shed some light: &quot;I was at that time meditating with t=\r\nhat beejaakshara. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I then =\r\nwent into a nice samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experienced=\r\n that deity at that time. But we should realize that this is all Her play a=\r\nnd we are just nimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows and we d=\r\no not. We are just dummies observing what comes our way. We neither make an=\r\nything happen nor should we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe.=\r\n Do not be attracted or repelled by anything.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, &quot;Y=\r\nou are doing good work by giving free astrology software and doing several =\r\npoojas, but you are not experiencing anything. Time has now come for your K=\r\nundalini to awaken and for you to start experiencing things&quot;. I thought he =\r\nwas crazy. He sent me a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Ga=\r\nyatri mantra everyday using that maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (cel=\r\nibacy) and keeping the back straight and without any body movement at all. =\r\nI ignored the Rudraaksha maalaa sent by him for many months before starting=\r\n the practice he wanted in May 2005. I experienced something very intense, =\r\npowerful, profound and life changing within 18 days of starting the practic=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I mentioned what happened to him, he laughed and said, &quot;now an=\r\n irreversible transformation has been kicked off&quot;. He said, &quot;we two were bo=\r\nrn together many times. Even if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me a=\r\nnd will be pulled towards me. Such is our relationship. You don&#39;t know who =\r\nyou are and who I am, but I do.&quot; He also told me then about his first phone=\r\n call to me in 2004: &quot;I did not have your phone number but wanted to connec=\r\nt with you. When I was in a trance after meditation, I simply picked up the=\r\n phone and dialed whatever digits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got yo=\r\nu on the phone.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Though I still thought he was crazy, I knew that what=\r\n I had experienced was too profound and the coincidence that it happened so=\r\non after starting to use his maalaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to=\r\n wonder if he was genuine after all, but his manner of speaking was still t=\r\noo weird for me. I never hid my thoughts from him and shared freely.\n&gt; \n&gt; M=\r\ny journey since then has been very interesting and I have shared parts of i=\r\nt on this yahoogroup. Someone said Rajarshi&#39;s mails reminded of Vimalananda=\r\n. There is indeed something Vimalananda-like about Manish. In fact, Manish =\r\nsays he is like a spiritual son to Vimalananda and holds Vimalananda in gre=\r\nat esteem. I don&#39;t know Vimalananda, but I know Manish and I can imagine se=\r\nveral things mentioned by Vimalananda in &quot;Aghora&quot; series books being correc=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite some of his supernatural abilities that I have seen, like t=\r\nhe ability to create a specific mystical experience in someone thousands of=\r\n miles away, he insists that Devi does everything and he is just a small in=\r\nstrument and an observer of Devi&#39;s leelaa and a small player in the big gam=\r\ne of chess being played by Devi. In fact, his main teaching to me was to im=\r\nprove devotion, faith and surrender and give up doership of my actions.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; His teachings are sublime and yet practical. He is not content to explain=\r\n theory, but practically demonstrates the weaknesses of mind and how to ove=\r\nrcome them. Instead of swimming in modern pseudo-vedanta, he made me unders=\r\ntand and appreciate duality and non-duality at the same time. He made me un=\r\nderstand things through experience. He brought great change in my attitude =\r\nand thinking in the last 5.5 years of interaction. He destroyed my biases a=\r\nnd expanded the horizons of my understanding and gave a much better perspec=\r\ntive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most importantly, using me as an instrument, he enabled many sin=\r\ncere spiritual seekers to embrace the ancient Vedic sadhana of rishis - hom=\r\nam or fire ritual for saattwik purposes. He tells me that one lakh (one hun=\r\ndred thousand) people will be doing homam on a regular basis one hundred ye=\r\nars from now.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said at the beginning of this email, inspiring sadh=\r\nana is more important than inspiring awe regarding specific personalities, =\r\nthough the latter sometimes helps with the former.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I will conclude with Manish&#39;s words I mentioned=\r\n before:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone=\r\n is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone =\r\ncan and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody=\r\n could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there=\r\n will be many people who make great progress. World will be a changed place=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;People should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on earth. =\r\nNever give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do whatever yo=\r\nu can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you ca=\r\nn sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana or the othe=\r\nr for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, but keep doin=\r\ng sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =A0 Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =A0 Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 1/18/10=\r\n, chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: chaudhuri.krish=\r\nnendu &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Resected Narasimhaji\n=\r\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, January 18, 2010, 2:06 P=\r\nM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;=\r\n       From time to time various sayings and incidents related to Manishji =\r\nare scattered in this forum and maybe at other places.His site also contain=\r\ns\n&gt; \n&gt; some valuable materials.Will it not be nice to archive them as i fee=\r\nl they are great pieces of inspiration.
