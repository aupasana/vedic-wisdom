After all, opponent in a debate is \ndiffere=\r\nnt from a &quot;questioner&quot; or a disciple seeking spiritual \ndirection.\n \n&gt; The =\r\ntopic of the meeting was something like \n&quot;Concept of God in\n&gt; Hinduism and =\r\nIslam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice \nto the topic by &quot;BEING&quot;\n&gt; an embodiment =\r\nof the very thing that was \nsupposedly the topic of\n&gt; discussion.\n \nIf a yo=\r\ngi has such stature, one can do \n&quot;justice to the topic&quot; without even taking=\r\n part in the debate and just by being \noneself.\n \n*        \n*        *\n \nWh=\r\nen people of little or no understanding were \ndebating Truth/God and mislea=\r\nding the world, great teachers in the past stepped \nin and directed the deb=\r\nate in the right direction, whether it is rishis or \nrecently Aadi Shankara=\r\ncharya or Swami Vivekananda. They had the knack of \nsteering the debate in =\r\na direction that they wanted - a direction that \nwould help establish sanat=\r\nana dharma. They did not tolerate adharma and \nignorance with &quot;polite words=\r\n&quot;. They destroyed adharma and ignorance with the \nsword of detached, and ye=\r\nt firm, actions.\n \nFighting with hatred or anger or agitation in the \nheart=\r\n is bad.

The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept \nof=\r\n God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEI=\r\nNG&quot; \nan embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of discu=\r\nssion. \nThose that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would ha=\r\nve benefited. \n&gt; \n&gt; ************\n&gt; \n&gt; The below part is not for \nRajarshi b=\r\nut may be of interest to everyone, especially those among us that are \ninte=\r\nllectually curious about spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; \n&gt; \nSri Sri al=\r\nways practices &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; \nprin=\r\nciple. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of \npe=\r\nople and Sri Sri will only say very simple things or share some simple joke=\r\ns \nand laughs, but his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for =\r\nthose \nthat are receptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,00=\r\n0 people \ntrading one mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere p=\r\nerson opening \nup to Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough fo=\r\nr that to happen. \nWords are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussio=\r\nns,  the point of \nwords is to create inner silence or illumination and if =\r\nthat is not created, \nthere is no point in talking! \n&gt; \n&gt; It is a great pri=\r\nvilege and an \nimmense blessing to be in the presence of a living Master wh=\r\nether it is Sri Sri \nor someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to the=\r\nm from our Being instead \nof our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s life, there ar=\r\ne innumerable examples of very \nsimple people benefiting from his mere look=\r\ns & presence while big \nintellectuals would debate with him and miss the op=\r\nportunity of a lifetime. \nSometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sr=\r\ni Ramakrishna would feign \nignorance and say what would I know - I am an il=\r\nliterate! What a disaster it \nwould have been for a seeker if he were to la=\r\nbel Sri Ramakrishna as an \nilliterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; \n&gt; Without an accomp=\r\nanying experience \n(at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an exper=\r\nience) accumulating \nknowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet =\r\nanother mental concept and \nwill actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Som=\r\ne of the most subtle and \ndangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by =\r\nnone other than the sadhak&#39;s \nempty concepts of spirituality and God! Thing=\r\ns like lust, greed, anger, etc., \nstand out conspicuously and are in that w=\r\nay less dangerous. \n&gt; \n&gt; \nJai Gurudev!\n&gt;    Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com, \nrajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear \nSiva,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nice mail. \nHowever I have one issue with=\r\n Sri Ravishankar.

I occasionally \nvisit this forum. =\r\nI happened to see several emails about AOL and the below email \nfrom Shri. =\r\nNarasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual \npractices and as a disci=\r\nple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to \nclarify a few things to =\r\nthe extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each l=\r\neading to the destination of \nSat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some u=\r\nse austerities, some use devotion, \netc. AOL is a path, where the path to B=\r\nliss is also blissful. That does not make \nit in any way inferior to paths =\r\nof austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, \nit is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In =\r\nthis path one does not suddenly emerge into \nSatChitAnanda. The personality=\r\n of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the \nsadhak radiates more and more=\r\n as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a se=\r\namless blend of Raja yoga, \nBhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritua=\r\nl practice in AOL is not just \ndoing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is comm=\r\nonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and \nSudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing=\r\n and settling of the mind and preparing \nfor meditation and doing other spi=\r\nritual practices of contemplation, Seva for \nrest of the day wit the right =\r\nattitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya \nremoves / breaks old pattern=\r\ns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; AOL \nincludes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the =\r\nPadma Sadhana sequence of \nasanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations =\r\n(Surya Namaskar) taught in Part \nII or advance courses fall under this cate=\r\ngory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Suda=\r\nrshan Kriya, mudras, \nbandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, =\r\nadvance courses, Sahaj \nsamadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The \nK=\r\nnowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhak=\r\nti \nSutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri S=\r\nri \nRavishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the above. Hi=\r\ns \ncommentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly avai=\r\nlable \ncommentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides =\r\ndaily study \nof Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and \n=\r\ncontemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to become A=\r\nrt of \nLiving teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises \non Surrend=\r\ner and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans \nare =\r\na standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \nSome wonder why AOL charg=\r\nes for these courses and some wonder about lack of a \nSadhguru at every sta=\r\nge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify \nfrom my personal experiences that Sri Sri =\r\nRavishankar is a fully Enlightened \nMaster living in Sahaj Samadhi all time=\r\ns. He is capable of guiding millions of \ndevotees in every step of the sadh=\r\nana without having to be near them in person. \nSeveral get necessary guidan=\r\nce in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), \nsome in person and seve=\r\nral via various other ways. However, to get these \nguidance, an inner conne=\r\nction with the Master is essential. Until that stage, \nthe various AOL cour=\r\nses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on \nvarious Knowledge ar=\r\ne more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where \nconscious inner com=\r\nmunion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL=\r\n teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) \nare yogis of a very high order capabl=\r\ne of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness \nat will during meditation. They =\r\nmay be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, \nbut act as channels of th=\r\ne SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and \nwhen needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept \nthose that left their body as having achieve=\r\nd highest realization such as Sri \nAurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana M=\r\naharishi. However it is a human tendency \nto doubt them when they are in ph=\r\nysical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AO=\r\nL is world&#39;s largest \nvolunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor =\r\nits founder Sri Sri \nRavishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go=\r\n to the charitable \nactivities again run by volunteers. Many of the full ti=\r\nme teachers have given up \nveyr lucrative careers and millions worth in pro=\r\nperty to become teachers and \nteach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither n=\r\needs all the money. All senior AOL \nteachers including Sri Sri have went th=\r\nrough very bad and sometimes even \ndangerous conditions to bring the Knowle=\r\ndge to the masses. This is a time when \nthe highest Knowledge needs to be r=\r\nevealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have=\r\n faced danger to their \nlives by going without any help or guidance to area=\r\ns infested with naxalites, \nterrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palest=\r\nine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. \nwith nothing but love and Divine Grace as th=\r\neir aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses fo=\r\nr two \nreasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that \nthose that pai=\r\nd for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It \nis Sri =\r\nSri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course because \n=\r\nthey cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing several=\r\n AOL \ncourses and know first hand many cases where people took courses for =\r\nfree and \nwere also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disa=\r\nster strikes, \nAOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL=\r\n and teach courses \nfor free and provide healing to the victims.

To him Truth / God is not an article of debate.=\r\n He can show \nthe way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He i=\r\ns not interested in \nanything else. He answers only when there is sincerity=\r\n in the heart of the \nquestioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words =\r\nand let it pass, however \nbig the occasion may be. Most of the questions th=\r\nat were raised in that meeting \nwere answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his=\r\n various commentaries &amp; \ndiscourses year ago!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One may =\r\nask why then did he go to this \nmeeting or whatever it was? The topic of th=\r\ne meeting was something like &quot;Concept \nof God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO,=\r\n Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; \nan embodiment of the very thi=\r\nng that was supposedly the topic of discussion. \nThose that were ready to b=\r\nenefit from it from the audience would have benefited. \n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; *=\r\n***********&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The below part is not for \nRajarshi but may be=\r\n of interest to everyone, especially those among us that are \nintellectuall=\r\ny curious about spirituality than practicing it. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \nSri Sri=\r\n always practices &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; \np=\r\nrinciple. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of =\r\n\npeople and Sri Sri will only say very simple things or share some simple j=\r\nokes \nand laughs, but his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed f=\r\nor those \nthat are receptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100=\r\n,000 people \ntrading one mental concept for another, but prefers one sincer=\r\ne person opening \nup to Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough=\r\n for that to happen. \nWords are secondary and optional. In spiritual discus=\r\nsions,&nbsp; the point of \nwords is to create inner silence or illumination=\r\n and if that is not created, \nthere is no point in talking! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; It is a great privilege and an \nimmense blessing to be in the presence o=\r\nf a living Master whether it is Sri Sri \nor someone else. We gain immensely=\r\n if we listen to them from our Being instead \nof our mind. In Sri Ramakrish=\r\nna&#39; s life, there are innumerable examples of very \nsimple people benefitin=\r\ng from his mere looks &amp; presence while big \nintellectuals would debate =\r\nwith him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. \nSometimes when he counter=\r\ned insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign \nignorance and say what w=\r\nould I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it \nwould have been for a=\r\n seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an \nilliterate and ignoramus=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Without an accompanying experience \n(at least a small gl=\r\nimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating \nknowledge can be v=\r\nery dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept and \nwill actual=\r\nly be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and \ndangerous hin=\r\ndrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s \nempty con=\r\ncepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., \nstand=\r\n out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \nJ=\r\nai Gurudev!&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Siva.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_bl=\r\nank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&lt;/a&gt;, \nrajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Dear \nSiva,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nice mail. \nHowever I have one issue with Sri Ravishankar.

I occasionall=\r\ny \nvisit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the bel=\r\now email \nfrom Shri. Narasimha.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s sp=\r\niritual \npractices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I =\r\nwant to \nclarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; \n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the des=\r\ntination of \nSat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, s=\r\nome use devotion, \netc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blis=\r\nsful. That does not make \nit in any way inferior to paths of austerities. A=\r\ns Sri Aurobindo would call it, \nit is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one doe=\r\ns not suddenly emerge into \nSatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is=\r\n transformed slowly and the \nsadhak radiates more and more as they progress=\r\n more and more.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL=\r\n is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, \nBhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga.=\r\n Spritual practice in AOL is not just \ndoing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it=\r\n is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and \nSudarshan Kriya are done for c=\r\nleansing and settling of the mind and preparing \nfor meditation and doing o=\r\nther spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for \nrest of the day wit th=\r\ne right attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya \nremoves / breaks old=\r\n patterns and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; AOL \nincludes some yoga =\r\nasanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of \nasanas taught in=\r\n DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part \nII or adva=\r\nnce courses fall under this category.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras=\r\n, \nbandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance courses, Sa=\r\nhaj \nsamadhi meditation course, etc.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe \nKnowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada=\r\n Bhakti \nSutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. =\r\nSri Sri \nRavishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the abov=\r\ne. His \ncommentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly=\r\n available \ncommentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Bes=\r\nides daily study \nof Yoga Vashishtam is highly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recommende=\r\nd. Learning and \ncontemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that s=\r\ntrive to become Art of \nLiving teachers.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; The path of AOL emphasises \non Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru par=\r\nampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans \nare a standard feature of AOL satsangs=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nSome wonder why AOL charges for the=\r\nse courses and some wonder about lack of a \nSadhguru at every stage.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify \nfrom my personal experiences=\r\n that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened \nMaster living in Sahaj Sa=\r\nmadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of \ndevotees in every st=\r\nep of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. \nSeveral get ne=\r\ncessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), \nsome in p=\r\nerson and several via various other ways. However, to get these \nguidance, =\r\nan inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, \nthe va=\r\nrious AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on \nvariou=\r\ns Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where \nconsc=\r\nious inner communion with Guru can be established.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis)=\r\n \nare yogis of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciou=\r\nsness \nat will during meditation. They may be not fully established in it l=\r\nike Sri Sri, \nbut act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide =\r\na Sadhak as and \nwhen needed.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is ve=\r\nry easy to accept \nthose that left their body as having achieved highest re=\r\nalization such as Sri \nAurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. Ho=\r\nwever it is a human tendency \nto doubt them when they are in physical form.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its=\r\n courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest \nvolunteer run organization. Neither AOL t=\r\neachers nor its founder Sri Sri \nRavishankar make monitory profits. All the=\r\n proceeds go to the charitable \nactivities again run by volunteers. Many of=\r\n the full time teachers have given up \nveyr lucrative careers and millions =\r\nworth in property to become teachers and \nteach for free. Sri Sri Ravishank=\r\nar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL \nteachers including Sri Sri =\r\nhave went through very bad and sometimes even \ndangerous conditions to brin=\r\ng the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when \nthe highest Knowledge n=\r\needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their \nlives by going =\r\nwithout any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, \nterrorists =\r\nin North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. \nwith not=\r\nhing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; \n&g=\r\nt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two \nreasons.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that \nthose=\r\n that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It=\r\n \nis Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course =\r\nbecause \nthey cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizin=\r\ng several AOL \ncourses and know first hand many cases where people took cou=\r\nrses for free and \nwere also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever nat=\r\nural disaster strikes, \nAOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket =\r\nor by AOL and teach courses \nfor free and provide healing to the victims. A=\r\nOL does not advertise it or make a \nshow of it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and \nnot AOl position. It removes the=\r\n Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers \nwho still may have some do=\r\nership in them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nFinally, Sri Sri is o=\r\nnly interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express \nthe love, joy =\r\nand compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a \npath, any=\r\n path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nSiva.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;position:fixed&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;!-- cg6=\r\n.c4.mail.gq1.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Tue Nov  3 04:54:49 PST 2009 --&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-393555443-1258524392=:49696--\r\n\n"}}
