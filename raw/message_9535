Rao\nSent: 31 July 2013 08:06\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: most difficult question\n\n  \n\nNamaste Durg=\r\nesh,\n \nThere is no single answer. We are always pulled in different directi=\r\nons by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is high=\r\ner and which rina is more important.\n\n \nDepending on one&#39;s individual circu=\r\nmstances, one of the following may be the best option:\n \n(1) Ignore the com=\r\nplaining wife/husband. Don&#39;t fight or argue, but keep doing your sadhana. A=\r\ns time progresses, (a) she may see the positive change in your attitude and=\r\n stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to it and accept her fate, (c)=\r\n she may keep complaining and YOU may get used to that complaints and accep=\r\nt your fate.\n \n(2) Talk to her/him and find some compromise that is accepta=\r\nble. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may be do half hour and spend more ti=\r\nme doing something she likes.\n \n(3) Give up your idea of sadhana and take w=\r\nhatever you are able to do, as sanctioned by your wife/husband, as your sad=\r\nhana. For example, cooking, cleaning dishes, washing clothes, taking her to=\r\n a movie, massaging her feet, taking kids to activities etc can also be sad=\r\nhanas.\n \nAny activity can be done with a protesting/dissenting attitude or =\r\nan agitated mind, or with love and caring and a calm and composed mind. Eve=\r\nry activity involves interacting with some objects. Just as god is in idol =\r\nand fire, he is in vegetables you cut, food you cook, feet you massage etc.=\r\n If you see an action as a chore or look at it or its object(s) with an imp=\r\nure mind (e.g. with lust or with anger or with frustration) or focus more o=\r\nf your attention on yourself, then it becomes impure. If you approach the a=\r\nction with a calm and devoted mind, see the action and its object(s) with l=\r\nove, devotion and caring and focus the more of your attention on the action=\r\n and its objects (rather than youself and your own happiness), then it beco=\r\nmes a ritual or sadhana.\n \nOf course, in some actions one hates, it is very=\r\n difficult to bring that calmness and caring. In some other actions (e.g. s=\r\nex), one may become too selfish or self-absorbed and think too much about o=\r\nne&#39;s own sensations, to look at the action and other persons/objects with l=\r\nove, caring, devotion.\n\n \nThus, we normally don&#39;t talk about converting all=\r\n actions into sadhana and talk about japam, homam etc. It is easier in thos=\r\ne to look at the action and its objects with a sense of purity and devotion=\r\n. However, if that is not possible and one has to do some other actions, wh=\r\ny note TRY to convert them into sadhana? Try to perform the action with a c=\r\nalm, stable, selfless mind, focus attention on the action and its objects a=\r\nnd imbibe love and caring into your thinking.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn fa=\r\nct, at some stage, (3) has to become part of one&#39;s sadhana. One has to conv=\r\nert every action into a sadhana. Just doing japam or homam for an hour or t=\r\nwo may not cut it.\n \nIf you live in a really cold country, your room can ge=\r\nt very cold. If you turn the heater on for an hour everyday and keep it off=\r\n rest of the time, the room will overall be very cold. Similarly, if you do=\r\n sadhana for an hour, you may feel better, but the normal attitude returns.=\r\n To make permanent progress, the heater has to be on most of the day! Of co=\r\nurse, as you cannot do japam or homam for 12 hours a day, you have to conve=\r\nrt whatever you do (eating, driving to work, your work, driving back, cooki=\r\nng, eating, talking to people, etc) into sadhana. At some stage, every seek=\r\ner will have to start doing it.\n\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrolo=\r\ngy & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/&gt;\n--------\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n________________________________\n\n=\r\n\tFrom: Durgesh Mishra &lt;durgesh.mishra@...&gt;\n\tTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com \n\tSent: Tuesday, July 30, 2013 11:43 AM\n\tSubject: [vedic-wisdom] mo=\r\nst difficult question\n\t\n\n\t  \n\tDear All,\n\n\tIf you are interested in spiritua=\r\nl sadhana, dhyaan, homam, fasting etc and your spouse doesn&#39;t like you doin=\r\ng it ? then what should you do ? \n\n\tRegards\n\tDurgesh O Mishra\n\t\n\n\t-- \n\t&quot;If =\r\nyou only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&quot; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
