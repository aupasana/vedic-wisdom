Any big changes =\r\nin lifestyle or in one&#39;s body-mind complex can aggravate vaata in people of=\r\n any dosha type. If one is already prone to vaata dosha, then it can be eve=\r\nn worse.\n=C2=A0&lt;The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously com=\r\nmon- I&#39;m sure this does no good for vata.&gt;\n\n=C2=A0\nYes, it is a terrible id=\r\nea. It not only aggravates vaata heavily, but increases ama (toxic buildup)=\r\n in the system. Vaata is one big problem and ama is another, which mess up =\r\none&#39;s digestion and kill appetite. Once the digestive fire becomes weak, sy=\r\nstem goes haywire and all other problems arise. Vaata pacifying food and he=\r\nrbs in addition to a lifestyle that reduces toxic buildup may be helpful. D=\r\netoxification and things like panchakarma can be helpful. Simple habits lik=\r\ne drinking hot Triphala tea every night can detoxify and make a big differe=\r\nnce in overall well-being.\n\n=C2=A0\n&lt;Can anti-psychotic medication be helpfu=\r\nl/harmful in the kundalini \npatient? Most doctors label kundalini problems =\r\nas &quot;psychosis&quot; and will \nadvise anti-psychotics&gt;\n=C2=A0\nForget about one wi=\r\nth Kundalini experiences that one could not handle/digest and in trouble no=\r\nw. Even one with normal psychotic issues may not be well served by the toxi=\r\nc combinations created by modern medicine, which I am afraid does not under=\r\nstand &quot;mind&quot; as well as Ayurveda did. IMHO, ayurveda has better tools to tr=\r\neat problems of the mind. While herbs like Jataamaamsi, Shankhapushpi, Aswa=\r\ngandha etc can do a good job of addressing the root causes of the instabili=\r\nty in the nervous system when administered properly, modern drugs only put =\r\n&quot;band-aids&quot; on the symptoms arising from those root causes. One may do well=\r\n to locate a good ayurvedic doctor IMHO.\n=C2=A0Best regards,\n\nNarasimha\n---=\r\n-----\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--=\r\n------\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunr=\r\nise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Friday, Mar=\r\nch 1, 2013 5:23 PM\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;That was an interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apart =\r\nkundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include simi=\r\nlar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot =\r\nexperience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these h=\r\nallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic=\r\n test. \n&gt;\n&gt;However most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-=\r\nseeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... th=\r\neir stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hea=\r\nr voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. \n&gt;\n&gt;About vata, mo=\r\nst of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are u=\r\nsually unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata dera=\r\nngement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. Th=\r\ne use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this=\r\n does no good for vata.\n&gt;\n&gt;The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will =\r\ndo some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to =\r\nany patient. \n&gt;\n&gt;Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the ku=\r\nndalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and w=\r\nill advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will=\r\n not harm them, though I doubt it will help.\n&gt;\n&gt;Advice and thoughts from al=\r\nl members would be much appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt;Om Dum Durgayai Namaha\n&gt;\n&gt;Aparna\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

See all the saints. You are unlikely to see even one who lived a=\r\n life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(when looked at b=\r\ny an external observer). However the internal joy of Kundalini is something=\r\n which fills that saint so completely that some great ones were completely =\r\nunaware of their external problems.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awaken=\r\ns it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini ri=\r\nse to a baby being thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy =\r\nis tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that=\r\n it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;The problem with adults is that they have to learn surrender. This surren=\r\ndering of ego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painless process=\r\n unlike that of the baby.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real=C2=A0s=\r\nurges&quot; of energy may=C2=A0result=C2=A0in mental havoc.=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nSecondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the conce=\r\npt of japa.

That should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The =\r\nLord of the Muladhara.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-tw=\r\no years.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On =\r\nFriday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

I=\r\nt is just A SMALL\n&gt;&gt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small=\r\n dilapidated house (this\n&gt;&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized =\r\nSelf) may first construct the palace over time and move into it when it is =\r\nCOMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace sti=\r\nll under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini=\r\n rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former appr=\r\noach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towa=\r\nrds complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These ar=\r\ne not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting suf=\r\nficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in =\r\na previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be get=\r\nting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it=\r\n!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not =\r\nto fancy too many specific\n&gt;&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in gra=\r\nnting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you righ=\r\nt now, arising from YOUR\n&gt;&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes giv=\r\nes you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something els=\r\ne. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born =\r\nas a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and=\r\n pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very health=\r\ny, but not have any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt;&gt; case, one may deeply=\r\n desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog =\r\nand act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt;&gt; experience. Basical=\r\nly, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; so=\r\nmething they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundali=\r\nni, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kunda=\r\nlini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, o=\r\nne may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify =\r\n(if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, =\r\nif one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it pa=\r\nnicked so badly and started to shake violently.

If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be anothe=\r\nr notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g.=\r\n a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an=\r\n extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul=\r\n who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who =\r\nwill rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deep=\r\nly clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some =\r\nsigns of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning ma=\r\ny accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious p=\r\nsychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kunda=\r\nlini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n&gt;&gt;  weaknesses and improv=\r\ne your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is =\r\nnot disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the o=\r\nther side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt;&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry =\r\nabout whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 b=\r\nondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt;&gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increa=\r\nsing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you a=\r\nre still making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (you=\r\nr self-awareness) \n&gt;&gt; will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lor=\r\nd (true Self).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on=\r\n surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most p=\r\neople do not have it. They simply do business with god.

There is something you want and you ask god for it. True su=\r\nrrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True su=\r\nrrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. T=\r\nrue surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pl=\r\neasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. =\r\nTrue surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in t=\r\nhe face of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrend=\r\ner and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, on=\r\ne may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that =\r\ngod does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protectin=\r\ng or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; examp=\r\nle above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s c=\r\nonditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s\n&gt;&gt;  protection! God&#39;s protectio=\r\nn may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away=\r\n from!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the=\r\n path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment.

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that =\r\ncompose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates int=\r\no more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger=\r\n, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happen=\r\ns, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotio=\r\nn of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the jou=\r\nrney. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it r=\r\neally does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things =\r\nand entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them ar=\r\ne useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its o=\r\nwn ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and m=\r\niss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n&gt;&gt;  vi=\r\ntal. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Ku=\r\nndalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are =\r\nbecause of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is pueril=\r\ne and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometim=\r\nes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle in=\r\nfluences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; =\r\ndue to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma e=\r\ntc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they=\r\n have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex an=\r\nd various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every opt=\r\nion. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can hav=\r\ne the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do =\r\nso, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n work.\n&gt;&gt;  Somet=\r\nimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the=\r\n starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used=\r\n to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnan=\r\nto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February=\r\n 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndro=\r\nme based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychia=\r\ntry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems=\r\n to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since chil=\r\ndhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in th=\r\ne body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until =\r\nher symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been =\r\nable to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it m=\r\night be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentall=\r\ny ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontan=\r\neous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into thi=\r\ns topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well=\r\n-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;  kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken t=\r\nhe kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundal=\r\nini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at tim=\r\nes because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it w=\r\nill consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered wha=\r\nt solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to th=\r\ne Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of=\r\n this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. Ma=\r\ny I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others=\r\n like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. An=\r\nd let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ou=\r\nrselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps =\r\nsafest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n&gt;&gt;  risin=\r\ng bit to God&#39;s will.

It not only aggra=\r\nvates vaata heavily, but increases ama (toxic buildup) in the system. Vaata=\r\n is one big problem and ama is another, which mess up one&#39;s digestion and k=\r\nill appetite. Once the digestive fire becomes weak, system goes\n haywire an=\r\nd all other problems arise. Vaata pacifying food and herbs in addition to a=\r\n lifestyle that reduces toxic buildup may be helpful. Detoxification and th=\r\nings like panchakarma can be helpful. Simple habits like drinking hot Triph=\r\nala tea every night can detoxify and make a big difference in overall well-=\r\nbeing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;\nCan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini \np=\r\natient?

While herbs like Jataamaamsi,=\r\n Shankhapushpi, Aswagandha etc can do a good job of addressing the root cau=\r\nses of the instability in the nervous system when administered properly, mo=\r\ndern drugs only put &quot;band-aids&quot; on the symptoms arising from those root cau=\r\nses.

Feat=\r\nures of both include similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling t=\r\nhings that others cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hal=\r\nlucinations&quot;.

They are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat =\r\n(poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try and help with this wit=\r\nh medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannabis and other drugs is a=\r\nlso notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this does no good for vata.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe G=\r\nanapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on her behalf as (for ob=\r\nvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCan anti-=\r\npsychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini patient?

Niyama=\r\n is very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you. in actual fact, t=\r\nhat is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However,&nbsp;the hold of the I ness on e=\r\nverything is so tremendous that its difficult to let go enough that you can=\r\n allow this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;=\r\nt imagine such a force, because they are conditioned to think in words, mos=\r\nt psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God completely anyway.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThis,&nbsp;combined with the fact that for&nbsp;most people, Kundalini is n=\r\not wanted because these people&nbsp;want the objects which God can give, no=\r\nt God Herself, means that the scope for misunderstanding is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but most are unable to realise that &quot;ma=\r\nterial objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely to see even o=\r\nne who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(wh=\r\nen looked at by an external observer). However the internal joy of Kundalin=\r\ni is something which fills that saint so completely that some great ones we=\r\nre completely unaware of their external problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;When Kundali=\r\nni (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes&nb=\r\nsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by the parent. =\r\nThe baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is comple=\r\nte. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s fee=\r\nling is that of joy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they have=\r\n to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother takes ti=\r\nme and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;That=\r\n results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;result&n=\r\nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secondl=\r\ny, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of j=\r\napa. Japa which deals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can cau=\r\nse serious instability in these people.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;=\r\npeople who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they have=\r\nn&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and think that the faking=\r\n of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the eye of the general=\r\n public.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, for =\r\nany doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must precede a=\r\nny attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to fi=\r\nnish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habits=\r\n, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp;that =\r\nmust be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is es=\r\nsential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totally calm=\r\n Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases may=\r\n be useful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati an=\r\nd the nava grahas to be performed by the patient.

It is just A SMALL&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s curre=\r\nnt limited identity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give a=\r\nn analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first constr=\r\nuct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately,=\r\n if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction =\r\n(analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achie=\r\nvement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one =\r\nloses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-real=\r\nization without any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but M=\r\naharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting s=\r\nufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise i=\r\nn a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be g=\r\netting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want =\r\nit!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;A=\r\ns you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  desires. Nat=\r\nure has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints =\r\non what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  OWN prev=\r\nious actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you n=\r\no longer want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for grea=\r\nt wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next l=\r\nife. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the l=\r\nife after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or mone=\r\ny. In another &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film=\r\n. One may be reborn &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film,=\r\n but not really enjoy that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; experience. Basically, people keep goi=\r\nng in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;m=\r\nissing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Ku=\r\nndalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising =\r\nKundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS li=\r\nfe, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fruc=\r\ntify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-p=\r\nrepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it a=\r\nnd it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it f=\r\nrom a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mous=\r\ne trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a cer=\r\ntain slow death!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas abou=\r\nt who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we a=\r\nre this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of th=\r\nat at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without be=\r\ning scared?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable con=\r\nditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Kundalini rise forced w=\r\nhen some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic n=\r\notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried d=\r\neeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one ov=\r\nercomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s bo=\r\ndy-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a g=\r\nreat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if=\r\n one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the wor=\r\nld, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the worl=\r\nd now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any suc=\r\nh notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress an=\r\nd yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditionin=\r\ng may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serio=\r\nus psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best appro=\r\nach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do=\r\n sadhana, overcome your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment ov=\r\ner time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or dista=\r\nste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of=\r\n attachment. It is a negative attachment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; whether your Kundalin=\r\ni rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemi=\r\nes (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not. If your abil=\r\nity to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kun=\r\ndalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you completely o=\r\nvercome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will automatically =\r\nascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One =\r\nword on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful,=\r\n most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though peopl=\r\ne may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give=\r\n it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please p=\r\nrotect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you want =\r\nand you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, d=\r\nemands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascinati=\r\non for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord thr=\r\nows one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasa=\r\nd and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fasc=\r\nination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many des=\r\nires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapp=\r\ned, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to=\r\n &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If=\r\n you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was tryi=\r\nng to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes on=\r\ne *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to =\r\na conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dis=\r\npassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken=\r\n away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be pre=\r\npared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental c=\r\nonditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kun=\r\ndalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s =\r\nnadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from mee=\r\nting True Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is ho=\r\nw light your conditioning is.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best=\r\n regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________=\r\n________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wi=\r\nsdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Se=\r\nnt: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nb=\r\nsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakthi and saranaga=\r\nthi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of=\r\n the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas with out any perso=\r\nnal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner pla=\r\nnes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are under the prot=\r\nection of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturbances will defini=\r\ntely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts=\r\n of purification of the various elements that compose the human mind-body s=\r\ntructure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, more equan=\r\nimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - On=\r\nce and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identi=\r\nfy with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind =\r\nis must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very=\r\n helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open=\r\n up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some of which a=\r\nre not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a c=\r\nhance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of in=\r\nhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence =\r\nconstant Bhuta-suddhi\n becomes even more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  vital. 4 - While someday=\r\n or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekeni=\r\nng and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The h=\r\numan psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to =\r\ndeal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an=\r\n individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us =\r\nto remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons=\r\n, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow fre=\r\ne assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of causi=\r\nng serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities=\r\n are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if=\r\n such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge =\r\nto rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing no=\r\nthing more than an intelligent guess\n work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Sometimes it will hav=\r\ne results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point =\r\nis a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens s=\r\nana in corpore sano. -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam many=\r\nantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Fro=\r\nm: sunrise_1080  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just =\r\nwanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience o=\r\nf a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been =\r\ninvolved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneou=\r\ns awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-bo=\r\ndy experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origi=\r\nn and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searc=\r\nhed for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically w=\r\nrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to derang=\r\ned kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as havin=\r\ng a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has=\r\n triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. =\r\nUnfortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, a=\r\nnd as we have no treatments for\n deranged&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  kundalini, we struggle =\r\nto help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience=\r\n with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly =\r\nwakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering fr=\r\nom the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is =\r\nsomething she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be t=\r\no her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manife=\r\nsts as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cur=\r\ne her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good s=\r\namaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not =\r\nknow of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our =\r\nsadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is wh=\r\ny the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be yo=\r\nur instrument&quot; and leave the\n kundalini&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s will.=\r\n Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nReply via web post  Reply to sender   Reply to group   Start a New Topic  M=\r\nessages in this topic (5)  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Recent Activity: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--61789334-1896835615-1362281911=:96666--\r\n\n"}}
