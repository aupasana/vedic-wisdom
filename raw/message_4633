Now, I need guidance from you in some aspects, if you could help me.=\r\n \n\n\n\n1. I have two sons, whose upanayanam is done. I want them make them do=\r\n a homam with thousand times Gayatri mantra while I want to chant the mantr=\r\na with them. Can I also join in the homam? \n\n\n\n2. Can you guide us how to r=\r\necite the mahasankalpa, kAnDa rishi tarpaNas etc. (essentially the whole up=\r\nAkarma procedure, if possible)\n\n\n\nAlso, I was told that upakarma is done be=\r\ncause vedas are not supposed to be studied in uttarAyana (as this time is e=\r\narmarked for studying shad-angas and other sastras/itihasas), but vedic sch=\r\nools do study anyway because they must finish the syllabus in time and henc=\r\ne as a prAyaschitta they do perform this upAkarma. But now a days, with no =\r\none studying vedas, (at least in our family) is it still relevant to do thi=\r\ns? In any case, I think it is a good idea at least to change the sacred thr=\r\nead and chant the Gayatri mantra to the best of our ability on that day. Co=\r\nuld you please advise us as to how to carry out that project? \n\n\n\nAlso, I h=\r\nave one trivial question, what is &quot;dwitIya parArthE&quot; ? as it comes in dwitI=\r\nya parArthE, swEtha varAha kalpE, vaivaswata manvantarE .... and so on.
