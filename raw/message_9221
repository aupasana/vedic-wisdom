betw=\r\neen every lines of chalisa. that makes hanumanji extremely pleased.\n\nI had =\r\nheard for siddhi for hanuman chalisa one has to take sankalp for 100times f=\r\nor 100days and then one gets tested also during the sadhana. better to have=\r\n a guru and do such things under his guidance only. \n\nOne of my friends nan=\r\naji did this for 10-15 yrs i guess and lot of people used to hear deep brea=\r\nths and panting sounds around him, many even saw shadow or something of han=\r\numanji around him. also if someone used to get affected by some ghosts n st=\r\nuff, his mere step in that home used to drive the ghosts away....\n\nIn case =\r\nof bajarang baan, its supposedly tantrik+sabar in nature so its very potent=\r\n. doing such stuff is like riding a heavy motorcycle so u need a guru and s=\r\nome helmet and stuff. ideally have a tantra guru. then before reading u nee=\r\nd to do short ram-sita-laxman puja, something like &quot;sri ram jai ram jai jai=\r\n ram&quot; 51/108 times. then do the paths and again the 108 times the mantra. a=\r\nlso on the alter keep small red cloth as asan coz hanumanji will come and w=\r\nould like to have a seat. keep daas bhav and thank him profoundly and say s=\r\norry later. whatever u offer him as prasad people keep tulsi on top. and ba=\r\nth is MUST.\n\nregards\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ramakrishnan Kri=\r\nshnamurthy &lt;ramki108@...&gt;
