Past, present and future; &gt;here, =\r\nthere and everywhere; I, you and others, this possibility, &gt;that possibilit=\r\ny and yet another possibility - all are accessible &gt;and fully &quot;known&quot; to Hi=\r\ns self-awareness.\n\n2)&gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, there is=\r\n certainly &gt;something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by the &gt;=\r\nreactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do have &gt;a scop=\r\ne for engaging in different actions at this time.\n\nThe above are main two p=\r\noints if understood and linked can give clarity.\n\nyou have brought to me a =\r\nvery FRESH Knowledge that most of Yogi&#39;s can find out one or two possibilit=\r\nies of future depending upon the space-time cycle zone in which their consc=\r\niouness can access. a really advance yogi can see more possibilities of fut=\r\nure events due to their access of more time cycles. BUT please explain to m=\r\ne about the supreme cosmic being who is a sole link between Dual and Non-du=\r\nal self. now as you have mentioned (pl. refer to no.1 above) he is all know=\r\ner so every possibility is known to him and not only every possibility but =\r\neven every action going to be taken in a perticular Space-time zone and wha=\r\nt the eventual result. we call him by Naraayana/Shiva/Bhagavati/GOD/Allah/G=\r\nanapati (As per Atharvashirsh) and many such names depending on our faiths.=\r\n   \n\nThe point no.1 indicates that HE is all knower and point no.2 indicate=\r\ns that Free will is certainly there at our Spac-time level. Now if ONE BEIN=\r\nG knows everything including EXACT action and EXACT REACTION, then would it=\r\n be really called free will ULTIMATELY? i know that it can be argued that H=\r\nE ONLY KNOWS but DOES NOT INTERFEAR and hence Free will exist but then what=\r\n is the meaning of the verses in the context of the topic...\n&quot;Mohyante Mohi=\r\ntaashchaiv Mohameshyanti chaapare...&quot;\n&quot;Mamatvagartetimahaandhakaare Vibhraa=\r\nmayatyetadativ Vishvam&quot;\n&quot;Tannatra vismay kaaryo yoganidra jagatpate\nMahaama=\r\nayaa Hareshchaishaa tayaa sammohyate jagat&quot;\n\n&quot;....Mrigtrushna bhramayati&quot; o=\r\nf Gita\n\nplease forgive me for wiritng all these things but it is very diffi=\r\ncult for me to really reconcile and i think you are the only help for me.\n\n=\r\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R=\r\n. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; But my question is because I ca=\r\nnnot reconcile this with freewill.\n&gt; &gt; Both cannot be correct. It is either=\r\n this or that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are correct, but at different levels. I will elabo=\r\nrate. However, this is philosophically complex and those who do not follow =\r\nwhat I say should not worry at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Non-dual =\r\nself has no division of self into various objects or space or time. There i=\r\ns no concept of time or space or space-time continuum within non-dual self.=\r\n A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of space or time or objectif=\r\nication.\n&gt; \n&gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non-dual=\r\nity. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the entire=\r\n field of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time c=\r\nontinua within the field of duality exist within Him. From the perspective =\r\nof supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are His parts and all=\r\n their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will. As all space-time con=\r\ntinua are within Him, there is nothing that is unknown to Him. Past, presen=\r\nt and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you and others, this possibili=\r\nty, that possibility and yet another possibility - all are accessible and f=\r\nully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, let us come lower and into th=\r\ne field of duality. The field of duality consists of infinite divisions of =\r\nspace, time and space-time continua. There are infinite possibilities withi=\r\nn this field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within duality have a line=\r\nar sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. Howe=\r\nver, field of duality also contains planes of consciousness where different=\r\n senses of time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at va=\r\nrious points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time continuum in =\r\nsuch a plane of consciousness may experience a point of time that maps to a=\r\n future time in a regular space-time continuum being experienced by you. Al=\r\nso, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 year in another s=\r\npace-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entity as one may t=\r\nhink. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space-time continua=\r\n and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s =\r\nself-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a spec=\r\nific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality. Bu=\r\nt relaity consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each othe=\r\nr. These are all different possibilities and you chart out your course base=\r\nd on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt; \n&gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is in a different space-tim=\r\ne continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as per t=\r\nhe space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspective of th=\r\ne space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future time is n=\r\not yet known and depends on your current action.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a yogi in a differ=\r\nent space-time continuum has seen your state in future, his observation is =\r\nmerely an observation and from his reference frame. It has no causal relati=\r\nonship to your current action or your future state. He is merely an observe=\r\nr and he does not cause anything to happen. His observation is specific to =\r\nsome space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-time pairs that you =\r\nwill traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair where he observed =\r\nyou (if at all you do!).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us go further. I=\r\ns there only one future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by yo=\r\nu in space-time continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can=\r\n your actions at important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIf so, what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is=\r\n his observation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can on=\r\ne observe a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is t=\r\nhat correct? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time contin=\r\nua contained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some great =\r\nrishis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at =\r\nthe same time, i.e. they can see various possibilities based on various pos=\r\nsible actions. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just =\r\none possibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline: At the level at =\r\nwhich we exist, there is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the =\r\nlimits imposed by the reactions given by nature to your own previous action=\r\ns, you do have a scope for engaging in different actions at this time. Depe=\r\nnding on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly different. =\r\nSome actions can even make the future significantly different. A rishi may =\r\nbe able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possibilities fo=\r\nr future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibilitie=\r\ns upto 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few possib=\r\nilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few moves =\r\nor guessing a future position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the enti=\r\nre field of possibilities, as they all exist within Him.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, your=\r\n actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your con=\r\nsciousness!) some of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilitie=\r\ns quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come to fruition, b=\r\nut it is your actions that actually make some of those possibilities a real=\r\nity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----=\r\n- \n&gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent=\r\n: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;         Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; \n&gt;         No doubt a wonderful and insp=\r\niring mail for all of us, however, I could not help it that an inevitable q=\r\nuestion popped up in my mind. One of the oft discussed and eternal question=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt;         If events have already been created like in a movie and lat=\r\ner as time unfolds, they happen in our plane of existence, then all talk of=\r\n freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in reali=\r\nty does not exist!\n&gt; \n&gt;         I am not questioning that what you wrote in=\r\n the mail about events having already happened, because same has been said =\r\nby other great spiritual people in the world. \n&gt; \n&gt;         But my question=\r\n is because I cannot reconcile this with a freewill. Both cannot be correct=\r\n. It is either this or that.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Theoritically speaking, say tomor=\r\nrow suddenly majority of the world reforms itself, does a self correction e=\r\nxercise and brings in peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Ava=\r\ntar still incarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our=\r\n texts say - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;         Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any cho=\r\nice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;         So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt;         The upsurge (of co=\r\nnsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Na=\r\nrasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;           From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt;\n&gt;           Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homa=\r\nm, purity and overcoming ego\n&gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n           Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Namaste,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;           I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short =\r\nChandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the follow=\r\ning mail:\n&gt; \n&gt;           http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/mess=\r\nage/ 761\n&gt; \n&gt;           This boy was born and brought up in US and is not p=\r\nroficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of =\r\nthe ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who a=\r\nnd a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with whit=\r\ne clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and=\r\n he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           This boy is usuall=\r\ny playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, I =\r\nsaw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the episod=\r\ne mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; \n&gt;           I asked what he was thinking.=\r\n He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already happen=\r\ned. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later when the t=\r\nime comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pre=\r\ntended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           He said,=\r\n &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be =\r\noverly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is usu=\r\nally cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was=\r\n onto something today. But he could not express himself.\n&gt; \n&gt;           I h=\r\nelped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at some lev=\r\nel, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie m=\r\nay have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have alread=\r\ny seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happen=\r\ning in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           H=\r\ne exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is going to h=\r\nappen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody may be able=\r\n to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along these =\r\nlines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision over the fire=\r\n was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. Given his age =\r\nand ability to think and understand things, this probably seemed like an od=\r\ndity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. So he was try=\r\ning to think how it was possible and came to some important conclusions abo=\r\nut &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Time seems linear at the level of =\r\nregular consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the conce=\r\npt of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is establish=\r\ned in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;        =\r\n   The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama =\r\nmantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were =\r\nmeditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It=\r\n was quite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy m=\r\nade my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely e=\r\nxpressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time =\r\nto leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; \n&gt;           I had experienced t=\r\nhe same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the sa=\r\nme energy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doin=\r\ng a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportu=\r\nnity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within=\r\n 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped=\r\n by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the th=\r\nree occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n    Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy r=\r\nemarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest =\r\nhomam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just =\r\nfelt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           This boy p=\r\nerformed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in m=\r\nanuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerful energy ma=\r\nnifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most important =\r\nthing.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a rit=\r\nual better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one=\r\n has to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Keep perform=\r\ning your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purit=\r\ny as you engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiri=\r\ntual progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes sm=\r\naller, you can resist attraction to external things better and you can resi=\r\nst internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your d=\r\nharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the r=\r\noot cause of all problems.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           Overcoming e=\r\ngo using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. =\r\nThink that all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, spou=\r\nse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a tempo=\r\nrary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, =\r\nbut without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant take=\r\ns very good care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all th=\r\nose things as his or her belongings.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Realize that thinking o=\r\nf things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant=\r\n who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. Whe=\r\nn a thing is taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying.=\r\n A servant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anyt=\r\nime. This enables one to do the best job with what one possesses and not wo=\r\nrry about what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n         Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s pr=\r\noperties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without getting caugh=\r\nt and overcome ego.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Best regards,\n&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;   =\r\n        ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; =\r\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam=\r\n\n&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ t=\r\narpana\n&gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom\n&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast=\r\n. net\n&gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\n nath.org\n&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- -\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
