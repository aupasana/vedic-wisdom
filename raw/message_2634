Can a Guru help us? He took Jiddu Krishnamurthy&#39; s v=\r\niew on this. JK claims that a guru can not help any one and the self realis=\r\nation has to come from with in. My friend is asking, if a Guru is useless a=\r\ns JK claims, why did JK write so many books (no offence to JK followers)&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. If a person has to realise on himself, how it c=\r\nan be?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. If the fact is that there is no I but =\r\nfor Brahman, why all this Maya? Why is Braham that is me has to go through =\r\nthe misery and in the end\n realise that he is Brahman? Why not Brahman be B=\r\nrahman and not create any thing?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I could not giv=\r\ne convincing answers to any of the questions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Be=\r\nst regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vijay&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Connect more, do mor=\r\ne and share more with Yahoo!
