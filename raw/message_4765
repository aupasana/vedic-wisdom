I received fantastic comp=\r\nliments from several learned people, both from west and India, for a clear =\r\nand balanced presentation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A writeup that tries to capture that prese=\r\nntation is now available for a free download. If you are interested, please=\r\n go to:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/homamwhy (tinyurl dot com slash homamwhy)\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you want the full link, use the following:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/homam/homam_why.pdf\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you find the writeup useful, ple=\r\nase feel free to benefit from it and pass the word around. Otherwise, kindl=\r\ny ignore.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, I followed up this presentation with a two hour practi=\r\ncal workshop, where I explained the why and how of homam and did a practica=\r\nl demonstration. According to the organizers, that workshop was the most at=\r\ntended event of the entire conference. My goal was to inspire some people t=\r\no perform a quick 20 min homam by themselves on a regular basis.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; PVR Narasimha Rao\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Less=\r\nons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for shor=\r\nt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt;        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;    =\r\n    Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
