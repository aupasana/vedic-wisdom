Pleas=\r\ne forgive me/ignore me for I do not have ability to write systematically an=\r\nd i write things from my own experiences.\n\n***\nIf one wishes to know the be=\r\nnefits of Chandi path, one can simply go though 11th chapter later part and=\r\n 12th chapter where in Mother herself describes those.\n***\nI started Chandi=\r\n path in Jan 2008 (As per tradition) unplanned-with my own intuition and wi=\r\nthout any initiation (I even did not know that Initiation is required for C=\r\nP). I went ahead to complete 108 consecutive days of recitation.\nAfter that=\r\n, within few months a Guru came in my life and also Agni Sadhana. Since the=\r\nn Chandi-path (whether In terms of Simple recitation or Chandi Havan) is pa=\r\nrt of my daily life. \nA couple of years back, My Guru told me that 13 chapt=\r\ners are the most important part and it is ok to recite 13 chapters and skip=\r\n other limbs. So I started reciting 13 chapters only-daily. It was taking 1=\r\n hour 20 minutes earlier which has come down to 50 minutes and loud recitat=\r\nion has changed to mental recitation.\n***\nThough I was reciting CP daily si=\r\nnce a long time, nobody from my near ones was interested in that. I never f=\r\norced or even insisted anybody to do that. I knew the hard fact that spendi=\r\nng 2/3 hours of time daily is almost not possible for people.\nAs it happene=\r\nd one day in Jan 2010, I forced my sister to recite CP over a phone convers=\r\nation. I say I forced her because I told her that If she loves me sincerely=\r\n, She must start Chandi Path recitation and to make her start that I sudden=\r\nly got one idea. I asked her to recite Kavach and one chapter in Rotation d=\r\naily. Kavach+1st ch, Kavach+2nd ch=85.Kavach+13 ch. Kavach+1st Ch and so on=\r\n=85.She accepted the idea and started. Thank you so much to MAA that she st=\r\narted. Violation of traditional way never crossed my mind and never bothere=\r\nd me. Maa is very kind. Very compassionate. She did not let down me. My Sis=\r\nter, just after few weeks of recitation started getting strange happy world=\r\nly results (Sattwik though) and she got a miraculous relief from a issue wh=\r\nich was troubling her for many years. That Initial encouragement was enough=\r\n to cement her faith and since then she is doing recitation on daily basis =\r\n(same way).\nAfter that trigger, one by one many people started CP same way.=\r\n My wife, Brother, his wife, few distant relatives, few close friends and f=\r\new colleagues. More than Dozen people are now reciting it daily.\n\nMany of t=\r\nhe above mentioned people who started CP actually got some instant surprisi=\r\nng material results which cemented their faith which was very strong factor=\r\n that is keeping them reciting it daily. \nFor Instance, One lady whose daug=\r\nhter was not having child even after 5 years of marriage, called my wife on=\r\ne day and asked her to check with me her daughter&#39;s chart for the progeny. =\r\nInstead of seeing the chart, I asked my wife to convey that let her start r=\r\neading CP daily (Kavch+1 ch). It so happened that she said started CP on 1s=\r\nt day of chaitri Navaratri and on the same day she got good news from her d=\r\naughter.\nAnother lady, suffering from sever problems in marriage is now get=\r\nting very encouraging results regarding her marital life. Even I feel that =\r\nit is a kind of miracle because it was a hopeless situation for her.\n***\nI =\r\nam not saying here that all the apparent good things will happen if one sta=\r\nrts reciting CP. I also do not wish to discount importance of traditional m=\r\nethod of reciting CP. I myself started that way and did it for almost coupl=\r\ne of years. However I definitely wish to stress a point that Mother is very=\r\n-very kind. Especially in times we live in, she would not look for perfect =\r\nritualistic method for Chandi recitation even though people recite in hope =\r\nof some material (reasonable) benefits.\nIn fact, I have gone through major =\r\nmaterial and spiritual problems since I started Chandi Path and Havan. Howe=\r\nver for me, I most of the times never thought for benefits and keep going w=\r\nith CP as I think I have started loving her. I started CP because I wanted =\r\nto progress spiritually.\n\n It is my strong faith (developed due to my exper=\r\niences as well as some sound logic) that in Kaliyuga, recitation of CP with=\r\n some level of devotion is enough and more important than traditional techn=\r\nicalities such as particular Method, specific range of voice, speed,Initiat=\r\nion etc=85\n\nSo friends, it is important to start Loving mother. If you are =\r\nbogged down by idea of complete Chandi path daily then start with 1 ch or 2=\r\n ch or 3 ch + Kavach daily or which ever way suitable to you. As Vimalanand=\r\na, a great devotee of Mother, used to fondly say=85carve your own niche! \nO=\r\nnce you start it, Maa will take care and provide further guidance as when r=\r\nequired. Leave it to her. Eventually start ignoring results and keep doing =\r\nwhatever may be the results. My concluding comments are that Chandi Path is=\r\n &quot;Sab dukho ki ek dawaa&quot; =96 It&#39;s a sure shot Rama-bana.\n  \nWhile at the mo=\r\nment when Shani dewa is on the verge of entering Tula Rashi (Uchha Rashi-Uc=\r\nhha Navamansha as per SSS), I pray to Maa Chandi to drive many more closer =\r\nto her by easiest & one of her most effective instrument called Chandi-Path=\r\n. \n\n\n\n"}}
