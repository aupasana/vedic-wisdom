As you pointed out, on a look at surface\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (at the levelof text), it means which many belives but you and me need\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to look at little deeper. A person who did the world of Good to Indias\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ordinary masses by rewriting the whole Ramayana in a language which\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npeople (from north) could easily understand, The man who gave immortal\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&#39;Hanumaan Chalisa&#39; can not be lebeled so casually as &#39;Nari basher&#39; or\n&gt; &gt; &#39;=\r\nShudra Hater&#39; (As Mayaavati brand poticians would capitalise).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reg=\r\narding your questions of why Pashu are only Nari and not Nara....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI think he was reffering to Men with the words Ganvaar and Shudra and\n&gt; &gt; P=\r\nashu Nari must be a joint statement. Again as you already know, Shudra\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwas not B.C., OBC, KBC, HSBC etc.. :-). but a fallen man, a mean\n&gt; &gt; thinki=\r\nng man. I have to agree if you say that Ganvaar and Shudra can\n&gt; &gt; also be =\r\nsaid about Woaman however looking at the Doha and general\n&gt; &gt; prevailing co=\r\nnditions of society, it seems that he used those words for\n&gt; &gt; Men.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Grammar...Hmmmm. i don&#39;t know if he has really used proper grammer in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n such Dohas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are verse in Bhagvad Gita which can be criticis=\r\ned by people from\n&gt; &gt; other faiths if they are taken literaly and without u=\r\nnderstanding\n&gt; &gt; personality of Krishna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding Ra=\r\nmachandra, Thank you for making clear, your notable friend&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; view and y=\r\nour detailed explanation by giving examples.

Th=\r\ne highlighting\n&gt; &gt; is done by you, not in the actual text. If he ment pashu=\r\n-nari he should\n&gt; &gt; have used some basic grammer to remove confusion. He di=\r\nd not. At the\n&gt; &gt; level of text, it is indefensible. Also, if I go by your =\r\nexplanation,\n&gt; &gt; why only Naari who are pashu, why not Naras who are like p=\r\nashus? There\n&gt; &gt; are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the world.=\r\n=C3=82 This\n&gt; &gt; explanation=C3=82 that you found looks more like a back eng=\r\nineering job\n&gt; &gt; to bail out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding Ram=\r\na self realization, I think I was unable to express the\n&gt; &gt; ideas of my fri=\r\nend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really saying\n&gt; &gt; that Sri Rama wa=\r\ns not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees that\n&gt; &gt; Sri Rama was an =\r\nAvatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; God did not de=\r\nscend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended\n&gt; &gt; in order to l=\r\nead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana.\n&gt; &gt; A path that =\r\nan ordinary man can and should follow. One of\n&gt; &gt; principles.=C3=82 Compare=\r\n this to the name of the other great epic,\n&gt; &gt; Mahabharata, which was not n=\r\named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot; . One cannot follow\n&gt; &gt; Krishna&#39;s path.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsubcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nand the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n did. BUt if we try to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; man, a devoted husband etc, we have a better chance of following such a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An ordinary man cannot lead the life of a God but he can fo=\r\nllow the\n&gt; &gt; life of a great man.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, even today =\r\nlot of people advise that one should try to\n&gt; &gt; become like Vivekananda, or=\r\n that this country needs its youth to be like\n&gt; &gt; Vivekanadas in teh future=\r\n. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self\n&gt; &gt; realized=C3=82 saint of hi=\r\nghest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; one who=C3=82 lived l=\r\nike a lion among sheep of ordinary=C3=82 men, fearless\n&gt; &gt; and uncompromisi=\r\nng and principled. If every=C3=82 person would constantly\n&gt; &gt; think that Vi=\r\nvekanada was a saint=C3=82 who worked by the pwoer of a deity\n&gt; &gt; or due to=\r\n his extreme spirituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; no one=\r\n will ever make an attempt to be inspired by him or=C3=82 emulate\n&gt; &gt; his w=\r\nay of living.Vivekanada was a spiritual giant, but=C3=82 the image he\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nrojected was one of a tireless, fearless KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire\n&gt; &gt; pe=\r\nople.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 On the other hand=C3=82 you will never hear=\r\n anyone advising that\n&gt; &gt; one should try to lead a life like Ramarkishna.=\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 That is\n&gt; &gt; impossible.

Tempted to ask him =\r\nwhat really is the\n&gt; &gt; definition of God which differentiates Rama from Kri=\r\nshna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose and ch=\r\narged/heated\n&gt; &gt; debate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind yo=\r\nu, these are\n&gt; &gt; all theoritical/ theological debates - nothing to do with =\r\nactual\n&gt; &gt; spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I was gettin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; agitated and it would have affected our friendship.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will onl=\r\ny mention that\n&gt; &gt; what he can support using logic. Therefore he never gene=\r\nrally discusses\n&gt; &gt; spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and de=\r\nbate scriptures\n&gt; &gt; using exact quotations etc, (theology)=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82 but not about mysticism or\n&gt; &gt; sadhana or anything which=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82 needs a belief system. That is why most\n&gt; &gt; people know him only =\r\nas a very rational, massively knowledgeable and\n&gt; &gt; uncorruptable=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82 human being.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 They h=\r\nave no clue about\n&gt; &gt; his meditations or anything.

He said, =\r\nSri Rama had mastery of all\n&gt; &gt; divine weapons. He could have destroyed Rav=\r\nana and his whole army in a\n&gt; &gt; blink of an eye, right from the place where=\r\n he was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 located when\n&gt; &gt; he first heard the news of Si=\r\nta&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and\n&gt; &gt; instead chose the hard way o=\r\nf destroying Ravana - the human way. So as\n&gt; &gt; per my friend, it is more im=\r\nportant to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to\n&gt; &gt; worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary a=\r\nngle, a\n&gt; &gt; hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajB=\r\nhasa. An\n&gt; &gt; author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been fl=\r\nouted) but\n&gt; &gt; a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which eq=\r\nuates women\n&gt; &gt; with animals or something similar. He believes that was int=\r\nroduces in\n&gt; &gt; the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own=\r\n lust.\n&gt; &gt; Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmaximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than\n&gt; &gt; Kris=\r\nhna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his t=\r\nhought on Food\n&gt; &gt; habits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy myself.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; as I explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything from a purely\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; spiritual angle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It was only by c=\r\nhance that I found out one day about his meditations\n&gt; &gt; etc and then he co=\r\nnfirmed them when asked.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have seen =\r\nhim debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific\n&gt; &gt; point of view - abo=\r\nut why there is no harm in having regulated amounts\n&gt; &gt; of meat (not red me=\r\nat).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I say, as Narasimha said, th=\r\nis person should not be taken as an\n&gt; &gt; ideal regarding food=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82 habits.

He has actuall=\r\ny never\n&gt; &gt; ever=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 spoken even a single lie in his whole=\r\n life, big or small.\n&gt; &gt; When he was in his school, once his teacher told h=\r\nim that Indian\n&gt; &gt; languages are richer than English, he believed his teach=\r\ner. Later\n&gt; &gt; someone else told him English is more comprehensive language =\r\nand the\n&gt; &gt; world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he bo=\r\nught\n&gt; &gt; himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for=\r\n ten\n&gt; &gt; years every day he spend one hour reading the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; English dictio=\r\nnary and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 up\n&gt; &gt; volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82 When I asked him why, he\n&gt; &gt; just said it is because he wan=\r\nted to be=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 equally adept at both the\n&gt; &gt; languages so t=\r\nhat one day he can take a really detached view to judge\n&gt; &gt; the truth about=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 which is more comprehensive language! As I said,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhe has an uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; about anything. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; in different fields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; last for long in most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlearning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. When he\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwas in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\njob he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n who was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he asked\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSeeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nright there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; in the form would have been a lie.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSo this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his\n&gt; &gt; friends=\r\n, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meet=\r\ning.\n&gt; &gt; His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge t=\r\no go into the\n&gt; &gt; temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside=\r\n the temple,\n&gt; &gt; but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next whe=\r\nn he sees his\n&gt; &gt; watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge =\r\nof how the time\n&gt; &gt; went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he=\r\n went into the\n&gt; &gt; temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole =\r\ntime without any\n&gt; &gt; movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb hi=\r\nm. But my friend\n&gt; &gt; had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, =\r\nas if he was in\n&gt; &gt; deep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then =\r\nhe started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 that h=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; got visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; most people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; exact same place and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82 Only\n&gt; &gt; his wife and close relatives know about this incident. I=\r\n believe\n&gt; &gt; nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters the =\r\nstate of\n&gt; &gt; Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he=\r\n just said\n&gt; &gt; it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am th=\r\ne sun, the\n&gt; &gt; moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, child=\r\nren, the\n&gt; &gt; wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger t=\r\nhan\n&gt; &gt; everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 =\r\nHe considers Sri\n&gt; &gt; Krishna to be God and=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Lord Rama t=\r\no be the ideal man.That is why\n&gt; &gt; he does not like the Ramacharit Manas be=\r\ncause he thinks it elevated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 Rama to the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nto show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 not a God.The differ=\r\nence he\n&gt; &gt; says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an o=\r\nrdinary\n&gt; &gt; man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cann=\r\not be\n&gt; &gt; emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 can\n&gt; &gt; try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued wi=\r\nth him over this, but I\n&gt; &gt; am merely stating his idea. Also he does not ha=\r\nve a Guru - a human guru\n&gt; &gt; at least, and advises people to not trust most=\r\n Gurus these days.\n&gt; &gt; Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later he had once=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82 me=\r\nntioned he knew the relation he had with\n&gt; &gt; all the people around him in h=\r\nis past lives. His mother he says, was his\n&gt; &gt; daughter in his past life et=\r\nc.
