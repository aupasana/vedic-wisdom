But, my point is that astrology as we know \nis unreliable and one is bett=\r\ner off just surrendering to god. There is \nsomething called free will and i=\r\nt can be used to surrender to god and \npray sincerely.\n\n*        *        *=\r\n\n\nReminds me of an incident. A gentleman had a high flying career during \nd=\r\not com bubble, but was struggling for a few years. He was from a \ndistingui=\r\nshed lineage of learned brahmins. I saw the horoscope and \nsuggested Lakshm=\r\ni homam everyday with Sri Sooktam 16 times with only \nghee as the aahuti. I=\r\n said the remedy will help a lot, but the next 2 \nyears were very problemat=\r\nic and I wasn&#39;t sure how much progress could be \nmade. But I said things wo=\r\nuld be better after 2 years. I told him to try \nit nevertheless.\n\nHe mispla=\r\nced the paper on which he wrote all this down and forgot about \nthis comple=\r\ntely. He continued to struggle for 2 years. About 26 months \nlater, his wif=\r\ne was cleaning the house and found this paper. She gave it \nto him. He sudd=\r\nenly got inspired and started homam. Within a month, he \ngot a job and his =\r\nwife too got a job without really trying.\n\nIn the end, one&#39;s well-being is =\r\nin one&#39;s hands. Others can try to \nmotivate, but nothing happens without th=\r\ne internal trigger. Moreover, \ndoing a remedy with a reasonable attitude ta=\r\nkes some preparation and \nmaturing (in the case below, this person was reas=\r\nonably mature to start \nwith and reading vedic-wisdom messages added to it)=\r\n. Force does not work \nin these matters. Make things available, put out som=\r\ne inspirational \nmaterial and leave it to the person.\n\n*        *        *\n=\r\n\n&gt; I know you are a very busy professional and perhaps have your own\n&gt; spir=\r\nitual path and activities to follow\n\nYes, I am busy professional in high te=\r\nch and have my own spiritual \nsadhana too. But this karma - sharings in Jyo=\r\ntish and spirituality - is \na *part* of my spiritual sadhana. It is my offe=\r\nring to Lord. One must \nshare with the world the good things one has access=\r\n to.\n\nI was touched when I heard about an old priest. Someone from Vizag to=\r\nok \na copy of our Mahaganapathi homam manual when they visited Boston and \n=\r\ngave it to a local priest who is around 75 years old. He apparently \nliked =\r\nit, made 200 copies, distributed at a Vizag temple and told people \nto do h=\r\nomam themselves using the manual. This is a priest whose \nlivelihood can be=\r\n affected if people do homam by themselves. Yet, he was \nunselfish and real=\r\nized the power of enabling people on a mass scale and \nwhat it can do to in=\r\ndividuals and to society in general.\n\nThose who like the free resources sho=\r\nuld feel free to spread the word. \nBut do NOT expect anything in return - p=\r\nraise or acknowledgment. Do not \neven expect that the person listens and st=\r\narts doing homam. Be prepared \nfor the effort to go waste and yet put in th=\r\ne best effort. Act like the \nmost passionate person, but be prepared for an=\r\ny result of the action - \nfavorable or unfavorable! THAT is detached action=\r\n or nishkama karma.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI&#39;ll club the reply to one more m=\r\nail:\n\n&gt; Congrats. He could be lucky but one must not forget that all prayer=\r\ns \n&gt; are not always answered.\n\nAll sincere and humble prayers are of course=\r\n always answered. \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa said, &quot;you go one step towards g=\r\nod and god will \ncome 3 steps towards you&quot;.\n\nThe only tricky thing is that =\r\nit may take some time - god waits till the \nperson first becomes worthy of =\r\nbeing given something. Surrender and keep \ndoing the remedy with *faith*. F=\r\naith, humility and surrender are the \nkeys.\n\nAlso, sometimes god may not gi=\r\nve what you asked for, but what he gives \nis always better for you. Bottoml=\r\nine is this: If you have a problem, \ntake it up with god. Do it with faith,=\r\n humility and surrender. Fire can \nbe a very effective medium to god. More =\r\neffective than anything else.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitt=\r\ner ID: @homam108\n----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;rohini_ran=\r\njan@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is very nice sharing!

He started\n&gt;&gt; homam and japam and got two offers with=\r\nin 15 days. He calls it a\n&gt;&gt; &quot;miracle&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He sent me several mails earl=\r\nier asking for an astrological advice. \n&gt;&gt; It\n&gt;&gt; did not feel like there wa=\r\ns anything I could do and I ignored. He\n&gt;&gt; discovered the free homam manual=\r\ns and the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup,\n&gt;&gt; derived inspiration from the mails th=\r\nere and used the free resources\n&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; the homam website. He saw immediate=\r\n results.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I know some other people whose problems were so=\r\nlved after they \n&gt;&gt; started\n&gt;&gt; doing homam or intense meditation. Exactly h=\r\now much effort is needed\n&gt;&gt; depends on the individual case and the karmas i=\r\nnvolved. But, things\n&gt; like\n&gt;&gt; homam and intense meditation can only help. =\r\nGod either solves one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; problems or creates a situation where one rises =\r\nabove the problems,\n&gt; i.e.\n&gt;&gt; does not get affected by the problems. If one=\r\n surrenders and worships\n&gt;&gt; god in fire, one&#39;s life will be steered by god =\r\nin the correct\n&gt; direction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Though people pay too much attention to m=\r\nany technical details and \n&gt;&gt; get\n&gt;&gt; worried that they may make mistakes, t=\r\nhe most important thing is\n&gt;&gt; devotion and surrender and many technical asp=\r\nects are negotiable. \n&gt;&gt; Many\n&gt;&gt; people who never even lit a light in their=\r\n life before are now doing\n&gt;&gt; daily homam and making brisk progress!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A lot of people in serious problems send me their horoscope and=\r\n ask\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; help. Sadly, I or any astrologer cannot solve their problems.=\r\n Solving\n&gt;&gt; their problems is in their own hands!! Irrespective of the exac=\r\nt\n&gt; nature\n&gt;&gt; of blocking karmas, doing homam or intense meditation can onl=\r\ny \n&gt;&gt; benefit\n&gt;&gt; one. Though people may think that they need an astrologer =\r\nto tell \n&gt;&gt; them\n&gt;&gt; which deity to worship and otherwise bad things can hap=\r\npen, this is \n&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; unfounded fear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I have studied and experimente=\r\nd with astrology (still do) as well as\n&gt;&gt; anybody alive today. I can declar=\r\ne with utmost confidence that our\n&gt;&gt; understanding is half-baked at best an=\r\nd one cannot rely on astrology\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; life-changing decisions. On the oth=\r\ner hand, one can rely on god. Gods\n&gt;&gt; like Ganesha, Kartikeya, Vishnu, Kris=\r\nhna, Lakshmi, Shiva, Hanuman,\n&gt; Durga\n&gt;&gt; etc can give any material or spiri=\r\ntual results, including moksha.\n&gt;&gt; Worshipping any of them is perfectly saf=\r\ne. Each deity puts a\n&gt; surrendered\n&gt;&gt; devotee on the correct path, in one&#39;s=\r\n own way. Each of them is far\n&gt;&gt; better than me or any astrologer alive tod=\r\nay, for changing your life\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; the better! Picking a deity based on ta=\r\nste and doing homam or intense\n&gt;&gt; meditation is faaaaaaar better than appro=\r\naching astrologers like me\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; astrological advice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nIf you are unsure which deity to worship, worship Ganesha with\n&gt; Ganapathi\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; homam. It is a superb sadhana to set one&#39;s life on the correct path,\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nboth materially and spiritually. You don&#39;t have to take my word for\n&gt; it.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; The proof of the pudding is in eating it. Try it yourself for a few\n&gt;&gt; mo=\r\nnths and see what happens. Your main problem will either be solved\n&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nyour mental state will start to change so that the problem&#39;s impact \n&gt;&gt; on\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; you is reduced. You yourself will see how you are benefiting!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also=\r\n, there are many insightful and inspiring mails on spiritual\n&gt; sadhana\n&gt;&gt; o=\r\nn vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, which have inspired many people to do\n&gt; homam\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n and other sadhanas.

Do some sadhana while\n&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; body still has some jui=\r\nce in it. If you are in problems, you have an\n&gt;&gt; added incentive to do sadh=\r\nana. But, even otherwise, consider sadhana.\n&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; homam can be done in jus=\r\nt 20-30 minutes. Spending 20-30 min\n&gt; worshipping\n&gt;&gt; god in fire everyday c=\r\nan change your life for the better and \n&gt;&gt; transform\n&gt;&gt; your personality co=\r\nmpletely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In fact, it is Mother&#39;s wish that several people should reg=\r\nularly\n&gt;&gt; worship various deities in fire again and progress.

Yes,=\r\n I started\n&gt; doing\n&gt;&gt; homams and japams by following guidelines from your h=\r\nomam website and\n&gt;&gt; from your emails on Vedic-wisdom list and a real life m=\r\niracle \n&gt;&gt; happened\n&gt;&gt; for me. Narsimhaji I bow in front of you. I feel we,=\r\n whoever, know\n&gt; you,\n&gt;&gt; are so fortunate that we got a Guru like you in th=\r\nis world. You are a\n&gt;&gt; Modern Age Guru who is enlightening us, showing us d=\r\nirection with all\n&gt;&gt; the vedic knowledge you got. I had known you for your =\r\nAstrology \n&gt;&gt; wisdom\n&gt;&gt; but not that much for Vedic knowledge and wisdom. B=\r\nut now I know that\n&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; this facebook and iphone era we have a Guru who =\r\ncan share Vedas\n&gt;&gt; knowledge with us and show us right path in this life si=\r\ntting here in\n&gt;&gt; the US.\n&gt;&gt; ... This dates back to last year when my wife f=\r\nound your website over\n&gt;&gt; the internet and came to me saying she found a ve=\r\nry easy way of doing\n&gt;&gt; homam by ourselves. She always thought that for all=\r\n our day to day\n&gt;&gt; problems that we were facing in our life, we should perf=\r\norm some\n&gt;&gt; homam/pooja, but we didn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t know how to d=\r\no that. So when I\n&gt; looked at the\n&gt;&gt; link she sent to me I told the gentlem=\r\nan who had written this was our\n&gt;&gt; Narsimha guru, and If he was recommendin=\r\ng to do homams and written\n&gt;&gt; something for it, then we should go for it, a=\r\nnd for the first time we\n&gt;&gt; did homam at our home during navratri 2010.\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nAs you know I was searching for full time job for last 2 yrs, and had\n&gt;&gt; fa=\r\niled 17-18 interviews thus far- I think I had sent you emails a\n&gt; couple\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n of times seeking some remedies- but you were busy. In 6 or 7 such\n&gt;&gt; inter=\r\nviews I reached close enough to think that I was going to get an\n&gt;&gt; offer l=\r\netter but never got any. ...\n&gt;&gt; I started searching Vedic astrology mailing=\r\n list ... I found one of\n&gt; your\n&gt;&gt; postings where you had written about han=\r\numan chalisa and then given a\n&gt;&gt; link for vedic-wisdom list. I started look=\r\ning at that list and read\n&gt;&gt; about your experience with Manish Pandit, that=\r\n made me read me many \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; your postings on that list. ... why couldn=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t I do intense pooja\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; homams and nullify th=\r\nat effect. I read your comment to surrender to\n&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; god and worship him=\r\n same time everyday with full surrender and do\n&gt;&gt; homams. I discussed this =\r\nwith my wife and we decided to take the \n&gt;&gt; route\n&gt;&gt; of homam and japams. W=\r\ne performed one homam and I started chanting\n&gt;&gt; Hanuman Chalisa everyday wi=\r\nth full devotion, attention and Surrender.\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; I started doing daily =\r\nHanuman Chalisa. Everyday I do Hanuman Chalisa\n&gt; 5/7\n&gt;&gt; times daily, and be=\r\nfore starting I think about you, Manish Pandit and\n&gt; Pt\n&gt;&gt; XX=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC&quot;all three as my gurus. I start my japam by telling god that\n&gt; if I am\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; honest and sincere, haven=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t committed anything wro=\r\nng, then god\n&gt; should\n&gt;&gt; come and l help me out. To my surprise just within=\r\n 15 days, I got 2\n&gt;&gt; interview calls. I went and attended interviews. The I=\r\nnterviews went\n&gt;&gt; well as always, but this time I got the JOB OFFERs. Yeah,=\r\n job offers\n&gt; at\n&gt;&gt; 2 places. It ended my 2 years of struggle, I couldn=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t believe\n&gt; it. I am\n&gt;&gt; planning to join one of them n=\r\next Monday 20 th June. Hence this time\n&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; was not your Astrology wisdo=\r\nm, it is your vedic wisdom that has \n&gt;&gt; helped\n&gt;&gt; me. I couldn=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2t believe what god has given. It was like a\n&gt; miracle.\n&gt;&gt; Now I=\r\n am determined that I would keep doing homams as and when\n&gt; possible\n&gt;&gt; but=\r\n japam daily for sure for my rest of the life. I am a novice for\n&gt;&gt; homams =\r\nso I am learning these things. I often see your youtube video\n&gt; on\n&gt;&gt; homam=\r\ns and try to follow this. I hope someday I will get some mastery\n&gt;&gt; over th=\r\nis and do homams regularly without errors. Your experiences \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; stor=\r\nies with Manish Pandit were very inspiring throughout this\n&gt; journey.\n&gt;&gt; Yo=\r\nur those real time experiences with Manish were great, they gave me\n&gt;&gt; cred=\r\nentials that if Narsimha guru is writing these things then there\n&gt;&gt; should =\r\nbe some truth behind this. That inspired me that if I \n&gt;&gt; surrender\n&gt;&gt; to g=\r\nod, god can help me too and he really helped me.\n&gt;&gt; This time I had a mater=\r\nial motive behind my homams and japams as I\n&gt;&gt; wanted to get a full time, b=\r\nut I am sure this route will take me more\n&gt;&gt; towards spirituality and some =\r\nday I would be able to help society and\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; this world in some way. ...=\r\n\n\n"}}
