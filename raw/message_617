Thank you for s=\r\nharing it.\n=C2=A0\nAfter Ramakrishna left his body, several people saw him i=\r\nn embodied form.\n=C2=A0\nThat is entirely possible. When someone who did not=\r\n identify with a body but identified with the entire universe lives in a bo=\r\ndy and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, in every atom=\r\n and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that body of his and=\r\n he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to that person in=\r\n that body. It is not that he is &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;. It is just that he is i=\r\nn every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because he has realize=\r\nd the true nature of Self while living in the previous body and that realiz=\r\nation was intact even while leaving that body.\n=C2=A0\nAccording to Sarada M=\r\nata, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be back after 100 years=\r\n and that all of them would have to be reborn when he is reborn after 100 y=\r\nears. Thus, he may have already come to earth in a different body. But that=\r\n does not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at =\r\nthe lower level form may still be able to access his previous form.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nEven after the form of Rama left this=C2=A0world and the form of=C2=A0Krish=\r\nna was born, a devotee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Rama may be a=\r\nble to realize a darshan of the form of Rama.\n=C2=A0\nRamakrishna Paramahams=\r\na was almost certainly an avatara.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short =\r\nHomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedica=\r\nstro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Ashwin Rawal \nTo: Vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com \nCc: pvr@charter. net \nSent: Wednesday, November 05, 2008 10=\r\n:25 AM\nSubject: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir, =\r\nI would like to share one of my great Devine experience about shri Ramkrish=\r\nnadev. This is an unbelievable experience that I have had. I have not added=\r\n anything from my own. I am writing exactly as was happened in my life. I a=\r\nm going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are i=\r\nn religious mood. \n\n=C2=A0 \n\nI was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Pos=\r\nt office near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late =\r\nfee allowance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite =\r\nto Post office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Te=\r\nlephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)=\r\n was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shr=\r\ni Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking about shr=\r\ni Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his hom=\r\ne called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him and was w=\r\neeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 you=\r\nngsters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then =\r\n24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore dail=\r\ny at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only about Thakur. \n\nOne day wh=\r\nen we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest=\r\n have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a =\r\nfew minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my sur=\r\nprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n\nAt one another incident he to=\r\nld me that there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also happened. I w=\r\nas very much impressed about him. He could foresee the events. One day I ha=\r\nd to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire wil=\r\nl be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka =\r\nas was punctured on the way. This was surprising. \n\nThis all incidents made=\r\n me to believe that he had some super power and this was due to Ramkrishand=\r\nev worship only. I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I shoul=\r\nd also be disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 p=\r\nm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur=\r\n picture. I prayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower an=\r\nd bestow his grace. \n\nNext day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6=\r\n.10 morning while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was w=\r\naking up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have acce=\r\npted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued w=\r\nith me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? =\r\nRamkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great=\r\n Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra =\r\netc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are d=\r\noing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--. \n\nHer arguments were right at her place as =\r\npeople in general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-=\r\n- yes I have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- =\r\n\n\nBut I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their d=\r\nisciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I=\r\n immediately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never c=\r\nome to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I =\r\nam living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes=\r\n, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- \n\nS=\r\nhe laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t belie=\r\nve.=E2=80=9D-- \n\nI prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to just=\r\nify my decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existenc=\r\ne even today.=E2=80=99 \n\nTo our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at=\r\n 06.30 in the morning with angry mood. What he told? \n\n=E2=80=98 How dare y=\r\nou test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday was my night =\r\nduty and I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sl=\r\neep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=\r\n=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for you. He want=\r\ns to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D \n\nI immediately rushed to =\r\nyour home. Thakur was guiding me the way to your house and pushing me too. =\r\nWhat you want? Why you are disturbing him in such an early morning for such=\r\n a silly things?=E2=80=99 \n\nWe both were so excited and surprised that we h=\r\nad no words that Morning. \n\nI will never forget that 5th April, a miracle d=\r\nay in my life. There were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur bu=\r\nt I will write it sometime. \n\nDear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is=\r\n still alive on the earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is add=\r\ned to exaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us. \n\nDr. Ashwin Rawal=\r\n Ahmedabad \n\n\n\n\n\nAdd more friends to your messenger and enjoy!

He was singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping whil=\r\ne singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters wer=\r\ne attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years ol=\r\nd. Mr. Patel was of 30 then.
