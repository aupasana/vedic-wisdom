I wish you every suc=\r\ncess with your purascharana. Obstacles are bound to come but at those times=\r\n it helps to remind oneself of the important reasons for which one started =\r\nit. I&#39;m sure you will be able to overcome all obstacles (just ask Lord Gane=\r\nsh!). :)\n\n Perhaps we can be &#39;purascharana buddies&#39; and motivate each other=\r\n to finish- you know like some people have &#39;gym buddies&#39; to encourage them =\r\nto workout on those inevitable lazy days that occur sometimes. I don&#39;t know=\r\n anyone in my circle of family and friends who is doing a purascharana so i=\r\nt would be nice to finally know of someone who is doing one. It would be in=\r\nteresting to hear of your purascharana plans so keep us updated. (Why wait =\r\ntill Navaratri, start now!) :p  Good luck! :)\n\nWarm regards,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, dolly jha &lt;jha.dolly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear=\r\n Aparna,\n&gt; thanks so much for sharing those wonderfully helpful \n&gt; links wi=\r\nth me :)\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; i&#39;ll try working out on the sheet to see the \n&gt; purashchar=\r\nan of which mantra i can complete \n&gt; within those 9 days.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; and if i =\r\nset my mind to actually doing gayatri\n&gt; mantra then i&#39;ll do the one lakh ja=\r\nap that\n&gt; u&#39;ve said of.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; also, for the complete purashcharan i&#39;ll\n&gt; =\r\nwork out a time table like you do and if not \n&gt; within 9 days then i&#39;ll try=\r\n completeing it in \n&gt; a year..starting this puja and ending it \n&gt; the next =\r\nyear.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; obstacles have alraedy started raising their heads\n&gt; but i&#39;ll=\r\n fight=A0them all.\n&gt; i have to do a purashcharan this puja..\n&gt; come what ma=\r\ny!:)\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; u&#39;ve given me ample food for thought..\n&gt; thanks so much :)\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; regards,\n&gt; dolly.\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
