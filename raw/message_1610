They can be taken \n&gt; as a general guideline, but they c=\r\nannnot be absolute.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding non-Brahmins:\n&gt; \n&gt; If a person is intere=\r\nsted in Veda and studies Veda, one IS a Brahmana. One \n&gt; who is interested =\r\nin knowledge and spirituality is a Brahmana. One who is \n&gt; interested in po=\r\nwer and authority over others is a Kshatriya. One who is \n&gt; interested in w=\r\nealth is a Vaishya. One who is interested in pleasures in a \n&gt; Shoodra (tha=\r\nt is why phala sruti of Vishnu sahasra naama stotra promises \n&gt; these respe=\r\nctive results to the four varnas - see &quot;vedaantago braahmanah \n&gt; syaat...&quot;)=\r\n. Valmiki was born in a shoodra family, but became a brahmana and \n&gt; a maha=\r\nrshi later. Vishwamitra was born in a kshatriya family, but became a \n&gt; bra=\r\nhmana and a maharshi later and many veda hymns were actually revealed to \n&gt;=\r\n the world through him!\n&gt; \n&gt; The meaning of saying that only a Brahmana can=\r\n deal with veda is that only a \n&gt; person interested in knowledge and spirit=\r\nual progress (and not money or \n&gt; power or pleasures) can learn and teach v=\r\neda. Others (interested in money, \n&gt; power and pleasures) are not qualified=\r\n for self-realization. It has nothing \n&gt; to do with the the birth caste.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Regarding women:\n&gt; \n&gt; Veda is for self-knowledge. Study and contemplatio=\r\nn of Veda is for \n&gt; self-realization. Spiritually speaking, Shiva is the po=\r\ntential energy and \n&gt; Shakti is the kinetic energy.  Men are supposed to ha=\r\nve more Shiva than \n&gt; Shakti in them and women are supposed to have more Sh=\r\nakti than Shiva in \n&gt; them. If a man is really like Shiva, he can study and=\r\n experience Veda and \n&gt; realize self and his wife can realize self through =\r\nhim. That would be a good \n&gt; strategy.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, men are hardly like Sh=\r\niva today. In fact, there is very little \n&gt; Shiva in anyone and there is mo=\r\nre Shakti (kinetic energy) in women as well \n&gt; as men today. Moreover, most=\r\n men do not do any spiritual sadhana at all. The \n&gt; rules make no sense any=\r\nmore.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the old days, rishis pursued knowledge and spiritual sadhana,=\r\n while their \n&gt; wives ran the houses. The sadhana of rishis was sufficient =\r\nfor them and \n&gt; their wives. Today&#39;s men are different. Whenever I go to a =\r\npoojas at the \n&gt; houses of friends, I see all women gathering at the pooja =\r\nand chanting \n&gt; mantras, while all men sit elsewhere and chat about sports,=\r\n politics and \n&gt; movies. The world is a changed place. Women cannot rely on=\r\n their men to do \n&gt; spiritual sadhana for them and they are on their own. M=\r\nen are not like \n&gt; Shiva. Rules composed long back do not apply anymore.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Upasani maharaj, who was worshipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, w=\r\nas a \n&gt; great Vedic scholar who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect h=\r\nis \n&gt; judgment and its relevance today more than the relevance of an ancien=\r\nt \n&gt; dharma shastra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to ti=\r\nme by \n&gt; realized souls. It becomes stale otherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the probl=\r\nem with some religions that are based on a written text. \n&gt; The text may ha=\r\nve been good for a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may have \n&gt; become stale=\r\n now. Fortunately, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) does not \n&gt; depend on one=\r\n specific text. We emphasize sadhana to realize truth rather \n&gt; than adhere=\r\nnce to a text. This emphasis on active sadhana ensured a \n&gt; continuous flow=\r\n of realized souls. We had many realized souls (like \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj,=\r\n Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, \n&gt; Ramana Maharshi et=\r\nc) from time to time and they refined our understanding. \n&gt; Religions that =\r\nemphasized adherence to a text rather than active sadhana to \n&gt; realize tru=\r\nth depended on an old text put together by one realized soul and \n&gt; they ma=\r\ny have become stale now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.com=\r\ncast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Jagmohan Nanaware&quot; &lt;jagmohan_nanaware@...&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:57 PM\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Women reading Vedas (Re: reading/learning the ved=\r\na)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Excellent explanation from you Narasimha-ji!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just have some doubts:\n&gt; &gt; The code of conduct about reciting vedas=\r\n (who can do it)  are prescribed \n&gt; &gt; in Manusmriti.

He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully sel=\r\nf-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master at a young age. He reformed religion and cor=\r\nrected some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; corrupt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; traditions. He once made a buffalo chant Ve=\r\nda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin cou=\r\nncil\n&gt; &gt;&gt; forbade him\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda.=\r\n Jnaneshwar insisted\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda a=\r\nnd the head of the council\n&gt; &gt;&gt; disagreed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As he started reciting Ve=\r\nda, the Brahmins tried to stop him by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; closing his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mouth. Then a=\r\n buffalo standing next to him took over and chanted\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Veda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Astou=\r\nnded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head\n&gt; &gt;&gt; apologize=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as the keepers of Veda, but you hav=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the real\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding and mastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jn=\r\naneshwar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish\n&gt; &gt;&gt; between pe=\r\nople\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; based on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGita as =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; essence\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His=\r\n commentary\n&gt; &gt;&gt; departs from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point=\r\n of view adopted by most\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vaishnava\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gurus and uses a purely Adwa=\r\nitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; priceless and timel=\r\ness masterpiece.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One Swamij=\r\ni who was at my house last month had an interesting take.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He said\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; misi=\r\nnterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is called\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;purusha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n sareera&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that the physical body comes from mother and the =\r\nsoul comes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; father and that is why they are called so. The =\r\nsoul or inner self\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thousand-headed purusha within us (de=\r\nscribed in purusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that Veda is supposed to=\r\n be recited with the purusha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sareera.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; According to him, it does=\r\n not mean that women cannot read it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether men or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women, they=\r\n have to read it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; &gt;&gt; body, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n not just with the physical body. So, according to him, the standard\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n convention is based on a flawed understanding. According to him,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one =\r\nsimply\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; understanding is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence n=\r\not doing the right\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; In fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nunderstanding them is quite another. When we make sound, there are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fou=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; material\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; belonging to the gross body (sthoola sareera) produce=\r\ns vaikhari\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sound and it is heard through the senses be=\r\nlonging to the gross\n&gt; &gt;&gt; body (ears).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But vibrations at the level o=\r\nf subtle body (sookshma sareera) and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vibrations\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the level of=\r\n astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; can be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; percei=\r\nved thorough subtle perception.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om Namo N=\r\narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mundane\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matters, the vibrations=\r\n produced at levels above vaikhari will not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; auspicious. Ther=\r\ne is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; people\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; forget =\r\nthat what happens at the other layers of existence is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; equally, if not\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, important!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you produce the correct vibrations=\r\n at all levels (not just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic m=\r\nantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra. A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; full experience=\r\n of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; life=\r\n! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Ved=\r\nic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n encouraged,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowledge ali=\r\nve).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference betw=\r\neen genders\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtl=\r\ne body and astral body,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no difference at all. One shou=\r\nld realize that the role of gross\n&gt; &gt;&gt; body is too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; limited in the co=\r\nrrect recitation/experience of a Vedic mantra. It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purity=\r\n of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are far\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more important.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To b=\r\ne fair and balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Like I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a full\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;=\r\nto know\n&gt; &gt;&gt; self&quot;).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is di=\r\nfficult for it to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; come in one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shot. It comes in steps. When one=\r\n is half way down the path, one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; has to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; careful and under the=\r\n vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When one is not fully realiz=\r\ned and the gross body has a role to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; play, there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are some differ=\r\nences based on the gender that come into play.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If a lady carr=\r\nying a baby in her womb has certain spiritual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (whic=\r\nh a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; even be an\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; abortion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; awakening\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and=\r\n an ascent of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness). Though s=\r\nome people\n&gt; &gt;&gt; may have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrong impression about Kundalini because =\r\nof the corrupt practices\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section of so-called &quot;Kundalini s=\r\nadhakas&quot;, the fact is that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini merely\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represents one&#39;s eg=\r\no-consciousness. When one casually associates\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one sees=\r\n with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kund=\r\nalini\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reaches\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or n=\r\not, Kundalini\n&gt; &gt;&gt; moves based\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is=\r\n into Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; or Karma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does=\r\n not matter. All paths lead to an awareness\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and more =\r\ncorrect concept of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realizati=\r\non finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; more and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reac=\r\nhes Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; During the period when Kundalini is=\r\n stuck in Swadhishthana chakra,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sexual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive can multiply. Seve=\r\nral yogis get stuck in this stage and fail\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the tests\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to progres=\r\ns further. In general, women have a higher drive than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; men. If that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; drive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nreally\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depends on the individual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, there are some practical difficulties on the way, which may\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n have made\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some people come up with some rules. However, are those i=\r\nssues\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sufficient to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think=\r\n so. In fact, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; factors I wrote\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; above are probably irrelevant=\r\n given the superficial understanding\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; present at this ti=\r\nme and the superficial recitation of Veda that we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these da=\r\nys.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide a=\r\nnyone, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; is better\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s s=\r\nadguru. If you have a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadguru who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual sad=\r\nhana, surrender and do as your guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; says! What\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is good for goos=\r\ne may not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; taught to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; goose=\r\n may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; well to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; follow gander&#39;s guru.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think I rambled enough for to=\r\nday... :-)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Homam manual an=\r\nd audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Wind=\r\nows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) webs=\r\nite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] reading/learning the veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;A warm nama=\r\nste to everyone!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard it said that women are not =\r\nallowed to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; read/know/recite the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vedas. Can anyone tell me if =\r\nthis is true? If so, is there any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (or evidence)in any =\r\nof the Vedas which says this?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask this not as a disresp=\r\nectful argument but as a genuine\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desire to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know what the text=\r\n actually says, if it does indeed say anything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; at all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on the =\r\nsubject.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also I have heard that a Brahmin who does have t=\r\nhe right to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; recite/use\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the mantras has to follow a certain (v=\r\nery strict) way of life.
