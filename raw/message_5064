Ramakrishna mission people found out\n&gt; about what he produced only y=\r\nears later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based\n&gt; on the PhD dissertation w=\r\non great acclaim in the West. He won an award at\n&gt; the Americal Academy of =\r\nReligion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and\n&gt; his book was sadly me=\r\nntioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number\n&gt; one* choice for lea=\r\nrning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sex=\r\nually perverted person, a\n&gt; homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Ben=\r\ngali or Hindi or Sanskrit\n&gt; well and did not take help from any Bengali peo=\r\nple at the Mission for this\n&gt; work. He used his own faulty translations, wi=\r\nllful distortions and\n&gt; manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (a=\r\nnd damning) conclusions.\n&gt; For example, he translated a word that means &quot;la=\r\np&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the\n&gt; context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of R=\r\namakrishna and a young boy\n&gt; then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap.

For example, he speculated o=\r\nn the meeting of Totapuri and\n&gt; Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (nake=\r\nd ascetic) Totapuri taught\n&gt; advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go=\r\n beyond Mother Kali and\n&gt; experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have=\r\n been like for Ramakrishna,\n&gt; a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away =\r\nfor days in a small hut with\n&gt; another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instructio=\r\nn or not, it was this man&#39;s\n&gt; nudity, and more especially, his penis, that =\r\nnormally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s\n&gt; attention.
