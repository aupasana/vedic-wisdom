I have learnt some lessons after this shoot.\n      I have known Narasimhaji for over 10 years, I first met him in July 1998. I married his wife&#39;s sister in Jan 1999. I used to live in New Jersey and often visit Narasimhaji&#39;s family (almost every month) until Nov 2005, when destiny moved me permanently close to him (Boston). I lived for 6 months in his home. He looked after me as his own brother during those  months. Again, destiny, I bought a home just 3 homes away from his. Even though 3 homes apart, many of our weekends are spent in either of our homes. Since day one, I had a lot of respect for him. I also admired his in-depth knowledge in various areas.\n      On Jan 31st morning, Narasimhaji setup everything necessary for Homam. I quickly went through various options in the Camcorder. Narasimhaji said &quot;Ravi Shall we start&quot;. I looked at him and was mesmerized by the look in his face, him sitting in front of the homa kundam. Even after so many years of association, all of a sudden I felt like an ant at the tip of Mt.Everest that has been just told to climb the Everest, the whole shooting idea looked like an uphill task for me. I was trembling, I said yes, let&#39;s start and started recording, my hands still shaking. If you closely look at the first 10-12 secs of the video, you will notice the shake in the camera.   \n      He has lost a lot of weight over the last 5 years or so. With the clothes that he put on in the video, it is not seen, but he is much thinner and with the beard gone now, he looks much younger, much different. Internal changes bring about external changes and he has gone through ton of them. His actions/words speak all these. I am not bored listening him talk on the same topics over and over and over and over...  I am not bored reading his writings in this forum over and over and over and over...  \n      As Narayan once said, we are grateful to have Narasimhaji and Manishji guide us through our lives.\n\n      I have learnt a lot from Masterji and there is lot more to learn.\nI sincerely bow down to Masterji. I salute him for his dedication and\nunselfish service to the world. \n\nRegards\nRavi\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Friday, February 6, 2009 10:21:26 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Homam video\n\n\nNamaste\n\nThe video is very good, Good work by the video grapher and Narasimha.\nIt was a pleasure watching it and I feel that I will watch it a few \nmore times.\n\nMost importantly I want to bring out the fact that when one does a lot\njapams and homams, the good work is reflected in the persons face, \nthe lustre etc. Although I have not met Narasimha ever, I have seen \none picture of him may be from many years ago and now the video. \nThere is a striking difference between the two.\n\nThe transformation internally may be more intense and fantanstic.\n\nOn a different note, I have heard from a very realized soul that\nThe Saffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks is reserved \nfor them, it is not advisible for people like us married or single to \nput it on.
