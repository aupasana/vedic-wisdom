I looked up in JHora and thought it was Wednesday, March 5. Chaturdashi starts around 3 pm EST on March 5 and ends on Thursday, March 6 around 2 pm EST. I assumed that you would fast and pray the night of March 5 but our temple priests insists that we need to celebrate it on the midnight of March 6, when, in fact, it will be amavasya during the entire night...\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks once again,\n&gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       ____________________________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Be a better friend, newshound, and \n&gt; know-it-all with Yahoo!
