All other things are secondary. For example, many priests re-ena=\r\nct all the rituals that were supposed to be done since birth (e.g. naming, =\r\nfirst feeding, first shaving etc), just in case those samskaras were skippe=\r\nd earlier. One can wonder if that is really necessary and whether it has an=\r\ny real impact on one&#39;s spiritual evolution.\n \nThere is also a lot of fake d=\r\nrama enacted. The young person and his father repeat things in Sanskrit tha=\r\nt are told by the priest. Those who know Sanskrit will see that the young m=\r\nan says he is going to go to Kashi and learn Veda etc. He says he will live=\r\n by begging alms from now on. He even practices it by asking all attendees =\r\nfor alms. There is a lot of entertaining drama. Of course, most boys gettin=\r\ng upanayanam do not really intend to leave parents, go to Kashi to learn Ve=\r\nda and do not really plan to live by begging! A lot of things they say are =\r\nsimply lies, done just for fun and to enact a drama based on how things cou=\r\nld have been in old days!\n \n*        *        *\n \nPut bluntly, being given =\r\na mantra by a guru is essentially a spiritual event and not a social event =\r\nor a party, though upanayanam has transformed from a spiritual event into a=\r\n social event. All you really need is the young man and his guru sitting in=\r\n one place and the mantra being taught. You don&#39;t need a big crowd.\n \nOf co=\r\nurse, one may say that a big crowd is needed to come and give blessings, bu=\r\nt &quot;blessings&quot; are a misunderstood and overrated concept. For someone to giv=\r\ne you blessings that do some good to you, the person should have something =\r\nin his karmik account and the ability to transfer it to you. Most of the ti=\r\nmes, blessings given by people in our society are a mere formality and mean=\r\n nothing, like checks that have &quot;void - this is not a real check&quot; printed o=\r\nn them.\n \nInstead of hundred people with various levels of interest in the =\r\ngoings on visiting the function out of social compulsion and watching possi=\r\nbly with boredom, an ideal setup for an upanayanam is just the sishya and g=\r\nuru and some sadhakas related to them who have done sadhana and wish the yo=\r\nung man well.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you ask me, the most important thi=\r\nng is this. The person who is transmitting the Gayatri mantra (usually fath=\r\ner) should intensify his spiritual sadhana, especially with Gayatri mantra,=\r\n in the months before upanayanam. If possible, keep brahmacharya for a few =\r\nmonths and chant Gayatri mantra for an hour or two everyday. During that ti=\r\nme, he should never say Gayatri mantra out loud.\n \nWhen he transmits the ma=\r\nntra, he should ensure that only the young man hears it and nobody else doe=\r\ns (i.e. no dilution in the transmitted energy). The custom is to say it in =\r\nthe ear while a cloth covers both, but that only *symbolizes* secretiveness=\r\n and may not really *ensure* secretiveness. If everybody (especially the pr=\r\niest) is sitting close to them, they may also hear it in spite of a the clo=\r\nth covering them.\n \nWhen I did upanayanam to my son, we did the rituals in =\r\nopen air in our back yard. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I took my s=\r\non inside the pooja room where I did my sadhana. I did not allow anybody, i=\r\nncluding the priests, to come there. I taught the mantra to my son in an lo=\r\nw, but audible, voice. I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a few tim=\r\nes, ensured his pronunciation was correct, and then both of us did a maalaa=\r\n (108 times meditation) with it silently. We then came back to the backyard=\r\n and the rituals continued.\n \nOne more thing on muhurta: If you got a muhur=\r\nta from an astrologer you trust and want to follow it, please ensure that G=\r\nayatri mantra is taught at that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Some pries=\r\nts put a paste made of cumin seeds and jaggery on the young man&#39;s head at t=\r\nhe muhurta time. That is irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thing.\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \nThough we did a detailed ritual for my son&#39;s upanayana=\r\nm, my own upanayanam was a very simple affair. Though my father is an ortho=\r\ndox braahmana following a very simple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthod=\r\nox in the matter of rituals. Above all, he fearlessly follows his convictio=\r\nns and does not engage in rituals that he does not consider meaningful. He =\r\nis also against following the letter of the rules and breaking the spirit. =\r\nFor example, when he went to a griha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, =\r\nthey were beating a cow to force it to climb stairs to enter the room. Peop=\r\nle bring a cow into the room at the time of housewarming, as they consider =\r\na cow to symbolize Lakshmi and some steps in the ritual require a cow in th=\r\ne room. As the cow was not happy to climb stairs, they resorted to violence=\r\n to force it. My father was sad to see the suffering of the cow and told th=\r\nem bluntly that they were doing adharma and there was no point in getting a=\r\n cow in the room like that. But my father puts more value on the spirit of =\r\nthe rules rather than the letter and does not hesitate to speak his mind in=\r\n front of anybody.\n \nFor my upanayanam, he took me to Lord Venkateswara tem=\r\nple in Tirupati/Tirumala, which is his favorite temple. At the time of muhu=\r\nrta, we were on the hill near the temple. He spent a few hours doing his ja=\r\npam with various stotras and I also did japam with several stotras. When th=\r\ne muhurta came, he simply taught me Gayatri mantra and that was it. No ritu=\r\nals of any kind were performed, except for japam for a few hours.\n \nIn my o=\r\npinion, such a simple approach is also perfectly fine. The key points are t=\r\nhat the person giving mantra should have done some sadhana, both of them sh=\r\nould be in a good and relaxed mood at the time and environment should be pe=\r\naceful, and, the person receiving mantra should do a lot of sadhana with it=\r\n later on.\n \nIf a businessman opens an account in his son&#39;s name for a new =\r\nbusiness venture by the young man, what matters is how much money father ga=\r\nve and how well the son used the money, how he ran the new business and how=\r\n he grew the money. How big a party was held, how many people came and what=\r\n activities they engaged in is irrelevant in the long run.\n \n*        *    =\r\n    *\n \nMy purpose is not to discourage elaborate rituals. Do them if there=\r\n is social pressure to do so or you find them interesting. But, atleast ens=\r\nure that mantropadesa happens peacefully and correctly. More importantly, e=\r\nnsure that the young man does some sadhana with Gayatri mantra everyday, af=\r\nter upanayanam.\n \nAlso, it is perfectly acceptable (and beneficial) to init=\r\niate the young person into homam after upanayanam is done. On the same day =\r\nor a few days later, one can teach a simple version of Ganapathi homam and =\r\nlet the young person perform it by oneself during weekends or so. One can s=\r\ntart off with the super-short procedure and slowly add things. Doing Gayatr=\r\ni mantra everyday and homam now and then will accelerate the spiritual evol=\r\nution of the young person.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for sho=\r\nrt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n \n---- Sunitha &lt;sunitha_macherla@...=\r\nm&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaskaram Narasimha garu,  Can the homam performed during upa=\r\nnayanam be done using only coconuts and nuts?
