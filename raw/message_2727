It is not synonymous with certain success. Why\nshould one=92s =\r\nattempts be always attended with success? Success develops\narrogance and th=\r\ne man=92s spiritual progress is thus arrested. Failure on the\nother hand is=\r\n beneficial, inasmuch as it opens the eyes of the man to his\nlimitations an=\r\nd prepares him to surrender himself.Self-surrender is\nsynonymous with etern=\r\nal happiness. Therefore one should try to gain the\nequipoise of mind under =\r\nall circumstances. That is will-power.\n\nAgain, success and failure are the =\r\nresults of prarabdha and not of\nwill-power. A man may be doing only good an=\r\nd noble actions and yet prove a\nfailure. Another may do otherwise and yet b=\r\ne uniformly successful. This does\nnot mean that the will-power is present i=\r\nn the one and not in the other.\n\nSource: Talk 423\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sr=\r\ni Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb56b97e758e04750241ce\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans=\r\n-serif; font-size: 13px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body =\r\nentry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: =\r\n0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n: bold; &quot;&gt;Devotee.:&lt;/span&gt;=A0What are the means for gaining will-power?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Bhagavan&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your idea o=\r\nf will-power is success insured.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Will-po=\r\nwer should be understood to be the strength of mind which makes it capable =\r\nfor meeting success or failure with equanimity.&lt;/span&gt;=A0It is not synonymo=\r\nus with certain success.=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Why should o=\r\nne=92s attempts be always attended with success?
