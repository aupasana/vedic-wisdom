I think that should suffice for occassional happenings. I ha=\r\nve no idea of Mantra for shifting the lord temperorily.\n&gt; \n&gt; My point in Ab=\r\nhisheka was that, if we don&#39;t like to bath with reused water then we don&#39;t =\r\ndo that for The lord.If we wish to eat best quality food, we must strive to=\r\n offer same quality if not the better as Naivedya. You know all this but st=\r\nill i wrote with the intentions that somebody coming to the list might get =\r\nsome idea in future.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, you are the best judge of your situation=\r\n w.r.t. Abhisheka as you mentioned your practical difficulties.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vey ha=\r\nppy Ugaadi, Cheti Chand, Gudi Padava, Navreh to every one from Andhra, Karn=\r\naataka, Maharashtra and Kashmir.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana Rao Pingali&quot;=\r\n &lt;pvklnrao@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pat=\r\nhak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Vijay,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Few thi=\r\nngs came to my mind after reading your message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Your intenti=\r\nons were right. i.e. you wanted your son to stay focussed in the Puja hence=\r\n you moved the Shiva Linga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * If you lifted the Linga without h=\r\naving any sense of presence of Shiva then i think your own faith of invokat=\r\nion was lesser. This seems to be the case for many of us or Most of us. We =\r\ninvoke the deity in the Fire and Idol but then the prsence is forgotten.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I moved, I mentally asked Siva to pardon me. So, I did not have=\r\n any doubt about Siva presence when I moved it. How ever, if a person I res=\r\npect is sitting in a sofa, I will try to avoid moving the sofa. But, if nee=\r\nded, I will request the guest to stand up and then move the sofa. In this c=\r\nase, if I had requested Siva to come to another object and after moving the=\r\n siva linga, I restored him into Siva lingam, I would not have felt bad. Ho=\r\nw ever, I do not quite know if this is appropriate (I know how to ask Siva =\r\nto come to yatha sthanam, but is there any procedure to shift the place of =\r\nthe God once he is invoked?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * Same goes for reusing of Water for=\r\n Abhisheka. it gives that we didn&#39;t care much for Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; No, I won&#39;t ag=\r\nree your view here. I did not care about the act of abhisheka. I was seeing=\r\n it merely as an act to glue my son to the seat. How ever, my son pour the =\r\nwater fast and hence I end up get lots and lots of water. I usually drink t=\r\nhe water after he finishes the abhishekam. If I should not reuse the water,=\r\n I won&#39;t be able to drink up all the water. May be I can use it for bathing=\r\n the next day (but then storing the water becomes a regular activity). So, =\r\nreusing the water seem to simplify the whole thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But It is yo=\r\nur own good heart which immediately realised the error and provocated the t=\r\nhought of doubt. it was such a strong feeling that you wrote to the list. t=\r\nhat shows your concern about the whole issue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, b=\r\noth the points mentioned needs to be avoided hence forth. Though i feel Shi=\r\nva is easy going and Bhole Baba who is reputed for not taking offense for s=\r\nuch trivial issues.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for your kind responce.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I trea=\r\nted Siva as a kid (if my son is in sofa watching TV, I won&#39;t hesitate to mo=\r\nve the sofa - in this case I had mentally requested Siva not to mind; but i=\r\nn the end my son started doing it himself, (once the bowl was full, he took=\r\n the siva lingam out and put it in the other container and continued that w=\r\nay. That is what made me think if I am misdirecting him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How ever,=\r\n strangely I felt resonating sound while I was chanting mRtyunjaya mantra (=\r\nfelt as if there is chanting from with in me) and felt very well. So, I am =\r\nsure Siva was not upset - but that could be because he is Siva.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I =\r\nwill definitely try not to move the idol.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
