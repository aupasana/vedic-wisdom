For the last\ncouple of years, I have witnessed a gradual yet strong incli=\r\nnation\ntowards spirituality, religion, rituals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish.=\r\n I\nhave been reading a lot about them, mostly via the internet, some\nreadin=\r\ngs more helpful than others, but each drawing me closer towards\nlearning mo=\r\nre and understanding better. A lot of what I read here, in\nthis yahoo-group=\r\n, is one of the most lucid explanation of spirituality,\nand the final goal =\r\nof every saadhana, and the link between spirituality\nand rituals, yoga, ayu=\r\nrveda, and leading a simple and humble life.\n\nRead the books by Dr Robert E=\r\n Svoboda on any of the above topics, they\nwill help you. Start with Aghora =\r\n1\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I have downloaded the book compiled from your writings on spiritual\n=\r\nmatters and I am in the process of reading that as well, and derive\ngreat h=\r\nappiness in reading it. I also visited your website and saw a\nwealth of mat=\r\nerial for spiritually inclined people there. The manuals on\ndo-it-yourself =\r\nhomams are one of your outstanding contributions to\nsociety, and shine brig=\r\nhtly among the other gems of your contributions.\nI feel an inclination towa=\r\nrds performing homams on a daily/weekly basis.\nBefore I start this, I want =\r\nto seek your guidance on the following:\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Do I need to prepare myself =\r\nin any way before I start the homam?- I\nwill explain to you what I mean her=\r\ne - since you have suggested that one\nstart with MahaGanapathi homam, I sha=\r\nll start with it too. However, as I\nhave been worshipping DeviMa every morn=\r\ning and Hanumanji every evening,\ndo I need to start worshipping MahaGanapat=\r\nhi now for a few days during\nmornings and evenings and then after a few day=\r\ns, start with the homam?\n\nVipin ji, the energy that you are planning to wor=\r\nship is  no different\nfrom the one that you already are worshiping. So don&#39;=\r\nt worry. When you\nread the Atharva Sheersham, understand the meaning, that =\r\nforms are\ndifferent , the energy is the same. The energy expresses itself\nd=\r\nifferently with each form, but the source remains the same. Our mind\npercei=\r\nves things as differently. It goes on tangents like &quot;if i worship\nthis form=\r\n, will the other one get offended?&quot; All that is a convolution.\nJust start t=\r\nhe homam.\n\n\n&gt; 2. Related to the first question, as I have been worshipping =\r\nDeviMa\nfor quite sometime now, I see/visualize Her many times during the da=\r\ny\n(at work/home), so now when I start with the MahaGanapathi homam with\ncom=\r\nplete faith, devotion, and surrender to MahaGanapathi, wouldn&#39;t there\nbe a =\r\nconflict in my mind, since I may still be visualizing DeviMa\neverywhere aro=\r\nund me (due to mind&#39;s conditioning), while I am\nworshipping MahaGanapathi a=\r\ns the One who is the source, cradle and end\nof everything, and hence shoule=\r\n be visualizing Him instead? This may be\na hypothetical situation, as I am =\r\ntalking about the future, however, may\nstill be relevant, and so I seek you=\r\nr advice here.\n\nRefer to the above reply.\nDevi Ma is no different , Infact =\r\nshe will help you. Take Ganpathi ji as\none of her aspects and vice- a - ver=\r\nsa and ask her to guide you, and she\nwill. If you sincerely surrender, your=\r\n questions will cease to exist\nsoon. Bete, devi ma aur ganeshi mein farak s=\r\nirf tumhare dimaag mein\nhain.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. As I am householder, and we are expect=\r\ning our first child in the\nnext few months, is it ok to perform a homam at =\r\nhome? It may sound\njouvenile but I don&#39;t know any better, and would rather =\r\nlisten to wiser\nmen. The reason I ask this is that while doing the homam, w=\r\ne chant\nvarious mantras/stotras, and they produce effects in the immediate\n=\r\nenvironment, specially in the presence of Agni, the Pavaka. Although,\nthe g=\r\noal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd to move towards\ngreater purity=\r\n, humility and peace, and I have faith that a regular\nhomam will enable me =\r\nto achieve that. However, for the sake of my wife\nand our child (inside her=\r\n womb), I am prompted to ask this question.\nPlease don&#39;t take it in any oth=\r\ner way except as a genuine concern for my\nfamily (however silly it is)\n\nIn =\r\ntwo words, I&#39;ll provide you the answer to that.\n\nNo Problem\n\n&gt; 4. Related t=\r\no the above question, if it is fine for me to do the homam\nat home, then ca=\r\nn my pregnant wife also participate in it, if she wants\nto?\n\nYes, if she is=\r\n comfortable. You are not doing a ritual for destruction,\nwhat harm can a l=\r\nittle worship bring?\n\n&gt; 5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amav=\r\nasya or an eclipse\nto start the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, shoul=\r\nd I do the homam\nat a particular time every day or is any time fine? I do u=\r\nnderstand that\ndoing the homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, what=\r\never time\none does it, is more beneficial than doing it at different times.=\r\n\n  Just start, start today, start tomorrow, let eclipses handle\nthemselves,=\r\n you handle yourself. Forget what is beneficial, what will be\nmore profitab=\r\nle and more gainful, just start, rest of the instructions\nganpathi ji will =\r\nprovide.\n\n&gt; 6. Is it better to do the homam at home or can it be done elsew=\r\nhere as\nwell? The reason I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodati=\r\non\nand the smoke from the homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling.\nHowe=\r\nver, in our residential/apartment complex, there is a common area,\nwhich is=\r\n open on two sides, where some community festivals are\ncelebrated together,=\r\n and if I get the permission, then maybe I can do\nthe homam there? Is there=\r\n a strong reason/added benefit to doing the\nhomam at home?\n\nIf there is a b=\r\nackyard do it there, if there is a terrace do it there,\nif you are doing it=\r\n in the house, do it near a window to help the smoke\nalong. Regarding your =\r\nadded benefit clause, are you doing a homam for\nbenefits or to celebrate/wo=\r\nrship Ganpathi ji?\nForget maximum benefits, start with any benefit.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimhaji, I will be very grateful to you for your answers to the\nabove ques=\r\ntions.\nOh yaar tu shuru toh kar, sawaal baad mein kariyo.\n&gt;\n&gt; You are rende=\r\nring a great service to today&#39;s society and we pray to\nDeviMa to keep showi=\r\nng you the way.\nYes indeed he and his Guru is, but like he would say forget=\r\n me and say\nDevima zindabaad!!\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for sharing so much!\nYay!!\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Humble regards,\n&gt; Vipin\nWoohoo\n\nNamaste,\nNobody\n\n\r\n--8-4630810902-8489864968=:4\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vasu_vipin&quot; &lt;vasu_vipin@...&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji,&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Namaste Vipin ji, I am=\r\n not Narasimha, just felt like replying to you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I feel =\r\nblessed to have chanced upon this yahoo group!
