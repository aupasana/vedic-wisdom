Everyone,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I just thought of adding=\r\n some clarifications.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;First of all, when I mentioned about the u=\r\ntility of techniques of &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; for handl=\r\ning the problem of spirit attachments as well as many other problems for wh=\r\nich we do not have reasonable explanation, my assertions were limited to th=\r\ne utility part only and not beyond that. I have no knowledge about whether =\r\npast life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anything=\r\n whatsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT.=\r\n..The Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of =\r\nthe term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still continue wit=\r\nh life irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though=\r\n we know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is =\r\nthe other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises=C2=A0in the ea=\r\nst&quot;, &quot;Sun=C2=A0sets=C2=A0in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on c=\r\nontinuing with activities which\n helps in keeping life go on...It is in thi=\r\ns sense that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;One should not comment about the wealth inside a sea just by st=\r\nanding at the shore. Life is full of infinite possibilities. When we say th=\r\nat the God is infinite, we just can not say that the universe can behave in=\r\n any particular limited ways. Before anyone comments about the utility of a=\r\nny branch of knowledge one=C2=A0must first take a sincere dip into the same=\r\n. By saying so, I do not mean to say that if=C2=A0one really takes a sincer=\r\ne dip into any subject one would definitely be convinced about the same.=C2=\r\n=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before taking a sincere dip, =\r\nI just mean to say that=C2=A0by doing so one would prevent oneself from bei=\r\nng dogmatic, narrow. Not only=C2=A0blind belief in religion and religious p=\r\nractices=C2=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also in science if one loses th=\r\ne scientific temper.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that =\r\nI can say to the persons willing to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnoth=\r\nerapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=C2=A0those who a=\r\nre desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind.

Jainas used this techn=\r\nique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the followers.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that=C2=A0so far as my knowledge=\r\n goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, but however, t=\r\nhere are so many problems which can be handled even over phone. To cite one=\r\n example - One girl was having=C2=A0one recurrent bad horrifying dream for =\r\npast 4/5 years and she=C2=A0approached me for the treatment.=C2=A0But due t=\r\no my=C2=A0official engagements I was camping at a far off place for around =\r\n2 months.=C2=A0Her problem was getting worsened as it=C2=A0had=C2=A0 starte=\r\nd affecting her professional career adversely. So having left with no choic=\r\ne, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phone session continued f=\r\nor around one and half an hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent=\r\n dream and also started improving her professional life. Since that day the=\r\n dream has not yet visited her again.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;It all depends on the open=\r\nness of the mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe =\r\nis much more than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to se=\r\ne.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Regards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:0=\r\n0 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Namast=\r\ne,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To add to the complexity of the problem, I believe our understandin=\r\ng of the reincarnation is over simplified and that causes more problems. Re=\r\nincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments=\r\n from past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external conscious=\r\nness. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportu=\r\nnity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be reca=\r\nlled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved a=\r\nnd new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in=\r\n the existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our =\r\nidea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. =\r\nIt is like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n =\r\nto give the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disinte=\r\ngrated and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these=\r\n can coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts =\r\ncan simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part=\r\n. =C2=A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnatio=\r\nn, to have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while ano=\r\nther part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Lik=\r\ne a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his=\r\n energy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarn=\r\nating in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits wit=\r\nh their philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of =\r\na reincarnation looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy go=\r\nverned only by a supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. =\r\nJain scriptures are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to=\r\n get rid of the illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/=\r\nNirvana. There is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the t=\r\nendency towards strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not=\r\n dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one lif=\r\ne to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop=\r\n this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human min=\r\nd/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual an=\r\nd unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, =\r\nbe able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a=\r\n Divine Life.=C2=A0A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it =\r\nis only one among many possibilities.=C2=A0 If=C2=A0 moving into a state \no=\r\nf complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, the=\r\nn there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex life-a=\r\nctions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an i=\r\ndea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. T=\r\nhe important thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and c=\r\nome forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations =\r\nimmediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorith=\r\nm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of peopl=\r\ne can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually =\r\nget born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]=\r\n. Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of =\r\nplay, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give a=\r\nnd take of energy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everyt=\r\nhing else being perishable, the only indestructible link between past life =\r\nand present life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and n=\r\never a complete cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now =\r\nif there have been lives when the soul had little or no frontal role to pla=\r\ny at all, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no tr=\r\nace. For Nature, those lives serve no purpose at all. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Moreover =\r\nall these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts living in and =\r\nthrough the soul in a very very strong manner. That is not easy. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Reg=\r\nards\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me =\r\nyet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insat=\r\niate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nOn Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

I am sure there too one can find good exo=\r\nrcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have very little knowledge=\r\n about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried any=\r\n sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;However, there is a particu=\r\nlar mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency =\r\nfor these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known a=\r\ns Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one =\r\nwhose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in =\r\nthe Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhai=\r\nrava has been\n invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditi=\r\nons for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremat=\r\nion ground. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations o=\r\nf this mantra too, all are good):\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddha=\r\narnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 m=\r\nalas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this should be continue=\r\nd daily till such time that there is some visible relief. One more thing is=\r\n that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit possession, as far a=\r\ns I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorc=\r\nist from a distance. These days almost no one has that kind of terrific sha=\r\nkti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physical presence in fron=\r\nt of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family =\r\nmembers, who live with the girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go thro=\r\nugh the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing =\r\nhomas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign land homas may not b=\r\ne that easy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If the family visits India, then I have a suggestio=\r\nn. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the K=\r\nalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the =\r\nmain priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many ex=\r\ncellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of ne=\r\ngative influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask=\r\n the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific=\r\n day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know ha=\r\nve actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other meth=\r\nods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Hope\n this\n helps.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O=\r\n spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a=\r\n hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: &quot;b_jamnadas@=\r\n...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Sat=\r\nurday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra f=\r\nor protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste.

For there are various classes and kin=\r\nds and types of entities which can possess an individual and some of them c=\r\nan be downright nasty.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Upayas are many. As so many different peo=\r\nple have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether=\r\n any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depends on mu=\r\nltiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depe=\r\nnds on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and wha=\r\nt their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root=\r\n, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person.\n =\r\nSometimes it can be\n something\n as simple as spitting somewhere (where this=\r\n being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and being sus=\r\nceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in=\r\n some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an i=\r\nndividual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop =\r\nmethod of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the sha=\r\nkti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are a=\r\nble to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a =\r\nviolent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to r=\r\nemove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;T=\r\nhese things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall=\r\n under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getti=\r\nng into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay awa=\r\ny. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n handle =\r\nthe same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time till w=\r\nhich, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the i=\r\nndividual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some =\r\nnot so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit.=\r\n It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individu=\r\nal I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting=\r\n any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well =\r\nas the time frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the =\r\nprevious karmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit a=\r\nnd do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free =\r\nwill, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove=\r\n it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a=\r\n very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best thing to do=\r\n is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession a=\r\nnd hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family=\r\n members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, C=\r\nhandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and d=\r\no it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a =\r\n10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of p=\r\nossession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with =\r\nthe mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very =\r\nend. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then=\r\n either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him=\r\n/her. And pray as hard as possible. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best of luck and may God he=\r\nlp the family.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet=\r\n/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiat=\r\ne/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 20=\r\n13 8:17 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from =\r\nspirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Thank you Nithi=\r\nn, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises -  crea=\r\nking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different ene=\r\nrgies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather=\r\n evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make =\r\nup because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but on=\r\nce I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in =\r\na terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some s=\r\nteps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly =\r\nbecome fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that =\r\nspirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more peopl=\r\ne staying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it=\r\n&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at =\r\nthat place before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to =\r\nsleep properly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I st=\r\narted waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short =\r\nbeings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the=\r\n sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefull=\r\ny.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds=\r\n of astral beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to slee=\r\np.

I have no knowledge about whether pas=\r\nt life exists or not, in fact I do not have any knowledge about anything wh=\r\natsoever, as I believe, any knowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...T=\r\nhe Absolute....is half knowledge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the=\r\n term. However, in our this empirical life we have to still continue with l=\r\nife irrespective of the fact of having absolute knowledge or not. Though we=\r\n know for sure that the Sun does not make rounds of the earth but it is the=\r\n other way around, still we use sentences like &quot;Sun rises&nbsp;in the east&quot;=\r\n, &quot;Sun&nbsp;sets&nbsp;in the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on cont=\r\ninuing with activities which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this se=\r\nnse that I&#39;d mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;One should not comment =\r\nabout the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full o=\r\nf infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just can=\r\n not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Befor=\r\ne anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one&nbsp;mus=\r\nt first take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to sa=\r\ny that if&nbsp;one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would de=\r\nfinitely be convinced about the same.&nbsp;By saying that one shouldn&#39;t mak=\r\ne comments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that&nbsp;by doi=\r\nng so one would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only&nbsp;=\r\nblind belief in religion and religious practices&nbsp;can be termed as dogm=\r\natic but also in\n science if one loses the scientific temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, a=\r\nll that I can say to the persons willing to address any of their problems. =\r\n&quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for&nbsp;tho=\r\nse who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind. Those w=\r\nho are interested can read &quot; Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to st=\r\nart with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;To respect=\r\ned Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are not &quot;new age ideas&quot;=\r\n. These were there much before in India.\n to cite concept of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot;=\r\n of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this technique of &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot;=\r\n to reinforce renunciation in the\n followers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that&nbsp;s=\r\no far as my knowledge goes Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over =\r\nphone, but however, there are so many problems which can be handled even ov=\r\ner phone. To cite one example - One girl was having&nbsp;one recurrent bad =\r\nhorrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she&nbsp;approached me for the trea=\r\ntment.&nbsp;But due to my&nbsp;official engagements I was camping at a far =\r\noff place for around 2 months.&nbsp;Her problem was getting worsened as it&=\r\nnbsp;had&nbsp; started affecting her professional career adversely. So havi=\r\nng left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone. The phon=\r\ne session continued for around one and half an hour and she got relieved fr=\r\nom her that recurrent dream\n and also started improving her\n professional l=\r\nife. Since that day the dream has not yet visited her again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;It all depends on the openness of th=\r\ne mind, the strength of the desire to overcome etc. The universe is much mo=\r\nre than what we see,what we can see and what we can believe to see.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt; &lt;div s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-family: HelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lu=\r\ncida Grande&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: H=\r\nelveticaNeue, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, Helvetica, Arial, &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, sans-ser=\r\nif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; On=\r\n Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n shape=3D&quot;rect&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrot=\r\ne:&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 1=\r\n2pt; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\nNamaste,&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;To add to the complexity of t=\r\nhe problem, I believe our understanding of the reincarnation is over simpli=\r\nfied and that causes more problems. Reincarnation is of the soul, and the s=\r\noul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a =\r\nrole to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a =\r\nlife where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and s=\r\nhine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process=\r\n. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need=\r\n.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in th=\r\ne existence of a soul. They believe in Shunya - which is similar to our ide=\r\na of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of reincarnation\n is very different. It =\r\nis like an energy stream made up of mind, body that coalesces together\n to =\r\ngive the impression of an individual being, which upon death get disintegra=\r\nted and and spread into the greater flow of energy. Now part(s) of these ca=\r\nn coalesce into another formation at a later date, and some other parts can=\r\n simultaneous or at a different point can coalesce into a different part. &=\r\nnbsp; Hence it is possible for a Lama, in their doctrine of reincarnation, =\r\nto have the some parts of his energy reincarnate into one body while anothe=\r\nr part of his energy reincarnate into another body *simultaneously*. Like a=\r\n Lama may have his energy of speech incarnating in one person, while his en=\r\nergy of mind incarnating in another person, or his energy of body incarnati=\r\nng in another person and all these happening simultaneously! It fits with t=\r\nheir philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those philosophies =\r\nwhich believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Universe only =\r\nas a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of\n debts/balan=\r\nces - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this term. =\r\nThe final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and move in=\r\nto a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that is of an=\r\ny final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal renunciati=\r\non of life and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But th=\r\ne old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved=\r\n at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life to anoth=\r\ner and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop this soul=\r\n&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body veh=\r\nicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual and unique s=\r\noul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to=\r\n *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Li=\r\nfe.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimat=\r\ne aim, it is only one among many possibilities.&nbsp; If&nbsp; moving into =\r\na state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitabl=\r\ne aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform com=\r\nplex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here too, but it is not rest=\r\nricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the ide=\r\na of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the s=\r\noul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes th=\r\ne karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and=\r\n real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have kille=\r\nd hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did no=\r\nt have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of t=\r\nhose he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the =\r\nsoul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rn=\r\nabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style: normal; font-size: 16px; background-color: transparent; fon=\r\nt-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style: normal; font-size: 16px; b=\r\nackground-color: transparent; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, t=\r\nimes, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything els=\r\ne being perishable, the only indestructible link between past life and pres=\r\nent life, it is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a c=\r\nomplete cinematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there=\r\n have been lives when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all=\r\n, then those are dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace.\n Fo=\r\nr Nature, those lives\n serve no purpose at all. &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style: normal; font-size: 16px; background-color: t=\r\nransparent; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style: normal; font-=\r\nsize: 16px; background-color: transparent; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, =\r\n&#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Moreover all these are possible ONLY if an=\r\nd when an individual starts living in and through the soul in a very very s=\r\ntrong manner.
