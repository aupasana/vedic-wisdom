I tried today, and boy, it was hard...failed most=\r\nly, to be honest.\n\nBut every sage Ramakrishna, Anandamayi Ma, Ammachi, Siva=\r\nnanda, Chaitanya, Mira, Rabia, Papa Ramdas, every one of them was obsessed =\r\nwith this Name business. That means, there must be something to it.\n\nI real=\r\nly want to take up Nobody ji&#39;s suggestion and get obsessed with the Name. I=\r\n firmly believe in it. I got sick (real sick) a few times, and the Name hel=\r\nped me (have had 2-3 black outs when I was unwell, long story, but basicall=\r\ny, I was conscious during these black outs, and it felt like I was dying...=\r\nand it sounds odd, but there were no thoughts except the Name &quot;Keshava plea=\r\nse help me&quot; or &quot;Narayana&quot;). These episodes scared the bejesus out of me, an=\r\nd each time I came out of them, I felt &quot;I MUST DO MORE JAPA&quot; it&#39;s the only =\r\nthing that&#39;ll save me. All else is of no use when I&#39;m in deep sh*t (pardon =\r\nmy language), the Name alone is reliable.\n\nWhat I&#39;m trying to say, is I wan=\r\nt to devise some practical ways to get serious about this sadhana. \n\nSivana=\r\nnda Saraswati (Rishikesh) was a big fan of japa, and especially of Purascha=\r\nrana (repeating mantra as many lakhs as there are syllables in the mantra. =\r\nEg Gayatri has 24 syllables, so one Purascharana is 24 lakh repetitions). H=\r\ne went on to say that 14 crore of japa with feeling would result in Darshan=\r\n of God in physical form, face to face. That would be great! Really wanted =\r\nto do it...but when I did the maths, I worked out that, at the rate of 12 h=\r\nours japa a day, every single day from now on, it would take me till age 83=\r\n to finish this. :( \n\nBut hey, I decided to make a start anyway, and began =\r\nmy my first Purascharana of the Om Namo Narayanaya mantra, in January this =\r\nyear, I am doing a measley 11 rounds a day, with my mind wandering most of =\r\nthe time (hard core people do hundreds of rounds with proper concentration =\r\ndaily). I&#39;m a slow chanter, and need to say the mantra loudly or in a barel=\r\ny audible whisper. My mental chanting is gradually improving but very diffi=\r\ncult to do for more than 1-2 minutes. It&#39;s gonna take me till October 2013 =\r\nto finish the 8 lakhs. Then my plan is to take a 3 month break (and do 7 ro=\r\nunds a day), and then start another Purascharana. \n\nAnyway, two things help=\r\n me get my 11 rounds of japa done every day when I&#39;m at work/outdoors. Thou=\r\nght I&#39;d mention it, if anybody&#39;s interested, just in case it&#39;s helpful. \n\nO=\r\nne is Telephone Japa. I hold my mobile to my ear, and pretend I&#39;m on the ph=\r\none. While doing this, I stick my hand in my pocket and count the japa on m=\r\ny fingers. I get a couple of rounds done during my working day this way (I =\r\ncheck carefully to make sure nobody&#39;s listening). Also while stuck in traff=\r\nic (while the car is NOT moving), I put my hands-free ear pieces on, and pr=\r\netend I&#39;m chatting to a friend on the phone and do a couple of rounds. \n\nTh=\r\ne other thing that I find useful (now please excuse the phrase), is &quot;Toilet=\r\n japa&quot;. When I need to escape to do a round or two of japa at work, I excus=\r\ne myself for a few minutes and lock myself up in a toilet cubicle. I then v=\r\nery very quietly mutter the mantra to myself for 5-10 minutes (lips moving,=\r\n no sound audible, in case anybody hears). I do about 2 sessions of this a =\r\nday. This allows me to complete my 11 rounds a day, on days when my working=\r\n hours are long. \n\nI know this sounds bonkers, but I thought I&#39;d mention th=\r\nis for anyone else whose work life interferes with their japa. At least, it=\r\n provides a solution to doing a bit of japa at work.\n\nIf anybody else has a=\r\nny thoughts/suggestions, on how to repeat God&#39; Name constantly, kindly shar=\r\ne. \n\nBest wishes, and Om Namo Narayanaya, \n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
