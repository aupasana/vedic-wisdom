There are plenty of simultaneous things tha=\r\nt can happen. Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalin=\r\ni awakening may not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a perso=\r\nn suddenly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very sub=\r\ntle nature. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities of al=\r\nl kinds. If by some chance the link to this world opens up, willingly or un=\r\nwillingly, it can cause quite a bit of problems for both mature as well as =\r\nimmature people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get aff=\r\nected by them easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected by a =\r\nplethora of false experiences and misplaced priorities. As such a diagnosis=\r\n like this simply cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of this for=\r\num (unless I am grossly mistaken).\n\nDoing a homa with the desire that someo=\r\nne gets cured maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences=\r\n. Some part of the person&#39;s karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You m=\r\nust have enuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it. It is never adv=\r\nisable to enter into the cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must =\r\nalso wear all necessary protections.=C2=A0 The first rule is curing such ki=\r\nnd of psycho-spiritual maladies is to find out what causes the effect, and =\r\nif the person is trying to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how m=\r\nuch of the effect will come to the person and how easily s/he can handle it=\r\n. All this is complex and not easy at all.

But how is a doctor to t=\r\nell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both in=\r\nclude similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that othe=\r\nrs cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. A=\r\nre these hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no =\r\ndiagnostic test. \n\nHowever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the at=\r\ntention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychose=\r\ns.... their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuin=\r\ne &quot;I hear voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. \n\nAbout va=\r\nta, most of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They=\r\n are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vat=\r\na derangement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advi=\r\nce. The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sur=\r\ne this does no good for vata.\n\nThe Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I w=\r\nill do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this=\r\n to any patient. \n\nCan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the =\r\nkundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and=\r\n will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this wi=\r\nll not harm them, though I doubt it will help.\n\nAdvice and thoughts from al=\r\nl members would be much appreciated.\n\nOm Dum Durgayai Namaha\n\nAparna\n\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

See all the sain=\r\nts. You are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact=\r\n they all lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). Ho=\r\nwever the internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so =\r\ncompletely that some great ones were completely unaware of their external p=\r\nroblems.\n&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world=\r\n to sleep.I sometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in=\r\n the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the ba=\r\nby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything withou=\r\nt the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.\n&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is =\r\nthat they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine M=\r\nother takes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nThat results in the problem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges&quot; of energy may=C2=A0resu=\r\nlt=C2=A0in mental havoc.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Ku=\r\nndalini rise are brought up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with=\r\n the Air element which is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in =\r\nthese people.\n&gt; &gt;Some=C2=A0of the=C2=A0people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; ma=\r\ny be people who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing i=\r\nn their lives and think that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them ge=\r\nt some esteem in the eye of the general public.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the spec=\r\nific problem:In general, for any doctor, the separation of the true from th=\r\ne false claims must precede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kund=\r\nalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in=\r\n food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;To finish V=\r\nata, all=C2=A0that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Con=\r\ntrol of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the b=\r\nody to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in diffi=\r\ncult real cases may be useful.\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small=C2=A0Homas to MahaGa=\r\nnapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should real=\r\nly improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.\n&gt; &gt;The whole p=\r\nrocess may be chalked out over one-two years.\n&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, ju=\r\nst psychotherapy may be sufficient.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao  wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatric problem=\r\ns may expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not =\r\nbe one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneou=\r\nsly rising through various nadis without one having gone through proper pre=\r\nparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and development o=\r\nf detachment) CAN create havoc!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundalini=\r\n may spontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana, while many serious sad=\r\nhakas may not experience it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT =\r\nan achievement. It is just A SMALL\n&gt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limi=\r\nted identity.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move fr=\r\nom one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge pala=\r\nce (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into i=\r\nt when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in t=\r\nhe palace still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due=\r\n to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. Th=\r\ne former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can =\r\nprogress towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experien=\r\nces. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and =\r\nputting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundali=\r\nni rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one=\r\n may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not e=\r\nven want it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana,=\r\n try not to fancy too many specific\n&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanis=\r\nm in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give =\r\nyou right now, arising from YOUR\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature someti=\r\nmes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want someth=\r\ning else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and b=\r\ne born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wea=\r\nlth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very=\r\n healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt; case, one may =\r\ndeeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt; as a tiger or a=\r\n dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt; experience. Bas=\r\nically, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking=\r\n&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kunda=\r\nlini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kun=\r\ndalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life,=\r\n one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructif=\r\ny (if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if =\r\none is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;On=\r\nce I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicke=\r\nd so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain=\r\n slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are l=\r\nike that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex an=\r\nd scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If our =\r\nideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect a=\r\nnd if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realiza=\r\ntion of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, =\r\nwithout being scared?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundali=\r\nni rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than=\r\n\n&gt;  Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is stil=\r\nl left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic =\r\nnotion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried =\r\ndeeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one o=\r\nvercomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s b=\r\nody-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a =\r\ngreat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, i=\r\nf one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the wo=\r\nrld, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the wor=\r\nld now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any su=\r\nch notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress a=\r\nnd yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened =\r\nKundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s we=\r\naknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spirit=\r\nual problems.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approa=\r\nch I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do =\r\nsadhana, overcome your\n&gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment over time.=\r\n Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for =\r\nlife/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachm=\r\nent. It is a negative attachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt; =\r\nwhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to re=\r\nsist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt; not=\r\n. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EV=\r\nEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When yo=\r\nu completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt; will automat=\r\nically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Th=\r\nough true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do =\r\nbusiness with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the p=\r\nlain and bare fact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please=\r\n give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and ple=\r\nase protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you =\r\nwant and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desir=\r\nes, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fasc=\r\nination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lor=\r\nd throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s =\r\nprasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with=\r\n fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notio=\r\nns experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking=\r\n of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as sa=\r\nid below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;=\r\nchipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, bu=\r\nt it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from Go=\r\nd&#39;s\n&gt;  protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like gra=\r\nve danger that one should run away from!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispass=\r\nion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken awa=\r\ny anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepare=\r\nd to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental condi=\r\ntioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundali=\r\nni rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadi=\r\ns will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting=\r\n True Self.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spi=\r\nrituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sa=\r\nstry \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SI=\r\nR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and sara=\r\nnagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove mos=\r\nt of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any p=\r\nersonal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner=\r\n planes who play havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the =\r\nprotection of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will de=\r\nfinitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that co=\r\nmpose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into =\r\nmore detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, =\r\nlust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens,=\r\n one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion =\r\nof a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journ=\r\ney. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it rea=\r\nlly does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things an=\r\nd entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are =\r\nuseless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own=\r\n ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and mis=\r\ns-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi\n becomes even more\n&gt;  vita=\r\nl. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kund=\r\nalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are be=\r\ncause of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile =\r\nand insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes=\r\n that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle infl=\r\nuences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; du=\r\ne to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc=\r\n. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they h=\r\nave chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and =\r\nvarious possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every optio=\r\nn. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have =\r\nthe right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so=\r\n, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n work.\n&gt;  Sometime=\r\ns it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the st=\r\narting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to=\r\n say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mam=\r\nAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 =\r\nPM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my =\r\nrecent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at pres=\r\nent, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she h=\r\nas had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has=\r\n involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is =\r\nnot of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms st=\r\narted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find an=\r\nything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that th=\r\nis is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe =\r\nthemselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini =\r\nawakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in main=\r\nstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by =\r\nwestern medicine, and as we have no treatments for\n deranged\n&gt;  kundalini, =\r\nwe struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. M=\r\ny experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not =\r\nbe forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the =\r\nsuffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her=\r\n, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution ther=\r\ne could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother=\r\n, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- an=\r\nd either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request tha=\r\nt the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom=\r\n we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be car=\r\neful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhap=\r\ns this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;=\r\nlet me be your instrument&quot; and leave the\n kundalini\n&gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s =\r\nwill.

Kundalini is only=\r\n one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini awakening may not even make y=\r\nou see or hear anything, it may make a person suddenly experience some othe=\r\nr nice things too. The mind is of a very subtle nature. The astral world is=\r\n a plethora of endless subtle entities of all kinds. If by some chance the =\r\nlink to this world opens up, willingly or unwillingly, it can cause quite a=\r\n bit of problems for both mature as well as immature people. In the sense, =\r\nthose who are not aware of these can get affected by them easily, even thos=\r\ne who do sadhana can also get affected by a plethora of false experiences a=\r\nnd misplaced priorities. As such\n a diagnosis like this\n simply cannot be d=\r\none over net, and rarely by people of this forum (unless I am grossly mista=\r\nken).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing a homa with the desire that someone gets cured maybe goo=\r\nd. However, it can also have unintended consequences. Some part of the pers=\r\non&#39;s karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You must have enuf spiritual=\r\n backup to know how to deal with it. It is never advisable to enter into th=\r\ne cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must also wear all necessary=\r\n protections.&nbsp; The first rule is curing such kind of psycho-spiritual =\r\nmaladies is to find out what causes the effect, and if the person is trying=\r\n to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how much of the effect will =\r\ncome to the person and how easily s/he can handle it. All this is complex a=\r\nnd not easy at all. It is like a specialization. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv520846925=\r\nMsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;yiv520846925Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\nize:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv520846925Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:r=\r\ngb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv520846925yui_3_=\r\n2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;,=\r\n times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv520846925yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv520846925yui_3_=\r\n2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv520846925yui_3_7_2_17_1362201335998_73&quot; style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttam=\r\nam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;Courier New&#39;, courier, monaco, monospace, sa=\r\nns-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, =\r\n&#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; \n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 2 Mar=\r\nch 2013 3:53 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv520846925&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv520846925ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;That was an interesting r=\r\nead. But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini p=\r\nsychosis?

They are usually unable to sleep, =\r\numable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try and help=\r\n with this with medication and lifestyle advice.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you. in =\r\nactual fact, that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However,&nbsp;the hold of t=\r\nhe I ness on everything is so tremendous that its difficult to let go enoug=\r\nh that you can allow this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors who see these &quot;=\r\npatients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because they are conditioned to think=\r\n in words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God completely any=\r\nway.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This,&nbsp;combined with the fact that for&nbsp;most people, =\r\nKundalini is not wanted because these people&nbsp;want the objects which Go=\r\nd can give, not God Herself, means that the scope for misunderstanding is t=\r\nremendous.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but most are unable to re=\r\nalise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely=\r\n to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived live=\r\ns of misery(when looked at by an external observer). However the internal j=\r\noy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely that some=\r\n great ones were completely unaware of their external problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.=\r\nI sometimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air b=\r\ny the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surre=\r\nnder is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the moth=\r\ner so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is =\r\nthat they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine M=\r\nother takes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energy may=\r\n&nbsp;result&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with th=\r\ne concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air element which is unstable =\r\nanyway can cause serious instability in these people.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Some&nbs=\r\np;of the&nbsp;people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel =\r\nthat they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and think t=\r\nhat the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the eye =\r\nof the general public.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In=\r\n general, for any doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims =\r\nmust precede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise need=\r\ns niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, s=\r\nleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, =\r\nall&nbsp;that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control =\r\nof Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body t=\r\no totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult =\r\nreal cases may be useful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homas to M=\r\nahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should=\r\n really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two years.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I=\r\nn pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Friday, =\r\nMarch 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao  wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Nama=\r\nste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiat=\r\nric problems may expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may =\r\nor may not be one.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conc=\r\neded though that Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis witho=\r\nut one having gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tunin=\r\ng of one&#39;s attitude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundalini may spontan=\r\neously rise in a layman with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may no=\r\nt experience it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalin=\r\ni rise is NOT an achievement. It is just A SMALL&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  STEP in overcomi=\r\nng one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated h=\r\nouse (this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) ma=\r\ny first construct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE=\r\n. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under=\r\n construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), =\r\nis it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is =\r\nsafer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards comp=\r\nlete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not my=\r\n word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it=\r\n and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Ku=\r\nndalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result=\r\n, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may =\r\nnot even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because o=\r\nf constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LA=\r\nTE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one may=\r\n pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick=\r\n man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for he=\r\nalth. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any kno=\r\nwledge or money. In another &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; case, one may deeply desire to act in=\r\n a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in =\r\na famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; experience. Basically, p=\r\neople keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; somethi=\r\nng they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, com=\r\ning back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience give=\r\nn by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having=\r\n it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire de=\r\nstined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if=\r\n one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I wen=\r\nt to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I wen=\r\nt to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill =\r\nit!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glu=\r\ned to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being resc=\r\nued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If =\r\nour ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorre=\r\nct and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete rea=\r\nlization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind compl=\r\nex, without being scared?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most u=\r\nndesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Kundalini=\r\n rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one=\r\n&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one=\r\n problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion tha=\r\nt lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment =\r\none. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another noti=\r\non in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a gre=\r\nat doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extre=\r\nme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who r=\r\nescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will r=\r\nescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply cli=\r\nngs to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs =\r\nof progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirab=\r\nle conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily a=\r\nnd cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nThe best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its=\r\n rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  weaknesses and improve your=\r\n detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not di=\r\nsgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other s=\r\nide of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; whether=\r\n your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 =\r\ninternal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not=\r\n. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EV=\r\nEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When yo=\r\nu completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will =\r\nautomatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrend=\r\ner is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god=\r\n. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fac=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you a=\r\nnd please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to yo=\r\nu and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is somet=\r\nhing you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agend=\r\nas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in o=\r\nne&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting any=\r\nthing Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) a=\r\ns Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of =\r\nLord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and=\r\n with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may =\r\nstill be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god do=\r\nes not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or e=\r\nndangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example abo=\r\nve, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditi=\r\noning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  protection! God&#39;s protectio=\r\nn may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away=\r\n from!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrende=\r\nr, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary an=\r\nd can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your be=\r\nst, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very =\r\nlight mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect on=\r\ne as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impuri=\r\nties in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and sto=\r\np Her from meeting True Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The =\r\nreal key is how light your conditioning is.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;-------=\r\n-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofoll=\r\now&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;__=\r\n______________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;YE=\r\nS&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakth=\r\ni and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and =\r\nremove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas with=\r\n out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entities to enter in to=\r\n the inner planes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are =\r\nunder the protection of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturbanc=\r\nes will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Co=\r\nnstant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the hum=\r\nan mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachme=\r\nnt, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed e=\r\ntc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to n=\r\now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more=\r\n intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A goo=\r\nd guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it=\r\n can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, s=\r\nome of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and =\r\ngiven half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They t=\r\nake hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes th=\r\ne same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi\n becomes even more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  vital. 4 -=\r\n While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini =\r\nShakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because =\r\nof this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and in=\r\nsufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that =\r\nthe aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences=\r\n and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to v=\r\narious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That=\r\n can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have ch=\r\nances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and variou=\r\ns possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Mor=\r\neover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the ri=\r\nght knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are =\r\noften doing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n work.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  Sometim=\r\nes it will have results, sometimes not.

I am doing a psychiatry job at present, a=\r\nnd have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had=\r\n a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has invol=\r\nved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of=\r\n Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started =\r\nand she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anything=\r\n physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is =\r\ndue to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themse=\r\nlves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awaken=\r\ning- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainstream=\r\n psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by wester=\r\nn medicine, and as we have no treatments for\n deranged&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  kundalini,=\r\n we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. =\r\nMy experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not=\r\n be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the=\r\n suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume he=\r\nr, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution the=\r\nre could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mothe=\r\nr, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- a=\r\nnd either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request th=\r\nat the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (who=\r\nm we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be ca=\r\nreful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perha=\r\nps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say =\r\n&quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the\n kundalini&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  rising bit t=\r\no God&#39;s will.
