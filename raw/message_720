The best thing is as you did, lit it back and continue\nw=\r\nith it. This is also a reason why I keep lots of camphor handy with\nme. Whe=\r\nn faced with such a scenario, I usually crush the camphor and\noffer it to t=\r\nhe embers, which then slowly ignites.\n\nAlso, when you want to prevent a fir=\r\ne from extinguishing, dont blow\ndirecly into the fire in the homa kundam. B=\r\nlow it on your hands and\ndirect it towards the agni in the kundam.\n\nHope th=\r\nis helps.\n\nRegards\n-Narayan-\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; =C2 \n&gt; Reading your =\r\nresponse another question came into my mind.

Doing it in the open i=\r\ns actually\nbetter than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain ca=\r\nn\ncause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it\nrains w=\r\nhile you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is\nextinguished by rain in=\r\n the middle of a homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bric=\r\nks and sand at the\nbottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)While p=\r\nerforming the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one\nrepeat the\n&gt; &gt; man=\r\ntras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; \n&gt; One can repeat mentally while list=\r\nening attentively (not casually).\nActually, even listening to mantras with =\r\nall the attention focused is\nas powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose pe=\r\nrson X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane\nmatter in the mind=\r\n. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus and\nthinking of the mantra=\r\n and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing\nfor person X and yet person =\r\nY may benefit from the mantra. The word\nmantra means &quot;one that protects the=\r\n mind&quot;. One can say a mantra or\nlisten to a mantra, to be protected. The ke=\r\ny is control over the mind\nand keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n However, there is a difference between meditation and homam. Mantra\nis sub=\r\nmitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitted in\nthe extern=\r\nal fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound\n(even if feeble) =\r\nis a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just\nlistening. Try to repe=\r\nat slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other\nconditi=\r\nons/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) has been\nperfor=\r\nmed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; \n&gt; One should follow th=\r\ne yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever\nrules one&#39;s guru sets, one =\r\nshould follow them strictly. At the\nminimum, one should eat only vegetarian=\r\n food on the day of homam and\ntake a bath before homam. Another rule I will=\r\n recommend is to avoid\neating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; By =\r\nthe way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for\nspiritual pro=\r\ngress, I am willing to take responsibility and allow them\nto do it. Such a =\r\nperson can think of me or my guru as guru and perform\nhomam. I am willing t=\r\no take on any karma incurred in the process until\nthe person crosses some m=\r\ninimum threshhold of purity through homam and\nother spiritual practices. Sa=\r\ncred thread or no sacred thread,\nmantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does n=\r\not matter after a while,\nwhen the person crosses a threshhold of purity. Th=\r\ne goal of upanayanam\nand other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this up and=\r\n make the person\ncross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as one desire=\r\ns no specific material benefits (and ready to\nreceive whatever god gives) a=\r\nnd does homam for spiritual progress, I\nam willing to help, even if it mean=\r\ns some suffering for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any =\r\nday would be fine?\n&gt; \n&gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi mo=\r\nrning. But any\nday is fine really.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Mentioning rain and roof=\r\ntop homam reminded me of my India trip.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I went to India in May 20=\r\n08, I and my guru Manish traveled\ntogether to several places (on a specific=\r\n project). We ended up doing\nhomam in the morning in several places (wherev=\r\ner we were). Before the\ntrip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me.=\r\n As monsoons come\nonly in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. =\r\nWe were in\nNew Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartme=\r\nnt\ncomplex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is\ngoi=\r\nng to rain heavily in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just\nsmiled.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we\noff=\r\nered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big\ndrops. Luckil=\r\ny, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close\nto us. Together, we=\r\n held it on top of the two small homa kundas,\nclosed our eyes and meditated=\r\n. We held the cloth cover on the homa\nkundas until fire in the two homa kun=\r\ndas went off and then packed\neverything and went down. We left for Kurukshe=\r\ntra later that day, but\nwe were told that a heavy rain continued for a few =\r\ndays in New Delhi.\nIn fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the=\r\n north, east\nand west of India. It rained in every place we went to, as we =\r\nfinished\nour task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,=\r\n\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spir=\r\nituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.c=\r\nom&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati H=\r\nomam daily, and have few\nquestions\n&gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam b=\r\ne performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) ?\nCan a homam\n&gt; &gt; kundam m=\r\nade by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used\ninstead of a\n&gt; &gt; copper=\r\n one?\n&gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one=\r\n\nrepeat the\n&gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors =\r\ndo Maha Ganapati Homam?
