Now, if possible, consider doing it every month or every week, perhaps on a smaller scale and for a smaller duration.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf one can take the mind off routine things and focus it (to the best of one&#39;s ability) on god on a regular basis, it will surely help one. If one can look at an idol or a person or fire or any object and that creates positive ambience in one&#39;s mind to focus on god, then that object can be beneficially used in spiritual sadhana. Irrespective of what works and what does not work, fire works always. If one looks at fire with respect and humility, sees it as auspicious and divine and tries to focus mind on god in its presence, fire tends to help.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNow I request people to consider one small thought.\n \nThere is a divine Will and divine rhythem spoken of as &quot;ritam&quot; in Veda. Agni symbolizes it. If we consider our entire life to be a big homam, this divine Will is the big fire that is burning and devouring everything. When we accept the divine Will and the experiences that it throws our way, without regret or disappointment or resistance, it is like materials burning in the fire nicely and with a nice fire.\n \nYou may have noticed in homam sometimes that an object that is not burning well will release a lot of smoke, while an object burning brightly will not release much smoke. If you put some ghee over an object nor burning well, it can catch fire and burn nicely.\n \nWhen we try to fight or resist the divine Will and the experiences that it throws our way, it is like materials not burning well and releasing a lot of smoke. Our regret, disappointment and resistance are like the smoke released in homam.\n \nWhen smoke starts to come from an object in an external homam, we put some ghee on that object and make it catch fire better and stop the smoke. Similarly, when smoke is coming in the internal homam of life also, use ghee (discrimination and intelligence) to increase the fire and reduce the smoke. In other words, when you see yourself resisting or fighting divine Will in any matter in life, use your intelligence to tell yourselves to surrender to divine Will and stop resisting.\n \nVisualize divine Will as a big fire and your activities and thoughts to be offerings in it. Monitor how well they are burning. Detect smoke (internal resentment or resistance) and reduce it whenever you detect it! One may be able to do external homam for limited time, but internal homam goes on forever. If one learns to burn objects well, without much smoke, in the internal homam, one progresses fast spiritually.\n \nExternal sadhana (homam) creates a conducive environment for a successful internal sadhana. But one has to *consciously* work on modifying one&#39;s attitude, in order to evolve spiritually.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Murali &lt;mkv1960@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste:\n&gt; \n&gt; With the good grace of the Lord, and your guidance, we were able to perform Lord Hanuman Homam today morning.

You can offer it when you offer naivedyam in the beginning (after invocation) or in the end (before uttarangam). Show naivedyam to fire and offer some in the fire.
