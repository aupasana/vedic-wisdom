When one performs a sadhana, it is on=\r\nly\n\nto achieve\n\n&gt; &gt; some goal whether that be spiritual or material objecti=\r\nve and the\n\nneed for\n\n&gt; &gt; sadhana is becuase the native feels that otherwis=\r\ne he/she may not be\n\nable\n\n&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 achive the goal easily. So essentia=\r\nlly the purpose of a\n\nsadhana is to remove\n\n&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards a=\r\nchieving the goal. Law of karma does not\n\nlet anyone\n\n&gt; &gt; of the hook thoug=\r\nh. The harships that you face while performing a\n\nsadhana might\n\n&gt; &gt; appear=\r\n like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially the Lord\n\nbringing necessary=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates the suffering in the sadhaka that\n\nl=\r\nets the\n\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhaka will eventually be=\r\n\n\nsuccessful but\n\n&gt; &gt; the effort required and the hardships that are yet to=\r\n be faced\n\ndepends on the\n\n&gt; &gt; karmic burden.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; If the karmic burde=\r\nn is less, suffering is less and success is\n\nobtained without\n\n&gt; &gt; much suf=\r\nfering (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very\n\nheavy, you\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n may suffer without seeing any success. Though you are now closer to\n\nyour =\r\ngoal\n\n&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not achieved, you do n=\r\not\n\nsee the\n\n&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the effort was a waste.\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brought to your way by her to=\r\n\n\npurge you\n\n&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what you want.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns is my belief, and this I use as a basis when performing a\n\nsadhana.

And if she does not know her bhakt,=\r\n how can she be the&lt;br&gt;\nshakti to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; rule over all?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tests which people refer to are usually the hardships t=\r\nhat one&lt;br&gt;\nhas to face&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; while undertaking a sadhana. When one=\r\n performs a sadhana, it is only&lt;br&gt;\nto achieve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; some goal whet=\r\nher that be spiritual or material objective and the&lt;br&gt;\nneed for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; sadhana is becuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 achive the goal easily. So essentially the pu=\r\nrpose of a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana is to remove&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards=\r\n achieving the goal. Law of karma does not&lt;br&gt;\nlet anyone&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of =\r\nthe hook though. The harships that you face while performing a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana =\r\nmight&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially th=\r\ne Lord&lt;br&gt;\nbringing necessary&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; hardships your way which create=\r\ns the suffering in the sadhaka that&lt;br&gt;\nlets the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed=\r\n some of the karma. The sadhaka will eventually be&lt;br&gt;\nsuccessful but&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; the effort required and the hardships that are yet to be faced&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\ndepends on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karmic burden.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If=\r\n the karmic burden is less, suffering is less and success is&lt;br&gt;\nobtained w=\r\nithout&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic bu=\r\nrden is very&lt;br&gt;\nheavy, you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any suc=\r\ncess. Though you are now closer to&lt;br&gt;\nyour goal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; after the su=\r\nffering, but since the goal is not achieved, you do not&lt;br&gt;\nsee the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; results of your effort and feel the effort was a waste.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brought to your way b=\r\ny her to&lt;br&gt;\npurge you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what you=\r\n want.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is my belief, and this I use as a b=\r\nasis when performing a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana. I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sure others may have=\r\n other views though.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bhu=\r\npendra.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: parijat_d parijat_d=\r\n@&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wed, September 29, 2010 4:20:17 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] A query&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i am parijat dutta from kolkata.there are some issues =\r\ngoing on i&lt;br&gt;\nneed to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; discuss..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsince i was 18-19,i became interested in tantras.and i worship ma&lt;br&gt;\nkali.=\r\nbt i feel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; i had and may be have to face several tests....like=\r\n initially...i&lt;br&gt;\nread books on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; tantra....wich promise highl=\r\ny materialistically beneficial&lt;br&gt;\nsadhanas..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and alarmingly =\r\ndifferent dieties for each purpose...i fell for&lt;br&gt;\nthat...an my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; devotion was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with time i realized all these have no value without a=\r\n gurus&lt;br&gt;\nguidance.....my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; astrologer told me....that time wi=\r\nll be arnd 29-30 of my age.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; then again...i was =\r\nagainst krishna worship.....cuzz i thot&lt;br&gt;\nfooshingly since he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; is only about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; again since...all the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nis the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; highest....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; un&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; also...=\r\nat that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since he talked&lt;br&gt;\nmostly of&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; devotion...n not of powers like siddhis....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; undes=\r\ntanding others thoughts n so on...as i have personally seen&lt;br&gt;\nsome tantri=\r\ncs&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; who have this power..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with tim=\r\ne again i learnt bhakti is the highest.......i asked once a&lt;br&gt;\nmaharaj who=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; presides over the ashram where my mother was initiated ...&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; which is more powerful ??
