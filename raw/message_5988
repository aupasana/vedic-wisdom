W=\r\nould not the message of love and peace spread and penetrate society at leas=\r\nt to a larger extent than today, where it seems to be almost non-existent? =\r\n OK, forget that argument, think about this, would not this saint-producing=\r\n factory have a line twenty miles long outside of aspirants and be all over=\r\n the news?  This is the Internet age, the age of information, a time where =\r\nmultiple 24/7 news channels thrive, where small news in a remote corner of =\r\nthe world shows up at your doorstep almost instantly.  So given that, would=\r\n not this incredible nirvana factory be the talk of the town?  Wouldn=E2=80=\r\n=99t all the spiritual junkies be flocking to it?  But the last time I tune=\r\nd into CNN, the news was still who just died, alas=E2=80=A6 I might have mi=\r\nssed the grand opening.  OK, forget that argument, think about this, the mo=\r\nnks and yogis of old retreated to the mountains and forests for decades to =\r\npractice meditation.  Were they mad, incompetent, or masochistic?  Were the=\r\ny just plain dumb and clueless to the fact that there was a quick fix avail=\r\nable?  Could it be that these potent, massive human beings just all kept mi=\r\nssing the short cut?  These fellows have practiced meditation for thousands=\r\n of years and all of them never discovered the short cut!  No, sorry my fri=\r\nend there is no short cut, but if you are still not convinced I will contin=\r\nue with some more reasons below. \n\nLet=E2=80=99s look at life.  Getting in =\r\nshape takes hard work, mastering an art can take a lifetime, learning a sci=\r\nence, skill or language can take years, but you figured that the greatest a=\r\nrt of all, the highest accomplishment possible to man, would be made possib=\r\nle via a 20 minute CD!!  Sorry, it will not be handed to you on a silver pl=\r\natter no matter what the salesman says.  And speaking of salesman, that is =\r\nprobably the best clue of all that something is amiss.  The one trait that =\r\nis common across all the definitions of enlightenment is compassion.  Does =\r\nit really make sense that a fully awakened enlightened person, who is suppo=\r\nsed to be completely free, full of joy, bliss and compassion, decides he wo=\r\nuld rather be a businessman and only help you if you pay him?  He decides t=\r\no rake in the cash to buy his third BMW since he is just not quite satisfie=\r\nd with having a Buddha Mind?  If the source feels more like a business than=\r\n a genuine place to help guide you, be warned - you are about to be conned.=\r\n  No, my friend, don=E2=80=99t waste your money, there are no short cuts an=\r\nd I will tell you something else, it is not ever possible to have one. \n\nEn=\r\nlightenment cannot be brought about through any act of will.  It comes on i=\r\nts own and goes on its own.  No formula can produce it, no method can creat=\r\ne it, and no path can take you to it.  Any effort on your part to bring abo=\r\nut enlightenment only strengthens the noose of desire and perpetuates self-=\r\ncentered activity, so no outside solution can possibly work for this condit=\r\nion. To illuminate this point the following traditional example is often us=\r\ned=E2=80=A6\n\nThink of your life as a movie.  Reality is what is happening o=\r\nn the screen, everything that takes place is in the movie; the Truth is the=\r\n screen itself.  It is forever hidden by the images moving on it.  It only =\r\nbecomes visible when the movie stops playing.  Any willful attempt to stop =\r\nthe movie just adds another theme, another story line and the show goes on.=\r\n  Any angle you undertake is another scene in your movie.  This movie has t=\r\no stop itself and when it does the Truth becomes visible.  All you can do i=\r\ns watch the movie.  As you watch and study the movie you start to see its m=\r\nonotony and meaninglessness.  You start to see the pettiness of being endle=\r\nssly drawn into your self-centered drama.  This is the beginning of the end=\r\n.  Keep watching carefully, meticulously, and diligently. This watching lea=\r\nds to the movie ending itself.  Then you may be blessed with the Truth.  So=\r\n next time someone comes up to you and tries to sell you magic beads of enl=\r\nightenment, politely show them the garbage can.\n\n\n\n"}}
