You are\nawar=\r\ne that Saturn is also called Mandi, or Mandachari.  In legends, it\nis known=\r\n as famous Siva Temple, which was built by Saturn, for atoning\nhis sin of B=\r\nrahamhatya by installing and adoring his Ishta Devata, Lord\nShiva.  Another=\r\n  legend, states that when Rakhsas  on the path of\ndestruction of Devatas, =\r\nthey  pleaded Sage Dadhichi for help. Sage\nDadhichi offered the Armours  cr=\r\neated from his body bones and gave to\nDevatas to fight Rakshsas. But, devat=\r\nas could not defeat the demons.\nThen sage Dadhichi adviced them to approach=\r\n great Saturn ,as he was the\nonly capable entity to use these armoury  and =\r\nkill the demons. When\napproached by devatas, Saturn expressed his inability=\r\n to go on war, as\nhe was performing Yajna for his ishta devata, lord Shiva,=\r\n for atoning\nthe sin of brahamhatya. However, after forceful pleadings by t=\r\nhe all\ndevatas, Saturn consented to use the shastras of the bones of sage\nD=\r\nadhichi and fight demons, thus leaving his Yajna incomplete, and\ndestroyed =\r\nthe demons. The place where Saturn destroyed the demons is\nknown after the =\r\nname of Saturn, Mandapalli.\n\nAfter the victory Saturn built a great temple =\r\nfor his ishta devata Lord\nShiva by installing a black Shivling,then the tem=\r\nple of Parvatiji was\nalso installed, followed by temple of Narayana and Nag=\r\neshwaray. All in\nthe same premises.\n\nIn this temple. the pujaris priests pe=\r\nrform pooja for removing the\nsevere effects and Graha dosham of all the pla=\r\nnets, and the mantras are\nalso addressedd to Saturn ; to help the devotee t=\r\no free them from all\nobstacles and bad times they are undergoing, due to af=\r\nfects of kroor\ngrahas. This pooja takes about 45 minutes. The pooja can als=\r\no be\nspecific for mahamritunjaya , if one needs that way. After this,\nginge=\r\nlli oil is offered on the Shivlinga through a long funnel,and\nobeseience is=\r\n also paid to the other deities. After performing the\nabhishekam ,the prasa=\r\nd given to the devotee is Kumkum, called Sri\nkumavari Kumkum.\n\nI was underg=\r\noing very severe period in my life from 2004 onwards, and\nIhad done all the=\r\n upayas, whatever I could do to the best of my\nknowledge,but of no avail.  =\r\nEven I had stopped my astrology work. Then\nin 2007, I happened to  read abo=\r\nut this temple on the internet ; and I\nsimply proceeded to Rajamundry and v=\r\nisited the temple. After my return,\nI had lot of feel good factor, and slow=\r\nly within 3 months my peace of\nmind started returning, health improved, ast=\r\nrology centre started\nre-working with more vigour and inner energy. As a to=\r\nken of my gratitude\nI again visited this ancient temple in November,2009, a=\r\nnd now I feel\ngreatly energised and more at peace and and satisfied. Visit =\r\nand pooja\nat this ancient temple has been really a great experience for me,=\r\n after\nvisiting almost all the known temples and historical and popular\nrel=\r\nigious places  in the country during past 20 years.\n\nThe priests there are =\r\nnot at all greeedy or fleece anyone. The pooja\nsamagri costs Rs.40-50; and =\r\nyou can offer  any amount in dakshina to the\npriests who performs special p=\r\nooja , say anything  between Rs.151 or\nmore, as per your wishes ! Offering =\r\nto all deities are normally done in\ncash to help the upkeep of the temple, =\r\nand pujaris in 4 temples do not\nlook askance at the devotees for money.  Gr=\r\neat soothing spiritual\nexpereince indeed, as it is in a small village,with =\r\nno hustle and bustle\nand hardly 2-3 devotees come to the temple , except on=\r\n the Triyodasis(\nwhich fall on Saturdays ) , 3 or 4 times in a year.\nWith m=\r\ny best wishes to all members and especially to those for whom\nnothing appea=\r\nrs to be working right ! It is just the question of faith\nin His powers.\n\nR=\r\naj Bhardwaj, Sh Aditya Jyotish Kendra, Dera-Bassi, (Near\nChandigarh),Panjab=\r\n\n\nExpert at :- www.liveperson.com/indoastro-raj/\n&lt;http://www.liveperson.com=\r\n/indoastro-raj/&gt;\n\n\n\n\r\n--7-9110393644-1442220737=:6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Dear Members,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Mandeswara (Saniswaraya) Templ=\r\ne is an ancient manument in VillageMandapalli in East Godavari Distt of And=\r\nhra Pradesh.It is about 35 Kms from Rajamundry on the Vijayawada-Vishakhapa=\r\nttnam route.
