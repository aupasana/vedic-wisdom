Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just lik=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vege=\r\ntables as well. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Cooking is a later addition to human society. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and loo=\r\nk at REAL \n&gt; &gt; research in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed sci=\r\nentific papers in \n&gt; &gt; clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 =\r\njune/july, you would find \n&gt; &gt; ample evidence that humans as a speicies, fo=\r\nr many milleniums have relied on an \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; omnivorous diet:-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a) =\r\nHuman ancestral diets changed substantially approximately four to five \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n million years ago with major climatic changes creating open grassland \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n environments. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced b=\r\ny a smaller, simpler \n&gt; &gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82  requiring=C3=82 foo=\r\nds based around meat protein and fat. \n&gt; &gt;For \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; example since the ti=\r\nme of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; years =\r\nago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for \n&gt; &gt; lon=\r\ng-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a \n&gt; &gt; cor=\r\nresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;a \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman =\r\nterms, our brain \n&gt; &gt; would not have reached the size and mass as it is tod=\r\nay, had it not been for \n&gt; &gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; c) The gut morphology of the human body as it stand todays=\r\n is ideally \n&gt; &gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores.=\r\n That is because \n&gt; &gt; humans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a we=\r\nll developed caecum and \n&gt; &gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult f=\r\nor the body to absorve plant \n&gt; &gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is wh=\r\ny, a=C3=82 major part of the leafy \n&gt; &gt;vegetable \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; based diet eventu=\r\nally ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach \n&gt; &gt;lining \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82  the kind of strong acids which is present=\r\n in a \n&gt; &gt;typical \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set =\r\nby Nature through=C3=82  the natural \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; process of evolution is suppo=\r\nsed to be omnivorous. It may further interest you \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; to know that the =\r\nteeth structure of humans is actually identical to, guess \n&gt; &gt;what, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved=\r\n and mistaken ideas that=C3=82 research into \n&gt; &gt; clinical nutrition very c=\r\nlearly indicates that absorption ability of the human \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; body for=C3=\r\n=82 w.r.t different foods=C3=82 is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;fish, \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is =\r\nconsidered negative \n&gt; &gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste =\r\nmore calories in absorving it \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; than the amount it gains from them. =\r\nBut fish is the easiet to digest.
