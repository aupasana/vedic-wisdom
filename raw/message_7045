BTW, \nVimalananda even goes to extent of mention=\r\ning a Nath may takes thousands of \nyears of sadhana to pulled into a Muni a=\r\nnd similarly a Muni may take &quot;billions&quot; \nof years of sadhana to become a Ri=\r\nshi, IF, a higher being decides to pull them \nforward. Else they can keep s=\r\ntaying in their ever &#39;orbits&#39; around the center, \nvery close, yet not mergi=\r\nng. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt; \nNow, Ramakrishna himself said that Vivekananda and six ot=\r\nher sishyas were \n&quot;Ishwara Koti&quot; or &quot;Nitya Siddhas&quot;. Can you tell me where =\r\nthis falls on \nVimalananda&#39;s scale? What do you think &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (nith=\r\nya=3Deternal) means? \nIs it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greater or in betw=\r\neen? If six disciples were \n&quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; a=\r\ns you say, can he be a \n&quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than them?&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n\n=C2=A0 \nSimple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi who =\r\ncame down. An \namsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of the=\r\n Rishi&#39;s \nconsciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and once the =\r\npurpose is \nserved, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddha=\r\ns. Therefore, \nvery technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi,=\r\n a projection of a \nRishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Siddhas=\r\n, Naths, Munis etc are \nprojection Rishis one way or the other. Each is kep=\r\nt is ingorance of their real \nbeing (Rishi) such that the play can go on (n=\r\not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). \nThey are Nitya-siddha because even if t=\r\nhey take birth over and over, being parts \nof extremely higher beings, thes=\r\ne emanations/projections/amsas will surely \neventually go back to the sourc=\r\ne when the work is done. \n\n=C2=A0 \nHowever, in their forms as specific indi=\r\nviduals like Vivekananda, whether these \namsa attain the specific stages wh=\r\nich makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will \ndetermine if they are to be called=\r\n so. They may not need to do so since they are \nhere for a purpose. But, th=\r\ne only way a person can be called a siddha in true \nsense is when he, as Vi=\r\nmalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific \nshaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and=\r\n moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it, \ndeeper and deeper=\r\n.=C2=A0 \n\n=C2=A0 \nThere is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a c=\r\nertain sadhaka (his \ndisciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to stay=\r\n in the Swargadwara \nsmashana and later someone build a small ashram for hi=\r\nm. Totapuri&#39;s ashram still \nexists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri =\r\nalso mentions a similar ideas of \nwhat is a siddha and higher. And how only=\r\n a Siddha and none less is a true \nVigyani. He further mentions that Swami =\r\nVivekananda did not (need) to go to the \nstage of a Siddha. His work was sp=\r\necific, he did the work and went off. He did \nnot need to and therefore did=\r\n not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. \n\n=C2=A0 \nAdded to this th=\r\ne fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the \ndisciples of Ramak=\r\nrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual \nbeing, and high=\r\ner than them. Here too I see no confusion. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;It is not necessary =\r\nthat there is a clear order of greatness. Infinity is \nneither greater than=\r\n nor less than nor equal to infinity.&gt;. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThis is what I call appro=\r\nximation. For an ordinary man, all saints maybe equally \nelevated. For Yogi=\r\ns, there maybe subtle differences and depths. The truth lies \nin the nuance=\r\ns. Anyway, Vivekananda&#39;s own words are more reliable for me than \nyours on =\r\nthis matter. And my previous explanation actually clarifies this \nstatement=\r\n of Sri Ramakrishna that Vivekananda was the &quot;ancient Rishis Nara&quot; who \ncam=\r\ne down for the good of mankind. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;Wise men tread cautiously and d=\r\no not rush to judgment on others.&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nI am merely quoting and puttin=\r\ng together the analysis, statements of spiritually \ngreat people. It is not=\r\n as complex as you think! Saying that A is fatter than B, \nbased one statem=\r\nents and quotes from people who maybe in the know of things, is \nhardly a j=\r\nudgement.

So you concluded Vivekananda is 2 and Vimalananda i=\r\ns \n2pwr16. \n\n=C2=A0 \nNow, Ramakrishna himself said that Vivekananda and six=\r\n other sishyas were \n&quot;Ishwara Koti&quot; or &quot;Nitya Siddhas&quot;. Can you tell me whe=\r\nre this falls on \nVimalananda&#39;s scale? What do you think &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (n=\r\nithya=3Deternal) means? \nIs it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greater or in b=\r\netween? If six disciples were \n&quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater=\r\n&quot; as you say, can he be a \n&quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than the=\r\nm? \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Vivekananda says Ramakrishna a gre=\r\nater spiritual man.

I on \nthe other hand would rather rely on the clear words of V=\r\nivekananda and \nAbhedananda on this matter rather than speculation.

The \ngoal of existence and sa=\r\ndhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither \nspecifically sought n=\r\nor specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature \ngives one some sid=\r\ndhi(s), one should accept them with neither excitement nor \ndisappointment.=\r\n But one should NOT run after them, for they are neither \nnecessary nor suf=\r\nficient for self-realization and liberation. \n\n=C2=A0 \nVivekananda used the=\r\n same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give his \nsiddhis to Vivekana=\r\nnda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize \ngod. Ramakris=\r\nhna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, \nwhen R=\r\namakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda&#39;s two \nact=\r\nions demonstrate Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nLet us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one&#39;s s=\r\npiritual \nsadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb t=\r\nhe hill from \ndifferent sides and using different paths. There may be trees=\r\n with nice fruits \non the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special ab=\r\nilities. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIf one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and co=\r\nllecting fruits, one&#39;s \njourney gets delayed and one may not reach the top.=\r\n That is why Vasishtha says a \nseeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nBut if some fruits fall in one&#39;s lap by themselves, one can keep =\r\nthem. \nSimilarly, siddhis that come to one by themselves can be accepted by=\r\n a seeker of \nSelf. \n\n=C2=A0 \nNow an important distinction: \n=C2=A0 \nThere =\r\nare some trees that are found at lower altitudes also, but some really \nspe=\r\ncial trees are found at very high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, =\r\nit \nshows that one has climbed great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do no=\r\nt mean \nmuch, but some siddhis are very special and only really elevated sa=\r\ndhakas can \nobtain them (whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhaka=\r\ns demonstrates \nsuch a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. Howev=\r\ner, the key is that \none who climbed the same or more distance may not have=\r\n that or any other fruit. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nUnlike in the=\r\n example of climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual \nprogre=\r\nss in real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure =\r\n\nhow much progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally a=\r\nnd \nwhat exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind. We may try to judge it from externa=\r\nl factors \nsuch as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nHere, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one&#39;s s=\r\niddhis to judge \nhow high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person who r=\r\neached the absolute \ntop may not have any fruits, while one person who stil=\r\nl has ways to climb may \nhave gotten some really nice fruit. Using externas=\r\nlly demonstrable siddhis that \nare neither necessary nor sufficient for Sel=\r\nf-realization as a measure of one&#39;s \nprogress is unsound. \n\n=C2=A0 \nGiven t=\r\nhat spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and compare \npeople=\r\n then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarvaantaryaami - a \nperfec=\r\nted being who has access to each being&#39;s internal state - can do that. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nRajarshi, you are assuming that Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on \nVimalananda&#39;s scale. You are concluding =\r\nthat Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; \nAbhedananda, Vivekananda etc are lower =\r\nthan that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and \nhence Vimalananda is superior to Ab=\r\nhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIs Paramahamsa Nithyana=\r\nnda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa \nbecause he is kno=\r\nwn so? See, how people are famously known may or may not \nreflect their spi=\r\nritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you \ncannot see it. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nWe do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not =\r\nbe just a \nparamahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, but be a siddha or a natha o=\r\nr even a rishi. \nHe may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some=\r\n religious experts of \nthat time declared based on various signs. If Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu \nhimself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can defi=\r\nnitely be rishis or naths in \nVimalananda&#39;s scale. If your argument is that=\r\n they cannot be because they did \nnot demonstrate siddhis compatible with t=\r\nhat status, that is a non-point as I \nexplained above. The disagreement bet=\r\nween then boils down a difference in the \nrelevance and importance of exter=\r\nnally demonstrated siddhis. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nWhy this is r=\r\nelevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to \nhave mis=\r\nconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing \nmira=\r\ncles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. \n\n=C2=A0 \nVasishtha is =\r\nnot only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught \nLord R=\r\nama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will \n=\r\nbalance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis =\r\nare \nneither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don&#39;t be distra=\r\ncted by \nthem or be infatuated with them. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThe goal of sadhana is =\r\nthat your notions of &quot;this is I and these are mine&quot; get \nsubtler and subtle=\r\nr and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and \nweaker. Other=\r\ns may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you \nknow your=\r\n progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no \nre=\r\nlevance or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your \nsad=\r\nhana. \n\n=C2=A0 \nBest regards, \nNarasimha \n---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------- \n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, \n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana: \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitt=\r\ner ID: @homam108 \n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------- \n=C2=A0 \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a long friendly ;-)=\r\n exchange between Rajarshi and me on Friday \n&gt; (July 29) on twitter on meas=\r\nuring spiritual caliber.

He \n&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and said=\r\n their spiritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was =\r\n2 power 16. He also talked about \n&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber ment=\r\nioned by V. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of musings on that. \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------- \n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here a=\r\nre a few comments on your statements a couple of days \n&gt; back on Twitter co=\r\nmparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, =\r\nrose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n&gt; which is a better flower. T=\r\nhey have different properties like color, \n&gt; size, shape, number of petals,=\r\n type/intensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; values depend on the purpose and =\r\nthey cannot be quantified universally. \n&gt; How can any sane person then say =\r\nthat spiritual caliber of different \n&gt; people can be compared and quanitifi=\r\ned? The field of duality has \n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of =\r\na yogi has infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual cal=\r\niber of a person as one \n&gt; number and compare them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even a=\r\nttempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha =\r\n&lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for=\r\n deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; where Vishnu is supr=\r\neme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some c=\r\nonsider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None =\r\nof them is absolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; and for specific purposes,=\r\n i.e. from a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; people who take them as abs=\r\nolute and argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so =\r\nand so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; know that none of the hierarch=\r\nies is absolute. \n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare =\r\nthe wisdom of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of=\r\n Ramakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion o=\r\nf Shirdi Sai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri M=\r\nahashaya, \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of E=\r\nknath \n&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, =\r\netc, \n&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific =\r\n\n&gt; limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n=\r\n&gt; another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n=\r\n&gt; on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n&gt; =\r\nYou should just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n&gt; o=\r\nf them that you like the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from=\r\n specific perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, his words should make one reali=\r\nze that there is always \n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resultin=\r\ng mastery over the field \n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One sh=\r\nould never rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gos=\r\npel and starting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially maki=\r\nng statements like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put to=\r\ngtr&quot; and thinking \n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda i=\r\ns assumed to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Even if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume =\r\n\n&gt; that you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramak=\r\nrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per =\r\nVimalananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or =\r\nmay be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; th=\r\ne details we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; statu=\r\nre based on his own classification? \n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal t=\r\no each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You=\r\n probably made this statement based on \n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimala=\r\nnanda. For the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he wa=\r\ns a real person or an imagined \n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and ver=\r\ny wisely!) left the latter \n&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book=\r\n! \n&gt; \n&gt; If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a =\r\n\n&gt; simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \n&gt; =\r\none&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; t=\r\nold Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \n&gt; =\r\nback, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \n&gt; on=\r\ne more birth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; th=\r\ne other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \n&gt; w=\r\naiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; A=\r\nbhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda! \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that =\r\nthis is just one definition. One can have many \n&gt; definitions. The key is n=\r\not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is w=\r\neightier than Y and so what he said must \n&gt; be more correct&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; People =\r\nwith lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \n&gt; to be =\r\nabsolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \n&gt; are doi=\r\nng the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t=\r\n fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n&gt; absolute. Writte=\r\nn words are always relative and never absolute. \n&gt; Discriminate relative kn=\r\nowledge using intellect at first and hopefully \n&gt; using experencial realiza=\r\ntion later on. \n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;ma=\r\nturity&quot;, we should \n&gt; not commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental =\r\ncomments of greats \n&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lo=\r\nt more than us. \n&gt; ------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, \n&gt; N=\r\narasimha \n\r\n--0-1045928482-1312359744=:68512\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Hopefully, this will be my last mail on this topic, since I see that I a=\r\nm merely reiterating myself.

The externa=\r\nl is connected to the internal. Some siddhis are not possible unless one at=\r\ntains a very rarified level of realization. And they manifest externally. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;Just in case someone=\r\n got the impression that I do not admire Swami Vivekananda or his brother d=\r\nisciples, it is totally wrong.

Can you tell me wh=\r\nere this falls on Vimalananda&#39;s scale? What do you think &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (n=\r\nithya=3Deternal) means? Is it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greater or in be=\r\ntween? If six disciples were &quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; =\r\nas you say, can he be a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than them?&=\r\ngt;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=\r\n=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 siz=\r\ne=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;Simple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a R=\r\nishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient par=\r\nt of the Rishi&#39;s consciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and on=\r\nce the purpose is served, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-=\r\nSiddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a R=\r\nishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Sid=\r\ndhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis one way or the other. Each is =\r\nkept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) such that the play can go on =\r\n(not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). They are Nitya-siddha because even if =\r\nthey take birth over and over, being parts of extremely higher beings, thes=\r\ne emanations/projections/amsas will surely eventually go back to the source=\r\n when the work is done. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#0000=\r\n00 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT col=\r\nor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;However, in their forms as specific in=\r\ndividuals like Vivekananda, whether these amsa attain the specific stages w=\r\nhich makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will determine if they are to be called=\r\n so. They may not need to do so since they are here for a purpose. But, the=\r\n only way a person can be called a siddha in true sense is when he, as Vima=\r\nlananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific shaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and mo=\r\nves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it, deeper and deeper.&nb=\r\nsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DV=\r\nerdana&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D=\r\n2 face=3DVerdana&gt;There is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a ce=\r\nrtain sadhaka (his disciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to stay i=\r\nn the Swargadwara smashana and later someone build a small ashram for him. =\r\nTotapuri&#39;s ashram still exists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri also=\r\n mentions a similar ideas of what is a siddha and higher. And how only a Si=\r\nddha and none less is a true Vigyani. He further mentions that Swami Viveka=\r\nnanda did not (need) to go to the stage of a Siddha. His work was specific,=\r\n he did the work and went off. He did not need to and therefore did not bec=\r\nome a Siddha.
