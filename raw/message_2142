I donot know whether i have the eligibility to b=\r\necome your Shishya also.  Still, i respect you as my Guruji and i am blesse=\r\nd to have found you. I should thank my friend, utpal for this.. \n\nI need yo=\r\nur help. Professionally i work for private company in accounts and administ=\r\nration department since past 20 years. Besides my profession, i am script w=\r\nriter also.. To earn more money, to lead good standard of life and to pay b=\r\nack my home loans, i have started writing script for Television serial as a=\r\n part time job. I am doing this script writing work since past 4-5 years. C=\r\nonsidering my creative talents and good language control (not praising myse=\r\nlf)I am getting good assignments of writing TV serials.\n\nAll daily soap tel=\r\nevision serials are glorifying more negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.. enemi=\r\nties.. Sometimes i am feeling guilty of writing scenes which shows  Conflic=\r\nts between SAAS and BAHU, Conflicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts betwe=\r\nen BROTHER and BROTHER. I am compelled to write harsh dialogues which hurts=\r\n me sometimes.. \n\nThe formula on which TV serials are now based follow this=\r\n: &quot;More conflicts means more drama and more drama means more TRP(Television=\r\n rating points)and More TRP means more benefits, more money and popularity =\r\nto the serial&quot;.\n\nGuruji, I feel that i am doing wrong by writing serials.. =\r\nI am passing wrong messages to the society.. i feel guilty about it. I am n=\r\not in a position to leave this as it gives me more money besides it also gi=\r\nves me good standard of life and good recognition also.. If i would leave t=\r\nhis someone else would do it.. What should i do? I am really confused. If i=\r\n will leave writing this, i will find more difficult to survive in this wor=\r\nld with home loan and two small school going children..I need your help\n\nI =\r\nwas fortunate to discuss this with utpal. He guided me to write this mail t=\r\no you.. to seek your guidance..\n\nWaiting anxiously your reply.\n\nRespectful =\r\nregards,\n\nRajesh\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
