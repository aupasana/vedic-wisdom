Any diety =\r\nis approachable through Bhakthi yoga.\n\nWhy not propotiate Sukra and Rahu di=\r\nrectly?\nWhile it is a good idea to pray to Sukra and Rahu directly, we shou=\r\nld also keep in mind there are different ways of looking at things. If a ba=\r\nd person is teasing you and bullying you, will you simply pray to him and a=\r\nsk him not to trouble you? How will you please him? The bad persons seeks p=\r\nleasure by troubling you and nothing else will please him. Say there is a p=\r\nowerfull yet good person in the same village who can be pleased in other wa=\r\nys (like singing, painting, sweets etc.). Won&#39;t we consider approaching the=\r\n powerful person, please him/her and then seek a favor from him to control =\r\nthe bad person who is troubling us?\n\nPraying to different deities to get ov=\r\ner worldly pains is similar to that situations. The deities are powerful an=\r\nd can control the extent of ill powers planets can inflict upon us.\n\nIf we =\r\nlook at it objectively, all the Gods are one and the same. However, dependi=\r\nng on our level of spiritual progress and karma, we seek different forms of=\r\n the God.\n\nFor Rahu afflictions one can seek Narasimha, Chandi, Kali, Veera=\r\nbhadra etc. For Venus, we can look at Lakshmi, Siva (Venus is an ordent Siv=\r\na devotee).\n\nI would have choosen Veera Bhadra/Kala Bhairava but Durga is a=\r\nlso a good choice.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Krishnan Iyer &lt;kris_iyr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; it is a strange question. why not=\r\n propotiate shukra and rahu directly instead of Durga?\n&gt; and how do you pla=\r\nn to propiatiate Durga? One should just find one ishta devata and stick wit=\r\nh it with out any material desires. material fulfillment is only a side eff=\r\nect of a sadhana. i advise all to just propitiate ganapthi. he is a very po=\r\nwerful deity who, sadly people think is a plaything. what people do not rea=\r\nlize is that ganesha is actually parvati herself. he was created from the d=\r\nirt of her own body and infused with her own prana.  this is an obvious sec=\r\nret which no one realizes and i recently saw some pictures of ganesha as sp=\r\niderman in one of the puja pandals of mumbai. Kalau chandi vinayakau - is m=\r\nemtioned in tantras which means in kaliyuga chandi and vinayaka show the wa=\r\ny. \n&gt; . prayimg to him alone is sufficient for sarva graha yaksha bhoota kr=\r\noora matubhayam hana kooshmanda bhairava kshetrapala dakinyurangamana vetal=\r\nadi (for all planetary effects and evil spirits). he is the most approachab=\r\nle god. durga is actually a bit advanced and cannot be approached with bhak=\r\nti alone without proper knowledge of prayogas.\n&gt; \n&gt; br\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
