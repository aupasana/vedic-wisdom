It&#39;s about the elephant that=\r\n&#39;s always been in the living\nroom, he wants to come and play again. Looking=\r\n for presention\nopportunities I found you, I intend that we become good fri=\r\nends. Just a\nbrief background, I studied health and law until I figured the=\r\nm out, the\ntruth is always the shortest distance between here and there. Bu=\r\nt the\nsmoke and mirrors surrounding the truth is very complicated to tangle=\r\n\nreason. I put together a four part presentation of how our country is\nbein=\r\ng destroyed and what needs to be done, it&#39;s on youtube under &#39;The\nWolves ar=\r\ne in the Chicken Coop&#39;. I presented it to Alex Jones to see if\nhe would key=\r\n his viewers to it, as he had publicly said he would do if\nhe saw a good id=\r\nea and it would mean hundreds of thousands of hits. If\nhe had I could have =\r\nmade it work, but he would not even discuss it.\n         Without help I fou=\r\nnd that even though I was getting the highest\nstar rating, less then twenty=\r\n present were even looking at part two. So\nI realized it&#39;s hard to get peop=\r\nle out of their cubicle bubble, until\ntheir bubble bursts which is too late=\r\n. I was wrestling with how to give\nthe wake up call that people could consi=\r\nder in the comfort of their\ncubicle. Going through the three DVD set of &#39;Wh=\r\nat The Bleep&#39; and arguing\nwith David Icke in my mind, while reading his &#39;In=\r\nfinite Love is the Only\nTruth&#39; book. He nailed so many things, but his idea=\r\n that the matrix was\nprojected by somebody somewhere else to keep us in an =\r\nillusion was the\nexteriorization that cleared my path.\n         I saw the p=\r\naradigm shift, all the answers were before me. I\nformed The Experiment in i=\r\nts entirety. I spent April 12-17, designing\nthe overview and presentation o=\r\nf &#39;The Experiment to Maximize the\nObserver&#39;s Effect&#39; by presenting it, whic=\r\nh is seven pages titled &#39;You&#39;re\nThe One&#39;, to about five hundred great scien=\r\ntific minds at Stuart\nHameroff&#39;s &#39;Toward a Science of Consciousness&#39;. Spons=\r\nored by the\nUniversity of Arizona in Tuscon. I&#39;m proud and dismayed at the =\r\ndead\nsilence that left most with mouths gaping. About a half dozen of them\n=\r\nvoiced appreciation and encouragement, not one negative comment but most\nav=\r\noided any. Nobody&#39;s dening the elephant is in the living room, but\nnobody w=\r\nill talk about him. If you could comment I&#39;d really appreciate\nit.\n        =\r\n I am proud to be the One with the opportunity to present the\nnext step in =\r\nscience, which is The Experiment. This is an experiment to\nfind why observa=\r\ntion changes results by maximizing the effect. It is the\ndemanded and natur=\r\nal next step of Quantum physics, based on specific\nprinciples and scientifi=\r\nc experimentation.\n          The first innovation is to add the observer to=\r\n The Experiment.\nBecause we have never dealt with this before we refuse to =\r\ncome to terms\nwith this mandatory addition. We first &#39;tried&#39; to eliminate a=\r\nnd when we\nfound that impossible, to stay separate we &#39;try&#39; to minimize ins=\r\ntead of\nmaximizing our effect. Now that we know we can not be separate, thi=\r\ns is\nthe step we must take but have not until now.\n          The second is =\r\nif consciousness changes results, do results\nchange according to belief as =\r\nthey certainly did in the double slot\ndilemma that finalized the mess we ar=\r\ne in, which herein we are finally\ndealing with. Everywhere there are indica=\r\ntors of this, in fact there are\nno answers outside of this perspective, so =\r\nwhy not?\n          The third is the possibility that Quantum physics is how=\r\n all\nphysics actually works and only needs actualizing to be effective, if\n=\r\nbelief is the focus of consciousness and the creator of all things. As\nall =\r\npreliminary investigations demonstrate this is true, The Experiment\nwill be=\r\n proved correct and will cause a paradigm shift in the\nperspective of the o=\r\nbserver(mass-consciousness).\n          This change of perspective comes fro=\r\nm the observer considering\nlife through the inter-connected big three Quant=\r\num laws. We are all the\nsame One, there is no thing outside of us, and we a=\r\nre all and infinite\npossibilities. Which is the interiorization of the exte=\r\nrior view. This\neffort is the natural genesis of science, the intentions ar=\r\ne clear, what\nthis is going to find is we are all responsible for the belie=\r\nfs that\ncreate reality.\n         The following is the academic overview, th=\r\ne quotation portion\nwithin is offered to The People with slight modificatio=\r\nns. If One of The\nPeople wants to know after reading the quotation portion,=\r\n they are\noffered &#39;You&#39;re The One&#39; to have and read at their leisure. They =\r\nare now\nOne of the first hundred monkeys, as all that is needed is wanting =\r\nto\nknow.\n\n\n\nOverview and Presentation of The Experiment\n\n\nQuestion: As cons=\r\nciousness changes results, can results change to\nanything wanted if we have=\r\n a consensus by the observer? If every One is\nchoosing what we all want, wi=\r\nll it manifest? This question is based on\nthe Quantum fact, we now know we =\r\nare all the same One outside the field.\nTherefore we must all want exactly =\r\nthe same things at our core.\n\nAssumption: To work the observer must realize=\r\n infinite possibilities,\nmeaning anything is possible with belief. Anything=\r\n less is belief in\nfinite possibilities and its creation. You must realize =\r\nthere is no\nthing outside of you to believe in infinite possibilities, and =\r\nto\naccomplish that you must realize you are the One. Idolatry is the\nlimita=\r\ntion in our perspective and everyone is involved, this realized\nthe observe=\r\nr takes the power back making the infinite the only\npossibility. &#39;You&#39;re Th=\r\ne One&#39; does exactly that, gives the Quantum\nperspective.\n       Deities are=\r\n anyone believed to be superior and anywhere you place\nyour power believing=\r\n it is then outside of you. Examples: alcohol,\npharmaceutical drugs, govern=\r\nment, science..... Consciousness did not\ncome from nothing, but it is where=\r\n no thing is, also. Desire for the\n&#39;Big Bang&#39; to occur had to exist, and is=\r\n an act of consciousness.\nTherefore everything thereafter is within the One=\r\n consciousness. Thereby\nis the reason for Time, Space, Energy, Mass, and Gr=\r\navity. Consciousness\nis creating all things, therefore its reflection is al=\r\nl that can be\nfound within them. You can not find what to believe in creati=\r\non, when\nbelief is the creator. You can find what your believing, but a cha=\r\nnge of\nbelief is a change of creation.\n       As you are consciousness your=\r\n reflections are for fun not to find\nyourself in, nor limit yourself to. I =\r\nknow it&#39;s hard to let go of all\nthe mental gymnastics, we&#39;ve devoted so muc=\r\nh time &#39;trying&#39; to find who\nwe are in our smallest reflection. Then we make=\r\n it smaller and harder to\nfind, making it even less likely, and start again=\r\n. But when people\nrealize what we all want is possible, they get excited an=\r\nd want to help.\n       When realization that the limits being used are by c=\r\nhoice, people\nlet go and begin to have inspiration unfold before them. Insp=\r\niration and\nlimitation are flip sides of every idea we have, looked at as w=\r\nhat we\nwant or doubt we can. We find out everything by realizing, we do not=\r\n\nhave to look anywhere else to find anything. That we look elsewhere to\nfin=\r\nd ourselves, is the reason for not know.\n\nIntention: Add unconditional love=\r\n and what we want to scientific\nexperimentation.\n\n\n\n       This is going to=\r\n geometrically explode exponentially.\n\nPresentation: The interface between =\r\nscience and The People is\ndisgusting, academic science people think they kn=\r\now to much, and\nCitizens don&#39;t think they can know any of it. Just like spi=\r\nrituality and\nscience, who both think they don&#39;t or even can&#39;t know it all.=\r\n They must\nbe combined. So it is presented by asking for The Peoples help.\n=\r\n       &quot;Did you know science has now found things that have turned\neverythi=\r\nng upside down? They now have to deal with consciousness and\ndon&#39;t quite kn=\r\now how to do that, so that is making this a very, very\nexciting time. Would=\r\n you like to hear how it got turned upside down,\njust take a couple minutes=\r\n? Maybe you could give them a hand.&quot; If they\nsay no, make small talk and sa=\r\ny good day. If yes they&#39;re in, because all\nthat is necessary is wanting to =\r\nknow. From here I find many get to the\npunch line before I do, because we a=\r\nll feel it coming in our heart.\n       &quot;Well they found the Quantum and now=\r\n they think there is a physics\nthat works on atomic and sub-atomic particle=\r\ns, and another that work on\nyou and me. What we intend to prove is, that we=\r\n&#39;ve just discovered the\nreal One, and just have not realized that&#39;s how it =\r\nreally works, yet.\nBut that is what is so exciting, and why there is so muc=\r\nh going on.\nEveryone is examining the puzzle pieces, and the one that made =\r\nthe mess\nis &#39;the famous Quantum physics double slot experiment&#39; that proved=\r\n that\nobservation changes the results.&quot;\n\n                                  =\r\n           The double slot dilemma.\n\n       &quot;A screen to block photons was =\r\nplaced between a photon gun and a\nsecond screen that would register photon =\r\nhits. With a slot cut in the\nfirst screen, just as if they were wet painted=\r\n tennis balls the photons\nmade a line of hits on the back screen, where the=\r\ny passed through the\nslot. With two slots in the first screen what do you s=\r\nuppose registered\non the back screen?\n       &quot;A wave pattern appeared inste=\r\nad of a particle pattern. Instead of\ntwo lines, imagine if water hit the fi=\r\nrst screen. Expanding half circle\nwaves of water come through the slots. Th=\r\ne leading surface of the wave\nregistered on the second screen, but where th=\r\ne waves intersect they\ncancel each other out. So after some head scratching=\r\n, they shot one\nphoton at a time so there could be no interference between =\r\nphotons but\nthe wave pattern did not go away. So a type of high speed camer=\r\na was\nsynced with the photon gun, and placed to see what the photons were\nd=\r\noing as they hit the slotted screen. What do you think happened? The\nwave p=\r\nattern went away and they got the two impact lines of a particle\npattern! W=\r\nhy? That&#39;s the Question you could help us with.\n\n&quot;They don&#39;t know what it m=\r\neans, but they do know beyond the shadow of a\ndoubt, that the observation c=\r\nhanges the results. In fact we now know the\nobservers effect on the observa=\r\ntion can never be removed. Making it\nnecessary to rethink every experiment =\r\never done. What do you think it\nmeans? We are running a world wide experime=\r\nnt to find out. We think if\nconsciousness changes results, results may chan=\r\nge according to belief,\nas they did in this case.\n       &quot;We&#39;ve designed th=\r\ne experiment to see if consciousness can change\nthe results to what we all =\r\nwant, by maximizing the observers effect.\nThis is global because we are all=\r\n the observer. We have prepared seven\npages intended to eliminate the reaso=\r\nns we think we&#39;re not in control,\nso we can all focus and believe we can ha=\r\nve what we want. This may be\neasier then it seems as the Quantum demonstrat=\r\nes that we are all the\nsame inter-connected One. So not superficially, but =\r\nat our core we all\nwant the same things.\n       &quot;We also believe that when =\r\nwe get to a certain number, once\nreached every One will get it. Have you ev=\r\ner heard about the hundredth\nmonkey experiment?&quot;\n\n                         =\r\n                      The Hundredth Monkey\n\n       &quot;In Japan there was a bu=\r\nmper crop of sweet potatoes one year, more\nthen could be used. So the exces=\r\ns was given to scientists. They decided\nto introduce them to an island of m=\r\nonkeys to see how this new food\nsource impacted them. They did an air drop =\r\non the beach. Sand was\nembedded making them hard to eat. One day an adolesc=\r\nent female washed\nhers off in a stream, making them easier to eat. The hier=\r\narchy would not\nallow the adults to notice her innovation, but some of her =\r\nplaymates\ndid. And soon their mothers did. Soon after they made a drop and =\r\nwatched\nto see what percentage washed them, and suddenly they all did! This=\r\n\nindicated a mass consciousness, but they did not know the number\ncompared =\r\nto the total it took, for everyone to get it. So they went to\nanother islan=\r\nd, counted the monkey and made the first drop. What do you\nthink happened? =\r\nThey all washed their potatoes!&quot;\n\n       Hand them &#39;You&#39;re The One&#39;. &quot;Here =\r\nis the awakening, you are now\none of the first hundred monkeys. We find tha=\r\nt the first day you look at\nall the possibilities, the second day you look =\r\nat all the reasons it\ncan&#39;t be, and the third you put together the combinat=\r\nion that works for\nyou. Then read it again and more will open up.\n       &quot;W=\r\ne ask that instead of asking yourself is this possible, because\nby all indi=\r\ncations everything is. We ask you to ask yourself, is this\nwhat I want too.=\r\n If it is, help us get to the hundredth monkey. Give it\nto those you care a=\r\nbout, and discuss it. If you see any place people are\ngiving up their power=\r\n that is not covered, or a clearer way to say what\nwe all want, hit the e-m=\r\nail and we&#39;ll add it.\n       &quot;By the time we get to the hundredth this will=\r\n be the most self\nempowering document ever written, because every One is wr=\r\niting it. You\nsee we feel that all the problems there are, are just our mak=\r\ning choices\nwe don&#39;t want. And if we&#39;re right, we are going to wake up happ=\r\ny and all\nheaded in the right direction, One day soon!&quot;\n\n                Th=\r\ne Experiment and all materials herein are for the use\nof all until the end =\r\nof two-twelve. No rights are reserved, as this is\nby The People for The Peo=\r\nple to The People.\n\n\n  You&#39;re The One\n\nHere are the tools for the completed=\r\n GRAND PLAN. This says what all the\npieces are hinting.\nThe meaning of actu=\r\nalizing Quantum physics, the pure potential of you.\nOK, lets dethrone every=\r\nthing except you\nTHE GNOSTIC GOSPEL\n            The potential of consciousn=\r\ness is unlimited, consciousness\nonly has the limits upon it, that it choose=\r\ns to experience. This is a\nnew, ancient spiritual paradigm, through Quantum=\r\n physics. This answers\nthe four great questions. The Quantum leap.    Prefa=\r\nce: Limitation sees\nthe separation between things, the One that strings eve=\r\nrything together,\nallows us to see through the real illusion. The observer =\r\nis\nconsciousness, and the observation becomes what the consciousness truly\n=\r\nbelieves. This gives the obvious additional conclusion to the double\nslot e=\r\nxperiment. The observation changed the results to, what we\nbelieved was the=\r\n only possibility. How do we disregard, that results\nchange to what&#39;s belie=\r\nved. Our exploration should be, could there be\nx&#39;s all over the screen, if =\r\nthat is the absolute only possibility of\nthe observer&#39;s knowing? Obviously =\r\nthis is a possibility. That we can\nnot remove the observer&#39;s impact on the =\r\nobservation, indicates this\ncan be true. Not believing does eliminate possi=\r\nbilities. The observer\ncould not be separated if we are all the creator. Tr=\r\nuly made in the\nimage of God.             Most see the mechanical as dispro=\r\nving the\nspiritual and never the twain shall meet. Thereby this is where, m=\r\nost of\nthe tension is. We&#39;ve looked for, creating more of, what we\ndon&#39;t kn=\r\now long enough, lets look at what we can. Instead of trying\nto minimize the=\r\n observer&#39;s effect we need maximizing. We will move\nbackward and forward in=\r\n time just as easily, once we believe, we&#39;ve\nproven it mathematically true.=\r\n But cream is not going to fly out of\ncoffee, as often as it goes in, becau=\r\nse that is never going to be our\nintention. The Quantum leap is, we have, t=\r\no have asked every question,\nto vibrate the frequencies of the answers, col=\r\nlapsing them thereby into\nwhat we know, and presto you have existence. It t=\r\nakes no time for\nanything we want, to happen. The time we decide things wil=\r\nl take, is the\nliteral creation of time. This picture is clearer when you r=\r\nealize your\ninfinite.              We are consciousness-es that are not the=\r\n field,\nwe are the projectors of the field, your kitty is the field. Kitty =\r\nonly\nunderstands love or variables thereof. We create the entire field from=\r\n\nunconditional love. That&#39;s why when we give what it is, it\nsynchronizes. O=\r\nur consciousness-es generate holograms (realities), and\nholograms generate =\r\nheat, that is what and why when we approach absolute\nzero the Bose/Einstein=\r\n effect occurs. Where there is no field, is the\nOne, we all are. And we can=\r\n never get to absolute zero, because there\nmust be something left to see th=\r\ne effect. We are each creating\nrealities, at the speed of the oscillations,=\r\n through each of our\nseparate entire reality&#39;s quarks. That&#39;s why we&#39;re\npro=\r\ncessing 400 billion plus bits of information per second, this is\nstuff we&#39;r=\r\ne doing not stuff we&#39;re going to do. Consciousness\nmoves through these imag=\r\nes in both direction, creating the sensations of\ntime.               Enligh=\r\ntenment is the understanding of what it is to\nknow. When you stay in the jo=\r\ny of knowing, thereby increasing the rate\nof images through your quarks to =\r\n144,000 revolutions per second,\nyou&#39;ll leave all that you don&#39;t want behind=\r\n. The big bang is the\nOne screaming more, as there was no thing to scream a=\r\nbout, before the\nbang. I don&#39;t believe anything `has to&#39; grow from anything=\r\n,\nobviously we want them to, but the One we all are has always existed.\nWho=\r\n we are can not be found within the field, this entire reality is\nonly a sm=\r\nall portion of who you really are. Involved will replace\nevolved. At our co=\r\nre we all want and are the same everything, as we are\nthe same One. This is=\r\n one of your possibilities, so how does it feel?\nNext is my philosophical c=\r\nompletion of the unified field. Unifying\nspirituality, the Quantum physics =\r\nand everything. I call it the Gnostic\ngospel, in One page, titled `new Gnos=\r\ntic movement&#39;. Your\nunderstanding is vast, any input would be much apprecia=\r\nted. And now for\nyour enjoyment.   NEW GNOSTIC MOVEMENT\n               Quan=\r\ntum physics is the Gnostic movement. With Quantum\nphysics we are approachin=\r\ng the truth about, what it is to know, and\nGnostic means to know. This reli=\r\ngion, the realization of knowing caused\ntime to start over again. And ended=\r\n about 325 A.D., when constantine\nended it by the sword and reinstated idol=\r\natry. From then on, until\nQuantum physics, idolatry is the only religion on=\r\n planet earth. Idolatry\nis the placing of someone or something on a pedesta=\r\nl with powers, you\nthink, you cannot achieve. That is why horus, mithra, ch=\r\nrishna,\nsolinvictus, jesus christ, and many others have the same powers and=\r\n\nachievements, and are their subjects masters. To believe that things are\nn=\r\not your choice, is to represent choices you don&#39;t want, which is\nthe purpos=\r\ne of idolatry. The test showing that your belief is idolatry,\nis you do not=\r\n truly believe you are made in the image of God. If what\nGod is, you do not=\r\n see as who you are, you have a deity between you and\nwho you truly are. Re=\r\nalization that you are is going to bring everything\nback, we are in the gre=\r\nat time of change. You do not learn to know, you\nrealize you always have. T=\r\nhere is no One nowhere, greater nor less than\nyou.               We are all=\r\n the same One, and within that One there is\nan unlimited amount of everythi=\r\nng for everyone. Einstein proved the\nexistence of the Quantum, then spent a=\r\n lot of the rest of his life\n&#39;trying&#39; to disprove it, because it meant the =\r\nrest of his work and\nscience, really don&#39;t matter. Point being, there is no=\r\n hierarchy in\nheaven and heaven is fast approaching for those in the Gnosti=\r\nc. Time and\nspace that has infinite energy, and appears to be infinite in a=\r\nll\ndirections outside of us, is actually the smallest speck at the very\ncen=\r\nter of who each of us are. The projection of mass created therefrom\nby the =\r\n&#39;Bang&#39; is not finite, as the bang is not a one time event. It is\nan on goin=\r\ng creation that will never stop adding creation in all\ndirections. The univ=\r\nerse only appears flat because we are seeing it like\nwe used to see the pla=\r\nnet. The big five of the unified field are\nprojections of consciousness, an=\r\n infinitely faceted gem.                \nThe One that we are, is the self a=\r\nware Quantum field of infinite\npossibilities, from this we project a hologr=\r\naphic image of as many of\nthe possibilities as we choose. To know, absolute=\r\nly everything is your\nchoice, is to be Gnostic. If you believe in One Omni =\r\nPresent God, there\nis only two things that everyone everywhere all agree up=\r\non, God is the\ncreator of everything and infinite. Now if you believe the t=\r\nhird thing,\nyou are made in the image of God, the first two things are the =\r\nonly\nthings that we all agree, are the image your made in. This is not only=\r\n\nthe only religion that is not idolatry, it&#39;s the only religion with\nno dow=\r\nn side, if you believe you can know, you will.               \nRealities, wh=\r\nen and wherever, are your projection of the portion of the\nOne, that you ch=\r\noose to experience. You are not a human being you are\nthe entire reality, y=\r\nou have just chosen to represent yourself as one,\ncreating time to interact=\r\n with other facets (creators). But awake,\nasleep, un-conscience, or dead yo=\r\nu are still the consciousness of the\nentire reality you choose. If you and =\r\nI agree that any object exists,\nthat means there are two of them. There is =\r\nan infinite number of us\nconsciousness-es, and all of our realities togethe=\r\nr reflect back to the\nOne that we all are, all the ways that can be. We are=\r\n like ball bearings\non the bridge, within each and every One of us is the r=\r\neflection of the\nentire bridge.               All realities are holographic=\r\n images of\nportions of the One, which means the only limit is when we choos=\r\ne to\nrepresent limitation. But limitation is the cause and effect of doubt,=\r\n\nand is the only thing that is not the One. It is the attempt to exclude\na =\r\nportion of the One from existence, which is the only power that we do\nnot t=\r\nruly have. As such doubt is the only thing that cannot be a part of\nwho we =\r\ntruly are. But it is the only thing between you and anything you\nwant.     =\r\n          In any reality, look at as many options as is\nnecessary to see th=\r\ne One that makes you feel good, that&#39;s the One\nthat you are. This joy is th=\r\ne Omni Presents of God permeating all\nportions of the One. The feeling of j=\r\noy in your heart is the Word of\nGod, showing you which part of the matrix i=\r\ns you, so you can always find\nyour way home. When you represent only this, =\r\nyou have Ascended!\nThis is the way and the light! And that&#39;s all there is t=\r\no it, it\nmatters not if you become Gnostic now or later, when you stop bein=\r\ng a\nmaster of limitation this is where you&#39;ll be. And so it is\ninevitable t=\r\nhat you will return to the powerful creator that you are,\nyou have forever.=\r\n But a lot of us are going in the blink of an eye, in\ntwo twelve. We did no=\r\nt evolve from an ameba, we came from the other\ndirection and are only going=\r\n back, to who we are. We&#39;ll still be\ncreating the matrix, we are just going=\r\n to completely stop creating what\nwe don&#39;t want with it. Can you feel the k=\r\ningdom come? It&#39;s not a\nplace, it&#39;s the movement that gets better forever. =\r\nIf anyone asks\nwhat&#39;s a Gnostic, you could just say their a bunch of know-i=\r\nt-alls.\nHere are some definitions I feel are miss used:                Fait=\r\nh; is\nnot giving power to something somewhere else, it is the feeling you h=\r\nave\nafter seeing what you want, that you must believe in to receive it.\nBel=\r\nief; seeing is not believing, when you believe in something you will\nsee it=\r\n. So the only question you truly have is, what must I believe to\nbe seeing =\r\nwhat I&#39;m seeing? If it&#39;s not what you want, find what\nis, and do whatever i=\r\nt takes to believe.                So now that\nwe&#39;re back to Faith, have fu=\r\nn  Like it&#39;s the most important\nthing in your life, because it is. One does=\r\n not have to find Faith every\nOne has it, Faith is what you truly believe a=\r\nnd actually creates\neverything. A mustard seed size Faith can move mountain=\r\ns, and you cannot\nbe part of something your not creating the vibration of. =\r\n               \nYou do not raise a question, a question raises its answer. =\r\nWithout a\nquestion you have no answers to experience, and every question ra=\r\nises\nit&#39;s answer, every time.                All realities are fractal so\ne=\r\nveryone of them always goes back to One bottom leg. Example: all the\nforces=\r\n everywhere every when, that want what we don&#39;t want for us,\nhave only one =\r\ntool, to get us to doubt we can have what we want. We\nleave the kingdom whe=\r\nn we don&#39;t do what feels good in our heart.\nEvery reality everywhere is a h=\r\nolographic image, although the vast\nmajority of them, off earth, represent =\r\nonly the Quantum field of\ninfinite possibilities that is unconditional love=\r\n. Some realities seem\nmore real then others, when they are what everybody t=\r\nruly wants, but it\nis never the less a hologram. A holographic projection i=\r\ns only an image,\nbut what it is the projection of, is not. And just as you =\r\ncan cut\nholographic film into a thousand pieces and fire up the entire imag=\r\ne\nfrom any piece, you can cut a person into a thousand pieces and fire up\nt=\r\nhe entire image from any piece.                 Because to interact\nwith an=\r\nother individual is to deal with another entire world, it&#39;s\nnever a reality=\r\n and always realities. Making it more complicated, this\nis why it seems we =\r\ncan&#39;t just create another reality, like when\nwe&#39;re asleep. To change the `r=\r\nealities&#39; you must all want\nand believe the shared agreements your changing=\r\n, will change. This we\ncan do globally, but we must make a lot of considera=\r\ntions. Truth is,\nwith tunnel vision, any One anytime can completely know, b=\r\nelieve, and\nrise to ascension. But some of us are wanting a mass Exodus, se=\r\nparating\nfrom those that refuse to leave limitations, we are not going to\nc=\r\no-create anymore. It  is only nothing, that is too simple or too good\nto be=\r\n true.                Experiments that find what we are not, are\nillusions.=\r\n Analyzation stunts results, dwarfs genius, as it is the idea\nthat the obse=\r\nrver is separate, which we now know is not possible. It is\nthe attempt to r=\r\nemove the unconditional love, lets see what is if we\ndon&#39;t want anything. W=\r\ne need not another experiment, we need to turn\naround and absorb, the Ones =\r\nalready done. Everything off the shelf,\nrealize, realization and applicatio=\r\nn take no time. Thinking it will is\nthe makings of time, that we don&#39;t want=\r\n.                 The grand\nillusion is the lie, that the images we are cre=\r\nating, are not ours. We\nare creating the spoon, to bend it is to `try&#39; to c=\r\nonvince our\nself that we&#39;re the creator, by changing our creation to one wi=\r\nthout\npurpose, there is a spoon. Be Gnostic, stop worrying about and doing\n=\r\nwhat you don&#39;t want. Pointing out a problem without representing the\nanswer=\r\n, is to vibrate more of it into your reality. Seeing fault in an\nother, is =\r\nyour opportunity to give your representation of that other,\nthe answer.    =\r\n             First One must look at the idea that you are\nThe One, to reali=\r\nze the possibility you are the observer and your\nobservation is created by =\r\nyour beliefs, and you are infinite\npossibilities. The two primary options a=\r\nre, you can realize this is not\ntrue, or you can realize that it is one of =\r\nthe infinite possibilities\nthat you are. With doubt all the things that sho=\r\nw it is not, appear\nbefore you. With the idea everything is true, choose th=\r\ne Ones you want,\nyou ask how does this idea feel? That feeling is the `coll=\r\napse&#39;\ninto existence, you&#39;re creation no matter which option you choose.\nIf=\r\n the mechanical disproves the spiritual and never the twain shall\nmeet, out=\r\nside of you exists and you just stumbled in from an ameba, than\nif I place =\r\na piece of chalk on your arm dust is the only possibility.\nBut if you are t=\r\nhe Quantum field of infinite possibilities and I take\ncontrol of your belie=\r\nf through hypnotism and tell you this chalk is a\nred hot cigar, which is th=\r\ne possibility that is really going to happen?\nAnd the truth is, you had bet=\r\nter get some aloe vera.                True\nor not, whether you come from t=\r\nhe smallest thing in creation or\nyou&#39;re the Quantum field of infinite possi=\r\nbilities, all of which is\nunconditional love and projects all creations, wh=\r\nich has the better\neffect in your life. The very idea this is a possibility=\r\n, gives you\nglimpses of how all things fit together, which is why we now ha=\r\nve the\nstring theory. Obviously if you don&#39;t realize your grandeur, your\nea=\r\nsy to take advantage of, by someone who does. I can talk you into a\nchalk b=\r\nurn. Within this time of limitation exploration, all don&#39;t\nhave the best in=\r\nterest at heart.                Lets clarify definitions\nto demonstrate thi=\r\ns is a new paradigm, shown by the completeness of new\nperspectives. The ide=\r\na of having a question, in the old paradigm, means\nI have an answer I can&#39;t=\r\n find. In the new paradigm, a question is\nthe selection of what we want to =\r\nexperience, from the infinite\npossibilities that we are, as there is no thi=\r\nng outside of us. The idea\nthat it could be possible, to not know an answer=\r\n, is the limitation that\nstops any answer from experience. When the experie=\r\nnce of the answer is\nwhy we ask any question. Why would we ever think that =\r\nall of these\npossibilities that we are, are perhaps hopelessly outside of u=\r\ns?\nThe answer coming to me by that question is, wait a minute, the\npossibil=\r\nities here are infinite too. Oh O.K., the One I get a good\nfeeling about is=\r\n. Now I know I&#39;m infinite, and realize I did not\nknow that for a while. I m=\r\nust have grown bored with knowing everything\nwas my doing, and presto. I ha=\r\nve the experience of emotions coming at me\nfrom around the corner, like wow=\r\n that got me when I wasn&#39;t lookin,\nwhat excitement. Now, I&#39;m bored with all=\r\n the ways I can hide from\nme, the Quantum field of unconditional love, and =\r\npresto it&#39;s back to\nthe knowing creator we really are.                The i=\r\ndea of infinite\npossibilities is known, but we don&#39;t know. Because we&#39;re co=\r\nming\nfrom limitation, complete realization that there are always infinite\np=\r\nossibilities would be to never create another limitation upon\nourselves. Th=\r\ne belief that we have to search for who we are, is the\ncreation of the vibr=\r\nation and reality of not knowing. We will experience\nbewilderment until we =\r\nchange our mind. To stay in this limitation,\nrealize every One of us are ad=\r\nding limitation, to every idea we have\nevery moment of every day. This new =\r\nparadigm has always been in effect,\nthe old one is just realities of not kn=\r\nowing. We always have infinite\npossibilities at our finger tips. It&#39;s our c=\r\nhoice to use the Ones we\nwant, or doubt we can.                 You can not=\r\n know all there is to\nknow when you don&#39;t need to know it, but if you liste=\r\nn to your heart\nyou will know what you need to know when you need to know i=\r\nt. Without\ndifficulty, in fact doing only what&#39;s best shows you how full of=\r\n\nwhat we didn&#39;t want, life was. You know who&#39;s found there truth,\nin the fi=\r\nrst moments of interaction, those that don&#39;t know are\nprojecting what they =\r\ndon&#39;t want. The world through `media&#39;\nis doubt by uncontrollable fear. For =\r\nwhich they are not accountable,\nbecause network news is legally classified =\r\nas entertainment.\nIn the old paradigm, you might say these are great concep=\r\nts, but even if\ncorrect, that will take along time to be `the norm&#39;. The ne=\r\nw One\nshows, this is the actual creation of time, that will go on until we\n=\r\nchange our mind. And all the time it takes until we decide to know, we\ncan =\r\nnot know that we are choosing to make time we do not want. You know\nnow, an=\r\nd the moment we see what for us is true, everything necessary for\nthat new =\r\nbelief, appears in our path. Happens every time.\nI&#39;ve seen the paradigm shi=\r\nft, lived the realization, am wishing you\nwill all come to. This is a gift =\r\nfor us all, understanding without\neffort. I know somewhere in the back of y=\r\nour mind, the possibility that\nwe&#39;ve come full circle, has gone off. You se=\r\ne we do things without\nasking our heart how it feels, as the rule. This is =\r\nall limitation is.\nThat is why out on the limb of science, it looks like th=\r\nings take a long\ntime. But when we started the idea of limitation, we start=\r\ned down the\nrabbit hole. When you realize the hole is all you, your closet =\r\nempties.\nYou&#39;ve made the turn around, and all the way out and beyond, is\nkn=\r\nowing and feels good.                Imagine if I&#39;m right and you\nare the Q=\r\nuantum field of infinite possibilities, that any choice is\nyour&#39;s by belief=\r\n. All that you think is so far out of human\npossibility, is one of the poss=\r\nibilities your&#39;s by belief. It is\nconsciousness-es belief that collapses in=\r\nfinity into that particular\nvibration.                You see when you beli=\r\neve by always asking your\nheart what to do, things you never thought would,=\r\n just clear up. But you\ndo have to witness how brutal we are. Ignorance of =\r\nhow `the placebo\neffect&#39; works, would have saved me the horror of watching =\r\ndoctors,\ndestroy the perfect working belief systems of the 40 % that believ=\r\ned and\nthereby got well, by telling them their ability was fake. Proper car=\r\ne\nwould severally damage pharmaceutical profits, what&#39;s going to\nhappen whe=\r\nn we get every One to believe in themselves.                \nAll I&#39;ve said =\r\nand all the ideas Quantum physics has found, line up\nlike the flight of an =\r\narrow that stuck directly in this paradigm. And\nyou can make it not true, w=\r\nhat ever you believe is true, that&#39;s the\nmeaning of infinite possibilities.=\r\n But this is not the use of Free Will,\nit is the choice of doubt creating l=\r\nimitation, eliminating\nopportunities. Free will is choices from the infinit=\r\ne possibilities that\nyou are, not the idea you don&#39;t have choices. This mak=\r\nes Quantum\nphysics practical and pliable.                                  =\r\n  \nBecause this is what it is, opposition is a demonstration of a belief in=\r\n\nlimitation, which now you see and thereby is the opportunity to let go.\nTh=\r\nat&#39;s why the greatest minds along with your&#39;s, are now seeing\nwhat we need =\r\nto look at, through the now completed circle of\nunderstanding. Do what ever=\r\n it takes, to believe and do what gives your\nheart joy with integrity, it w=\r\nill transform your where to where you want\nto be. Because I think servitude=\r\n has a two twelve end date too, and they\njust want us not to believe, in an=\r\nything. Oh by the way when you say,\noff handedly, well you know `they&#39; say =\r\nthis or `they&#39;\nsay that, this is who `they&#39;(the public opinion) are.\nWhat s=\r\nhows the direction we came from, is when you hear ideas for the\nfirst time,=\r\n maybe like this, you do not stand in awe of a new concept.\nYou reflect it =\r\noff of who you are inside, and if it matches you accept\nit. All the new par=\r\nadigm asks of you is to realize you grandeur and do\nonly what feels good in=\r\n your heart. Never has this been difficult when\nrealized, because it is wha=\r\nt we all want. The hardest part to get is,\nall the struggle, fighting, hard=\r\nship, etc., etc., etc., is to keep\nlimitations that we do not want!!! This =\r\nis a struggle to stay inferior.\nThere is an infinite number of ways to not =\r\nsee limitations are like big\nrocks, they are hard to hang on to and drop aw=\r\nay when you just let go.\nOnce all becomes the joy of knowledge within you, =\r\nyou see those around\nyou that are vibrating about things that they do not w=\r\nant. It is a\ndelicate idea to let them know, that they can vibrate things t=\r\nhey like\ninto being. Within our infinite possibilities there are answers th=\r\nat\nfeel good, for any turmoil. If met head on, you must use the greatest\nca=\r\nre in allowing them to see, the limitations being released, are not\nwho any=\r\n of us truly are. Because their first response, is to believe\nthese limitat=\r\nions are who they are, and take it as an attack on them. I\nknow you&#39;ll find=\r\n the best way.                This is not the time\nto solo ascend, this is =\r\na bigger event then those other times. If you do\nstay and help with this ma=\r\nss Exodus, you must take responsibility for\nthis entire experience and can =\r\nnot just step away. As your ancient eyes\nare opening, you may find yourself=\r\n sobbing about all you&#39;ve allowed\nto take place. That&#39;s enough of that, let=\r\ns get on with the conscious\nchoice of continuous preference we&#39;re now chang=\r\ning this mess into.\nKey here is you must move from self, to what&#39;s best for=\r\n all, all the\ntime. When you rise from taking responsibility for just the k=\r\narma of a\nbody, to that of (your images of) this entire reality, representi=\r\nng only\nanswers, your firing on all cylinders.                       The\nsi=\r\nmplicity that realities are fractal means, they stand on one bottom\nleg, th=\r\ne idea that builds the entire fractal. There are not two sides of\nevery fra=\r\nctal, there is only one undebatable bottom idea. If your in\npolarized confl=\r\nict your not at the bottom. When you get to the bottom\nleg there is only on=\r\ne question, is this an idea that we want, feels\ngood, or one we don&#39;t want.=\r\n Without a change in the bottom leg, we\nwill go where it is headed no matte=\r\nr how much justified conflict.\nA couple undebatable bottom legs, for exampl=\r\nes, that we are not taking\nresponsibility for:                  The bottom =\r\nleg of allopathic\nmedicine is, war to kill the smallest destructive things =\r\nwithin us. Or,\nkill microbes, which one you only morph them and two the `ki=\r\nll&#39;\nis not specific. Obviously this is not a creation we want, so we must b=\r\ne\nconvinced that it is necessary evil. This is a really hard sell if you\nkn=\r\now there is no thing outside of you, making it a personal death\nthreat. If =\r\nyou know your infinite, I mean do you know any near death\nsurvivors that di=\r\nd not leave their body, you may not take this threat\nseriously. But if you =\r\ndon&#39;t change the bottom leg you will go get\npoisoned, when the body is weak=\r\nened by a detox and/or deficiency, that\nwe call being sick. Truth is this e=\r\nssence of life we `try&#39; to\nkill from us, is infinite. The enzymes that allo=\r\nw all life functions, in\na slightly alkaline environment, become `germs&#39; wh=\r\nen your\nacidic. To acidify where these germs can&#39;t fractal your\ndegenerativ=\r\ne.

Eight pages of the Moniteur Scientifique were\nrequired to=\r\n set forth a list of his Scientific works. You can look at\nthe bottom line,=\r\n from the genius of discovery, or be stuck with\nmutilation. Find out, and t=\r\nhen see how you feel about mandatory\nallopathic administration through insu=\r\nrance.\n                Here is one we want, that we&#39;re being steered away\nf=\r\nrom. We are moving to statute ordinances, from the law of Rights. As we\nmus=\r\nt surrender our Constitution, for the u.n. charter to exist which is\nthe ce=\r\nntralization of all governing power. So the public opinion we are\ntold is, =\r\nwe can not know our Constitutional framers intent. The intent\nand outcome o=\r\nf this idea is to change what the framers said. The bottom\nleg can not be d=\r\nenied. The framers intent is demonstrated by what our\nConstitution gave us,=\r\n that did not exist before it was enacted, which we\ndo not have today. Secu=\r\nred Rights. An accurate exhibit of what&#39;s\nbeen lost is on youtube under, `T=\r\nhe Wolves are in the Chicken\nCoop&#39;, four parts. Hard truth here is, the Con=\r\nstitution of and for\nthe united States of America is the only thing in the =\r\nway. Those who\nhave it and are now let it go, are letting the entire planet=\r\n down. If we\ndon&#39;t look at the bottom line, we have no idea what we really =\r\nwant.\n                The latest unraveling in the public eye is, our ruler=\r\ns\ngot caught taking over the world by carbon tax. So they get scientists\nca=\r\nught up in a raging debate over is there a real problem. The bottom\nleg of =\r\nthis fractal from my perspective is:                First we must\ntake into=\r\n account the terms and conditions surrounding it, which a good\nscientist mu=\r\nst take into consideration. Which are, a very few control\nand receive the p=\r\nrofits from the use of fossil fuels. The problem&#39;s\nsolution cuts directly i=\r\nnto those profits. So it is possible we are\nbeing lead away from the soluti=\r\non, by having a different problem, that\nincreases profits with the bonus of=\r\n justifying world domination. Any\npart of that not true for you?           =\r\n          If carbon dioxide is\nthe problem, we should immediately have ever=\r\nybody in the world grow\nplants, everywhere. Imagine over 6 billion plant gr=\r\nowers, with every One\nhaving the power to help. Now that would create chang=\r\ne. Governments\nshould give planters and dirt to all, but get your own seeds=\r\n because\ntheirs are genetically altered, well maybe you better get your own=\r\n dirt.\nThe real problem we have is: Ozone Depletion, talking about ozone th=\r\ne\nallotropic O3 oxygen molecule, nothing more nothing less. As you know to\n=\r\nthe environment, it is an available active oxygen for cleansing, like\nbleac=\r\nh does for your laundry. It is unstable and breaks off easily\nleaving behin=\r\nd, our environments stable form, super-oxide or O2. Without\nOzone we are st=\r\narting to fry like an egg.                The real\nproblem&#39;s cause: Carbon =\r\nMonoxide, and the simple bottom line is,\nunstable forms, carbon monoxide(CO=\r\n) and ozone(O3) in contact stabilize\nforming the stable forms, carbon dioxi=\r\nde(CO2) and super-oxide(O2). This\nsimple scientific truth, is chemistry tha=\r\nt every One can understand.\nUnstable CO and O3 recombine forming stable CO2=\r\n and O2 equaling Ozone\nDepletion. Wait the truth is simpler yet, CO destroy=\r\ns O3 and it does not\nmatter where carbon monoxide steals the necessary oxyg=\r\nen for\nstabilization, the chain reaction ends with ozone depletion.\nI know =\r\nthis is too obvious why we are wasting time avoiding the problem,\nthat all =\r\nknow we have. Our rulers tell us to, and that does not feel\nvery good. Plan=\r\nters would be nice.\n                We can not fix what we are not changing=\r\n the bottom leg\nof. And as you can see they are not hard to find nor can yo=\r\nu debate\nthem. Allopathic medicine is to kill microbes, our Constitution se=\r\ncured\nRights, and carbon monoxide destroys ozone. Your just allowing bottom=\r\n\nlegs to be looked at helps tremendously.                 So another hard\nt=\r\nruth is, our leaders are leading us to insurmountable problems,\njustifying =\r\ncomplete control. Again, it&#39;s difficult just to look at\nthese bottom lines,=\r\n let alone publicly stand for the answers. I&#39;m in\nyour face because I belie=\r\nve times up, all our choices are back, but\nthose that don&#39;t get off the fen=\r\nce now, may live with all that they\ndon&#39;t want. See how important standing =\r\nfor what we really want, is.\nWhen you give everything, you&#39;ll get everythin=\r\ng, but not until. The\nsecret of Faith must be used for what&#39;s best for all,=\r\n and every Ones\nFaith will be tested.                If you didn&#39;t know abo=\r\nut the\nterms and conditions of Quantum physics such as, the famous double s=\r\nlot\nexperiment, the Bose/Einstein effect, the amazing amount of information=\r\n\nwe are procession, the oscillation of quarks, super position, etc.,\nit&#39;s b=\r\netter to find out from the inside out like this. It will\nconfirm that you n=\r\now know.                 You have changed. You do not\nhave baggage connecti=\r\nng you to problems, some other where some other\nwhen. There is only now and=\r\n now you choose what you want. Now you know\nmore than any allopathic doctor=\r\n about your health, more than our leaders\nwant us to know about the Constit=\r\nution, and more than Quantum physicists\nknow about the Quantum. In fact you=\r\n could hold instructional classes\nshowing Quantum physicists how to believe=\r\n what their finding. You\nunderstand para-phenomena, spirituality, philosoph=\r\ny, science, and\nmedicine. You understand the unified field, that there is n=\r\no thing out\nside of you, you see how every thing is the One, what free will=\r\n is, you\nknow why the observer can not be separated, etc. etc. etc... You&#39;r=\r\ne\na doggone genius, and the beauty of the truth  is, unlike limitations\nyou=\r\n do not need to keep affirming these tools. You can get a good nights\nsleep=\r\n and they well still be here, in fine working order, in the\nmorning.       =\r\n         Doubt is a notion, that can only exist after\nseeing one of infinit=\r\ne possibilities that is wanted, that creates the\nlimitation of not having. =\r\nThis is the opposite of Faith and the creation\nof what you don&#39;t want. To d=\r\noubt you can have what you want, has\nnever ever once felt good. This is why=\r\n if you only do what feels good in\nyour heart with integrity, the limitatio=\r\nns you don&#39;t prefer anymore\nare not manifest. And by definition, thereby as=\r\n doubt is eliminated\nexistence must fill with what you want, at equal  rate=\r\ns. To stand for\nonly what we all want, as you can see, I do not believe app=\r\nears an easy\nthing, in a world in doubt. But it is a must, and remember, we=\r\n only need\nto get to the hundredth monkey.                 Now at the begin=\r\nning of\nmeaningful things to say, where there are no more meaningful questi=\r\nons\nwithout answers, I&#39;ve talked enough. Though as you can see I go on\nfore=\r\nver. Now&#39;s your turn. Please let me know if this helps, or any\nreason this =\r\nis too simple and good to be you. If you find a meaningful\nquestion without=\r\n an answer, please let me see it, I can&#39;t find\nanymore of them myself. If y=\r\nou don&#39;t believe and can&#39;t tell me\nabout it, just know, I have delusions of=\r\n your grandeur. Gnostically use\nyour Faith.   Recommended:Read, including t=\r\nhis, again in three days.\nUntil you forget that you don&#39;t                  =\r\n   know.  Exodus\n          There you have it, an experiment to see that we =\r\ncan all\ntogether put the world right. By definition this is to find if we c=\r\nan\nall believe in what we all want, fortunately what we all want is what we=\r\n\ncan all believe in. Why not, every One every step of the way is going to\nb=\r\nenefit. This is the cheapest per magnitude and greatest experiment ever\ndon=\r\ne. Once validated, it will end scientific experiments where we &#39;try&#39;\nto ana=\r\nlize as outsiders.\n          As you&#39;ve now read &#39;You&#39;re The One&#39; the three =\r\nQuantum laws are\nwithin your conscious and the wake up is near. I can speak=\r\n more directly\nnow that you have, so I would like to say a little more. I&#39;m=\r\n running The\nExperiment because I truly understand these laws are literally=\r\n the way\nit all works. This truth is a feeling you have. To require outside=\r\n proof\nof this, is only to want something telling you it&#39;s OK to have that\n=\r\nfeeling inside. But it is also saying that you do not.\n          I know it&#39;=\r\ns all by choice, therefore we&#39;re making a lot of bad\nchoices as anyone with=\r\n their eyes open can see a train wreck just up\nahead. Understanding through=\r\n the new perspective of the Quantum is\nmaking the right choices. Some that =\r\nhave left religion, are the most\nreligious. Some who think their religious,=\r\n are. Who ever you are you\nmust deal with the main issue, what is right and=\r\n wrong? I believe when\nwe found the Quantum we found God, and is why for me=\r\n this is the science\nof religion. Everything else is idolatry exteriorizing=\r\n your power, which\nyou thereby believe is outside of you. When everything a=\r\nctually happens\nwithin consciousness, which is who you are. The key is you =\r\ncan only have\nwhat you can believe. How many degrees into idolatry you are =\r\nthereby the\namount of choices you allow yourself, is determined by your ans=\r\nwer to\nthis question. Why when you look at the possibility that you are mad=\r\ne in\nthe image of God, do you only see the differences? Because you are\nido=\r\nlizing God or something, God is not outside examining creation, God\nis the =\r\nconsciousness everything is a reflection from. The definition of\nomni prese=\r\nnce is within everything, meaning you can not go elsewhere to\nfind you, and=\r\n you are made in the image.\n          The Quantum demonstrates that there a=\r\nre only a couple rules,\ntoo few to understand by someone who exteriorizes t=\r\nheir beliefs.\nConsciousness is the Quantum, and the two rules are infinite =\r\nand\nunlimited. Everything is within the One consciousness, no matter how\nma=\r\nny point the One chooses to be the entire image is within each. So\nliterall=\r\ny there is no thing outside of you, no matter how much less you\nchoose to r=\r\nepresent. So though it appears things are outside of you, you\nare the consc=\r\niousness that all things are within. That all realities are\nprojections of =\r\nonly portions of the One and the whole is within each\nportion is the origin=\r\n of the paradox. But the illusion is that any of it\nis outside you. When yo=\r\nu negatively effect what you think is outside of\nyou, inside you know you o=\r\nwe for damage to who you truly are and thereby\nhave created karma.\n        =\r\n  Time is a component of consciousness&#39;s projection of realities,\nso there =\r\nis no time to measure the length of consciousness, before. But\nas that is w=\r\nho I am, I can tell you we are infinite and unlimited. Even\nbefore this ide=\r\na of less then the whole portions, called realities.\nThere is no time betwe=\r\nen you and enlightenment, using the Quantum view\nput it directly in your wa=\r\ny. When you see life as you, a tremendous\ncompassion surrounds everything. =\r\nWe are creating this time to interact\nwith other sentient creators. That re=\r\nalization grows reverence for\nothers, no matter what limitations they are c=\r\nhoosing. You know\neverything they are going through, because they are you. =\r\nThese are easy\nrules to follow because they are what we all want, what seem=\r\ns tough is\ngetting use to choosing what we want again. It has been a while.=\r\n What\nalso can appear scary is you must take responsibility if it&#39;s all you=\r\n.\nAnything appearing negative in your life, you only need to choose the\nans=\r\nwer that feels good for that idea and represent it anytime you see\nthe old =\r\none. It can not continue because its been answered, lesson\nlearned.\n       =\r\n   I know this is me, I see now and it set me free. Make the\nchoice to see =\r\nthrough the big three and come with me. I know all that I\nsee is me, I take=\r\n responsibility and represent only the answers. Even if\nnobody else wants t=\r\nhem. I will be the problem nevermore. So knowing I&#39;m\nout of here shortly, I=\r\n am going to do everything to show as many as I\ncan the Quantum view. When =\r\nthe transformation is complete if every One\nof us doesn&#39;t make it, will be =\r\nmy only regret.\n          The only opposition is to create disbelief it can=\r\n all be that\ngood. Why not stand together and see that we can! Prove this n=\r\not true,\nfind opposition other than that, can you? If anyone out there can =\r\nfind\nthat, we&#39;ll all go back to our box. But since that can&#39;t be done, lets=\r\n\nall go home! Together.\n           As you are infinite possibilities, we mu=\r\nst stop debating\npoints, both sides are always within infinite possibilitie=\r\ns. Which do\nyou prefer! Here is simplicity that can clear the view, there i=\r\ns only\nnothing in creation that we don&#39;t want. Everything is what we want, =\r\nor\ndoubt we can. Everthing you don&#39;t want in creation is only doubt you\ncan=\r\n. I am channeling what we all want because that is my choice, and\nhave no d=\r\noubt, I can! Everywhere everywhen there is One we want. Stand\nwith me, for =\r\nevery thing we all want. We will exceed our absolute\ngreatest expectations =\r\nmany times to come.\n           Give up everything you have, that is in the =\r\nway of every thing\nthat you want! When we stop all the time we are creating=\r\n, for believing\nin what we don&#39;t want, is the realization we&#39;ve made it!!! =\r\nGet very\nexcited, it&#39;s OK by me, I am. We are the Ones that get to tell the=\r\n\nWorld. We are Saved and we&#39;ve done it all ourselves! The only way there\nis=\r\n, is by choice. And if you don&#39;t choose it you can&#39;t have it. You\nthink of =\r\nanything more, we can have it. But vibrating about anything\nless was yester=\r\nday and yesterday&#39;s gone. There is no more meaningful\nquestions my heart ca=\r\nn&#39;t answer. Don&#39;t think I&#39;m not well, I have just\ngotten well after lifetim=\r\nes. Stand next to me, it looks real good. Here,\nhave my perspective, it&#39;s o=\r\nnly what is best for all and nothing else.\n          We have all thought we=\r\n are separate pearls, I have before you\nstrung the neckless. Stop measuring=\r\n your pearls against others, as\nreceiving the whole string does not diminis=\r\nh your pearls. Life is us\ndividing into every individual thing, but we are =\r\nnot any individual\nthing, we are first the string and then every single pea=\r\nrl. You do not\n&#39;need&#39; to look for anything, as you are everything. The trut=\r\nh will not\ngo away now that you know. Some may go away for awhile, but when=\r\n the\nlimitation more important then the truth becomes too heavy,they&#39;ll be\n=\r\nback this is the only store in creation. I have put all of my lifetimes\nint=\r\no this. Your actualizing that is to realize I am not someone out\nhere, this=\r\n is you writing this to you. Saying, lets all stand together\nfor what we al=\r\nl want.\n          You have been infinite forever, you have just pretended n=\r\not to\nbe for a bunch of life times. As we are now coming out of limitation\n=\r\nexploration for the exalting of emotions, we are riddled with doubt.\nDoubt =\r\ncan only exist after asking for what you want, so as your ancient\neyes open=\r\n, you need not even look for what you want, you&#39;ve already\nasked to have do=\r\nubt. Remove doubt and what you want must remain.\nActualize what&#39;s best for =\r\nall as what&#39;s best for self, because it is.\nHave the wisdom to uncover the =\r\nright, the will to choose it and the\nstrength to endure.\n          &#39;You&#39;re =\r\nThe One&#39; is the looking glass into infinite\npossibilities, which is the kno=\r\nwing that no thing is outside of you,\nbecause the truth is you are the One.=\r\n A few transformations down the\nroad and you&#39;ll realize your coming ascenti=\r\non, as I have. You&#39;ll embrace\n&#39;You&#39;re The One&#39; like she&#39;s your long lost mo=\r\nther, until your closet&#39;s\nempty. The Wonder of you will thereby and then be=\r\n actualized.\n          Though I do not know if I&#39;ll hear from you, there is=\r\n one thing\nI know, everything I&#39;m doing is what you want in your heart. I h=\r\nave\nscared the life into everyone so far, but I have my hopes for every One=\r\n.\nThose that want to dominate others and those that don&#39;t know how to live\n=\r\nwithout being dominated may think otherwise, but they want this too. If\nyou=\r\nr heart is open you want the results of this experiment, doubt or\nnot. Anot=\r\nher fact is I could not pull any punches, so I&#39;ve offended\nevery limitation=\r\n and all who think that is who they are. The game is on,\nthe pieces are all=\r\n in place, and I&#39;m right. I will wake up many, if some\nhelp me I&#39;ll wake up=\r\n the world, sadly my support track record doesn&#39;t\nexist. As I am blowing a =\r\ncanon off down main street, any comunication or\nhelp will be confidencial u=\r\nnless otherwise specified. I pray what I&#39;ve\nsaid serves you.\n\nWe are the On=\r\nes,\n\nmark\nTheExperiment101@... &lt;mailto:TheExperiment101@...&gt;\n\r\n--4-7942718780-8069277553=:9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Every One,&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;re: You&#39;re The One&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a vision that I&#39;m now presenting to The People=\r\n, you may find it fits. It&#39;s about the elephant that&#39;s always been in the l=\r\niving room, he wants to come and play again.&nbsp;Looking for presention op=\r\nportunities I found you, I intend that we become good friends.&nbsp;Just a =\r\nbrief background, I studied health and law until&nbsp;I figured them out, t=\r\nhe truth is always the shortest distance between here and there. But the&nb=\r\nsp;smoke and mirrors surrounding the truth is very complicated to&nbsp;tang=\r\nle reason. I put together a four part presentation of how our country is be=\r\ning destroyed and what needs to be done, it&#39;s on youtube under &#39;The Wolves =\r\nare in the Chicken Coop&#39;. I presented it to Alex Jones to see if he would k=\r\ney his viewers to it, as he had publicly said he would do if&nbsp;he saw&nb=\r\nsp;a good idea&nbsp;and it would mean hundreds&nbsp;of thousands of hits. I=\r\nf he had I could&nbsp;have made it work, but he would not even discuss it.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without help I found that eve=\r\nn though I was getting the highest star rating, less then twenty present we=\r\nre even looking at part two. So&nbsp;I realized it&#39;s hard to get people out=\r\n of their cubicle bubble, until their bubble bursts which is too late. I wa=\r\ns wrestling with how to give the wake up call that people could consider in=\r\n the comfort of their cubicle. Going through the three&nbsp;DVD set of &#39;Wha=\r\nt The Bleep&#39; and arguing with David Icke in my mind, while reading his &#39;Inf=\r\ninite Love is the Only Truth&#39; book. He nailed so many things, but his idea =\r\nthat the matrix was projected by somebody somewhere else to keep us in an i=\r\nllusion was the exteriorization that cleared my path.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the paradigm shift, a=\r\nll the answers were before me. I&nbsp;formed The Experiment in its entirety=\r\n.&nbsp;I spent April 12-17, designing the overview and presentation of &#39;The=\r\n Experiment&nbsp;to Maximize the Observer&#39;s Effect&#39; by presenting it, which=\r\n is seven pages titled&nbsp;&#39;You&#39;re The One&#39;,&nbsp;to about five hundred gr=\r\neat scientific minds at Stuart Hameroff&#39;s &#39;Toward a Science of Consciousnes=\r\ns&#39;. Sponsored by the University of Arizona in Tuscon. I&#39;m proud and dismaye=\r\nd&nbsp;at the dead silence&nbsp;that left most with mouths gaping. About a =\r\nhalf dozen of them voiced appreciation and encouragement, not one negative =\r\ncomment but most avoided any. Nobody&#39;s dening the elephant is in the living=\r\n room, but nobody will talk about him.&nbsp;If you could comment&nbsp;I&#39;d r=\r\neally appreciate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;I am proud to be the One with the opportunity to present the next =\r\nstep in science, which is&nbsp;The Experiment.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;an experim=\r\nent to find why observation changes results by maximizing the effect. It is=\r\n the demanded and natural next step of Quantum physics,&nbsp;based on speci=\r\nfic principles and scientific experimentation.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first innovation is to add the observer to=\r\n The Experiment. Because we have never dealt with this before&nbsp;we&nbsp;=\r\nrefuse to come to terms with this mandatory addition. We&nbsp;first &#39;tried&#39;=\r\n to eliminate and when we found that impossible, to stay separate we &#39;try&#39; =\r\nto minimize&nbsp;instead of maximizing&nbsp;our effect. Now that we know we=\r\n can not be separate, this is the step we must take but have not until now.=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second =\r\nis if consciousness changes results,&nbsp;do results change according to be=\r\nlief as they certainly&nbsp;did in the double slot dilemma that&nbsp;finali=\r\nzed the mess we&nbsp;are&nbsp;in,&nbsp;which herein&nbsp;we are finally&nbs=\r\np;dealing with. Everywhere there are indicators of this, in fact there&nbsp=\r\n;are no answers outside of this perspective, so why not?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is=\r\n the possibility that Quantum physics is how all physics actually works and=\r\n&nbsp;only needs actualizing to be effective,&nbsp;if belief is the focus o=\r\nf&nbsp;consciousness and the creator of all things. As all preliminary inve=\r\nstigations demonstrate this is true, The Experiment will be proved correct =\r\nand will cause a paradigm shift in the perspective of the observer(mass-con=\r\nsciousness).&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This =\r\nchange of perspective comes&nbsp;from the observer considering life through=\r\n the inter-connected big three Quantum laws.&nbsp;We are all the same One, =\r\nthere is no thing outside of us, and we are all and infinite possibilities.=\r\n Which is the interiorization of the exterior view. This effort is the natu=\r\nral genesis of science,&nbsp;the intentions are clear, what this is going t=\r\no find is we are all responsible for the beliefs that create reality.&lt;BR&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following&nbsp;is the aca=\r\ndemic overview, the quotation portion within is offered to The People with =\r\nslight modifications. If One of The People wants to know after reading the =\r\nquotation portion, they are offered &#39;You&#39;re The One&#39; to have and read at th=\r\neir leisure. They are now One of the first hundred monkeys, as all that is =\r\nneeded is wanting to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P align=3D&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Overview an=\r\nd Presentation of &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;The Experiment&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P align=3D&quot;=\r\ncenter&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Question: As consciousness changes results, can results c=\r\nhange to anything wanted if we have a consensus by the observer? If every O=\r\nne is choosing what we all want, will it manifest?&nbsp;This question is&nb=\r\nsp;based on the Quantum fact,&nbsp;we now know we are all the same One outs=\r\nide the field.&nbsp;Therefore we&nbsp;must all want exactly the same things=\r\n at&nbsp;our core.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;Assumption: =\r\nTo work the observer must realize infinite possibilities, meaning anything =\r\nis possible with belief. Anything less is belief in&nbsp;finite possibiliti=\r\nes&nbsp;and its creation. You must realize there is no thing outside of you=\r\n to believe in infinite possibilities, and to accomplish that you must real=\r\nize you are the One.&nbsp;\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
