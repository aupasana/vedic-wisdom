There need n=\r\not be a big or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possible =\r\nexpansion in future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with f=\r\nour pillars on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from ra=\r\nin. The area is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. Clo=\r\nse to it, a small one or two room structure is built to store materials.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nA priest or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he=\r\n should be a sincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifes=\r\ntyle dedicated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, on=\r\ne more in forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chan=\r\ndi homam in the evening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no ido=\r\nls to worship and no other rituals to do.\n=C2=A0\nThis=C2=A0will pretty much=\r\n take up all his time and hence enough money should be arranged to take car=\r\ne of the priest and his family. If the priest is not well-versed in homam o=\r\nr Chandi homam, that is no problem. He can be trained. But, the most import=\r\nant thing is that he should be committed to this and devoted to the Mother.=\r\n If one has the basic simplicity, innocence, devotion=C2=A0and purity, othe=\r\nr things will fall in place by themselves.\n=C2=A0\nBuying of the land and co=\r\nnstruction of room and homa kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time ex=\r\npense. Salary of the priest and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are=\r\n an ongoing expense. This project requires a good amount of money and energ=\r\ny.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAfter a center is established and sadhana=\r\n progresses in each center, slowly the presence of Mother will be establish=\r\ned there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will start making faster progress.=\r\n As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana will generate more and more en=\r\nergy.\n=C2=A0\nAfter establishing 4 other centers, a center in Ujjain is to b=\r\ne started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi homam centers will have a c=\r\natalytic influence on the homam movement and many many people will start do=\r\ning different kinds of homas around the world. This will have a major impac=\r\nt on dharma in the world. That is what he was told.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nI did not want to force or impose on anybody. So this has waited. Wh=\r\nen the time comes, people who will make this happen will come and take char=\r\nge.\n=C2=A0\nTime has probably not yet come for Ujjain. But if there is a vil=\r\nlage in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do this, please consider.

Someone sent me a few snippets from an \ninterview posted on her =\r\nwebsite. Please see below.\n\nIt is interesting that she considers Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa as her guru. It \nis interesting that Ramakrishna told her she=\r\n had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and \nshow what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the =\r\nwhole world will be peace&quot;. This \nis similar to what my guru was told by Di=\r\nvine Mother when she appeared to \nhim during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.=\r\n\n\nShe told him that many people are and will be born who will perform a sho=\r\nrt \nfire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in =\r\nthe \nworld and also make quick spiritual progress individually in that proc=\r\ness. \nShree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along simila=\r\nr \nlines.\n\nMy guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Ch=\r\nandi homam \nshould be established around the world, where Chandi homam is d=\r\none 3 times a \nday. These places do not need to be near any temples or famo=\r\nus places and \ncan be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For examp=\r\nle, there is no \nneed to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual wit=\r\nh bare minimum \nofferings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times e=\r\nveryday. When a \nfew such centres are established, it will apparently lead =\r\nto a chain of \nevents that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n\nThough =\r\nnot 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for \n3 ye=\r\nars in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \nIt =\r\nis the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings \ndeiti=\r\nes to a place. While several ancient temples are without any divine \npresen=\r\nce these days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure \nsouls =\r\nengaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.\n\nAs I men=\r\ntioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam during which \nMother=\r\n appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was \ntaken on=\r\n Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa was within \na fe=\r\nw minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. \nAl=\r\nl of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this significance when \n=\r\nwe decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \nmen=\r\ntion fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are \nsimil=\r\nar to the words of Mother.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. ne=\r\nt\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n&gt; She considers Shri Ramak=\r\nrishna as her\n&gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt;\n&gt; Now h=\r\nere is the very interesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; pasted for yo=\r\nur benefit), from an interview found here\n&gt; http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal=\r\n/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was te=\r\nlling, &quot;You have to go now for\n&gt; our country, and all other country, you ha=\r\nve to go do fire ceremonies\n&gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, and =\r\nat that time the whole\n&gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Her main disci=\r\nple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American descent),\n&gt; that same page d=\r\nescribes his background, how he met her and all that;\n&gt; but another interes=\r\nting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Mi=\r\nddle Asia was arduous at best,\n&gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;=\r\ns interior where he studied\n&gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the=\r\n worship of Chandi and\n&gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primar=\r\ny system of worship\n&gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerities i=\r\nn the process.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a thre=\r\ne year fire ceremony\n&gt; and worship of the Goddess, without setting foot out=\r\nside from the\n&gt; humble temple grounds they established in Martinez, Califor=\r\nnia.&quot;\n&gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1918956995-1235840692=:10829\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-s=\r\nerif&quot;&gt;Dear Narsimhaji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, =\r\nsans-serif&quot;&gt;I am glad to know this and perhaps I will be the lucky person t=\r\no start the first center in India.

There need not be a big or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres o=\r\nf land (for possible expansion in future) and construct a homa kundam built=\r\n in open space with four pillars on the four sides and a high roof on the t=\r\nop to protect from rain. The area is open on all the four sides and covered=\r\n only on the top. Close to it, a small one or two room structure is built t=\r\no store materials.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;A priest or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification =\r\nis that he should be a sincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a si=\r\nmple lifestyle dedicated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the m=\r\norning, one more in forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one=\r\n more Chandi homam in the evening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There =\r\nare no idols to worship and no other rituals to do.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;This&nbsp;will pretty muc=\r\nh take up all his time and hence enough money should be arranged to take ca=\r\nre of the priest and his family. If the priest is not well-versed in homam =\r\nor Chandi homam, that is no problem. He can be trained. But, the most impor=\r\ntant thing is that he should be committed to this and devoted to the Mother=\r\n. If one has the basic simplicity, innocence, devotion&nbsp;and purity, oth=\r\ner things will fall in place by themselves.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D=\r\n2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;Buying of the land and constructi=\r\non of room and homa kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. S=\r\nalary of the priest and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongo=\r\ning expense. This project requires a good amount of money and energy.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;After a center is established and sadhana progresses in each center, =\r\nslowly the presence of Mother will be established there. Once that happens,=\r\n the sadhaka will start making faster progress.

Someone sent me a few snippets from an &lt;BR&gt;intervi=\r\new posted on her website. Please see below.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is interesting that s=\r\nhe considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It &lt;BR&gt;is interesting tha=\r\nt Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and &lt;BR&gt;show what is =\r\ntruth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This &lt;BR&gt;is simila=\r\nr to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to &lt;BR&gt;him du=\r\nring Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She told him that many people ar=\r\ne and will be born who will perform a short &lt;BR&gt;fire ritual on a regular ba=\r\nsis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the &lt;BR&gt;world and also make qui=\r\nck spiritual progress individually in that process. &lt;BR&gt;Shree Maa&#39;s stateme=\r\nnt about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar &lt;BR&gt;lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My gu=\r\nru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam &lt;BR&gt;s=\r\nhould be established around the\n world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;day. These places do not need to be near any temples or famous places=\r\n and &lt;BR&gt;can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, th=\r\nere is no &lt;BR&gt;need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with b=\r\nare minimum &lt;BR&gt;offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times e=\r\nveryday. When a &lt;BR&gt;few such centres are established, it will apparently le=\r\nad to a chain of &lt;BR&gt;events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyd=\r\nay for &lt;BR&gt;3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is =\r\nfantastic! &lt;BR&gt;It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy=\r\n and brings &lt;BR&gt;deities to a place. While several ancient temples are witho=\r\nut any divine &lt;BR&gt;presence these days, new places of divine presence may be=\r\n created by pure &lt;BR&gt;souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dha=\r\nrma in the\n world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata=\r\n Chandi homam during which &lt;BR&gt;Mother appeared and gave instructions to my =\r\nguru on spreading homam was &lt;BR&gt;taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary a=\r\nnd the time of sankalpa was within &lt;BR&gt;a few minutes from the actual Tithi =\r\nPravesha time of the birth anniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All of this was a coincidence a=\r\nnd we were unaware of this significance when &lt;BR&gt;we decided the muhurta. It=\r\n is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did &lt;BR&gt;mention fire ceremonies sp=\r\necifically to somebody and that his words are &lt;BR&gt;similar to the words of M=\r\nother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJ=\r\nC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She considers Shri Ramakris=\r\nhna as her&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snippets from her website&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; pasted for your benefit), from an interview found here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A\n =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonomy_menu/54/86&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was te=\r\nlling, &quot;You have to go now for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our country, and all other country, =\r\nyou have to go do fire ceremonies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and show what is truth, what is d=\r\nignity, and at that time the whole&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world will be peace.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &l=\r\nt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati=\r\n (of American descent),&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that same page describes his background, ho=\r\nw he met her and all that;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but another interesting snippet in there=\r\n:-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middl=\r\ne Asia was arduous at best,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to Ind=\r\nia&#39;s interior where he studied&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with a number of gurus, coming to em=\r\nbrace the worship of Chandi and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the\n yagy=\r\na, as his primary system of worship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and meditation, while undertaki=\r\nng great austerities in the process.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;They un=\r\ndertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremony&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and wo=\r\nrship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humble =\r\ntemple grounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;/snip=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOC=\r\nKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOT=\r\nE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;C=\r\nOLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1918956995-1235840692=:10829--\r\n\n"}}
