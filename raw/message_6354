As Sri Dharma Pravartak=\r\na Acharya explains in this amazingly informative talk, a real brahmana is k=\r\nnown by his inherent qualities of goodness, wisdom, cleanliness, peacefulne=\r\nss, knowledge of the Vedic scriptures, humility, and adherence to Dharma. M=\r\nore, a real brahmana knows Brahman - God. Thus, brahmana initiation is open=\r\n to any man or woman who knows Brahman - regardless of their ethnicity, rac=\r\ne, language, nationality, or any other material factor. There is no such th=\r\ning anywhere in the Vedic scriptures as a &quot;caste&quot; brahmana. \n\nSri Acharyaji=\r\n conclusively explains the nature of a real brahmana with more depth and cl=\r\narity than has ever been presented by anyone else before.\n\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO=\r\n HERE:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dru7tF4YzWPM\n\n\n\nPlease forward this=\r\n important video to every sincere spiritual seeker you know.\n\n\nAum Tat Sat\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
