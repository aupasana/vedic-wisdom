He also will lea=\r\nd a satsang,\nor discourse, on the Hindu religion on the third Thursday of e=\r\nach\nmonth in Lincoln.\n\nThe Nebraska temple is the first in the nation to ha=\r\nve an acharya, or\nresident scholar, which is common at temples in India, sa=\r\nid Ram Bishu,\nchairman of the temple&#39;s religious committee.\n\n&quot;The whole ide=\r\na is to make sure we educate the young people =97 and\nadults =97 in all asp=\r\nects of spirituality,&quot; Bishu said.\n\nDr. Morales, a native of New York, bega=\r\nn studying Hinduism at age 10\nand converted to the Indian religion at age 1=\r\n4. He spent many years in\nintensive study of Hindu scriptures and teachings=\r\n.\n\nAfter living the life of a celibate Hindu monk for six years, he was\nini=\r\ntiated as a Hindu priest in India in 1986.\n\nIn an interview in Lincoln, Dr.=\r\n Morales said he earned a bachelor&#39;s\ndegree in philosophy and theology from=\r\n Loyola University in Chicago\nand master&#39;s and doctoral degrees in Hindu st=\r\nudies from the University\nof Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nHe is now a nationally rec=\r\nognized Hindu teacher whose Web site,\nwww.dharmacentral.com, is one of the =\r\nlargest and most popular Internet\nsites relating to Hinduism.\n\nBeing a U.S.=\r\n-born convert to Hinduism is really not that unusual, he said.\n\n&quot;There are =\r\n1.5 million non-Indian Hindus in the United States,&quot; he\nsaid. &quot;I personally=\r\n call them the `hidden Hindus.&#39;&quot;\n\nHinduism is the traditional faith of Indi=\r\na but has spread throughout\nthe world, he said. It&#39;s the fastest-growing re=\r\nligion in eastern\nEurope and has converts in many other parts of the world.=\r\n\n\nThe Nebraska temple serves about 1,000 families, 95 percent of which\nare =\r\nfrom India. The remaining 5 percent are converts, Dr. Morales said.\n\nAttend=\r\nance at Dr. Morales&#39; two adult classes on Saturdays has been\naveraging 40 p=\r\nercent non-Indians, while the Sunday youth class is 100\npercent Indian.\n\n&quot;Y=\r\nou can be a practicing Hindu and not be a member of a temple,&quot; he\nsaid. &quot;It=\r\n&#39;s a very personal thing =97 what one believes and what one\npractices.&quot;\n\nHe=\r\n is president-acharya of the International Santana Dharma Society.\nSantana =\r\nDharma is the Sanskrit name for Hinduism.\n\nMany westerners are attracted to=\r\n the religion because of experience\nwith yoga or through books or the Inter=\r\nnet, he said.\n\nMost Americans don&#39;t know much about the history and philoso=\r\nphy of\nHinduism, a well-developed belief system that is thousands of years\n=\r\nold, he said.\n\n&quot;Hinduism teaches tolerance and that to attain God and enlig=\r\nhtenment\nis not simply a matter of accepting a dogma but something you have=\r\n to\nwork toward.&quot;\n\nAs a teacher, his goal is to help people along that path=\r\n, he said.\n&quot;The idea of Hinduism is to encourage people but not chastise th=\r\nem.&quot;\n\nBefore coming to Omaha last fall, Dr. Morales taught classes in\nHindu=\r\nism in Madison, Wis. He is one of fewer than 10 non-Indians who\nare recogni=\r\nzed scholars of the Hindu scriptures, Bishu said.\n\nThe Omaha temple, which =\r\nwas consecrated in 2003, has 12 separate\nsanctums where people may show dev=\r\notions to deities from all regions\nof India. Bishu said he knows of no othe=\r\nr American temple that has\nsuch a wide representation of regional forms of =\r\nHinduism. &quot;It&#39;s a\nfully integrated little Indian temple.&quot;\n\nDr. Morales head=\r\ns a staff that includes two resident priests, Damodar\nBhattar and Vidya Sha=\r\nnker, who lead worship at the temple.\n\nAnother priest may be added as Nebra=\r\nska&#39;s Hindu community continues to\ngrow, Bishu said.\n\nReach Bob Reeves at 4=\r\n73-7212 or breeves@....\n\n\nCopyright =A9 2002-2008 Lincoln Journal Star.
