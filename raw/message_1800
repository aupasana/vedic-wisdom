Good that you have started. But, don&#39;t limit yourself to shor=\r\nt version for ever. You do not have to follow short/medium/long version as =\r\nif. You can take bits and pieces and do the homam your way. I have taken fe=\r\nw from longer version, but, predominantly do the medium version. Starting w=\r\nith shorter version is good as you will easily get used to it. After a whil=\r\ne, do look out side the shorter version and adapt your self.\n\n2. I have a s=\r\nlightly different opinion. As Narasimha earlier mentioned, sticking to a ma=\r\nntra is better how ever, if you are drawn naturally to a specific mantra, I=\r\n would advise against opposing it. Don&#39;t analyse much as to why you are dra=\r\nwn to a mantra on a specific mantra. The most important thing is concentrat=\r\nion and devotion. By opposing some thing naturally coming you will more lik=\r\nely get distracted.\n\nDuring my homam, I do manny mantras, how ever, I repea=\r\nt one mantram several times.\n\n1) OM SrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM gaNapatayE var=\r\navarada sarvajanaM mE vaSamAnaya svAhA$\n2) OM ga@NAnAM$ tvA ga@Napa#ti#f3;#=\r\ne8; havAmahE ka@viM ka#vI@nAmu#pa@maSra#vastamaM| jyE#ShTa#rAjaM# brahma#NA=\r\nM brahmaNaspata# A naH# SRu@NvannU@tibhi#ssIda@ sAda#naM || svAhA$|\n3) gaNa=\r\npati atharva SIrShaM\n4) OM harE rAma harE rAma rAma rAma harE harE\nharE kRu=\r\nShNa harE kRuShNa kRuShNa kRuShNa harE harE OM svAhA$\n4) OM harE rAma kRuSh=\r\nNa namaH svAhA$\n5) OM vinAyakAya svAhA$\n6) OM SrImallakShmInArAyaNAbhyAM na=\r\nmaH svAhA$\n7) gAyatri\n8) mRutyunjaya maMtraM\n9) OM namO bhagavatE nArasiMhA=\r\nya svAhA$\n10) OM namO nArasiMhAya svAhA$\n11) OM vajranakhAya vidmahE tikShn=\r\na daMShTrAya dhImahi nannOnArasiMhAya pracOdayAt OM svAhA$\n12) ugraM vIraM =\r\nmahavishNuM jvalaMtaM sarvatO mukhaM nRusiMhaM bhIShaNaM bhadraM mRutyu mRu=\r\ntyuM namAmyahaM svAhA$\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Mitesh,\n&gt; \n&gt; it =\r\nwas a good notes from you. i enjoyed reading your frank thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nama=\r\nste Vinitaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Today, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneously\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;towards the end of the homam and i found myself reciting it &gt;\n&gt; &gt;mentally.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opinion, if you have decided to perform Ganapati Homam, then no=\r\n need to get confused about Mantra Selection during Homam. for Ganapati Hom=\r\nam, Narasimha has suggested to do 3 specific Mantars/Stotra.\n&gt; Bija Mantra,=\r\n Vedic Mantra and Atharvashirsha (pl. Refer the manual)- over and above it =\r\nis perfectly fine to offer Aahutis with &#39;Mritunja Mahamantra or Gayatri Man=\r\ntra or soime other nantra&#39;. I used to offer initially Mritunjaya and Gayatr=\r\ni Mantra Aahuti during Ganapati Homam but now since a couple of months, i h=\r\nave discontinued that and only stick to the 3 suggested above.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one =\r\nperforms the Homam, over period of time the deity will inspire saadhaka wit=\r\nh right mantra and attitude. it is best to live with confusions and pray Ma=\r\nhaGanapati to do anything and everything including removal of doubts. this =\r\nis offcourse my attitude and people need not agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Utpal \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good Question, thanks for this, it would be=\r\n nice to hear more on this subject.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I feel that from one perspecti=\r\nve all mantras do get you to same level\n&gt; &gt; at some point in time, if done =\r\nwith correct bhava and surrender etc ..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What we want is chit shudd=\r\nhi and to get there, there is evidence\n&gt; &gt; people have used different mantr=\r\nas and have reached similar higher levels of conscoiusness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But we=\r\n still have many mantras too and people have very unique and differing opin=\r\nion. Earlier I too felt differently about each mantra and was curious about=\r\n it them, always wanting to do the most potent\n&gt; &gt; and powerful mantra so t=\r\nhat the progress speeds up but off late\n&gt; &gt; I feel differently and agree wi=\r\nth Narasimha and other to stick to\n&gt; &gt; one and that one mantra will do the =\r\ntrick, same with homa also\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did some Lord Ganapati and then here =\r\nand there lord krishna and goddess laxmi devi, lord narasimha dev etc and t=\r\nhen due to winter stopped doing it,\n&gt; &gt; now I am gradually starting or thin=\r\nking about them, may be start with\n&gt; &gt; lord ganapati homa and try to do it =\r\natleast 40 times or so and then\n&gt; &gt; may be observe at that time what is in =\r\nstore in the mind and also the external circumstances.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For lord ga=\r\nnpati one mantra that resonates to me at this time is\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Om Gam Gluam Gan=\r\npataye VighnaVinashine swaha&quot;. Please pardon my spelling errors here. I am =\r\nsure others feel strongly too about other mantras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I feel a lot of=\r\n Lord Ganapati Mantras help removing obstacles, and there may be special ma=\r\nntras for special results or expectations,\n&gt; &gt; and a lot of people feel str=\r\nongly about it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I feel that one cannot escape prarabdha karmas, wh=\r\nen sanchit karmas take the form of prarabdha karmas, sometimes we get good =\r\ndirection and get special mantras and they may help but also at times even =\r\ntrying special mantras one seem to not get any help over prarabdha karma. I=\r\nt is all play of conciousness and unfolding or fruitification of karma.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; May be I digressed and moved in different direction, I thought it is =\r\nimportant to see different mantras in the light of achiving progress in spi=\r\nriruality, overcoming obstacles, and our curiocity at times help us get con=\r\nfused and lost.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do believe one should understand about different=\r\n mantras and firmly pick quickly with conviction one and use that mantra fo=\r\nr some period of time without expecting any results or quick expectations. =\r\nAgain this applies towards progress in spirituality and not for mantras for=\r\n worldly expectations. That is a different thing altogether, for instance s=\r\nomeone wants a child or someone wants to get married or overcome some chall=\r\nenges, there are mantras for it and one should consult experts on mantra sh=\r\nastra, and many times the karmas do play their role and to the extent possi=\r\nble it is better to let it play and be done with it and move forward.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; Mitesh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nvinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pranam!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As sugg=\r\nested by you i have switched over to Ganapati mantra. I picked on &quot;om gam g=\r\nanapataye namah&quot; because it is short and simple. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My curiousit=\r\ny has been aroused about the different &quot;quality&quot; of mantras. The above mant=\r\nra is supposed to be a &quot;moola&quot; mantra and also a &quot;bija&quot; mantra for ganapati=\r\n. Can you explain the significance of this?As a remover of obstacles which =\r\nother mantra would you suggest for ganapati? i am drawn to &quot;aum vakratunday=\r\na hum&quot; also, but do not know how to pronounce the mantra correctly and neit=\r\nher do i know what is the &quot;correct&quot; intonation for this. Should i stick to =\r\none main mantra only? Today, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneously =\r\ntowards the end of the homam and i found myself reciting it mentally. Shoul=\r\nd i resist doing this since you have advised that i should do Ganapati mant=\r\nra at least for a month?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thankyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards and bes=\r\nt wishes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
