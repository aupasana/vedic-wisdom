I wish to call a te=\r\nmple priest but I am confused between Maha sudarshan,Chandi and Mahakali.  =\r\nWithin a span of two months if I ask the priest to perform homam 3 times th=\r\nen are they more fruitful than the one done on a regular basis. \n I am doin=\r\ng Ganpati homam with great devotion but still I see very little difference =\r\nin life. Obviously my path to sprituality is much tougher than others. So w=\r\nhat rules shall I specially need to follow for results to show up. \nAs I ha=\r\nve chronic health issues my meditation is not efficient. Though I keep tryi=\r\nng if a healthy body can give 70% I give only 30%. Hence the question alway=\r\ns comes in my mind are my prayers working?\n\nI can try getting answers from =\r\noutside but once I say I have black magic priests only think of minting mon=\r\ney. People coming in this forum are genuine and hence am looking for help h=\r\nere. Kindly suggest as life is going tough for me. I am willing to work har=\r\nd but don&#39;t know the right approach. \n\nThanks and regards,\n\nOm shanti, shan=\r\nti ,shanti\n\nPM\n\n\n\n\n"}}
