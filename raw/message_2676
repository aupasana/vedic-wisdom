I planned to do the homam weekly on every su=\r\nnday and finished two weeks so far.\n\nHere is how it went.\n\n1st Homam :  Was=\r\n extremely nervous on whether I will be able to sucussfully complete my lon=\r\ng cherished dream of performing Ganapathi homam. committed lot of mistakes =\r\nin mantras ,did not say Svahaa at the right places, lighting fire etc may b=\r\ne because of my nervousness probably , burnt my finger while putting ahuti =\r\ninto the fire (surprisingly unlike most of the other burn wounds , this did=\r\n not last for more than 3 hours.. usually a burn would stay for more than 2=\r\n-3 days...and also i realised that i had burnt my finger only when my wife =\r\npointed it to me.. i assume this is a good sign  :) ).. I sincerely prayed =\r\nduring the Homam conclusion to be forgiven for all the mistakes commited du=\r\nring the homam..\n\n2nd Homam: This time I was very relaxed and took my owm t=\r\nime to make sure that I dont make any mistakes.. the homam fire burnt peace=\r\nfully and I did not hurt myself..I was told by my wife that the room was fu=\r\nll of smoke which made breathing difficult and we even had couple of neighb=\r\nours at our doorsteps enquiring about the smoke. But again surprisingly I n=\r\never felt the slightest of discomfort even though I was nearest to the homa=\r\nm... \n\nSo as told by many members in the group , its only practice that mak=\r\nes one perfect.. I am very happy that I have come across this group and und=\r\ner ur guidance I am sure eveybody will be benefited in  sadhana through hom=\r\nam.\n\nThanks and Regards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
