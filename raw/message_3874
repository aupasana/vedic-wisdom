If priest was aware and still did that, then =\r\nI can\n&gt; understand the consequence.\n\nIf one goes in the path of a tornado, =\r\naware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it=\r\n.\n\nIf the question is of fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthqu=\r\nakes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natu=\r\nral order of the universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an &quot;order&quot;=\r\n. Your actions gets opposite reactions. You experience the fruits of your a=\r\nctions, as determined by the order of nature. A person may happen to be doi=\r\nng what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him.=\r\n If so, there must be a previous karma as a result of which he is placed th=\r\nere at that time.\n\nIn the case of the priest in the story, his mistake is t=\r\nhat he\n slapped a person worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the=\r\n bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing the worship, he should&#39;ve =\r\ngiven the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather tha=\r\nn assuming it was a fool.\n\nSee, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Triling=\r\na Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanat=\r\nha himself. However, others may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body wi=\r\nth some body parts and some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the =\r\nbenefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully. Just because of externa=\r\nl parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.\n\nHitting a person who st=\r\nill has a limited self-identification is one thing and hitting a person who=\r\n has no limited self-identification and identifies with the entire universe=\r\n or with a deity is different.\n\n* * *\n\nIn any case, do not worry about that=\r\n priest that much. For all you know, he may be an\n associate of Shiva who c=\r\name along with Trilinga Swami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may=\r\n have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important r=\r\nole in an interesting divine drama.\n\n* * *\n\nJeevanmuktas may engage in acti=\r\nons that are difficult to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and a=\r\ngenda. They become instruments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The =\r\naction of Trilinga Swami may help several people question, challenge and ov=\r\nercome their biases and learn some important lessons, centuries after he le=\r\nft earth.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and sai=\r\nnts sometimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at =\r\na specific set of people.\n\nThere is nothing wrong in having many deities in=\r\n pooja room and worshipping all. Such people may lead fruitful dharmik live=\r\ns. However, Vimalananda may not be concerned about such people. His teachin=\r\ngs may be\n addressed at some other people to come in the coming years who h=\r\ne has rina with and who are meant to achieve saayujya of some deities and d=\r\no some work. There is an intended audience for every work and no work can b=\r\ne perfect for all audience.\n\nIf the goal is either liberation or a deity&#39;s =\r\ndarshan (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to agree that focusing on o=\r\nne deity is the best thing to do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten d=\r\neities and keep switching. A deity comes when mind and its thoughts are fil=\r\nled with that deity&#39;s name and mantra and other thoughts are driven away fr=\r\nom the mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate several people to striv=\r\ne for vision/company of deities. He probably thought some people he has a r=\r\nina with would come to earth with such a potential.\n\n* * *\n\nThyagaraja did =\r\ncompose songs on many deities. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spen=\r\nt several years chanting Rama&#39;s name and had a darshan. Then\n he composed s=\r\nongs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as different emanations f=\r\nrom Rama. He saw Rama in all.\n\nSame with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deeksh=\r\nitar, Bammera Pothana and others.\n\nWhen one achieves perfection in surrende=\r\nr to one deity, one&#39;s life is made. After that, one will see the same deity=\r\n in all deities even if he worships 100 deities. If one is switching betwee=\r\nn ten deities before that, it may not be helpful in filling the mind with t=\r\nhoughts of any of those deities. Mind sees those deities as different objec=\r\nts and may not fully surrender to any of them. Still, as I said, one may le=\r\nad a fruitful dhaarmik life. That&#39;s fine.\n\nBut, if you really want to taste=\r\n the nectar of complete surrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill =\r\nthe mind with his/her thoughts.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Excellent answers on each thread =\r\nand mother showed her divine\n&gt; grace through you that I am able to find ans=\r\nwers to\n many\n&gt; questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n\nThough I=\r\n had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I am not a realized person.

But contrary to that we find gr=\r\neat saints / composers / poets from India have indeed worshipped many forms=\r\n of the God and were successful in that approach as well. For instance, the=\r\nre is not a single deity form that was not worshipped by Adi Sankara and/or=\r\n Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famous that Muththuswamy Dikshitar was a se=\r\nlf-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he left his mortal coil by singing to Madur=\r\nai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of his disciples. But he composed =\r\nsongs of deep devotion that have immense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Gan=\r\nesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So were many great com=\r\nposers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they were all great advaitis=\r\n and never saw any difference between any form of the God, what soever. Bam=\r\nmera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra\n who\n&gt; translated Bhagavatam, in his o=\r\npening invocatory poems, pays homage to Lord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha=\r\n, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in that order before declaring that he =\r\ngot the divine inspiration from Lord Rama to write the Stories of Krishna! =\r\nWhere is the difference between any form of God here! I wonder. So, I was n=\r\not able to comprehend why Vimalananda accuses many Hindus of having a chaot=\r\nic mind just because their puja mandirams are filled with many photographs/=\r\n idols of different murthis of Almighty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhagar=\r\nu, \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed her divine grac=\r\ne through you that I am able to find answers to many questions that my imma=\r\nture mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of =\r\nthe topics I found disturbing in the first book of Aghora are as follows: \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. On the page 45 it says that\n Telang swami performed the ritual bath=\r\n of Kashi Vishveshwara with his own urine and feces. What could be the comp=\r\nelling reason for this bizarre behavior and why should the priest who slapp=\r\ned him die, because in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in =\r\nthe least! Since you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly distur=\r\nbing things, I hope to find and answer here. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In quite a few places=\r\n, Vimalananda equates changing the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to p=\r\nrostitution, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would =\r\nAdi Sankara compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja =\r\ncomposed in the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata a=\r\ns well. So are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas a=\r\nnd Leelashuka where they wanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama=\r\n in the case of former and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing t=\r\nhat the other\n form is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in =\r\nthe list of Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself bei=\r\nng equally in the love and awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, kr=\r\nishna, ganesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- On Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From:=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Surrender (=\r\nRe: Aghora books..)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, M=\r\narch 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; How to achieve it=\r\n effectivey?\n&gt; \n&gt; If it can be achieved easily, we will not have so many sp=\r\niritual paths and so many sadhanas.

Only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i) know=\r\ns and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how to dispatch r=\r\nnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a\n reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was a gr=\r\neat sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He did so much=\r\n sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and nig=\r\nht. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rares=\r\nt of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle,=\r\n because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows ho=\r\nw to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can =\r\nyou worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the bat=\r\ntle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa so=\r\nmething crazy happened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Kris=\r\nhna was present even before, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prope=\r\nrly.\n this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the Lord loves to play with His genuine=\r\n devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was fu=\r\nrther effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharo=\r\nopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the battle when all the Pandavas went to as=\r\nk the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but w=\r\nho was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... about who was =\r\nresponsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that ma=\r\nn said was that at the beginning of the day he could see\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudar=\r\nshana start out from one end of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that destruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the da=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti =\r\nor Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at His side=\r\n, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna us=\r\ned to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thrivi=\r\nng surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He sa=\r\nid something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thin=\r\ng to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freely\n =\r\nadmitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfool and knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Whatever you ever do in life, just try and be straight in every dealin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have with anybody, give whatever you can, turn away nobo=\r\ndy from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your door, who knows when God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does not mean that one is fatalistic and does nothing, but =\r\nit means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that terrific sadhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana and a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes dar=\r\nkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cha Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being), are es=\r\nsential. Before I met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys who were b=\r\nasically sadhakas themselves, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; used to ask and swear at them, &quot;Yo=\r\nu are blind yourself, how will you lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when y=\r\nou have not seen God yourself face to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you =\r\ntake Time out of the equation (because a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n space frame which runs in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of a=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with patience, then where will God go? God has to=\r\n come, He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mani=\r\nsh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 27, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If yo=\r\nu see the old mail quoted by Hemanth below, it will answer\n your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nquestion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just because a group of people think somethin=\r\ng is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not free them from karma.

As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s dharm=\r\na becomes clearer to one.

Krishna clearly says in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follo=\r\nw someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Following the=\r\n path of dharma basically means engaging in the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action/du=\r\nty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what =\r\nactions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, =\r\nwho\n you affected in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the acti=\r\nons that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the pro=\r\ncess, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts,=\r\n nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that bec=\r\nomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendenci=\r\nes and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, =\r\nbased on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, na=\r\nture wants a\n person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world=\r\n, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; menta=\r\nl tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a being =\r\nmay change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of=\r\n Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eld=\r\ners and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some=\r\n weight.\n&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place an=\r\nd civilization destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcom=\r\ne Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply l=\r\noved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma=\r\n to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again =\r\nin the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishya=\r\ns (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, accordin=\r\ng to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material\n life despite his\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and insp=\r\nire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment a=\r\nnd service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, a=\r\ns per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and =\r\nplace may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying =\r\n&quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma=\r\n&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; of cas=\r\nte (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra w=\r\nho lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi =\r\nlater. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful kin=\r\ng. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically var=\r\nna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words wh=\r\nich tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is=\r\n wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing =\r\nwhat one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is s=\r\nurrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which=\r\n tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what\n is our dharma and follow it sincere=\r\nly. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all t=\r\nhat we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is =\r\nof utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identifica=\r\ntion. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new kar=\r\nmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma i=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment =\r\nand self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the a=\r\nction is\n finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god=\r\n. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousne=\r\nss\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sha=\r\nrper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive=\r\n feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma cl=\r\nearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eas=\r\ny,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not\n following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sens=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if on=\r\ne engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellec=\r\nt and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the w=\r\nords of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take =\r\nthe words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and=\r\n follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused abo=\r\nut what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nrelatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a s=\r\necluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa =\r\ncried and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is=\r\n not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature\n expects from one can err in the jud=\r\ngment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an el=\r\nevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner cor=\r\ne, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set=\r\n of principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma chang=\r\nes from person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from =\r\nplace to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by\n increasing internal purity. By doing vari=\r\nous kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and enga=\r\nging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify =\r\noneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s indiv=\r\nidual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sens=\r\ne of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dines=\r\nh.

If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she will do i=\r\nt or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then they=\r\n will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Ri=\r\nnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be able to break free from this particular chain.

The idea is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* un=\r\nderstands and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic st=\r\nories of wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explain how on=\r\ne can fight and overcome various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n weaknesses that typically bind =\r\none in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will pro=\r\nmote the fighting spirit within one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; There is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fi=\r\nght/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in tha=\r\nt Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to=\r\n overcome it. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overco=\r\nme it. When one realizes Self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the end, irrespective of the pat=\r\nh taken, one\n finally sees that all these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are aspects of a Single=\r\n Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83=\r\n? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have starte=\r\nd to read the Aghora series books by Dr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are =\r\ngood, but Aghora is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to ha=\r\nve mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means =\r\nterrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord S=\r\nhiva is Aghora. A true=C3=83? Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations =\r\nof god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is per=\r\nmanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant\n &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lo=\r\nrd Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is =\r\nto remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary illusi=\r\non and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we =\r\nremind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? W=\r\nhen someone praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done =\r\nand we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves=\r\n &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tem=\r\nporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and w=\r\nant\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. Th=\r\nis thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so b=\r\neautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the =\r\nmind not dwell on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are ab=\r\nout to feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam sat=\r\nya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is re=\r\nal. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Agh=\r\nora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects=\r\n all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinki=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and fo=\r\ncus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practically. If feces\n and fruit are both imperm=\r\nenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the=\r\n Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may=\r\n try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=83? But, please remember t=\r\nhat eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the fo=\r\nod being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation=\r\n of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eati=\r\nng feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind=\r\n is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will =\r\nnot be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certai=\r\nn properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be t=\r\nhinking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a veda=\r\nntin also has the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses whe=\r\nn eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consumi=\r\nng Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly=\r\n cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver f=\r\nrom the focus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an =\r\naghora are telling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb=\r\n that truth into every thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting=\r\n himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very =\r\nbad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic v=\r\nerse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty=\r\n laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb =\r\nthe mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells =\r\non the nice (or even\n not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other food=\r\n, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to a=\r\nbsorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so dis=\r\ngusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nxperience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficul=\r\nt tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely bec=\r\nause of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeed=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n *=C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose som=\r\neone is doing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet hav=\r\ning a weakness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or =\r\ngetting sexual thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is caus=\r\ning guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce=\r\n celibacy and keep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that i=\r\ns nor a formula for\n overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such th=\r\noughts may still come and distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibac=\r\ny for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the=\r\n mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to a=\r\nn extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascinati=\r\non from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two diffe=\r\nrent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine t=\r\nhem into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure.\n Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then d=\r\noes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in=\r\n sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana is being made impure.
