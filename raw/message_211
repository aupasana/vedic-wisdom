Some people cannot see beyond a man&#39;s name and=\r\n religion and hence cannot recognize when a great celestial being is born i=\r\nn a different religion.\n \nSwami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in t=\r\nhe &quot;Aghora&quot; series books, is somebody who achieved the highest states of co=\r\nnsciousness. He received a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. Acco=\r\nrdinging to him, Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyukta and Ra=\r\njput King Prithviraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim inv=\r\naders at the border of India. When Muslims finally conquered India, he was =\r\nreborn as one of them and put breaks on their aggression and changed their =\r\nways.\n \nIn that age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed temple=\r\ns, libraries and other relics of native religion and culture. They beheaded=\r\n Hindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu women and they beheaded de=\r\nfeated kings. They just tried to wipe out the native religion and culture a=\r\nnd replace with theirs. Akbar slowed down the barbarism and aggression and =\r\npromoted tolerance and integration. He stopped the forced conversions, rape=\r\ns and beheadings of Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples and libra=\r\nries. He talked about respecting other religions while following one&#39;s own =\r\nreligion. He even took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished a spe=\r\ncial tax on Hindus based on religion. He was a man of great character, conv=\r\niction and principles and was utterly fearless. He had affinity for Rajputs=\r\n and was even born in a Rajput family and spent early years there. He displ=\r\nayed the samskaras and instincts of a refined and cultured Rajput more than=\r\n those a of Mughal king - he was so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Hu=\r\nmayun and step-brother Adham.\n \nHe used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morn=\r\ning and then participate in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to=\r\n our homam) and then do a namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unh=\r\neard of from any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!).=\r\n Towards the end of his life, he even started his own religion, which was b=\r\nased on his realization and is quite noble. He was a spiritually elevated s=\r\noul. Irrespective of the religion one follows, one deserves our respect and=\r\n admiration if one embodies the spirit of sanatana dharma in one&#39;s thoughts=\r\n and actions.\n \nAkbar was a true hero - a being who came down from a higher=\r\n loka to fulfil a certain mission with the blessings of rishis. His contrib=\r\nution to the safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be judged from what h=\r\narm his fellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana dharma. His contribution is to=\r\n be judged from what *more* harm to sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If h=\r\ne had not come, I have no doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered mu=\r\nch much more than it did. That was not the wish of rishis and that is why t=\r\nhey sent somebody to alter the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortun=\r\nate that those who see the goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji cann=\r\not see the goodness of Akbar simply because he was a Muslim.\n \nIt is unfort=\r\nunate that some Hindus are equating Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric=\r\n Muslim kings. Who should be (was) a friend of Hindus is being portrayed as=\r\n an enemy and being shot down. Instead, we should promote his story and ins=\r\npire more people to be like him. He was a great inspirational figure then a=\r\nnd should be now too.\n \nThe epic movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is a very good movie a=\r\nbout one of the greatest and most dharmik emperors of India. The director a=\r\nnd actor did justice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad a=\r\nbout the mud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. Please=\r\n do not assassinate the character of Akbar.\n \nIf you want, please make movi=\r\nes of the same caliber and cinematic excellence on great Hindu heroes such =\r\nas Chatrapati Shivaji, Prithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka=\r\n, Salivahana, Ashoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, Ra=\r\nmakrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there is no ne=\r\ned to denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.\n \nThese are my 2 cents on the f=\r\nire over Jodha Akbar.\n \nBest regards,Narasimha-----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homamSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdomFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.netFree =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.orgSri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org-----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nNamask=\r\narThis is an awareness drive to awake people to boycott movie &#39;Jodhaa Akbar=\r\n&#39;.The movie Jodhaa Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt by a mischi=\r\nevous producer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick bucks by deni=\r\ngrating and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people.
