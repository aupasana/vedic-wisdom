I am striving hard t=\r\no continuing my excellence in spiritual saadhana. Apart from vedic-wisdom g=\r\nroup I also read various websites regularly to full fill my quest and enhan=\r\nce understanding of Spiritual Dimension. Right now I am doing Chanting and =\r\nPaath  and the total time I spend is around 3 hrs 30 minutes (1.5 for Chant=\r\n and 2 hrs for reading spiritual materials) in a day consistently.  I have =\r\nimmense desire to be in communion with almighty in all day with more deeper=\r\n level .\n\n\nMy query is about the Chanting I am practicing for 1 hrs and 30 =\r\nminutes. Some time I feel that I should chant one deity name instead more t=\r\nhan one. I start my chant with Kuldevi thn Shree Gurudev Dutta thn Om hum h=\r\nanumate namhe followed by Paath of Shree Vishnu Sahastranaam. I also chant =\r\nOm Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaye before commencing the said Paath with small pr=\r\nayer to every deity I am chanting to. The Kuldevi and Dutta chant I do for =\r\nAncestors, the Hanmaan ji chant I am doing as per recommendation of my Astr=\r\nologer after seeing my horoscope and VS I am doing for overall well being o=\r\nf my family and for my past bad karmas as well as for my future lives.\n\n\nWi=\r\nth this letter I am seeking kind guidance for my dilemma as I always &quot;Break=\r\n&quot; the rhythm of my mind when one chant over (I end tht as per my wish no co=\r\nunting) and  begin with the next one. In totality I am giving and wanting t=\r\no increase the time frame for the chanting(s) but sub-consciously feel that=\r\n I am changing  pattern and holding back my mind submerging  in intense lev=\r\nels.\n\n\nI know this is personal query and a long letter and seek apology if =\r\nany inconvenience caused to you sir.\n\n\nRespectfully yours,\nvishwas\n\n\n\n"}}
