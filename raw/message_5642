In the process of doing the nyasa, one is converting ones human bod=\r\ny to become fit to receive the mantra(actually, the Devatha). In addition, =\r\none receives protection while doing japa.\n\nIn each one of these, the hand n=\r\needs to be placed with the appropriate mudra on the place( Hridaya, Shiraha=\r\n, Shika, Kavacha mudra and the netra followed by the astra mudra and the ci=\r\nrcular movement.\n\nThe nyasa needs to be done at least once before the japa/=\r\nhoma etc. The nyasa usually comes along with rishi nyasa, kara nyasa and ot=\r\nher nyasas which would depend on the mantra and parampara..\n\nNormally the o=\r\nrder is :\n\n1. Samkalpa\n2. Rishi etc recital\n3. Rishi nyasa( Rishi Chandas D=\r\nevatha etc)\n4. Kara nyasa\n5.

This is the first law of \n&gt; &gt;Karma.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Giving a potentially life-altering astrological reading is an act=\r\nion that will \n&gt; &gt;have a reaction. Doing so for financial rewards, pre-dete=\r\nrmined (fee) or \n&gt; &gt;completely left to the client (dakshina), will further =\r\ncomplicate the equation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, giving astrological readings, freely=\r\n or for a fee (including &quot;recommended&quot; \n&gt; &gt;dakshina) or for a dakshina (i.e=\r\n. totally voluntary), is not the only action we \n&gt; &gt;engage in. We engage in=\r\n so many actions, some better and some worse.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One with bad vaasana=\r\nas (mental conditioning) engages in wrong actions or in \n&gt; &gt;correct actions=\r\n with wrong attitude, and pays for it later. Who are we to tell \n&gt; &gt;people =\r\nwhat to do? Can we convert the whole world into gods or make everyone \n&gt; &gt;g=\r\nod-realized? People will evolve spiritually at their own pace, determined b=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt;the the density of the kaarmic baggage they carry.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you co=\r\nnsider someone to be your sishya in Jyotish, you may tell the person \n&gt; &gt;wh=\r\nat to do. With other people, you have to maintain respect and assert your \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;views gently, delicately and inoffensively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In a different private thread, someone wrote the following to me=\r\n yesterday. It \n&gt; &gt;may be relevant when we are discussing astrology and fee=\r\ns. I am not an emotional \n&gt; &gt;person, but this made my eyes wet. If I was th=\r\nere, I would&#39;ve washed the feet of \n&gt; &gt;this beggar and sprinkled the water =\r\non my head. This kind of pure thinking is so \n&gt; &gt;difficult to find now-a-da=\r\nys...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Once when I was in Alandi, I heard two blind beggars talk i=\r\nnside the temple \n&gt; &gt;presmises. One of them said that he has recently been =\r\ninitiated by someone into \n&gt; &gt;the Varkari path and he can now sing Abhags (=\r\nspiritual songs in Marathi) in the \n&gt; &gt;company of other initiates. He was v=\r\nery happy. The other beggar asked him, why \n&gt; &gt;don&#39;t you sing the abhangs w=\r\nhen you beg. You will get more money, your singing \n&gt; &gt;is terrific. The fir=\r\nst man replied that he cannot use songs of God for earning \n&gt; &gt;money, even =\r\nif the money is coming through begging. God is beyond everything \n&gt; &gt;else. =\r\nBegging is for my dharma, but signing is for God. I will not mix the two.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;When I heard it (&lt;deleted&gt; was also there) I was stunned. This com=\r\ning from a \n&gt; &gt;begger! This created a strong impact on my mind.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;S=\r\nuch is the power of Gyaneshwar Maharaj who moulds the consciousness of all =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;who go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, Krishna temple at Alandi, where Gyaneshwar=\r\n Maharaj is believed to be still \n&gt; &gt;meditating in the underground chamber =\r\n(I have no doubt about it), is one of the \n&gt; &gt;most spiritually charged plac=\r\nes I have been to. Tiruvannamalai, Girnar, Mayapur \n&gt; &gt;and Dakshineshwar ar=\r\ne some other places that are alive with spiritual energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
