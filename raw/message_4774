The questions pertain to Mathura Bhakti tradition as w=\r\nell as some very popular works of great sages and saints of our beloved Bha=\r\nrata Varsha. \n\n1. There is this tradition of envisioning the lord (paramatm=\r\na) as the only purusha and all the humanity (various jeevatmas) as women an=\r\nd thereby jeevatmas seeking union with paramatma culminating in salvation. =\r\nWe have seen examples of great saints like Chaitanya Maha Prabhu who were s=\r\ntalwarts of this path. And this explains the Krishna tatva in Srimad bhagav=\r\natam as well in gopika vastra apaharana / rasaleela episodes. While I think=\r\n I understand this concept very well, I find it very hard to explain it 1. =\r\nTo someone who is foreign to our culture and 2. To people who intentionally=\r\n malign the image of our rich Vedic traditions and 3. To kids who might com=\r\ne up with questions on this subject. What is the best way to explain it in =\r\nthese situations? \n\n2. In Lalitha Sahasranama stotra as well as Saundarya L=\r\nahari stotra, Veda Vyasa and Adi Sankara respectively have described the mo=\r\nther goddess in a very detailed way detailing on specific body parts. Yes, =\r\nundoubtedly they have envisioned the formless nirguna Brahman as their belo=\r\nved mother, but where from is this tradition anga-anga varnana (part - by p=\r\nart description) of mother? While I have no problem in accepting those and =\r\ninclude those in my daily prayers, how do we sensibly / convincingly explai=\r\nn these to the above groups of people? \n\nNot only in these, I find referenc=\r\ne to woman&#39;s body parts quite liberally in most of the ancient sanskrit / t=\r\nelugu literature and I want to know why? Examples are Sri Krishna Ashtakam,=\r\n Venkateshwara stotra that follows soon after Suprabhata (kamala kucha choo=\r\nchuka kumkumatO ....) and so on. \n\nPardon me if I am sounding naive... But =\r\nhaving to teach some of these to a teenage kid... I really do not know how =\r\nto approach, in case of any questions! \n\nRegards, \n\nNagraj\n\n\n"}}
