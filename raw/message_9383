The japa I do is Manasik only (inau=\r\ndible).\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kris_iyr&quot; &lt;kris_iyr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; i am not a big expert but i do know that only some deities ca=\r\nn be invoked irrespective of the physical purity. the bed / bedding/ unwash=\r\ned clothes etc are all considered impure. you can only do upasana of tara m=\r\nahavidya lying on bed. there are other forms of some deities you can safely=\r\n do lying on bed. this wll also count towards mantra purushcharana. \n&gt; if y=\r\nou do manasika japa then it is believed the physical condition does not mat=\r\nter no matter where you are. this is also known as ajapa japa. the secret b=\r\nehind is that death can come anywhere (even if you are in the toilet). henc=\r\ne you can do mantra japa but typically this is mot counted  towards purushc=\r\nharana of a mantra. the benefits of ajapa are immense and is beneficial for=\r\n kundalini awakening. a sadhaka must at all times do the ajapa of his/ her =\r\nmoolamantra.  there is no harm but the merit is somewhat slower. thats all.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; if you must lie down amd do japa i would advise using a straw mat an=\r\nd a washed dhoti / saree instead of plllow and avoid reused / unwashed line=\r\nn..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sillylallypally&quot; &lt;sill=\r\nylallypally@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sirs,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; thanks a lot for helpful replie=\r\ns! My specific concern is whether it is &#39;spiritually wrong&#39; to do mantra ja=\r\npa lying on bed, or standing up, etc..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;sillylallypally&quot; &lt;sillylallypally@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sirs, tho=\r\nse of you experienced in Mantra Sadhana kindly reply \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to this. Is it =\r\nok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfortably? Or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should it always=\r\n be in a a seated positon? Because, lying on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bed comfortably, I can =\r\ndo far more number of rounds than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting up. Also, I can concentrat=\r\ne entirely on mantra being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chanted that way. Also I read somewhere A=\r\nnga nyasa, Kara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nyasa etc.are not necessary, just chanting the speci=\r\nfied \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra is adequate. What&#39;s your opinion on this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
