In=\r\n homam, you are \ncalling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you ar=\r\ne calling pitris and \nthe medium is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to =\r\nall people irrespective of \nwhether watery signs/planets are strong or fier=\r\ny signs/planets in their \nhoroscope.\n=A0\nIn homam, devatas come in fire and=\r\n burn your blocking \nkarmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water=\r\n and free you from vasanas \n(conditioning of the mind) that were karmically=\r\n inherited from them. If you have \ngenes from (and rina with) an ancestor w=\r\nho was lustful or angry or jealous and \nthe consciousness of the deceased a=\r\nncestor is still having those thoughts, you \nwill also suffer from such tho=\r\nughts due to the connection and may even commit \nsome bad karmas because of=\r\n the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina \nby working on giving =\r\na rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness \nis attached to=\r\n a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will \nnot affe=\r\nct your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a \nstr=\r\nong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad \nk=\r\narmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual \nprogress.\n=A0\nDevata=\r\ns are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their \nself-identification is to =\r\nwhat is known as soul and represented by Sun. They \nwork on your individual=\r\n soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are \ngrosser forms of =\r\nconsciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their \nself-identificati=\r\non is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You \nmay note tha=\r\nt Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora \nchart of a=\r\nstrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them \nrespectively.\n=A0\n=\r\nDevas and pitris have different ways of working and \ninfluencing us and hel=\r\nping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all \nof us and have a=\r\n role to play in our spiritual evolution.

If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness \n=\r\nis attached to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness =\r\nwill \nnot affect your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to =\r\ncut off a \nstrong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously co=\r\nmmitted bad \nkarmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual \nprogre=\r\nss.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their \nsel=\r\nf-identification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They \n=\r\nwork on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris=\r\n are \ngrosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. T=\r\nheir \nself-identification is with what is known as mind and represented by =\r\nMoon. You \nmay note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris =\r\nin the hora \nchart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for t=\r\nhem \nrespectively.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Devas and pitris have different ways of wor=\r\nking and \ninfluencing us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are r=\r\nelevant to all \nof us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. W=\r\norshipping devas in \nfire and satisfying pitris in water are very important=\r\n.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;------------ --------- =\r\n-----&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Best \nregards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;br&gt;Do \na=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Do \nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n/ tarpana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: \n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free \nJyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedica=\r\nstro. home.comcast. net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Free \nJyotish software (Windows): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;=\r\nnofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri \nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- \n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3DJyotishGroup@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, \nRamakrishnan Krishnamurth=\r\ny &lt;ramki108@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear \nNarasimha,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks for this valuable manual. Could you \nenlighten me on the =\r\ndifference between Pitri Tarpana and Shraddham? I believe \nShraddham is per=\r\nformed once a year on the thithi of demise of one&#39;s father (to \nbe performe=\r\nd by the eldest son). There are some variants such as performing it \nduring=\r\n the Shraddha Paksham instead of on the actual thithi, every year. Also, \nh=\r\nave heard of a Gaya Shraddham, which is to be performed once in a lifetime,=\r\n and \nwhich makes it unnecessary to perform yearly Shraddham subsequently. =\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Have tried to search for material on this but have=\r\n not \nsucceeded so far. At least if you can provide information on some sou=\r\nrces, it \nwould be a great help.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks and regards,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; \nRam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- On Fri, 12/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &l=\r\nt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now a Vish=\r\nnu sahasra naama \nhomam manual is available. It contains a very short proce=\r\ndure for Vishnu sahasra \nnaama homam. It is very detailed and pretty much a=\r\nnybody can follow it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Those who regularly chant Vishnu sa=\r\nhasra naama stotram should be able \nto perform a homam if they spend an ext=\r\nra 10 minutes, after a little practice. \nFor those who are pressed for time=\r\n and yet want to do a homam, a super-short \nprocedure involving one verse i=\r\ns also given.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The manual is \navailable in English language=\r\n, with mantras given in Sanskrit/Hindi, English, \nTelugu, Kannada or Malaya=\r\nlam scripts.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In addition to this \nmanual, manuals for Maha=\r\nganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Krishna homam, Shiva \nhomam, Mahalakshmi hom=\r\nam, Sani homam and Kuja homam are available. More will be \ncoming later.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Chanting Vishnu&#39;s 1000 names is very powerful in \nthis age. =\r\nIt is the best antidote for many problems, material and spiritual. \nFire of=\r\n a reasonable size augments the effect. The philosophy of fire ritual is \ne=\r\nxplained in the manual.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; This is a part of the effort to en=\r\nable \na community of sadhakas who worship various deities in fire, as per t=\r\nhe command \nof the divine Mother to my spiritual master at Kalikambal templ=\r\ne in Chennai in \nMarch 2006.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Please go to the homam websit=\r\ne below to download \nthe manuals. It is hoped that spiritual sadhakas inter=\r\nested in homam will \nbenefit from this and also help in increasing collecti=\r\nve dharma in this world \nwith their contribution. Please feel free to sprea=\r\nd this link among interested \npeople.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Any philosophical or=\r\n practical questions on homam or \nany spiritual sadhana can be discussed on=\r\n the yahoogroup vedic-wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&gt; \n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Naras=\r\nimha&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n\n\t \n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr=\r\n&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;hr size=3D1&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://sg.rd.yahoo.com/aa/mail=\r\n/domainchoice/mail/signature/*http://mail.promotions.yahoo.com/newdomains/a=\r\na/&quot;&gt; New Email names for you! &lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\nGet the Email name you&#39;ve alway=\r\ns wanted on the new @ymail and @rocketmail.&lt;br&gt;\nHurry before someone else d=\r\noes!\r\n--0-534703678-1244868135=:7820--\r\n\n"}}
