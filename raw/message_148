It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n \n=\r\nIt is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedic scholars,=\r\n pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorre=\r\nctly.\n \nOf course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the=\r\n spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation =\r\nis a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Ved=\r\na mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most =\r\ncomplete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can=\r\n memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experienc=\r\ne&quot; a mantra.\n \nOver the next few months, I will write my views on correct p=\r\nronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think that cor=\r\nrect pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of th=\r\ne errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore =\r\nmy writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing=\r\n your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my s=\r\nuggestions if you find them appropriate.\n \n*        *        *\n \nTake the &quot;=\r\nt&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sah=\r\nasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. =\r\nThey change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is =\r\na reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nev=\r\nertheless.\n \nIn &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/aks=\r\nhara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at =\r\nthe end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, ch=\r\nanges the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience s=\r\nomething when meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the m=\r\nantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n \nAkshara means &quot;unperished&quot;.=\r\n Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have jus=\r\nt a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara=\r\n and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (=\r\nwithout adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the list=\r\nener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.\n \nI=\r\nn &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no=\r\n praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowe=\r\nl &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot;=\r\n is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, =\r\nit is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise =\r\ndifficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound wi=\r\nthout praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n \nThis makes people add some vow=\r\nel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in betwee=\r\nn them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It=\r\n suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n \nProbably, some big=\r\n teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of=\r\n itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students would not get =\r\nconfused when learning. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu=\r\n&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, tha=\r\nt became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.\n \nIf you pronounc=\r\ne the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot;=\r\n at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an=\r\n vowel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prach=\r\nodayaat&quot;.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhat I said about words ending in consona=\r\nnts applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly=\r\n encountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There als=\r\no, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up chan=\r\nging the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is al=\r\nso wrong.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha=\r\n&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (a=\r\ns in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha =\r\nand dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is different. It =\r\nis possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound because of t=\r\nheir inability to see the dot and others started following. Now pronouncing=\r\n tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the odd=\r\n person out.\n \nSanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols=\r\n for the same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letter=\r\ns &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pronoun=\r\nce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspirat=\r\nion to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n \nIn the sankalpa before many p=\r\noojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhy=\r\nartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human exis=\r\ntence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfill=\r\ning desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronou=\r\nncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;h=\r\nalf of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment=\r\n&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankal=\r\npa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many many trained pries=\r\nts!\n \nWhen you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to t=\r\nhe difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them different=\r\nly. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensur=\r\ne that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere are=\r\n several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pr=\r\nonunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the =\r\nnext few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n \nPlease give me your co=\r\nnsideration and take my input into consideration in altering your pronuncia=\r\ntion (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I am sa=\r\nying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can understand that. I =\r\nam not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She inspired =\r\nme to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are SOME w=\r\nho are destined to change their pronunciation based on my views. That is wh=\r\ny I am writing these mails.\n \nIf you do not like this discussion, I am sorr=\r\ny and just ignore this idiot!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.com=\r\ncast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0275_01C82899.4A300EF0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3199&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once said that ev=\r\nen Vedas \nare corrupted these days.

Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha \nkaama moks=\r\nha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and \nmok=\r\nsha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means \n=\r\n&quot;half a human&quot;.
