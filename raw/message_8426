One \nwho does not know advanced mathematics may not know what &quot;differential \nequation&quot; means. He may think that differential means &quot;relating to \ndifferences&quot; and &quot;equation&quot; means &quot;equating or making equal&quot;. He may \nthink that &quot;differential equation&quot; means &quot;removing differences and \nchanging different things to become equal&quot;. Of course, one knowing \nmathematics knows that that is nonsense.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen we use words to communicate, we acquire an understanding of what \ndifferent words mean, through correlating previous experiences with \nwords being used by people around us during or after an experience. When \nsomeone describes something we have absolutely no clue about, we may \ntotally miss the point and acquire a wrong (or superficial) \nunderstanding (as in the above analogy). When it comes to god and \nspirituality, this is particularly likely. Different people have \ndifferent understanding of some keywords we often use.\n\n*        *        *\n\nFirst, take the word God. If one person values smartness and abilities, \nhis notion of God may be a super-being who is very smart and highly \ncapable. If another person values control and power, his notion may be a \npowerful being who is controlling everyone. If another person values \ndiscipline and orderliness, his notion may be an impassionate \nsuper-being who maintains order in the word. If another person values \nlove and compassion, his notion may be a super-being who loves all \nbeings. Some of these notions are quite conflicting!\n\nWhen we talk about God and spirituality, our notions of God find a way \ninto our words, language, tone and even sub-text. That may sometimes \nmake someone whose notions are different jump up. When something \ninexpressible or infinite is expressed in finite words (or, at another \nlevel, when people discuss what they have no direct experience of), such \nconflicts and confusions are to be expected.\n\n*        *        *\n\nSuppose a book talks about the great importance of being veera (brave) \nin spiritual sadhana. The book may mean being brave in encountering \none&#39;s internal weaknesses and conditioning. But one may see the word \nveera as hinting at being externally brave and aggressive with others. \nOne may think he is following the book, but end up doing something else. \nIn another case, one may understand the subtleties and be working on \novercoming inherent self-centeredness and weaknesses such as jealosy, \ngreed, anger etc. Yet, use of words like &quot;veera&quot; by that person may \noffend someone else valuing compassion and love and seeing the word \nveera as being aggressive and uncompassionate towards others.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI can give many examples. The bottomline is that we are on thin ice when \ndiscussing very subtle concepts like god and spiritual progress. Fools \nrush where wise tread carefully. Most of us (don&#39;t mean to offend \nanyone, this includes me too) are fools who want to talk too much \ninstead of listening more.\n\nMy main message here is that misunderstandings are to be expected. We \ncan never use words to replicate the thinking in our minds in other \nminds. Tottally different thinking may be induced by the same words in \ndifferent minds. So, be patient and compassionate when you encounter \nviews that make no sense to you. Always give the benefit of doubt and \ndon&#39;t jump to conclusions or get provoked and become aggressive or \nconfrontational. Then, there is SOME chance of finding a common ground \noneday.\n\nHope I made some sense!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n"}}
