To exchange our id=\r\neas and \nexperiences is really exciting sometime. There was a time when I w=\r\nas \ndoing Gayatri Mantra constantly. Now I am doing only Thakur&#39;s Dixa \nman=\r\ntra and after reading your articles I have again started Chandi \nPath daily=\r\n. We really experience some sort of energy within us. \n&gt; I will narrate one=\r\n of my experiences. In 1976/77 I was=C2=A0reciting \nChandi Path daily befor=\r\ne Shri Thakur&#39;s Photo kept in the Pooja \n(worship)cupboard. I was closing t=\r\nhat cupboard after worshipping. At \nthat time I was living in=C2=A0a single=\r\n=C2=A0room only as I was newly \ntransferred from Dwarka to Ahmedabad. One d=\r\nay one lady of 35 came to \nme to show her horoscope. She was Gujarati but w=\r\nas living in USA. \nAfter some discussion on astrology she suddenly went to =\r\ntrance and \nstarted saying me that &quot;I hear Mantras of Chandi Path from that=\r\n \ncorner. I see some white blue rays are coming from that cupboard.&quot; I \nwas=\r\n surprised to hear these words as my Pooja Cupboard was closed and \nshe was=\r\n not knowing that I was doing daily Chandi Path=C2=A0in that \ncorner. She w=\r\nas also reading Auras and said to me that=C2=A0&#39;I am seeing \nPurple and Blu=\r\ne coloured Aura coming from your body.&#39;\n&gt; I asked her how you got this know=\r\nledge? She said that she was \nchanting &#39;=C2=A0Om Gam Ganapataye Namah&#39;=C2=\r\n=A0 Mantra constantly from \nher=C2=A0childhood. \n&gt; This experience made my =\r\nfaith towards Chandi Path more strong. \n&gt; Dr.Ashwin Rawal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, =\r\n14/12/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

I finished=\r\n the homam and was \nabout to offer poornaahuti. There are a few Vedic mantr=\r\nas that I \nnormally read before poornaahuti. The fire was burning very brig=\r\nht. I \nclosed my eyes, kept the poornaahuti on my head and started to chant=\r\n \nthe mantras. But suddenly I got this palpable feeling that the Mother \nwa=\r\ns standing in front of me in the fire and asking me to hurry up. It \nfelt v=\r\nery strongly like she was saying &quot;enough with those mantras. \nThey do not m=\r\natter now. Just give me the poornaahuti, NOW.&quot; I did not \nthink much. I sur=\r\nrendered fully to Her as manifested in my mind. It \nmay just be the imagina=\r\ntion of a fool, but I surrendered to Her as \nShe existed in my mind at that=\r\n time. I left the standard mantras and \njust said &quot;om aim\n&gt;  hreem kleem ch=\r\naamundaayai vichche vaushat&quot; and offered the dry \ncoconut in fire with eyes=\r\n closed still.

Af=\r\nter doing it daily for \na few months, I finally got down to the original ta=\r\nsk - teaching \nNarayan. I chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose=\r\n. In \nhindsight, I made the correct choice, as many people in addition to \n=\r\nNarayan are able to do homam using the manual now! I and many other \npeople=\r\n have benefited (and will benefit). However, as far as my mind \nconcerned, =\r\nall this started for Narayan! When it was time for Narayan \nto start doing =\r\nhomam, many people across the world started with him. \nWhat a fortunate sou=\r\nl..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell m=\r\ne at the \nonset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and men=\r\ntal \nstate would&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I would&#39;ve =\r\n\nbeen more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only thing I \nwas to=\r\nld was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived at the \ncorrect bala=\r\nnce and also wrote it down without many pretensions. The \nwhole effort ende=\r\nd up being more saattwik and I really benefited from \nthe exercise. If I ha=\r\nd known the full story, it would have had more \nrajas given my mental state=\r\n then and I would not have had made the \nsame progress I made, while prepar=\r\ning myself to teach homam to \nNarayan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me the full story o=\r\nnly when I was better prepared to \nhandle the information and, of course, I=\r\n added it to the preface of \nthe manual as asked by him then.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that can \nwre=\r\nak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day in the spr=\r\ning of the same year, I decided to spend a whole \nday meditating with Gayat=\r\nri mantra during the coming weekend. The \ninspiration came out of nowhere a=\r\nnd I immediately latched on to it. \nWhen I told Manish, he only said &quot;good,=\r\n go ahead and do it&quot;. I \nstarted before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. E=\r\nxcept for 3-4 \nbreaks of 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small=\r\n lunch \nand another 10 min break for another bath at dusk, I was basically =\r\n\nsitting in the same place and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was \na ve=\r\nry good experience. I was in a very nice state at the end of the \nday.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I noticed on the next day that the previous day was Akshaya \nTriteeya (Vai=\r\nsakha Sukla Triteeya). It is considered a very \nauspicious day and it is be=\r\nlieved that spiritual sadhana on that day \nis 1000 times more powerful than=\r\n on other days. Though I had not \nnoticed it before, I picked a perfect day=\r\n for the sadhana. I was \nexcited. When I mentioned this to Manish with exci=\r\ntement a few days \nlater, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I d=\r\nid not tell \nyou because knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have=\r\n been \nexcited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement=\r\n \nwould&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more rajas into the \nsadhan=\r\na.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was absolutely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a \ns=\r\nadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and limited the mental focus \non th=\r\ne mantra. If I was aware that I was doing this sadhana on a \npowerful day, =\r\nit would&#39;ve increased the pride and excitement, brought \nin rajas and reduc=\r\ned the saattwik focus on mantra further. Ego is a \nvery dangerous entity. E=\r\nven after one makes excellent progress, it \ncan suddenly return and pull on=\r\ne down! After hearing Manish&#39;s words, \nI introspected and found that my ego=\r\n was still alive and kicking and \nthat he was wise not to feed it with more=\r\n delicious food!\n&gt; \n&gt; Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tel=\r\nl them what is \nuseful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who ha=\r\nve a guru \n(or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and p=\r\noint \nit out, so that they can weed it out through further introspection \na=\r\nnd weaken it through conscious effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember one more =\r\nsimilar incident. Before the shata chandi homam \nin early 2006, a priest we=\r\n respect a lot took me to a Siddha (a \nperfected/advanced soul). When he lo=\r\noked at me, he mentioned the name \nof one of the saptarshis and said that I=\r\n very close to him and that I \nwould do some important work in this birth.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He \nimmedia=\r\ntely became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more \nidentity? Yo=\r\nur ego is already strong with the identity of &#39;Narasimha, \nthe Sanskrit sch=\r\nolar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the \nengineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha,=\r\n the spiritual seeker&#39; etc. It will take great \neffort to overcome those id=\r\nentities and find True Self. As if that \nchallenge is not sufficient, do yo=\r\nu really need yet another new \nidentity to feed your ego further? See, what=\r\n he said may very well be \ncorrect. But it is not useful for your progress.=\r\n You have to rise \nabove all identities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; How true and wise!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * =\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as a fat and mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and \ng=\r\net all the food given by the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense \nof &quot;I&quot;) wi=\r\nthin us wins over the spirit of detachment and gets all the \nenergy possibl=\r\ne. Just as a good master may chain the fat dog and feed \nthe lean dog speci=\r\nally, we too must consciously try to restrain ego \nand increase detachment.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple points \n=\r\nhe made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my \nspiritual ev=\r\nolution in this life. Even without giving any specific \nmantra to me, like =\r\nmany spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of \nknowledge in my heart. He woul=\r\nd say the lamp and light were already \nthere and he simply wiped the dust o=\r\nn the lamp that was blocking the \nlight. That is what a good guru does. He/=\r\nShe wipes off the thick \nlayer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass=\r\n (ego) that \nencloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, =\r\nwe may \nbe too caught up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Ho=\r\nmam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. But one \nshould als=\r\no try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on an \nongoing basis. There =\r\nis no magic pill. For most people, this does not \ntake just a single moment=\r\n or day or month or year. It CAN take a long \ntime. As Narayan indicated, o=\r\nne should start walking on the path and \nnot worry about the progress and t=\r\nhe distance left. One who keeps \nwalking without distractions will reach th=\r\ne goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals (li=\r\nke \nhomam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) should go \nh=\r\nand in hand.

Honestly ... un=\r\nless one is an adept, this is\n&gt; &gt; impossible and only repeated and sincere =\r\nattempts makes one an \nadept.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Reminds me of the great Kalidasa who=\r\n worshipped Goddess Mahakali \nfor\n&gt; &gt; nine lives and he was born a dunce in=\r\n his tenth and she appeared \nto\n&gt; &gt; him in his 10th lifetime, when his sadh=\r\nana was complete and he \nbanged\n&gt; &gt; his head out of sheer frustration. Imag=\r\nine!!! In Kaliyuga, along \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity=\r\n is the best path for \nmost. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me share one incident, when Nara=\r\nsimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I \nalso\n&gt; &gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we=\r\n were in Chennai for Shata \nChandi\n&gt; &gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I=\r\n thought he was really joking!\n&gt; &gt; When I got back to the US, he called me =\r\nagain and reminded me. It \nthen\n&gt; &gt; occured to me he was really being serio=\r\nus. So, I started \nsearching on\n&gt; &gt; the net and I found a really flimsy doc=\r\nument, but nevertheless I \ntook\n&gt; &gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not =\r\nsatisfied. Manishji then\n&gt; &gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but even=\r\n in that it was \nentirely\n&gt; &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I could=\r\nn&#39;t distinguish \nbetween\n&gt; &gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time,=\r\n Narasimha \noccasionally\n&gt; &gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I =\r\nparticpated in it, \nbut\n&gt; &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to=\r\n guide me, which he\n&gt; &gt; did, but still it did not get through my really den=\r\nse brains :). I\n&gt; &gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I ne=\r\nver gave \nup,\n&gt; &gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If =\r\nhe really\n&gt; &gt; intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show m=\r\ne the\n&gt; &gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has \ndec=\r\nided\n&gt; &gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n grace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; &gt; baby=\r\n-steps and making progress everyday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha a=\r\nnd the all the divine forces for \nhelping\n&gt; &gt; me progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My requ=\r\nest, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter what. \nWe\n&gt; &gt; are human=\r\ns and prone to mistakes. But then nobody got perfect the \nvery\n&gt; &gt; first ti=\r\nme, unless he has worked on it a lot in his previous \nlives.\n&gt; &gt; Its all a =\r\ncontinuum. Dont worry about time, we have future \nlives ...\n&gt; &gt; plenty of t=\r\nime. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt \nhappen\n&gt; &gt; overnight. =\r\nNo matter what, complete your homa everyday, that \nshould be\n&gt; &gt; the primar=\r\ny goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, \nwhether you\n&gt; &gt; get or do=\r\nnt get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; move on to hi=\r\ngher things. I wish all the best. We should really \nthank\n&gt; &gt; our stars tha=\r\nt people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here \nguiding\n&gt; &gt; us ... what wo=\r\nuld be life without them!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; -N=\r\narayan-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utpal pa=\r\nthak&quot; \n&lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;A servant carrying a million dollar check to the bank and \ncashing it=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank \nan=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

Let me give an a=\r\nnalogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and you=\r\nrself as a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, a=\r\nll the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serv=\r\ne \nyour \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy=\r\n and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks =\r\neveryday to mail \nothers. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically c=\r\narry papers to the \nbank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capab=\r\nle of doing anything in \nthis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings w=\r\nho execute god&#39;s agenda \nin this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (in=\r\ncluding Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth=\r\n every now and then. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through=\r\n various physical \npersons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do =\r\nhomam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and \ntry \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to help=\r\n others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant \ncarries \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mast=\r\ner&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing wh=\r\nat is applauded by others as good work tends to \npromote ego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we =\r\nneed to guard against it. A servant carrying a million \ndollar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; check=\r\n to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a =\r\n$100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are \nmerely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their =\r\nmaster&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* =\r\nused by the master to carry out his agenda. \nSimilarly, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does=\r\n what are considered great deeds in this world and \none \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who does wha=\r\nt are considered meagre deeds in this world are \nboth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of go=\r\nd helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really own=\r\ns anything. One may consider oneself superior \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because =\r\nhis/her deeds are considered superior by the \nworld, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is j=\r\nust as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior t=\r\no another servant carrying something \nless \n&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situat=\r\nions his previous karmas place one in. One can remain \nhappy and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bli=\r\nssful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in \nlight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana li=\r\nke homam. It is \na job \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you ca=\r\nn.

Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam ma=\r\nde by arranging red bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing i=\r\nt in the open is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But =\r\nrealize that \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to =\r\nprotect the \nfire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not g=\r\nood if fire \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While=\r\n performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should one repeat th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can=\r\n repeat mentally while listening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; casually). Actuall=\r\ny, even listening to mantras with all the \nattention \n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused is as p=\r\nowerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a =\r\nmantra and thinking of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose pers=\r\non Y is listening \nto it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and i=\r\nts deity. Then the \nmantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet perso=\r\nn Y may benefit from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that pr=\r\notects the mind&quot;.. \nOne can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to b=\r\ne protected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind f=\r\nocused on the \nmantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference betw=\r\neen meditation and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire i=\r\nn meditation \nand it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a =\r\nhomam. So making \nsome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good ide=\r\na as opposed to \nsilent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat sl=\r\nowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from havi=\r\nng vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred =\r\nthread ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married i=\r\ns irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set =\r\nby one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow the=\r\nm \n&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food \non =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before \nhomam.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take \nresponsibility and \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru \nas guru=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred \nin t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of \npuri=\r\nty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or \nno=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not \nmatter=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. \nThe=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed \nthis=\r\n up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready=\r\n to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for \nspiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; progre=\r\nss, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering \nfor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturt=\r\nhi morning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Ma=\r\nnish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We=\r\n \nended \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we=\r\n \nwere). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with =\r\nme. \nAs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to \nthe \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. \nManish \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city \nafter \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, =\r\nit did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaah=\r\nuti, it suddenly started \nraining \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, th=\r\nere was a small towel/blanket \non \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together,=\r\n we held it on top of the two \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes an=\r\nd meditated. We held the cloth \ncover \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire =\r\nin the two homa kundas went off \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went=\r\n down. We left for Kurukshetra \nlater \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told tha=\r\nt a heavy rain continued for a \nfew days \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain=\r\n followed us on that trip as we \ncovered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the north, east and west of=\r\n India. It rained in every place we \nwent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to, as we finished our tas=\r\nk in that place and prepared to move \non.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): htt=\r\np://vedicastro. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Wi=\r\nndows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasth=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily,=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ?

Any Other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be =\r\nfollowed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to st=\r\nart the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Phani\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;       Get rid of Add-Ons in your email ID.

During the chapter where=\r\n Kalika comes out of the third eye a \ngolden light with red aura would appe=\r\nar. I was not reciting every \nday, however these lights would appear during=\r\n my daily routines, \nwork, interactions with others, etc, as if Mother was =\r\nreminding me of \nher presence in all my daily affairs.\n\nHow could I be such=\r\n a dunce so as to get involved with so many other \nmantras and dilute the p=\r\nure shakti that comes as a result of reciting \nChandi? \n\nI have been follow=\r\ning these mails and I feel grateful to you \ngentlemen for your faith and wi=\r\nsdom.\n\nWarm Regards.................Ajaya \n\n\n"}}
