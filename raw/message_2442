Normally, fire alarm is not present in every room. If so, sit in a roo=\r\nm that does not have fire alarm, close the door, open the window and go on =\r\nto do the homam. If you are getting smoke, you can consider dropping a towe=\r\nl near the closed door\n\n2. Take smaller pieces of dry coconus - may be 1.5 =\r\nto 2 inc in size (take a dry coconut half and cut into 6 or 8 pieces. That =\r\nwill be small enough to keep the smoke level low.\n\n3. After the homam is ov=\r\ner and the burnt dry coconut pieces cool down, remove them and try to keep =\r\nthe homakundam clean. The pieces even though are burnt, will catch fire if =\r\nyou keep them in the homakundam, and they will generate higher levels of sm=\r\noke. So, keep it clean.\n\n4. Keep marmaya, and pelalu (these are like pop-co=\r\nrn but in a smaller size and devoid of oil etc). They are very effective in=\r\n burning with out much smoke\n\n5. I purchased a window exhaust fab ($20-40 i=\r\nn Wallmart), and kept in my window. The amount of smoke during the homam is=\r\n not too much if you keep the ghee level and the size of dry coconut pieces=\r\n small. How ever, after the fire goes off, there will be some smoke. The ex=\r\nhaust will help in sending this out. How ever, you can move the homakundam =\r\nout.\n\n6. I purchased 2 bricks from Homedeopt and kept my Homakundam on them=\r\n so that carpet does not get the heat\n\n7. I also bought a terpentine (also =\r\nfound in Wallmart for about $15 in trekking related ile - it is used to mak=\r\ne tents. I used to put it first and then bricks and then the homamkundam. T=\r\nhis helped my ensure that carpent did not get any strains.\n\n8. Initially I =\r\nwas very skeptic about the fire alarm, but, the day I started (with window =\r\nexhaust fan), I was relieved and never bothered again.\n\n9. Narayan&#39;s tip ab=\r\nout keeping the lights at night is good. But, Candles are normal and if you=\r\n keep the window blinders for the area above the window exhaust, the light =\r\nwill not be so much for the out siders and will be similar to a bright cand=\r\nle if your fire size is small.\n\n10. Ravi Poruri has a beautiful set up at h=\r\nome. I request Ravi to photo the arrangement and put for the benefit of the=\r\n public.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; You should NOT put off fire. =\r\nFire will go away by itself after a while. If you use firewood and have a b=\r\nig fire, it may burn for a while. If you use dry coconut pieces and have a =\r\nsmall fire, it will go away quite quickly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is a good idea to stay =\r\nwith fire until it goes off. But it is admissible to finish the ritual and =\r\nleave the fire and take care of other things. But, in either case, let fire=\r\n go off by itself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose you call someone for lunch and serve a lot=\r\n of food. Suppose the person is still eating. Do you remove food from him a=\r\nnd push him out of your house? Of course not, for that would be quite rude.=\r\n You give him enough time to eat the food. If you have less time and *have*=\r\n to stop soon, you should factor that in when you call him for lunch and se=\r\nrve less food to start with.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Treat fire as a real person (he IS) and =\r\nhave respect and love for him. He serves as a portal connecting you to gods=\r\n and rishis. Depending on your vaasanas and connections, blessings of some =\r\ndeity or rishi can come to you through fire. Of course, this may not be per=\r\nceptible to you, but those blessings may slowly transform you. No wonder se=\r\nveral religions considered fire sacred and taught fire rituals in the past.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like I said earlier, it is the presence of a deity or a rishi *withi=\r\nn you* that is concentrated in an idol or kalasha or fire or some other obj=\r\nect when you imagine that deity or rishi in that idol or kalasha or fire or=\r\n other object and pray. However, some layers within you are suppressed when=\r\n you are sitting in front of a fire of decent size and your ability to conc=\r\nentrate a divine aspect within you into that fire is higher compared to whe=\r\nn you are working with an idol.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have a special arrangement in my po=\r\noja room with a 2 ft x 2 ft fireplace that is open on all 4 sides and const=\r\nructed like a homa kundam, with a chimney going up. But other people are do=\r\ning in US and UK with simpler and more regular arrangements. I will let tho=\r\nse people respond to your last question.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpan=\r\nas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagann=\r\nath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n- \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- metllapalli &lt;metllapalli@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Devotees,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I am new to homam and this group.
