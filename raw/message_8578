In a=\r\n private communication, Sri Svoboda made some points that I liked. I am sha=\r\nring it with you with his kind permission.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Instea=\r\nd of focusing on offending gods or any other beings, as some people do, ple=\r\nase note that he focused on the prevailing gunas and also on downward movem=\r\nent of apaana vaayu. Focused sadhana is meant to make apana move up (Kundal=\r\nini moves up when praana and apaana meet) and some physical conditions dire=\r\nct apana heavily downward (e.g. full bowels, monthly periods, full bladder)=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Of course, in the end, when one is dying, one MAY ne=\r\ned to focus mind on god and make apana move up, under equally (if not more)=\r\n challenging circumstances. But one can make things easy and controlled, wh=\r\nen still alive and practicing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If I may add my 2 =\r\ncents of perspective to the learned opinion below, please keep in mind that=\r\n some highly taamasik men may be influenced by tamas more than some highly =\r\nsaattwik women even in their first day of periods. Things are relative. Als=\r\no, many people (men and women) do most of their sadhana when their apaana i=\r\ns clearly directed downwards and does not move up at all. They do not exper=\r\nience anything. Sadhana in such stages is for instilling discipline rather =\r\nthan making apaana move up and meet with praana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resou=\r\nrces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; --------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Forwa=\r\nrded Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Robert Svoboda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: Narasimha P.V.R.

The second day is ruled by rajas,\n&gt; &gt; and that devi is red=\r\n; and the third day is ruled by sattva, and that\n&gt; &gt; devi is white. During =\r\nthose first 3 days I believe it is better for a\n&gt; &gt; woman to be away from e=\r\nverybody except other women; better for them\n&gt; &gt; not to cook, clean &c; and=\r\n better for them not to involve\n&gt; &gt; themselves in ritual. After all, when a=\r\npana is moving downwards\n&gt; &gt; strongly, why disturb vayu by performing some =\r\nactivity like puja &c\n&gt; &gt; that is meant to encourage vayu to move upwards? =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;After\n&gt; &gt; that, I think it depends on the woman. Some wom=\r\nen are basically\n&gt; &gt; balanced and even if they spot for a day or two more, =\r\nthe bleeding is\n&gt; &gt; effectively ended by the third day. Other women bleed h=\r\neavily for\n&gt; &gt; four or five days, during which time apana is clearly still =\r\nmoving\n&gt; &gt; downward; in these cases, I think they are better off waiting un=\r\ntil\n&gt; &gt; the main flow ends.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;IMO\n&gt; &gt; during this period a w=\r\noman can still do japa & internal\n&gt; &gt; meditation and naama japa, but in an =\r\neasy, sahaja, saumya fashion; no\n&gt; &gt; kathina prayogas EXCEPT when for certa=\r\nin tantrika rituals, e.g. if\n&gt; &gt; the centerpiece of the ritual is to offer =\r\nmenstrual blood, it can be\n&gt; &gt; a big help to have an actual menstruating wo=\r\nman present, to invoke\n&gt; &gt; that particular shakti. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Genera=\r\nlly\n&gt; &gt; I have found that so long as the woman is sufficiently comfortable =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; be able to sit up, that there is no problem for her to sit and watch=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; someone doing a ritual, except when that ritual is of a type where\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the very presence of a menstruating woman can disturb the delicate\n&gt; &gt; sha=\r\nkti that is being invoked. Sadly, I have found that most of the\n&gt; &gt; people =\r\nwho claim that a menstruating woman can disturb them are\n&gt; &gt; people who are=\r\n not as sensitive as they imagine themselves to be. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n often find that when I am myself doing homam and a menstruating woman\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nis sitting at the fire (which I usually permit so long as the woman\n&gt; &gt; und=\r\nerstands what she is doing), that the fire often doesn&#39;t burn as\n&gt; &gt; well =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; this makes sense to me, and so I simply adapt to the\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nituation (e.g. by having plenty of ghee on hand!). Watching homam is\n&gt; &gt; (I=\r\n have found) generally OK, except that for some sensitive women the\n&gt; &gt; act=\r\nivation of agnitattva heats them up in a way that they can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; control. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What\n&gt; &gt; does your heart tells you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Best\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;RS \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;_______________________________=\r\n_\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

In a private communication, S=\r\nri Svoboda made some points that I liked. I am sharing it with you with his=\r\n kind permission.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nnstead of focusing on offending gods or any other beings, as some people do=\r\n, please note that he focused on the prevailing gunas and also on downward =\r\nmovement of apaana vaayu. Focused sadhana is meant to make apana move up (K=\r\nundalini moves up when praana and apaana meet) and some physical conditions=\r\n direct apana heavily downward (e.g. full bowels, monthly periods, full bla=\r\ndder).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, in the end, when=\r\n one is dying, one MAY need to focus mind on god and make apana move up, un=\r\nder equally (if not more) challenging circumstances. But one can make thing=\r\ns easy and controlled, when still alive and practicing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If I may add my 2 cents of perspective=\r\n to the learned opinion below, please keep in mind that some highly taamasi=\r\nk men may be influenced by tamas more than some highly saattwik women even =\r\nin their first day of periods. Things are relative. Also, many people (men =\r\nand women) do most of their sadhana when their apaana is clearly directed d=\r\nownwards and does not move up at all. They do not experience anything. Sadh=\r\nana in such stages is for instilling discipline rather than making apaana m=\r\nove up and meet with praana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Best =\r\nregards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ----- Forwarded Message -----&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;From: Robert Svoboda&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;To: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Subject: Re: A=\r\n commonly asked question I need help on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Namaste&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Personally,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I follow the =\r\n3-day rule: the first day of bleeding is ruled by tamas,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nthe devi of that day is black. The second day is ruled by rajas,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; and that devi is red; and the third day is ruled by sattva, and that&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; devi is white. During those first 3 days I believe it is better=\r\n for a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; woman to be away from everybody except other women; be=\r\ntter for them&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not to cook, clean &amp;c; and better for them =\r\nnot to involve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; themselves in ritual. After all, when apana is=\r\n moving downwards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; strongly, why disturb vayu by performing so=\r\nme activity like puja &amp;c&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that is meant to encourage vayu =\r\nto move upwards?  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\nAfter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that, I think it depends on the woman. Some women are b=\r\nasically&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; balanced and even if they spot for a day or two more=\r\n, the bleeding is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; effectively ended by the third day. Other w=\r\nomen bleed heavily for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; four or five days, during which time a=\r\npana is clearly still moving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; downward; in these cases, I thin=\r\nk they are better off waiting until&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the main flow ends.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;IMO&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; during=\r\n this period a woman can still do japa &amp; internal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; meditat=\r\nion and naama japa, but in an easy, sahaja, saumya fashion; no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; kathina prayogas EXCEPT when for certain tantrika rituals, e.g. if&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; the centerpiece of the ritual is to offer menstrual blood, it can b=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a big help to have an actual menstruating woman present, to=\r\n invoke&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that particular shakti.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Generally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have found that so l=\r\nong as the woman is sufficiently comfortable to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; be able to si=\r\nt up, that there is no problem for her to sit and watch&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; someo=\r\nne doing a ritual, except when that ritual is of a type where&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the very presence of a menstruating woman can disturb the delicate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; shakti that is being invoked. Sadly, I have found that most of the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; people who claim that a menstruating woman can disturb them ar=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; people who are not as sensitive as they imagine themselves =\r\nto be.  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; often find that when I am myself doing homam and a menstruating woman=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is sitting at the fire (which I usually permit so long as th=\r\ne woman&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; understands what she is doing), that the fire often d=\r\noesn&#39;t burn as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; well =C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot; this makes sense to me, =\r\nand so I simply adapt to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; situation (e.g. by having plenty=\r\n of ghee on hand!). Watching homam is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (I have found) generall=\r\ny OK, except that for some sensitive women the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; activation of =\r\nagnitattva heats them up in a way that they can&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; control.  &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;What&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndoes your heart tells you?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;Best&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;RS  &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;_=\r\n_______________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

What about internal meditation and naama japa?=\r\n What about sitting and watching someone doing a ritual? What about watchin=\r\ng homam? Does it depend on deity?
