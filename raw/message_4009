I was also\nfinalizing my new book which deals specifically wit=\r\nh Tamil Nadu religious\npolitics, and in particular with the role of various=\r\n nexuses based overseas.\nSo I decided to jump into the eye of the storm of =\r\nthis scandal in order to\ninvestigate whether similar nexuses were at work i=\r\nn this case. Naturally, at\none level I have seen this scandal through the f=\r\nramework of a civilization\nencounter in which Vedic culture is pitted again=\r\nst the Dravidian\ndivisiveness that is being backed by Christian evangelism.=\r\n At another level,\nI found that the sensationalized media reports were too =\r\none-sided, and none\nof them had a single statement to report from the swami=\r\n himself.\nFurthermore, there was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from=\r\n Swami\nNithyananda&#39;s inner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned o=\r\nut\ndifferently had they managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will\ne=\r\nlaborate later in this article. Given this, another interest of mine has\nbe=\r\nen to extrapolate important lessons from this episode for other Hindu\norgan=\r\nizations, which I predict will face similar scandals as and when their\nweak=\r\nnesses become understood by those opposed to them. This article\nhighlights =\r\nmy findings at these multiple levels and issues.\n\nDuring this 2-week invest=\r\nigative period, I have been loyal to my pledge to\ngive Swami Nithyananda&#39;s =\r\norganization the benefit of doubt and to report\ntheir side of the story. Be=\r\nsides wanting to balance out the one-sided media\ndepictions, I wanted acces=\r\ns to the ashram&#39;s core group for my own research\non the broader subject of =\r\ncivilization encounters. I respect the\nsensitivities of that organization c=\r\nonsisting of many decent and dedicated\ndevotees who have sacrificed a great=\r\n deal and stand to lose a lot.\n\nBut I have concluded that the situation is =\r\nnow beyond repair for Swami\nNithyananda and that his continued involvement =\r\ncan only damage the broader\ninterests of dharma as well as jeopardize the a=\r\nshramites. Along with two\nother sympathizers who are not ashramites, I have=\r\n personally recommended to\nSwami Nithyananda that the best course at this s=\r\ntage would be for him to\nresign completely from his organization. He should=\r\n turn it over to a small\nteam of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets =\r\ncan be used in the best\ninterests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of=\r\n these mahatmas he must\nlive a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institut=\r\nional responsibilities.\nBecause the head of any organization must accept re=\r\nsponsibility that &quot;the\nbuck stops here,&quot; only such a move can salvage the o=\r\nrganization and the\nreputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this=\r\n resignation would\nhopefully reduce the massive pressure that has built up =\r\nagainst him\npersonally, and enable him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It is=\r\n up to him to\naccept or reject this advice. The basis for this conclusion b=\r\necomes clearer\nonce the reader has gone through the rest of this article.\nI=\r\n want to begin by examining some principles about the relationships between=\r\n\nsiddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality, Tantra and sex. This will\n=\r\nprovide the framework in which to interpret what has happened. Then I will\n=\r\nturn to my initial interest in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism in\ns=\r\nouth India from a variety of forces.\n\n\nSiddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers)=\r\n and Morality\nA few days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private =\r\nconversation\nwith Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introd=\r\nuced myself as\nan independent researcher who is writing a series of books o=\r\nn Indian\ncivilization in the context of the global challenges and opportuni=\r\nties. One\nof my volumes will be specifically on the major global gurus sinc=\r\ne the 1960s\n=96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh =\r\nYogi,\nPabhupada, among others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri =\r\nSri\nhimself. I have been investigating what happened to such gurus, in term=\r\ns of\nthe shifts in their Western followers over time, their scandals, their=\r\n\nIndian followers and critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/her\npo=\r\nsition sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western\nmodernit=\r\ny on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Swami\nNithyananda w=\r\nill become clear very soon.\n\nThe first provocative question I asked Sri Sri=\r\n concerned the nature of yogic\npowers: What is the relationship between sid=\r\ndhis and morality? If siddhis\nare a scientific phenomena dealing with power=\r\ns that can be harnessed by all\nhumans then one must bear in mind that scien=\r\nce deals with truths that are\nmorally neutral. If Einstein was declared to =\r\nhave lived an immoral life it\nwould not invalidate his scientific theories.=\r\n A person who designs aircrafts\nor any other complex technological systems =\r\nmay or may not be moral in order\nto be effective in his technical work. In =\r\nother words, rtam (the patterns of\nthe cosmos), which we discover and call =\r\nscience, functions independently of\nhuman morality. This is why a scientifi=\r\nc principle can be used either\nmorally or immorally, because it is independ=\r\nent of morality. There are moral\npersons who lack any siddhis or even ordin=\r\nary scientific competence.\nConversely, there are great siddhas (like Ravana=\r\n) who lack morality. Sri\nSri&#39;s pranayama techniques would also produce resu=\r\nlts for an immoral person.\n\n\nSri Sri seemed impressed by this question, and=\r\n agreed with my overall\nposition on the independence between siddhis and mo=\r\nrality. But he pointed\nout that the moral dimension, while not determining =\r\nthe siddhis, was also\nimportant because it led to receiving the grace of th=\r\ne divine. I agree with\nhim.\n\nSo there are two separate phenomena involved: =\r\n(i) spiritual technologies\nthat are objective and that allow anyone to harn=\r\ness spiritual energies, and\n(ii) morality which is important in itself, not=\r\n for attaining siddhis, but\nin order to have a positive relationship with t=\r\nhe divine. Either one can be\ndeveloped without the other; however, the dhar=\r\nma tradition encourages us to\ncultivate both. The reason that meditation sy=\r\nstems prescribe things like\nvegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an ina=\r\nppropriate lifestyle\ninterferes with the mental tranquility required to adv=\r\nance. This lifestyle\nchange can be appreciated regardless of whether one be=\r\nlieves in a personal\nGod or not. This absence of a personal God is clear in=\r\n Buddhist meditation.\nDifferent Hindu systems place different levels of emp=\r\nhasis upon a personal\nGod for the yoga to function. This is why many secula=\r\nr and scientifically\nminded persons are also drawn towards meditation techn=\r\niques. In other words,\nsomething cannot be a science if it depends upon mor=\r\nality, because science\nis objective and stands independent of morality.\n\nTh=\r\ne relevance of this question is as follows: Many persons who have learned\na=\r\ndvanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to know if any moral\nbreache=\r\ns by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim of achieving higher\nstates =\r\nof consciousness. When a far worse sex scandal against the legendary\nSwami =\r\nMuktananda emerged in the 1990s, involving charges by a large number\nof his=\r\n Western female disciples, the Western academy rashly condemned not\nonly on=\r\ne man&#39;s morality, but also the whole legitimacy of the Indian\ntradition its=\r\nelf. In that series of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah\nCaldwell, etc=\r\n.), I took the same position then as I am taking now: that\nMuktananda&#39;s cap=\r\nabilities in harnessing spiritual energies are separate and\nindependent fro=\r\nm whether or not he violated any code of morality.\n\nPatanjali warns against=\r\n getting lured by siddhis which appear along the way\nwhen one practices adv=\r\nanced meditation persistently. One is not supposed to\nindulge in them. This=\r\n warning is found in various Hindu systems that deal\nwith the body as a veh=\r\nicle for spiritual evolution, because these energies\nare very powerful and =\r\ncan get out of control. Another point that is worth\nnoting is that the tech=\r\nniques taught by Swami Nithyananda are not his\noriginal ones; he has made i=\r\nt clear repeatedly that they are from the Shiva\nSutras which have a long hi=\r\nstory in our civilization. I feel that he does\nhave the siddhi of being abl=\r\ne to transmit these techniques very effectively\nto others. For instance, I =\r\nhave never before in my life been able to sit\nstill and alert in meditation=\r\n for the whole night, but he had a few hundred\npersons in a large hall achi=\r\neving this. The point here is similar to saying\nthat the mathematics and go=\r\nlf I have learned from someone is not invalidated\nwhen the teacher is found=\r\n to be immoral.\n\nHence, the issue of his morality must be pursued separatel=\r\ny and\nindependently from whether his siddhis are genuine.\n\nIs Tantra a Part=\r\n of Hinduism?\n\nThe second question that I asked Sri Sri could not be comple=\r\ntely dealt with\nin the time available for our meeting. I hope to pursue thi=\r\ns some day with\nhim and with various other acharyas for my own benefit. Its=\r\n significance in\nthe present scandal becomes clear soon. I asked whether th=\r\ne Shiva Sutras are\nvalid, pointing out that among the 112 spiritual enlight=\r\nenment techniques\ntaught in them, about 6 deal with sexual contact between =\r\na male yogi and a\nfemale yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well as the Tantra tra=\r\nditions have\nincluded exemplars that practiced these techniques. Recently, =\r\nOsho tried to\nrevive them and nowadays Deepak Chopra has brought some eleme=\r\nnts of these\ninto his repertoire. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a US based scholar =\r\nof Tantra and\nKashmir Shaivism, is one of the voices who brings out the aut=\r\nhenticity of\nthese approaches in the tradition, despite the common rejectio=\r\nns by society\nat large. The tradition considers itself not suitable for mai=\r\nnstream society\nand is meant only for a small subset of people.\n\nMany popul=\r\nar Hindu rituals and symbols have emerged out of the Tantra\ntraditions =96 =\r\nsuch as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic traditions were\nnot separat=\r\ne until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integration is found in\nAdi Shankar=\r\na all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrator of\nVaishnavism who took=\r\n Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and even more recently in\nthe life of Sri Ramak=\r\nrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra\npractitioners, but they do it p=\r\nrivately and not publicly.\n\nI have an unpublished monograph that shows the =\r\nhistory of this shift in\nIndian consciousness concerning Tantra. It was und=\r\ner British rule that\ncertain Indian leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started=\r\n to condemn (as part\nof their &quot;reform&quot; of Hinduism) those aspects of Hindui=\r\nsm that bothered\npuritan Christian values. It must be noted that Christiani=\r\nty has had a very\nnegative posture towards the human body starting with the=\r\n Biblical episode\nof Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called &quot;witche=\r\ns&quot;) got demonized\nby the Church in its very official genocide of several mi=\r\nllion practitioners\nacross Europe. This Church prosecution was called the I=\r\nnquisition and was\nwidespread for a few centuries. The use of shakti and an=\r\nything concerning\nthe body as a spiritual resource was considered not only =\r\nimmoral but also\ndemonic, and was outlawed with draconian enforcement. The =\r\nterm &quot;occult&quot; was\nused to refer to a vast assortment of such practices and =\r\nwas heavily\ncondemned by the Church as the work of the Devil.\nThis mentalit=\r\ny entered India under the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of\nIndia was pas=\r\nsed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed several dozen\ntribes that p=\r\nracticed such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were officially\npersecuted into e=\r\nxtinction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism evolved as\nthe mark of being =\r\n&quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus be proud of\nour identity, now t=\r\nhat it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; practices of our\nancestors.\n\nIn this h=\r\nistory of removing Tantra out of Hinduism, some people include\nSwami Viveka=\r\nnanda among those who undermined Tantra. I disagree with this\ncharge. He wa=\r\ns saying a separate set of things to his Western audiences than\nto Indians.=\r\n In his Western lecture tours, he presented a Hinduism that\nWesterners coul=\r\nd relate to and appreciate, but he did not ask Indians to\nshift their pract=\r\nice. It is unfortunate that after his death, the\nRamakrishna Mission he sta=\r\nrted has diluted itself into a sort of\npseudo-Christianity. Kali and other =\r\nrelated Tantra deities, symbols and\nrituals that were dear to Ramakrishna h=\r\nimself, have become &quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&quot;private&quot; use by the monks, but are ma=\r\nrginalized publicly and considered as\nan embarrassment. Their lead in this =\r\ndirection has spread across modern\nHinduism to such an extent that Vedic Hi=\r\nnduism has become separated from\nTantra, and Tantra is now widely condemned=\r\n by many Hindu gurus. This is also\na factor that worked against Swami Nithy=\r\nananda&#39;s reputation among orthodox\nHindu leaders, for he uses Tantric techn=\r\niques that arouse body energies,\nsuch as kundalini.\n\nMy own feeling is that=\r\n Tantra is making a big comeback. First there was\nWestern popularity of dis=\r\ntorted versions of Tantra; but this is now being\nfollowed by more clinical =\r\nexperimentation by psychologists and others. The\nwhole issue of latent huma=\r\nn energies and potentials (both positive and\ndangerous) is a hot topic of s=\r\nerious scientific investigation. Hindus should\nreclaim this aspect of their=\r\n own tradition rather than waiting for U-Turned\n(appropriated) versions to =\r\nget re-exported back to India, packaged as &quot;Made\nin USA&quot; spiritual science.=\r\n This requires an attitude of experimentation\nunder the appropriate control=\r\ns to prevent abuses and quackery.\n\nI just returned from Kumbh Mela where I =\r\nwalked amidst several tens of\nthousands of naga sadhus who were completely =\r\nnaked. I did not consider them\nas either vulgar or primitive. The old guard=\r\n of Hindu orthodoxy rejects\nTantra at least in public, and yet lives in con=\r\ntradictions because they do\nrespect the naga sadhus and also the various sy=\r\nmbols and rituals that have\ntheir foundations in Tantra. The vacuum left by=\r\n avoiding the subject of\nTantra has created opportunities for the likes of =\r\nWendy Doniger to formulate\ndistorted interpretations. I feel that Hindu spi=\r\nritual practitioners as well\nas intellectuals must take back control over T=\r\nantra as an intrinsic part of\nour tradition.\n\nSex and Morality\n\nAgainst thi=\r\ns backdrop, I will address the issue of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\nmorality. Just =\r\nto recap:\nMy first point above has been that the morality issue about Swami=\r\n\nNithyananda does not impact the effectiveness of the meditation techniques=\r\n\nhe has taught very successfully. Their efficacy is best evaluated by the\nt=\r\nens of thousands of practitioners for themselves.\nMy second point was that =\r\nthere is nothing inherent about sex that is\nrejected by Hinduism across the=\r\n board, although certain strains of Hinduism\ndo reject sex seeing it as har=\r\nmful to spirituality.\nHere it must be noted that brahmacharya (involving se=\r\nxual abstinence) is\njust one of the spiritual paths of Hinduism. The first =\r\nhalf of my recent\nstay in Haridwar was as a guest of the Gayatri Pariwar, o=\r\nne of the greatest\nand largest Hindu movements, that does not advocate bein=\r\ng brahmachari. Its\nfounder, its present head and its members at large, are =\r\nhouseholders and not\nbrahmacharis. But for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral=\r\n authenticity under\nthis system, he would have to pronounce himself as a ho=\r\nuseholder and not a\nsannyasin. He has never done that, so we must examine h=\r\nis morality by some\nother criteria.\n\nAnother approach for him could have be=\r\nen to announce himself as an\nexperimenter of Tantra for modern times, there=\r\nby making himself transparent\nof any such charges. This would place him in =\r\nthe same category as Osho. Many\ntimes in his public discourses and teaching=\r\ns, he has praised Osho as his\ngreatest teacher and enlightened exemplar. He=\r\n even said that many of his own\nteachings were derived from Osho. But he fa=\r\niled to publicly clarify whether\nhe was practicing those techniques that in=\r\nvolve sex. Privately, he explained\nto me in recent days that Shiva Sutras h=\r\nave two categories of techniques.\nMost of the sutras do not involve physica=\r\nl contact with another person and\nonly use the four senses of sight, sound,=\r\n taste and smell as pathways to\nspiritual experiences. Hence an individual =\r\npractices these techniques\nentirely on his/her own. This path is what he ha=\r\ns taught thus far to the\npublic. The best pursuit of this path is as a brah=\r\namachari according to him,\nand he has initiated many followers into it. But=\r\n for a small number of\npersons, he feels that the 6 sutras involving sexual=\r\n Tantra need to be\ntested and perfected for modern times, before they can b=\r\ne safely taught more\nwidely. This he considers to be like any R & D done in=\r\n a lab for developing\na product.\nMy sense is that he did practice Tantra wi=\r\nth a very small number of persons,\nand I believe that he even entered into =\r\nwritten legal contracts with them to\nmake sure that both parties were clear=\r\n about the arrangement. The reason for\nthis &quot;Non-Disclosure Agreement&quot; was =\r\nto make sure that someone who willingly\napproaches him for Tantra does not =\r\nlater accuse him of inappropriate\nphysical contact. On March 9 (about a wee=\r\nk ago), I did a specific video\ninterview with him dealing with this issue v=\r\nery specifically. But this video\nwas blocked by his ashram leaders even tho=\r\nugh he personally felt that it was\na good idea to show it. I gave up arguin=\r\ng in favor of showing it, because\nhis ashram management took a firm stand a=\r\ngainst it. I still feel that this\nwas a blunder they made. Swami Nithyanand=\r\na is very forthright and clear in\nthat interview =96 I felt that it was the=\r\n best interview of all the ones I did\nwith him, but it was never made publi=\r\nc.\nI surmise that Ranjitha, the Tamil actress in the scandalous videotape, =\r\nwas\npracticing Tantra with him. He taught her the self-control she had to\na=\r\nchieve before any intimacy. I have tried to interview her in order to get\nh=\r\ner side of the story, but so far I have not succeeded in getting through to=\r\n\nher. Based on third party reports from some persons who are in touch with\n=\r\nher, and the media reports of her statements, her stance seems to be along\n=\r\nthe following lines: She took the sexual initiative with him on the occasio=\r\nn\nshown in the videotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. But this\na=\r\nctivity did not proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. She has also\nsai=\r\nd that the videos being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what\nactual=\r\nly happened, because they exaggerate the situation. They do not show\nportio=\r\nns where he asked her to stop. Different clips from various videos\nseem to =\r\nhave been turned into a single video by editing. She has not filed\nany comp=\r\nlaint against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual sex\nbetween ad=\r\nults, and that too backed by a formal written contract between the\nparties.=\r\n Because she has refused to give any statement against Swami\nNithyananda, s=\r\nhe feels threatened by those who set her up and who did this\nsting operatio=\r\nn. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her safety\nfrom this mafia-=\r\nlike conspiracy. I have not been able to corroborate this\nthesis directly f=\r\nrom her.\n\nMy concern about his morality is, therefore, not based on sex bet=\r\nween\nconsenting adults. Rather, my moral issue is about the lack of transpa=\r\nrency\nbefore the public. He could have openly said that he wants to select =\r\na few\nyoginis to experiment Tantra under mutual consent. At worst this woul=\r\nd have\nupset many followers and pushed them away. In response to my concern=\r\n over\nhis lack of transparency, he could offer the argument that this was a=\r\n\nprivate activity between adults who are under no obligation to disclose it=\r\n\nto the public. After all, people do not go about broadcasting their sexual=\r\n\nlives. So long as this was under mutual consent, he might say, it cannot b=\r\ne\nan offense. And if it was done under the Tantra portions of the Shiva Sut=\r\nra,\nit was also an act within the Hindu tradition despite the controversy\ns=\r\nurrounding Tantra today.\n\nHaving given this best case argument on his behal=\r\nf, I must say that there\ncould also be the alternative scenario, namely, th=\r\nat this was mere lust\npackaged as Tantric spirituality. David White, one of=\r\n Wendy&#39;s Children, has\nwritten extensively making the claim that all Tantra=\r\n is &quot;hard core porn&quot;\nthat gets wrapped up before the public in metaphysical=\r\n mumbo-jumbo to appear\nto be legitimate spirituality, which he calls &quot;soft =\r\nporn&quot; coating. White&#39;s\nlatest book takes this allegation to the extreme, an=\r\nd states that all major\nyogic exemplars in Indian history were basically no=\r\nt engaged in any kind of\nspirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were=\r\n developing personal power\nfor the purpose of exploiting others. I am unqua=\r\nlified to comment on whether\nSwami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this notion of &quot;=\r\nsoft porn,&quot; or whether it was\nlegitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate fac=\r\ntual data of what happened to\npass judgment either way.\nThis concludes what=\r\n I have to say about his morality issue as shown in the\nsex tapes.\n\nMy Impr=\r\nessions of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal\nI was introduced to Swam=\r\ni Nithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent\nHindu leader based in C=\r\nalifornia. This man was so impressed by the young\nswami that he frequently =\r\ncalled me to speak about him in glowing terms. I\ntold him that I had a guru=\r\n already, and that my present interest in\ninteracting with gurus was mainly=\r\n as a part of my research for my book on\nglobal gurus. He arranged a privat=\r\ne meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\nwhich I used mostly to explain the=\r\n civilization threats facing Hinduism,\nciting numerous examples, and questi=\r\noned him on his position in this regard.\nI found him to be very sharp, a gr=\r\neat listener, and in agreement that we\nmust engage social issues rather tha=\r\nn pursuing the &quot;world negating&quot; or\n&quot;escapist&quot; paths that are typical of man=\r\ny gurus today.\nLater on, I attended a weekend course in USA where he taught=\r\n the Patanjali\nYoga Sutras. I have read several translations of this great =\r\nclassical work,\nbut I had never before seen it taught experientially. Swami=\r\n Nithyananda gave\nthe attendees their own personal inner experience of ever=\r\ny one of the eight\nlimbs of Patanjali&#39;s system, right up to and including s=\r\namadhi. This was\nquite an achievement in two days.\n\nOverall, my interaction=\r\ns with him remained centered largely on the\ngeopolitics of religions. I saw=\r\n him as a prominent swami who was not running\naway from troubling issues, s=\r\nuch as Christian conversions and the\nDravidianization of Tamil identity. Gi=\r\nven that I have been writing a book\nfor three years (now in the editing sta=\r\nge) on this very issue as it exists\nin Tamil Nadu, I was especially impress=\r\ned by his experimental program of a\nHindu temple on wheels traveling from v=\r\nillage to village. In each village\nthis mobile temple stops and offers chan=\r\nting, a talk by one of the leaders,\nfood, medicines, etc. So it combines re=\r\nligion with social service and thus\ncompetes directly against Christian eva=\r\nngelism. Rather than building a\ntemple in every village and needing a puroh=\r\nit in each of the thousands of\nvillages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was=\r\n to bring to each village this\n&quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by my =\r\nown independent fact-finding was\nthat wherever this temple on wheels went, =\r\nthe missionaries were upset\nbecause it blunted their conversion efforts.\nI =\r\nattended his 21-day meditation program in December 2009. The various\ntechni=\r\nques in it are very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of\nthis ca=\r\nn be done by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly\nequally be=\r\ntween Indians and whites from North America.\n\nIn several side conversations=\r\n with him as well in the public forum, I\npursued the point that I already h=\r\nave a guru since 1994, so I was not\nlooking for a new guru. Since my guru h=\r\nad left the body a few years ago, I\nwanted to continue learning new techniq=\r\nues for my practice. I explained to\nhim that I had previously learned and p=\r\nracticed meditation techniques from\nmultiple sources for over 30 years, inc=\r\nluding: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\nSri Ravi Shankar, Yogi Amrit Desai (who =\r\ncertified me as a teacher), Deepak\nChopra, Vipassana, and more. Additionall=\r\ny, I had practiced numerous bhakti\ntraditions, as well as formal Vedanta ed=\r\nucation from Swami Chinmayananda and\nRamakrishna Mission. I went through a =\r\nserious study of the writings by Sri\nAurobindo, various Madhyamika Buddhist=\r\n systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Ramana\nMaharshi, etc. So I was not seeking a ne=\r\nw guru like most others who took his\ncourses.\n\nI have to say that he never =\r\npressured me to adopt him as my new guru, and\neven said that one must remai=\r\nn loyal to one&#39;s guru. To be classified as a\ndevotee/disciple of his, there=\r\n are two criteria, neither of which applies to\nme. First, there is an optio=\r\nnal program one can sign up for, to do &quot;paada\npuja&quot; at the guru&#39;s feet, in =\r\norder to develop a special link with him. The\nsecond is that one can ask to=\r\n be given an initiation with a new name, in\nwhich case his policy is that t=\r\nhe person must legally change his/her name,\nand use this new name publicly.=\r\n I did not do either of these steps. So my\nrelationship is not as a devotee=\r\n or disciple, but more arms-length.\n\nIt was a two-way street. While he taug=\r\nht me meditation, I brought to him my\nscholarship on the geopolitical posit=\r\nioning of Hinduism which I feel the\ngurus know only superficially. They do =\r\nnot adequately know things like:\nWestern philosophy, neither of the religio=\r\nus nor the secular variety; or\nWestern history; or Western institutions tha=\r\nt have been set up explicitly to\nspread its civilization; or various global=\r\n campaigns under way to invade\nIndian civilization through conversions, edu=\r\ncation, media, political\npolicymaking and more.\n\nHe requested that I should=\r\n present him my findings on such matters so that\nhe and his senior acharyas=\r\n could learn. I told him that most gurus have\nlittle time to listen attenti=\r\nvely to a layperson like me, because the gurus\nlike to do all the talking. =\r\nHe replied that he would sit and listen to me\nseriously. I made it clear th=\r\nat I was disinterested in giving a short talk\nof a few minutes, because my =\r\nfindings required considerable time to be\nexamined seriously. I told him th=\r\nat I would need two full days of undivided\nattention, so that I could prese=\r\nnt 300 Powerpoint slides.\n\nSwami Nithyananda sent me an invitation when I w=\r\nas in Delhi to visit his\nashram and present my research. I was delighted to=\r\n have such an important\naudience. I was very impressed by the fact that he =\r\nsat through two long days\nof my talks, about 12 hours per day. He asked his=\r\n 40 top acharyas and\nvarious thought leaders in his ashram to sit and liste=\r\nn to me for both the\ndays. The interactions were intense, and I explained m=\r\nany points from my\nforthcoming books. I felt that he and I had a peer relat=\r\nionship, each side\nbeing an expert in his domain to teach the other. After =\r\nmy two days of talks\nwere over, he asked me to help him incorporate my core=\r\n ideas into his\ncurriculum, so as to make sure that his teachings helped po=\r\nsition the Vedic\ncivilization properly.\n\nNo other guru in the world has inv=\r\nested so much time with me to try and\nlearn these global issues so deeply. =\r\n(The only other prominent guru I know\npersonally who understands these issu=\r\nes about the external challenges is\nSwami Dayananda Saraswati.) Most gurus =\r\ntend to either be dismissive by\nresorting to spiritual loftiness, or imagin=\r\ne that they already know whatever\nthere is worth knowing. Thus, my primary =\r\ninterest in Swami Nithyananda was\nas a vehicle to spread greater awareness =\r\nof the kinds of issues that I was\nresearching. (For instance, he bought a c=\r\nouple of hundred copies of the\nbook, &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot; at the full pric=\r\ne, and made it required reading\nfor all his ashram residents.)\n\nI must bala=\r\nnce this praise with criticism. In my 2-day talks, I had\nexplicitly discuss=\r\ned that many gurus were falling prey to sex scandals,\noften with women plan=\r\nted as part of sting operations, or women in the inner\ncircle who got too c=\r\nlose and let things get out of control. Despite these\nwarnings, it seems th=\r\nat nothing concrete was done to prevent or at least\nanticipate the crisis t=\r\nhat was to follow.\n\nMy Approach to this Investigation\n\nWhen the scandal bro=\r\nke out I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram\nmanagement and found t=\r\nhem confident but confused. Probably they felt that\nthe matter would soon g=\r\net forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite\nhappened, as each day =\r\nbrought fresh allegations and sensational media\ncoverage. After several day=\r\ns had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\nstudy the situation for my=\r\nself. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra\npractice with any women. =\r\nWhatever I knew was based on what his followers\ntold me, because he was per=\r\nsonally inaccessible for several days even after\nI reached Bangalore. I spe=\r\nnt many hours daily with some of his ashram&#39;s top\nteam.\n\nWhat I wrote earli=\r\ner in this article actually comes later in the chronology\nof my investigati=\r\non. But I presented it up front because most readers are\nobsessed with gett=\r\ning my answer to only one single question: did he or did\nhe not have sex? N=\r\nothing else seems to matter to them, whereas my\ninvestigation&#39;s emphasis ha=\r\ns been about issues broader and more\nconsequential than any one man&#39;s moral=\r\nity.\n\nUntil I concluded my fact-finding 2-week period recently, I was unabl=\r\ne to\ndiscuss the sexual acts shown in the videotapes. I had to respect the\n=\r\npolicies of his people as part of the trust being placed in me to gain\nacce=\r\nss. They also needed legal clearance on what can and cannot be said by\nthem=\r\n. Their policy on the sex tapes was that Swami Nithyananda would\ndirectly e=\r\nxplain his acts. The Tamil actress&#39; lawyer was also in contact\nwith them an=\r\nd her sensitivities had to be respected. The sensitivities of\nthe 140-stron=\r\ng ashramites had to be protected also. Given this set of\ncircumstances faci=\r\nng me, I feel that it was unfair to demand that I should\nhound him with the=\r\n one critical question. People have assumed that it was up\nto me to decide =\r\nwhat would be within the scope of each interview. As I have\nmentioned earli=\r\ner, even after certain interviews were recorded by me, the\nashram leadershi=\r\np used its discretion not to air them.\n\nIn response to my critics on how I =\r\nconducted my interviews, I would also\nlike to explain why I chose to focus =\r\non the criminal charges being made\nagainst Swami Nithyananda. Besides the s=\r\nex-tape being off limits as\nmentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the crimi=\r\nnal charges became my focus\nfor two reasons. These charges could be ascerta=\r\nined with objectivity =96 such\nas asking for documents on the land ownershi=\r\np, the medical reports on the\ndeath of one meditation participant 2 years a=\r\ngo, and so forth. The evidence\nwas more clear-cut than the evidence on what=\r\n exactly happened in the\nvideotapes between two persons none of whom were w=\r\nilling to talk with me\nabout it. Secondly, the consequences of criminality =\r\nwould be far more severe\nthan mere moral fallibility. While immoral conduct=\r\n is a big concern for the\ndevotees, it is not enough grounds by itself for =\r\nthe state to confiscate the\nentire property that runs into very large sums =\r\nof money. Also, as a matter\nof principle, regardless of whether or not he i=\r\ns guilty of the morality\ncharge, I felt opposed to spurious criminal charge=\r\ns being piled up by the\nirresponsible media just to create sensationalism.\n=\r\n\nThe Conspiracy against Swami Nithyananda\n\nSince I had arrived at the scene=\r\n while writing my book on the conspiracy in\nTamil Nadu religious politics, =\r\nit was natural to start with that as my\nemphasis for the investigation. But=\r\n in this short article I have decided to\nfocus on the matters surrounding h=\r\nis conduct and his organization&#39;s conduct,\nbecause these have assumed a mor=\r\ne urgent nature. The details of the\nconspiracy belong in my book as corrobo=\r\nrating evidence for my thesis there.\nThe types of parties reported to be be=\r\nhind the conspiracy, both foreign and\nIndia based, were remarkably similar =\r\nto the ones I have written about in the\nbook. So for now I shall merely sum=\r\nmarize some of the main points concerning\nthis conspiracy.\n\nFirst one must =\r\nunderstand why Swami Nithyananda became such a target. He was\nvirtually unk=\r\nnown 7 years ago, but once he appeared in public his popularity\ncatapulted =\r\nat a dramatic rate. For example, last year, YouTube wrote to him\nthat he wa=\r\ns the most watched of all Indian spiritual leaders on the Internet\nand prop=\r\nosed a closer collaboration for their viewers. This letter also\nstated that=\r\n among all spiritual leaders worldwide (not just Indian) he was\nthe second =\r\nmost popular one, the Vatican being first. His meditation\nprograms have bec=\r\nome very popular in USA and in certain Indian states. The\nmain factors are =\r\nthat participants almost invariably report experiencing\nhigher states of co=\r\nnsciousness, and he has healed a large number of persons\nof a variety of di=\r\nseases. His healing powers are what brought together his\ncore inner group o=\r\nf devotees from around the world =96 doctors, businessmen,\nIT professionals=\r\n, corporate executives. Many of them have explained their\npersonal healings=\r\n from terminal illnesses as the turning point in their\nlives. His meditatio=\r\nn programs sometimes bring up to a few thousand\nattendees for periods rangi=\r\nng from a few days to several weeks.\n\nWhile the funds come mostly from uppe=\r\nr strata participants in India and USA,\na large portion of the expenses hav=\r\ne been allocated to develop grass-roots\nsocial and spiritual programs focus=\r\ning primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native\nstate. This is where he is seen as =\r\na threat by Dravidian as well as\nChristian forces. For instance, in Decembe=\r\nr 2009, about 600 villages across\nTamil Nadu sent their local &quot;Nithyananda =\r\nleaders&quot; for a celebration and\nplanning session in his main ashram near Ban=\r\ngalore. I happened to be present\nfor the event. These common folks, mostly =\r\nfrom the lower strata of Tamil\nsociety, had walked 300 kilometers for this =\r\njourney, which they saw as a\nspiritual pilgrimage. The reason for the anger=\r\n of Christian and Dravidian\nforces is that his activities have put a dampen=\r\ner to conversions in many\ndistricts, and several Christians have returned t=\r\no Hinduism by getting\ninitiated formally into his organization. The swami h=\r\nimself has spoken\nagainst conversions, and has also stated that the Dravidi=\r\nan movement had\nmade Tamil people unspiritual in their lives, and that this=\r\n had caused\nsocial decay. His Tamil language publications and courses have =\r\nbecome his\nmost popular ones, far exceeding the numbers in English. Also he=\r\n is a very\nbig threat because he is not a Brahmin. Because he cannot be tar=\r\ngeted using\nthe classic attack strategies used on Brahmins, and because the=\r\n masses in\nTamil Nadu were rising to swell his ranks, the threat he posed t=\r\no the\nexisting political power structure had to be stopped one way or anoth=\r\ner.\n\nThe attack against Swami Nithyananda has consisted of two prongs, dest=\r\nroying\nhis image and alleging legal misdeeds. At first a highly sensational=\r\n sexual\ncharge was broadcast in order to devastate his credibility and crea=\r\nte an\natmosphere in which any and all kinds of outlandish allegations would=\r\n be\ntaken at face value. Once the media and popular sentiments had been tur=\r\nned\nagainst him, there was one amazing allegation after another in rapid\nse=\r\nquence. It was clear that none of this was spontaneous but was being\ncentra=\r\nlly orchestrated under a systematic plan.\n\nWhat became evident to me was th=\r\nat there was &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\nunofficial ways among the media,=\r\n police and lower level judiciary. In fact,\nmany third parties were aware o=\r\nf the attack in advance and had warned his\npeople before it happened with s=\r\npecific details of the plan. For instance,\none of his top devotees got a ph=\r\none call from someone based in New York\ndescribing the media and police att=\r\nack that was to come. His predictions\nturned out to be accurate but at that=\r\n time the ashramites did not take the\nthreat literally. He said that for th=\r\ne right sum of money he could be\nhelpful in preventing such an attack. He c=\r\nlaimed that the planning for this\nattack had started a year ago. He mention=\r\ned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\nwas allocated by some overseas groups to =\r\ndemolish Hindu gurus especially in\nsouth India, and named two south Indian =\r\nchurches as the nodal agencies to\ncoordinate this strategic plan. (I am pre=\r\nsently pursuing these leads as part\nof my book investigation.)\nThere was an=\r\nother concrete extortion effort about eleven or twelve days\nprior to the sc=\r\nandal breaking out. A lawyer contacted them and claimed that\nhis client had=\r\n compromising videos, and that the client was seeking money or\nelse they wo=\r\nuld get released. The same intermediary later sent a letter\ncontaining a va=\r\nriety of unsubstantiated criminal allegations against Swami\nNithyananda, an=\r\nd this letter&#39;s distribution list included India&#39;s Prime\nMinister, Presiden=\r\nt, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various Chief Ministers\nand police heads,=\r\n various national criminal investigation and security\norganizations. I have=\r\n a copy of this letter, and it makes the Nithyananda\norganization seem like=\r\n a terrorist outfit that needs to be attacked for the\nsake of public safety=\r\n. This letter along with a DVD of the sex video was\ndelivered to the Chief =\r\nMinister of Karnataka state two hours before the\nvideotape was first aired.=\r\n Clearly, the attack was well planned and executed\nacross many locations, a=\r\nnd was persistently carried out over several days.\nThis is not the work of =\r\nsome isolated individuals.\n\nThere were warnings given to individuals in the=\r\n ashram that their phones\nwere being tapped and that they better leave to s=\r\nave their own lives,\nbecause something horrible was about to happen. One fr=\r\niendly man based in\nPune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nith=\r\nyananda, told the\nashram a week in advance of the attack that some such cat=\r\nastrophe would\nhappen. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press =\r\nClub. Another\npublisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda&#39;s bo=\r\noks in Telugu,\ncalled three times to warn that a graphic video would be rel=\r\neased and gave a\nprecise time for this to happen. It was also reported that=\r\n an American\ndevotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in associ=\r\nation with one\nJody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a prominent w=\r\neb site. He was\nbeing helped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was once =\r\nvery deeply\ninvolved inside the Nithyananda organization but had turned mal=\r\nicious. The\nonly man who has openly come out as the main accuser was an ash=\r\nramite who\nhad a falling out when he got demoted due to his conduct. It was=\r\n recently\nreported that he had a prior criminal record against him but nobo=\r\ndy in the\nashram had checked out his background before admitting him.\n\nTher=\r\ne were constant threats received to harass the ashramites and scare them\naw=\r\nay, with claims that &quot;narcotics will be planted to cause arrest warrants.&quot;\n=\r\nThe actions by the police were being leaked to the media ahead of time and\n=\r\neven to the opposing side, leading to numerous &quot;tips&quot; received by &quot;friends&quot;=\r\n\nasking the ashram dwellers to run away before &quot;the attack comes.&quot;\n\nBut eve=\r\nn after a couple of weeks since the scandal has erupted, the lawyers\nfor Sw=\r\nami Nithyananda&#39;s ashram have failed to get copies of any concrete\ncharges =\r\nfiled with the police, except a few trivial ones. Each time they\napproach f=\r\nor specific details they are told that there is no formal charge,\nexcept re=\r\nlatively minor ones. So the intimidation has been carried out\nmainly throug=\r\nh media reports, without any legal due process starting where\nfacts and arg=\r\numents could get cross-examined. This lack of formal charges\nhas enabled an=\r\n atmosphere of intimidation using rumors and threats that\ncannot be pinned =\r\ndown officially.\n\nIt is important to contrast this with the manner in which=\r\n Indian media\ntreats scandals facing Islamic or Christian groups. The numer=\r\nous scandals\noccurring overseas often get blocked by Indian media entirely,=\r\n or are given\nmild treatment with tremendous sensitivity, in order to be se=\r\nen as &quot;secular&quot;\nand not &quot;communal.&quot; By contrast every kind of allegation ag=\r\nainst any Hindu\ngroup gets clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated =\r\nas a social\nscourge equivalent to terror groups.\n\nThe media&#39;s hounding ment=\r\nality and mafia tactics deserve to be condemned. In\nthe Swami Nithyananda c=\r\nase, they have used carrots and sticks to lure and\nthreaten, using whatever=\r\n would get them more sensational footage. Several TV\nstations and journalis=\r\nts camped out in Haridwar and sent me emails\nrequesting my help in arrangin=\r\ng an interview. When I failed to deliver\n(because it was not up to me to de=\r\nliver any such thing), some of them turned\nnasty against me. One TV woman p=\r\nromised the swami&#39;s people &quot;positive&quot;\ncoverage if she got an exclusive. But=\r\n after the interview, she betrayed them\nand turned it into more distortion =\r\nand smut. This led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\nhandlers to give interviews to more =\r\nstations in order to counteract this\ndistortion. But the more they said bef=\r\nore TV cameras, the worse the scandal\nbecame. One station was blatant in it=\r\ns threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\nyou don&#39;t give us an interview right=\r\n away, we will show you the power of the\nmedia to destroy you.&quot; At one poin=\r\nt a major TV station also wanted to drag\nin Ramakrishna Mission with simila=\r\nr allegations, but someone was able to\nstop that.\n\nFailures of Swami Nithya=\r\nnanda&#39;s Organization\n\nHindu tradition separates three kinds of Varna (skill=\r\ns), each representing a\nform of social capital, and these three were never =\r\nsupposed to be\nconcentrated in a single person, thereby preventing too much=\r\n concentration\nof power. I use the terms Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not=\r\n as birth based\n&quot;caste,&quot; but as merit based social capital and areas of com=\r\npetence. The\nBrahmin job description focuses on spirituality and research; =\r\nKshatriya on\ngovernance, politics and leadership; and Vaishyas on commerce =\r\nand financial\ncapital. Swami Nithyananda had persons with Brahmin qualities=\r\n performing\nduties that demand Kshatriya and Vaishya skills. This was count=\r\nerproductive.\nThe ashram leaders were selected and trained for skills and r=\r\noles that are\nvery different than this situation demands. Too often their b=\r\nhakti and\nspiritual practice substituted for professional competence in man=\r\naging a\nrapidly growing global enterprise. The sole emphasis was placed on\n=\r\ntraditional Brahmin qualities, and none on what would be considered\nKshatri=\r\nya qualities.\nFor example, there are a large number of white devotees who d=\r\no have\nKshatriyata - leadership expertise, courage and commitment. But even=\r\n after\nthis attack the ashram organization has blundered in its failure to =\r\nleverage\nand deploy them. I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and f=\r\nound them\nremarkably willing to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bot=\r\nhered to\norganize them and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyanand=\r\na has a\nglobal following. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the cris=\r\nis, his\norganization was in utter chaos, reacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the othe=\r\nr side.\nIts leaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after another.=\r\n\nDecisions were being made in desperation and panic. The group was\ncognitiv=\r\nely disoriented and many of its members were psychologically\nbreaking down.=\r\n\n\nThe organization was too much of a one-man show with the leaders operatin=\r\ng\nlike children dependent on the swami for every decision. The swami had\nbe=\r\ncome the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inner circle. Their proximity to\nhim=\r\n became their measure of personal power and identity. This is classical\ncul=\r\nt-like behavior that cannot survive the onslaughts that are inevitable\nnowa=\r\ndays. Such a concentration of all varnas into one man not only makes an\nent=\r\nerprise incompetent, but it also can also get to the leader&#39;s head and\nmake=\r\n him power hungry. Especially when the guru has siddhis, this power can\neas=\r\nily become co-opted by his ego into a dangerous mixture. The result is\nthat=\r\n he surrounds himself with sycophants who tell him what he wants to\nhear, a=\r\nnd this feedback loop of self glorification turns into group\ndelusion.\n\nI n=\r\noticed this in the form of the inner circle&#39;s inability to make common\nsens=\r\ne judgments, and their misrepresenting the facts to their leader by\ngiving =\r\nhim too much &quot;good news.&quot; The result was that the honest truth did\nnot come=\r\n out fast enough to allow pragmatic and realistic planning. I had a\ndifficu=\r\nlt time to get dependable information, and the stories kept changing\nnot on=\r\nly over time but also between one person and another within the group.\nI co=\r\nuld not tell if there was a cover up and if new lies were fabricated to\ncov=\r\ner prior lies. In such an atmosphere one cannot tell which individuals\nmigh=\r\nt have a separate stake and vested interest from the group. Lacking\ncompete=\r\nnt Kshatriyas, the swami had not anticipated that such a crisis was\never po=\r\nssible, despite the fact that outsiders (including myself in my 2-day\ntalks=\r\n at his ashram) had explained to them the threats facing every\nprominent Hi=\r\nndu mahatma today.\nWhile on the one hand I blame those in positions of resp=\r\nonsibility at the\nashram, ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibi=\r\nlity as he selected\nthem, defined their roles, evaluated their performance,=\r\n motivated and\nsupervised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual =\r\ncapabilities had\nfailed to evaluate those very close to him as well as the =\r\nexternal reality.\nAn enlightened master must do better than this, or else h=\r\ne must not try to\ncontrol everything so personally.\nI acknowledge that bein=\r\ng a global guru is very demanding today, given that\none has to represent a =\r\nvery old tradition authentically and yet in a manner\nthat appeals to modern=\r\n people. This is why Hindu leaders need a crash course\non matters that are =\r\nwell beyond the traditional education in their own\nsampradayas (lineages).\n=\r\n\nHindu Chaos\nSwami Nithyananda&#39;s own support base in India has started to d=\r\nistance itself\nout of self preservation amidst all the rumors and slander. =\r\nHis closest\nsupporters were not approached soon enough with his side of the=\r\n story, and\nby the time they were approached the damage to his credibility =\r\nwas already\nirreversible. They did not want to risk being associated with a=\r\n &quot;fallen\nguru.&quot; Many Hindu gurus have started to publicly lash out against =\r\nthe\n&quot;fallen godman&quot;; others became silent or neutral publicly, while offeri=\r\nng\nprivate sympathy but refusing to stick their necks out.\n\nOne factor is t=\r\nhat the swami&#39;s approach was too conservative for some and\ntoo liberal for =\r\nothers. It is too filled with deities, symbols and rituals\nof a very orthod=\r\nox kind for the aesthetic taste of modern global gurus who\npropagate a whit=\r\nened, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism that is abstract and\nmetaphysical but de=\r\nvoid of imagery associated with &quot;primitive paganism.&quot; At\nthe other end of t=\r\nhe spectrum are orthodox Hindu leaders who find his idea\nof youthful dancin=\r\ng, celebration, and liberal atmosphere to be not &quot;real&quot;\nHinduism. A couple =\r\nof shankaracharyas interviewed on NDTV lashed out against\n&quot;false&quot; gurus and=\r\n claimed that only the shankaracharyas had the authority to\ncertify who was=\r\n qualified to be a guru. So Swami Nithyananda fits neither\nend of this spec=\r\ntrum.\n\nMany of the gurus I met have told me in confidence that they fear th=\r\nat\nsimilar attacks are coming to more Hindu gurus, but that there is no cen=\r\ntral\nHindu mechanism to deal with these episodes along the lines of various=\r\n\nChurch mechanisms that intervene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent=\r\n\nfeelers to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to=\r\n\nstep in and take over the ashram and its related organizations, thereby\nbr=\r\ninging new management to clean up matters and bring stability to the\nenterp=\r\nrise. I was told that while this was a &quot;good idea in principle,&quot; it\nwas not=\r\n practical because HDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.\n\nThe Way Fo=\r\nrward\nMy overriding concern throughout this investigation has been to find =\r\na way\nto do damage control in order to protect the broader interests of dha=\r\nrma.\nThis requires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affairs, it see=\r\nms\nthat the mess cannot be created without the swami leaving the movement a=\r\nnd\ngoing into a strictly private life of meditation and self inquiry. I wor=\r\nry\nfor the young ashramites who I feel are amazing individuals but in need =\r\nof\nproper mentoring. They have a solid commitment to the cause and their\npe=\r\nrsonal spiritual paths, but they lack the sophistication and maturity to\nde=\r\nal with what they face today.\n\nSwami Nithyananda should resign immediately =\r\nand hand over all his\norganizations to senior spiritual masters, preferably=\r\n Shaivites practicing\nthe Shiva Sutras and related traditions. He told me i=\r\nn an interview hat I\nrecorded on March 9th that he was willing to leave eve=\r\nrything and become a\nwandering sadhu again. I wish that interview had been =\r\naired.\n\nThe new spiritual leaders would give the ashram a new life and chan=\r\nce to\nrevive itself. It could either remain a place for spiritual training =\r\nor turn\nitself into a Hindu social service organization. Either way it woul=\r\nd be a\nbetter outcome than the likely alternative of the government steppin=\r\ng in to\ntake over the ashram and turn it over to administrators who are not=\r\n\npositively disposed to Hindu spirituality =96 as has happened in numerous\n=\r\nsimilar cases of government takeovers of Hindu temples and organizations\nde=\r\nspite government claims of its actions being &quot;secular&quot;.\n\nBesides giving up =\r\nthe organization, Swami Nithyananda should return to his\npersonal sadhana u=\r\nnder the guidance of these spiritual leaders. Let them\nevaluate him and his=\r\n organization, and issue their independent report to the\npublic. Swami Nith=\r\nyananda should fearlessly and humbly submit himself to\ntheir judgment of wh=\r\nat happened and what the remedies ought to be.\n\nHinduism has survived for m=\r\nany millennia and faced many kinds of crises,\njust like all the other major=\r\n religions of the world. It has its own\ninternal resources and mechanisms t=\r\no deal with such situations. These need\nto be put to use and they need to b=\r\necome modernized. This is not the last\nsuch scandal Hindu groups are going =\r\nto face in the near future.\n---\n\n&quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil=\r\n is bound to persist so long as\none does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa\n\r\n--000e0cd146f81d47ba04821677cc\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Namaste:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An article about Swami Nityananda.

I was also finalizing my new=\r\n book which deals specifically with Tamil Nadu religious politics, and in p=\r\narticular with the role of various nexuses based overseas. So I decided to =\r\njump into the eye of the storm of this scandal in order to investigate whet=\r\nher similar nexuses were at work in this case. Naturally, at one level I ha=\r\nve seen this scandal through the framework of a civilization encounter in w=\r\nhich Vedic culture is pitted against the Dravidian divisiveness that is bei=\r\nng backed by Christian evangelism. At another level, I found that the sensa=\r\ntionalized media reports were too one-sided, and none of them had a single =\r\nstatement to report from the swami himself. Furthermore, there was chaos an=\r\nd mismanagement of the crisis from Swami Nithyananda&#39;s inner circle. In=\r\n hindsight, things might have turned out differently had they managed more =\r\nsensibly and faster =96 which I will elaborate later in this article. Given=\r\n this, another interest of mine has been to extrapolate important lessons f=\r\nrom this episode for other Hindu organizations, which I predict will face s=\r\nimilar scandals as and when their weaknesses become understood by those opp=\r\nosed to them. This article highlights my findings at these multiple levels =\r\nand issues.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;During this 2-week investigative period, I have been l=\r\noyal to my pledge to give Swami Nithyananda&#39;s organization the benefit =\r\nof doubt and to report their side of the story. Besides wanting to balance =\r\nout the one-sided media depictions, I wanted access to the ashram&#39;s cor=\r\ne group for my own research on the broader subject of civilization encounte=\r\nrs. I respect the sensitivities of that organization consisting of many dec=\r\nent and dedicated devotees who have sacrificed a great deal and stand to lo=\r\nse a lot.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But I have concluded that the situation is now beyond re=\r\npair for Swami Nithyananda and that his continued involvement can only dama=\r\nge the broader interests of dharma as well as jeopardize the ashramites. Al=\r\nong with two other sympathizers who are not ashramites, I have personally r=\r\necommended to Swami Nithyananda that the best course at this stage would be=\r\n for him to resign completely from his organization. He should turn it over=\r\n to a small team of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets can be used i=\r\nn the best interests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of these mahatm=\r\nas he must live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institutional respons=\r\nibilities. Because the head of any organization must accept responsibility =\r\nthat &quot;the buck stops here,&quot; only such a move can salvage the orga=\r\nnization and the reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this re=\r\nsignation would hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has built up aga=\r\ninst him personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It is up=\r\n to him to accept or reject this advice. The basis for this conclusion beco=\r\nmes clearer once the reader has gone through the rest of this article. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\nI want to begin by examining some principles about the relationships betw=\r\neen siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality, Tantra and sex. This wi=\r\nll provide the framework in which to interpret what has happened. Then I wi=\r\nll turn to my initial interest in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism i=\r\nn south India from a variety of forces.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Siddhis (Extraordinary=\r\n Yogic Powers) and Morality&lt;br&gt;A few days ago, I had the honor of having a =\r\ntwo-hour private conversation with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Ri=\r\nshikesh. I introduced myself as an independent researcher who is writing a =\r\nseries of books on Indian civilization in the context of the global challen=\r\nges and opportunities. One of my volumes will be specifically on the major =\r\nglobal gurus since the 1960s =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, =\r\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi, Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global g=\r\nurus such as Sri Sri himself. I have been investigating what happened to su=\r\nch gurus, in terms of the shifts in their Western followers over time, thei=\r\nr scandals, their Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru nego=\r\ntiated his/her position sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and=\r\n Western modernity on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Sw=\r\nami Nithyananda will become clear very soon.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The first provocative=\r\n question I asked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic powers: What is the=\r\n relationship between siddhis and morality? If siddhis are a scientific phe=\r\nnomena dealing with powers that can be harnessed by all humans then one mus=\r\nt bear in mind that science deals with truths that are morally neutral. If =\r\nEinstein was declared to have lived an immoral life it would not invalidate=\r\n his scientific theories. A person who designs aircrafts or any other compl=\r\nex technological systems may or may not be moral in order to be effective i=\r\nn his technical work. In other words, rtam (the patterns of the cosmos), wh=\r\nich we discover and call science, functions independently of human morality=\r\n. This is why a scientific principle can be used either morally or immorall=\r\ny, because it is independent of morality. There are moral persons who lack =\r\nany siddhis or even ordinary scientific competence. Conversely, there are g=\r\nreat siddhas (like Ravana) who lack morality. Sri Sri&#39;s pranayama techn=\r\niques would also produce results for an immoral person. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sri Sri s=\r\neemed impressed by this question, and agreed with my overall position on th=\r\ne independence between siddhis and morality. But he pointed out that the mo=\r\nral dimension, while not determining the siddhis, was also important becaus=\r\ne it led to receiving the grace of the divine. I agree with him. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSo there are two separate phenomena involved: (i) spiritual technologies th=\r\nat are objective and that allow anyone to harness spiritual energies, and (=\r\nii) morality which is important in itself, not for attaining siddhis, but i=\r\nn order to have a positive relationship with the divine. Either one can be =\r\ndeveloped without the other; however, the dharma tradition encourages us to=\r\n cultivate both. The reason that meditation systems prescribe things like v=\r\negetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an inappropriate lifestyle interfer=\r\nes with the mental tranquility required to advance. This lifestyle change c=\r\nan be appreciated regardless of whether one believes in a personal God or n=\r\not. This absence of a personal God is clear in Buddhist meditation. Differe=\r\nnt Hindu systems place different levels of emphasis upon a personal God for=\r\n the yoga to function. This is why many secular and scientifically minded p=\r\nersons are also drawn towards meditation techniques. In other words, someth=\r\ning cannot be a science if it depends upon morality, because science is obj=\r\nective and stands independent of morality.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The relevance of this q=\r\nuestion is as follows: Many persons who have learned advanced meditation fr=\r\nom Swami Nithyananda want to know if any moral breaches by him would invali=\r\ndate the whole Hindu claim of achieving higher states of consciousness. Whe=\r\nn a far worse sex scandal against the legendary Swami Muktananda emerged in=\r\n the 1990s, involving charges by a large number of his Western female disci=\r\nples, the Western academy rashly condemned not only one man&#39;s morality,=\r\n but also the whole legitimacy of the Indian tradition itself. In that seri=\r\nes of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah Caldwell, etc.), I took the sa=\r\nme position then as I am taking now: that Muktananda&#39;s capabilities in =\r\nharnessing spiritual energies are separate and independent from whether or =\r\nnot he violated any code of morality. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Patanjali warns against get=\r\nting lured by siddhis which appear along the way when one practices advance=\r\nd meditation persistently. One is not supposed to indulge in them. This war=\r\nning is found in various Hindu systems that deal with the body as a vehicle=\r\n for spiritual evolution, because these energies are very powerful and can =\r\nget out of control. Another point that is worth noting is that the techniqu=\r\nes taught by Swami Nithyananda are not his original ones; he has made it cl=\r\near repeatedly that they are from the Shiva Sutras which have a long histor=\r\ny in our civilization. I feel that he does have the siddhi of being able to=\r\n transmit these techniques very effectively to others. For instance, I have=\r\n never before in my life been able to sit still and alert in meditation for=\r\n the whole night, but he had a few hundred persons in a large hall achievin=\r\ng this. The point here is similar to saying that the mathematics and golf I=\r\n have learned from someone is not invalidated when the teacher is found to =\r\nbe immoral. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued sepa=\r\nrately and independently from whether his siddhis are genuine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Is Ta=\r\nntra a Part of Hinduism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second question that I asked Sri Sri co=\r\nuld not be completely dealt with in the time available for our meeting. I h=\r\nope to pursue this some day with him and with various other acharyas for my=\r\n own benefit. Its significance in the present scandal becomes clear soon. I=\r\n asked whether the Shiva Sutras are valid, pointing out that among the 112 =\r\nspiritual enlightenment techniques taught in them, about 6 deal with sexual=\r\n contact between a male yogi and a female yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well =\r\nas the Tantra traditions have included exemplars that practiced these techn=\r\niques. Recently, Osho tried to revive them and nowadays Deepak Chopra has b=\r\nrought some elements of these into his repertoire. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a =\r\nUS based scholar of Tantra and Kashmir Shaivism, is one of the voices who b=\r\nrings out the authenticity of these approaches in the tradition, despite th=\r\ne common rejections by society at large. The tradition considers itself not=\r\n suitable for mainstream society and is meant only for a small subset of pe=\r\nople.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Many popular Hindu rituals and symbols have emerged out of t=\r\nhe Tantra traditions =96 such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic tr=\r\naditions were not separate until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integratio=\r\nn is found in Adi Shankara all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrato=\r\nr of Vaishnavism who took Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and even more rece=\r\nntly in the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra pr=\r\nactitioners, but they do it privately and not publicly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I have an =\r\nunpublished monograph that shows the history of this shift in Indian consci=\r\nousness concerning Tantr\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
