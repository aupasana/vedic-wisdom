History is =\r\nproof to the fact and many links can be provided of the collosal purposeful=\r\n mistakes done by Nehru and his ilk.Neither is this a conspiracy theory nor=\r\n fringe arguements. For those interested please read Nehru&#39;s role \n\n1.Passi=\r\nng the Endowments act of 1951 which taxes on Hindu temples and gives a free=\r\n reign to others. Till to this day tax is collected on many poor temples wh=\r\nich is directly resulting in dharma being squashed. The then President Raje=\r\nndra Prasad refused to sign the bill.\n\n2.His stubborn insistence on being b=\r\nlind to Chinese aggression beleiving in the Panchashila agreement. Indian g=\r\nenerals have written tomes on it how he got front divisions killed ...many =\r\nbrave young men killed due to his foolishness.\n\n3.Turning over 2/3rds of Ka=\r\nshmir which was already taken by General Manikshaw and Turning over the Iss=\r\nue to the UN which has caused this bloodshed for so many years...\n\nThere is=\r\n proof for each one of this along with Independent Internationally reviewed=\r\n books written by generals and observers and Including the Internationally =\r\nRenowned Time magazine articles and links.\n\n\nHowever bringing this up  will=\r\n deviate the spiritual discussions and I will not attempt that.Nature proba=\r\nbly had its own reasons for sending a person like Nehru.\n\n\nHistory is alway=\r\ns written by the victors ...this is one small example of how false legends =\r\nwhen repeated for 50 yrs become gospel truth. \n\nShri K N Rao that is why al=\r\nways criticized nehru on the basis of his horoscope.
