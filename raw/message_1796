Refer the manual)- over and above i=\r\nt is perfectly fine to offer Aahutis with &#39;Mritunja Mahamantra or Gayatri M=\r\nantra or soime other nantra&#39;. I used to offer initially Mritunjaya and Gaya=\r\ntri Mantra Aahuti during Ganapati Homam but now since a couple of months, i=\r\n have discontinued that and only stick to the 3 suggested above.\n\nIf one pe=\r\nrforms the Homam, over period of time the deity will inspire saadhaka with =\r\nright mantra and attitude. it is best to live with confusions and pray Maha=\r\nGanapati to do anything and everything including removal of doubts. this is=\r\n offcourse my attitude and people need not agree.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal \n \n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Good Question, thanks for this, it would be nice to hear more on=\r\n this subject.\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel that from one perspective all mantras do get you=\r\n to same level\n&gt; at some point in time, if done with correct bhava and surr=\r\nender etc ..\n&gt; \n&gt; What we want is chit shuddhi and to get there, there is e=\r\nvidence\n&gt; people have used different mantras and have reached similar highe=\r\nr levels of conscoiusness.\n&gt; \n&gt; But we still have many mantras too and peop=\r\nle have very unique and differing opinion. Earlier I too felt differently a=\r\nbout each mantra and was curious about it them, always wanting to do the mo=\r\nst potent\n&gt; and powerful mantra so that the progress speeds up but off late=\r\n\n&gt; I feel differently and agree with Narasimha and other to stick to\n&gt; one =\r\nand that one mantra will do the trick, same with homa also\n&gt; \n&gt; I did some =\r\nLord Ganapati and then here and there lord krishna and goddess laxmi devi, =\r\nlord narasimha dev etc and then due to winter stopped doing it,\n&gt; now I am =\r\ngradually starting or thinking about them, may be start with\n&gt; lord ganapat=\r\ni homa and try to do it atleast 40 times or so and then\n&gt; may be observe at=\r\n that time what is in store in the mind and also the external circumstances=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; For lord ganpati one mantra that resonates to me at this time is\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nOm Gam Gluam Ganpataye VighnaVinashine swaha&quot;. Please pardon my spelling er=\r\nrors here. I am sure others feel strongly too about other mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; I f=\r\neel a lot of Lord Ganapati Mantras help removing obstacles, and there may b=\r\ne special mantras for special results or expectations,\n&gt; and a lot of peopl=\r\ne feel strongly about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel that one cannot escape prarabdha karm=\r\nas, when sanchit karmas take the form of prarabdha karmas, sometimes we get=\r\n good direction and get special mantras and they may help but also at times=\r\n even trying special mantras one seem to not get any help over prarabdha ka=\r\nrma. It is all play of conciousness and unfolding or fruitification of karm=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; May be I digressed and moved in different direction, I thought it i=\r\ns important to see different mantras in the light of achiving progress in s=\r\npiriruality, overcoming obstacles, and our curiocity at times help us get c=\r\nonfused and lost.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do believe one should understand about different m=\r\nantras and firmly pick quickly with conviction one and use that mantra for =\r\nsome period of time without expecting any results or quick expectations. Ag=\r\nain this applies towards progress in spirituality and not for mantras for w=\r\norldly expectations. That is a different thing altogether, for instance som=\r\neone wants a child or someone wants to get married or overcome some challen=\r\nges, there are mantras for it and one should consult experts on mantra shas=\r\ntra, and many times the karmas do play their role and to the extent possibl=\r\ne it is better to let it play and be done with it and move forward.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar=\r\n&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pranam!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As suggested by you i have =\r\nswitched over to Ganapati mantra. I picked on &quot;om gam ganapataye namah&quot; bec=\r\nause it is short and simple. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My curiousity has been aroused about=\r\n the different &quot;quality&quot; of mantras. The above mantra is supposed to be a &quot;=\r\nmoola&quot; mantra and also a &quot;bija&quot; mantra for ganapati. Can you explain the si=\r\ngnificance of this?As a remover of obstacles which other mantra would you s=\r\nuggest for ganapati? i am drawn to &quot;aum vakratundaya hum&quot; also, but do not =\r\nknow how to pronounce the mantra correctly and neither do i know what is th=\r\ne &quot;correct&quot; intonation for this. Should i stick to one main mantra only? To=\r\nday, the mahamrityunjaya mantra came spontaneously towards the end of the h=\r\nomam and i found myself reciting it mentally. Should i resist doing this si=\r\nnce you have advised that i should do Ganapati mantra at least for a month?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thankyou\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards and best wishes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
