Sri Yogeshwar was a very hig=\r\nhly\nrealized saint. His book is very good. He does mention about his\nprevoi=\r\nus birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also confirmed\nthe same thi=\r\nng. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized saint too.\n\nSri Yogeshwar =\r\nhad many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and Naamdev\nand also many othe=\r\nr saints too. The initiation he got on the bank of\nriver Narmada awakened h=\r\nis kundalini and he has described very\naccurately the state and symptoms af=\r\nter awekaning of kunalini. He had\nvery good command on all aspects of sprit=\r\nuality and was a fantastic\norator. His followers have done a very good job =\r\nof putting up the web\nsite and sharing the information for free both audio =\r\nand books.\n\nChiti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, Ramak=\r\nrishna\nmay have taken birth as more than one person and in future may take\n=\r\nmore births.\n\nHis comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others use pa=\r\nrdon my\nlack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifest from time to t=\r\nime\nAfter reading this and other books, I feel that each one of us has a\nin=\r\nner guru along with our atma and this inner guru in conjunction with\nour ac=\r\ncumulated or sanchit sankaras give us visions of these mahatmas\nor help us =\r\nattach or attract to a Saint or some aspects of the saint\nmore than others.=\r\n This inner guru is the same in all humam beings but\nmanifests uniquely bas=\r\ned on each person. \n\nI also believe that one needs to get initiated by a Gu=\r\nru who is\npresent in physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.=\r\n\nThere are many instances of other forms of inititations like\ninitiation in=\r\n dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms of\ninitiations though ve=\r\nry important are very rare or uncommon.\n\n\nAfter reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s boo=\r\nk I had some questions pop up in my\nmind about him.\n\n1) What was the purpos=\r\ne of his birth? Yes he may have guided many\nspiritual aspirants, but there =\r\nhas to be something more unique.\n2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he ke=\r\neps mentioning in the book\nabout it in many places? Was he satisfied? How d=\r\nid he feel after that?\n3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the =\r\nmiddle of giving\nspirtual talks? It seems unusual.\n\nI have also read somewh=\r\nere that once a person reaches a spiritual\nstate, he cannot remain in human=\r\n body for more than few days, was this\nthe case?\n\nMay be others who have re=\r\nad this book can share more light.\nI do recommend to seekers of spirutualit=\r\ny to read this book if one has\ntime, it is available for free to download a=\r\ns a pdf book on his web site.\n\nSri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work f=\r\nor the betterment and\nupliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown. He=\r\n spread the Devi\nGayatri mantra/homa and other things in a big way all arou=\r\nnd india.\n\nI feel like I have not even begun my spiritual journey which is =\r\nvery\nvery long too and many obstacles in the path.\n\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nwrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri =\r\nRam Sharma \n&gt; Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAnother as intresting as well as equally confusing thing is that \n&gt; Late Sh=\r\nri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about \n&gt; his past life=\r\n and he also indirectly indicated in his biography that \n&gt; he was Thakur Ra=\r\nmkrishna in the previous birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; I know\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinji\n&gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I would like to mention something that may be an interesting \n&gt; insight.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya. He actually said in his\n&gt; &gt; aut=\r\nobiography ( Hamari Virasat aur Vasiyat, My Inheritances and \n&gt; Will,\n&gt; &gt; l=\r\noosely translated) that once when he was 14 years old and sitting \n&gt; for\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; his Morning Sandhya,  a divine figure appeared, guru\n&gt; &gt; Sarweshwaranandj=\r\ni. His Guru then made him realise his past lives \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; gave him the wo=\r\nrk for this life.\n&gt; &gt; He took him back as in a flash to the past. He realis=\r\ned that he had\n&gt; &gt; been born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and before =\r\nthat Guru \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I will try t=\r\no locate the exact link and send it.The general site is\n&gt; &gt; www.awgp.org I =\r\nremember the book is there on pdf in English \n&gt; somewhere\n&gt; &gt; online.

This is an unbelievable ex=\r\nperience that I\n&gt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am w=\r\nriting \n&gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the pe=\r\nriod of \n&gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious moo=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post offic=\r\ne near \n&gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late =\r\nfee allowance \n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just op=\r\nposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship w=\r\nith some \n&gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call=\r\n him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he wa=\r\ns always talking \n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There =\r\nwas a weekly \n&gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing d=\r\nevotional songs created \n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was=\r\n reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending t=\r\nhis weekly \n&gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr.=\r\n Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm aft=\r\ner duty hours\n&gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we=\r\n were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; some gue=\r\nst have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My \n&gt; son\n&gt; &gt; will c=\r\nome in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At one a=\r\nnother incident he told me that there will be a plane \n&gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; tomorrow=\r\n and that also happened. I was very much impressed about \n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; He cou=\r\nld foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, \n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; told=\r\n me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; went to=\r\n Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; on th=\r\ne way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe tha=\r\nt he had some super \n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship =\r\nonly. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also =\r\nbe disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I=\r\n surrendered \n&gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Th=\r\nakur picture. I prayed \n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his =\r\nfollower and bestow his \n&gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussio=\r\nn with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to =\r\nstart from 7 am I was \n&gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife i=\r\nn the morning that I have\n&gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My=\r\n wife was annoyed and \n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy =\r\nshould you take such a hasty \n&gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a d=\r\nevotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He \n&gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru sh=\r\nould be living one, who can guide us, \n&gt; give\n&gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Bette=\r\nr you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma \n&gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; since you are doing Gay=\r\natri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as peop=\r\nle in general not \n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thoug=\r\nht-- yes I have taken\n&gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Pat=\r\nel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was tell=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. =\r\nPatel \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has=\r\n never \n&gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to ou=\r\nr house \n&gt; within\n&gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection=\r\n for Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2=80&quot;=E2=80=\r\n=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I praye=\r\nd Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; &gt; decision and =\r\nconvince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence \n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; today.=\r\n=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=98 How dare yo=\r\nu test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; &gt; Yesterday was my nig=\r\nht duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; &gt; mornings today and trie=\r\nd to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n&gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told=\r\n me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s \n&gt; house. He\n&gt; &gt; is waiting =\r\nfor you. He wants to test me. I will show you his \n&gt; house=E2=80=9D\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; y=\r\nour house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are \n&gt; disturbing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhim in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We bot=\r\nh were so excited and surprised that we had no words that\n&gt; &gt; Morning. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. \n&gt; There\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will \n&gt; write\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; it sometime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still =\r\nalive on the\n&gt; &gt; earth.
