Now listen=\r\n to the science of selfless service (Seva), endowed \nwith which you will fr=\r\nee yourself from all Karmic bondage, or sin. \n(2.39)\n\nNo effort is ever los=\r\nt in selfless service, and there is no adverse \neffect. Even a little pract=\r\nice of the discipline of selfless service \nprotects one from the great fear=\r\n of repeated birth and death. (2.40)\n\nA selfless worker has resolute determ=\r\nination for God-realization, but \nthe desires of the one who works to enjoy=\r\n the fruits of work are \nendless. (2.41)\n\nTHE VEDAS DEAL WITH BOTH MATERIAL=\r\n AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF LIFE \n\nThe misguided ones who delight in the melo=\r\ndious chanting of the Veda -\n- without understanding the real purpose of th=\r\ne Vedas -- think, O \nArjuna, as if there is nothing else in the Vedas excep=\r\nt the rituals \nfor the sole purpose of obtaining heavenly enjoyment. (2.42)=\r\n\n\nThey are dominated by material desires, and consider the attainment \nof h=\r\neaven as the highest goal of life. They engage in specific rites \nfor the s=\r\nake of prosperity and enjoyment. Rebirth is the result of \ntheir action. (2=\r\n.43)\n\nThe resolute determination of Self-realization is not formed in the \n=\r\nminds of those who are attached to pleasure and power, and whose \njudgment =\r\nis obscured by ritualistic activities. (2.44)\n\nA portion of the Vedas deals=\r\n with three modes =AD goodness, passion, and \nignorance =AD of material Nat=\r\nure. Become free from pairs of opposites, \nbe ever balanced and unconcerned=\r\n with the thoughts of acquisition and \npreservation. Rise above these three=\r\n modes, and be Self-conscious, O \nArjuna. (2.45)\n\nTo a Self-realized person=\r\n the Vedas are as useful as a small \nreservoir of water when the water of a=\r\n huge lake becomes available. \n(2.46)\n\n____________________________________=\r\n___________________________\n\n\nOvercoming Negativity\n\n&quot;Negative emotions - s=\r\nuch as fear, sadness, depression, grief, and \nguilt =96 cannot be ignored. =\r\n But neither should they be given power \nthat they don&#39;t have.  All negativ=\r\ne emotions can be overcome with \nGod&#39;s love, just as shadows naturally disa=\r\nppear in the clear presence \nof light.&quot;  \n\n                                =\r\n  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\n________________________________________=\r\n____________________\n\n\nThe Power of Focus\n\n&quot;Focus and concentration are eve=\r\nrything.  If you can learn to focus \nall of your attentive energy like a la=\r\nser beam, there will be no \ntask, no goal, no dream that you cannot realize=\r\n in this world.&quot;\n\n                                  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka=\r\n Acharya\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\nSe=\r\nek the Seeker\n\n&quot;We are all seeking so many things =96 career, love, success=\r\n, fame.  \nBut who is it that seeks?  If you don&#39;t know your own self, how c=\r\nan \nyou truly know success in what you seek?  Seek your true self first.  \n=\r\nSeek the seeker.  Success will follow automatically.&quot;  \n\n                  =\r\n                - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\n__________________________=\r\n__________________________________\n\n\nAlways Reach Further\n\n&quot;Progress means =\r\never seeking to exceed your present maximal limits.  \nAlways know that you =\r\nhave even more potential within than you \npresently believe.  Always reach =\r\nfurther.&quot;  \n\n                                  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acha=\r\nrya\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\nTrust\n\n=\r\n&quot;Trust is the most precious gift another person can give us.

Once you&#39;ve given your word to another, it is in keeping=\r\n \nthat word that you gain strength; and it is in going against that \nword t=\r\nhat you become weak.  Once your word is given, do not ever go \nback on that=\r\n word.&quot;\n\n                                  - Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n=\r\n \n____________________________________________________________\n\n\nAccomplish=\r\n Anything\n\n&quot;Always lead a healthy existence.
