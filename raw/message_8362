For=\r\n The Mother Durga, hatred is a boon IMHO.\n\nSo dont worry and keep going....=\r\nblame her, damn her, yell at her as much as you can and keep doing...you ar=\r\ne surely blessed if you really start hating her.\n\nI have a very humerous sh=\r\nort story in this regard which has a deep meaning.\n\nthere was a person in a=\r\n village who used to go to a Temple every morning without fail to praise th=\r\ne Lord and then go to his field for work. in the same village there was ano=\r\nther person who disliked and hated God so much that he also used to visit t=\r\nhe temple Lord every day morning without fail, to just yell at lord, abuse =\r\nthe deity.\n\nOne night, there was a thunderstorm with very hevay rain and in=\r\n the morning, there was waist deep water around temple and it was still rai=\r\nning heavily. The gentle man who liked God thought that It is very heavy ra=\r\nin and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn&#39;t go to temple on that=\r\n morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though could not st=\r\nop himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-s=\r\ntakingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing =\r\nthe deity.\n\nThe lord became very pleased with him and gave him Darshana.\n\n*=\r\n**\n\nAparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you. I know you dont mean wh=\r\nat you wrote and you actually have lot of love for Durga because such words=\r\n of Damn also come out when you love somebody very dearly in your heart os =\r\nhearts.\n\nThis is for the well meaning spiritual people who get hurt by some=\r\n other spiritual people&#39;s temperory disgust and outburst. \n\n\nBest Regards,\n=\r\n\nUtpal\n\nMai na Jaanu, Tu hi jaane....Tu hai meri, main to Tera....\n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Fi=\r\nrst of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while\n&gt; reading,=\r\n time is running out, who knows when you will reach the\n&gt; cremation ground,=\r\n chant and chant.

It becomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; und=\r\nerstand.\n&gt; \n&gt; A little point about love these days, One day a man who is in=\r\n love with\n&gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad=\r\n, in an\n&gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrad=\r\nes and\n&gt; was sweating profusely as expected. He was getting irritated with =\r\nthe\n&gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you w=\r\nant\n&gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; The man looked down in sh=\r\name upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I =\r\nwant him to  go away this very\n&gt; moment, just because my body is trying to =\r\ncool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; All of us look out for him in the winters ca=\r\nlling him, coming out to\n&gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wi=\r\nsh to drive him away, we\n&gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking l=\r\nove??? And to all that\n&gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,=\r\nthe man said.\n&gt; \n&gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun f=\r\norgave him\n&gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could=\r\n say back\n&gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went =\r\nup to 48.\n&gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; \n&gt; In winters we all sing songs =\r\nof loving the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; him, that is not love, its mere=\r\n usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and giv=\r\nes, after all because of him\n&gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxyg=\r\nen which leads to all of us\n&gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Withou=\r\nt him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , n=\r\no gdp, no play.\n&gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true lov=\r\ne it&#39;s called.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for h=\r\nim for all our\n&gt; births combined.\n&gt; I am talking about people outside of al=\r\nl this worship business. And\n&gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; \n&gt; These days, if a=\r\n man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; automatically she is=\r\n a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; the man her body, she=\r\n is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is=\r\n a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; love with a certain girl. The girl ha=\r\ns never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; him, infact is oblivious to his exist=\r\nence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know=\r\n these characters, I myself\n&gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his=\r\n chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you =\r\nask of her from god.\n&gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnat=\r\nh&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya auka=\r\nad ki main ink\n&gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe =\r\npeel meri maa\n&gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more ins=\r\nane than\n&gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then he went on, that who=\r\n told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; love????\n&gt; You love then c=\r\nlaim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; slap!!\n&gt; You people l=\r\nove, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; is to look ou=\r\nt for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; I ask, i am sc=\r\nrewed, because I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; what&#39;s the fun in th=\r\nat, and when did i become big enough to know whats\n&gt; best for me???? yeh to=\r\nh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; should be so intense, =\r\nthat god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and=\r\n I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve m=\r\ne.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; girl, who is eventually h=\r\ner.\n&gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can th=\r\nen\n&gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n=\r\n&gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; me=\r\nan you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; eve=\r\nrything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; hui ha=\r\ni??\n&gt; \n&gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they=\r\n are\n&gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in betwee=\r\nn.\n&gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or =\r\na\n&gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be i=\r\nt\n&gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; =\r\nalways maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; =\r\nwhen he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; ma=\r\nster , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; doggy=\r\n is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; doggy is =\r\nhappy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; \n&gt; Equate dog=\r\ngy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; We are never hap=\r\npy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; expecting butter chicken,=\r\n who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; \n&gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nah=\r\nin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; \n&gt; We act=\r\nually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; then w=\r\ne claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; yeah r=\r\night!!\n&gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer=\r\n????\n&gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies=\r\n so\n&gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt;=\r\n blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; w=\r\nag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; abo=\r\nut the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; nope.=\r\n That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir, if =\r\nyou become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; oye hoye=\r\n sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

The gentle man who liked God thought that It is very heavy ra=\r\nin and i can skip my visit to the temple and he didn&#39;t go to temple on that=\r\n morning. He made peace with his mind. The other person though could not st=\r\nop himself. He went ahead, crossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-s=\r\ntakingly, with great efforts reached the temple and did his job of abusing =\r\nthe deity.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe lord became very pleased with him and gave him Dars=\r\nhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n***&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you.=\r\n I know you dont mean what you wrote and you actually have lot of love for =\r\nDurga because such words of Damn also come out when you love somebody very =\r\ndearly in your heart os hearts.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThis is for the well meaning spiri=\r\ntual people who get hurt by some other spiritual people&#39;s temperory disgust=\r\n and outburst. &lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMai na=\r\n Jaanu, Tu hi jaane....Tu hai meri, main to Tera....&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; reading, time is running out, who knows when you will reach the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\ncremation ground, chant and chant.

It becomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; understand.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A little point about love these days=\r\n, One day a man who is in love with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the sun, was doing homam on , =\r\na sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; open field with no shade, =\r\nin a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was sweating profuse=\r\nly as expected. He was getting irritated with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sweat coming int=\r\no his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; me to hid=\r\ne so that you are comfortable???&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The man looked down in shame upon=\r\n himself and asked himself,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I w=\r\nant him to  go away this very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; moment, just because my body is tryi=\r\nng to cool itself down with sweat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; All of us look out for him in t=\r\nhe winters calling him, coming out to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers=\r\n we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; don&#39;t wish to see his=\r\n face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; look at his love=\r\n, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The man =\r\nwas humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; because=\r\n after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;=\r\nshine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; (That last line was a joke.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In winters we all sin=\r\ng songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him, that is not=\r\n love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; magnanimous he sti=\r\nll gives gives and gives, after all because of him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there is photos=\r\nynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; breathing=\r\n, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; exist=\r\n, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hell, h=\r\ne burns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all =\r\nour&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; births combined.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am talking about people outside of=\r\n all this worship business. And&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there are quite a few.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn=\r\n&#39;t give&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Del=\r\nhi, he is in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken w=\r\nith him, rarely met&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and=\r\n he is lost in god to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know t=\r\nhese characters, I myself&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted t=\r\no his chosen form of our mother,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I asked him if you so love her wh=\r\ny don&#39;t you ask of her from god.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me y=\r\nou forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mother will decide her daughte=\r\nr - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh cha=\r\nhiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; chahiye, apni bhen =\r\nmaraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; quite a lot of pe=\r\nople I have met.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Then he went on, that who told you that=\r\n you are sure to get the one you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; love????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You love then c=\r\nlaim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; slap!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The mo=\r\nment&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but=\r\n then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to =\r\nknow whats&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane=\r\n.  Rather my love&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should be so intense, that god herself should co=\r\nme and tell me &quot;you, my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer =\r\nthat she (god) tells me first&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because=\r\n if I have her, i already have that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; girl, who is eventually her.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can =\r\nthen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge=\r\n. If you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. T=\r\nhat doesn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what=\r\n do I need to do,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ap=\r\ne baap ki naukri kari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hui hai??&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Surrender is yo=\r\nu do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; god&#39;s, the=\r\n results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If yo=\r\nu actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace t=\r\nhis planet, has&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break h=\r\nis tail off by wagging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion a=\r\nnd love. He doesn&#39;t ask the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutt=\r\non, or food. His master brings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t=\r\n bring, still the tail is wagging,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy w=\r\nants master, food is an afterthought.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Equate doggy with =\r\nus , and master with god, and what do we do?????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; We are never happ=\r\ny with what the master brings, because we were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; expecting butter ch=\r\nicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (Haanji madame waale =\r\nhero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lo, Bolo hari bo=\r\nlo gopaal bolo)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we s=\r\nubconsciously want the food, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then we claim to others , oh no n=\r\no, I never want food , I only want him,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; yeah right!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If y=\r\nou only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doe=\r\nsn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do=\r\n, we read&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewh=\r\nere there, but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion =\r\njust like porn.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then y=\r\nou walk on the left handed path,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world =\r\nwill salute you.
