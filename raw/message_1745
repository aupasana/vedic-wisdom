Is it adviseable to use copper spoons? I look forwa=\r\nrd for your advice.\n\nThank you,\nShankar \nDetroit, MI, USA\n\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Ravi Poruri &lt;rporuri@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Hiral,\n&gt;=\r\n      Check out this online site. \n&gt;      http://www.indousplaza.com/copper=\r\n-hawan-kund-p-4818.html?cat=3D8&cPath=3D8_188&osCsid=3D3545d6eae477f0b0f5e5=\r\n1b051bd7d413\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Ravi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ____________________________=\r\n____\n&gt; From: Hiral Desai &lt;hdesai_wakhlu@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 19, 2009 11:38:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Havan Kund\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I live in Massachusetts.
