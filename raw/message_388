There are other technicalities that can be \ndone away =\r\nwith, when they start to block one.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I recently saw the char=\r\nt of a person, who I am sure will make much \nprogress and be in a position =\r\nto guide thousands of people \nspiritually. His chart strongly suggested tha=\r\nt he should chant \nChandipath or do Chandi homam and then progress will com=\r\ne. I told \nhim that. He said he learnt Chandipath sometime ago but he does =\r\nnot \nread it regularly because he does not have the anga nyasam and kara \nn=\r\nyasam text. He cannot read Indian scripts and can only read \nEnglish. Chand=\r\nipath is available in Roman script from Ramakrishna \nmath, but that only ha=\r\ns the thirteen chapters, kavacham, argala and \nkeelakam. It does not give t=\r\nhe nyasas, which are given in the Gita \npress version (available only in In=\r\ndian languages). The poor guy \nassumed he could not do it without proper ny=\r\nasas and did not attempt \nto do it.\n&gt; \n&gt; I told him that 13 chapters are th=\r\ne main thing and all else is \nsecondary. I told him to just start with 13 c=\r\nhapters.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Like this, many people have various ideas about &quot;t=\r\nhe right way&quot; to \ndo it and do not even try things lest they should it do i=\r\nt &quot;a wrong \nway&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, there *are* right ways to do poojas, japa=\r\ns and homas. \nHowever, there are also right ways to do so many things. Let =\r\nme give \nan analogy using eating.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; There are right ways to e=\r\nat too. There are certain mantras you \nshould say before eating, while eati=\r\nng and after eating. There are \nrules for what items should be eaten. There=\r\n are rules for what order \nthey should be served in, on the plate. There ar=\r\ne rules for how the \nserved items are arranged on the plate. There are rule=\r\ns for what \norder you eat them in. There are rules for what kind of plate c=\r\nan be \nused (silver, gloden, copper, banana leaf etc). There are rules for =\r\n\nwhat kind of clothese the person serving food can wear. There are \nrules f=\r\nor what kind of clothes eater can wear. There are many many \nrules.\n&gt; \n&gt; Su=\r\nppose you don&#39;t know some rules. Or suppose you are unable to \nfollow some =\r\nrules and have to compromise. Or suppose you don&#39;t know \nthe mantras to be =\r\nrecited before and after eating. Will you then \nstop eating? Won&#39;t it be fo=\r\nolish to not eat because you cannot \nfollow all the rules and technicalitie=\r\ns of eating? Won&#39;t you \ncompromise wherever you have to and just eat *some*=\r\n food, so that \nyou get some strength and sustain yourself?\n&gt; \n&gt; Friends, t=\r\nhe *same* thing applies to spiritual sadhana. Whether \nyou spend 5 hours or=\r\n 1 hour or half hour or ten minutes everyday on \nspiritual sadhana, it shou=\r\nld be an integral part of your life. It \nshould be as important as eating f=\r\nood, drinking water and breathing \nair. In fact, it really is. Just as not =\r\neating makes you weak, not \ndoing any sadhana also makes you weak. Just as =\r\neating makes you \nstronger, doing some sadhana also makes you stronger.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; People are unnecessarily afraid of spiritual sadhana. They take \nall the =\r\nrules and technicalities too seriously (unlike with other \nthings in life, =\r\nsuch as eating, drinking, bathing etc) and block \nthemselves from progressi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt; This needs to change. People need to know that it is ok to \ncompro=\r\nmise on most things, but important to do *some* sadhana. Just \nas you would=\r\n eat simple dal chaval (lentil soup with rice) or a \nbread and cheese sandw=\r\nich when there is no multi-course meal that \nsatisfies the rules, you can j=\r\nust sit down for 15 minutes without \nmoving and repeat any mantra. Or just =\r\nlight a fire in a silver or \ncopper or clay bowl with sticks, say &quot;Om bhuh =\r\nswaha, Om bhuvah \nswaha, Om suvah swaha, Om bhurbhuvassuvah swaha&quot; and then=\r\n repeat \nsome mantra with swaha added and some ghee drops poured into fire.=\r\n \nSuch a simple sadhana also, when repeated daily, can be powerful. It \nis =\r\ndefinitely better than avoiding sadhana at all, just as eating \njust a brea=\r\nd sandwich is better than not eating at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Rules and tech=\r\nnicalities are there to maximize the experience one \ngets from sadhana. The=\r\ny are NOT there to block or stop one from \ndoing sadhana altogether. That w=\r\nould be counter productive.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each rule, each technicality and each step=\r\n in the standard \nprocedures has some deeper meaning and motive (which is l=\r\nost on \npeople these days!), but it is ok to compromise. If you can, follow=\r\n \n*all* the rules. If you cannot, atleast do *something* with several \nrule=\r\ns compromised, rather than not doing anything at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Too many people =\r\nare suffering from intertia when it comes to \nprogressing spiritually. I se=\r\ne some great souls meant for big things \nalso suffering from inertia at var=\r\nious levels. Unnecessary fear of \nrules and technicalities is part of the r=\r\neason for this inertia.\n&gt; \n&gt; This needs to be changed. Spiritually inclined=\r\n people have to be \nempowered and boldened. The fear and inertia in them ne=\r\ned to be \ndestroyed. This is very much needed for not just for the individu=\r\nal \ngood of those people, but the collective good of world in these \nintere=\r\nsting times.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast.=\r\n net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Unlimited freedom, unlimited storage.=\r\n Get it now, on \nhttp://help.yahoo.com/l/in/yahoo/mail/yahoomail/tools/tool=\r\ns-08.html/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
