A=\r\ns has been said before ad nauseum, to achieve specific material desires one=\r\n needs to be perfect in pronounciation and intonation, materials offered ne=\r\ned to be pristine and all the rituals need to be followed precisely. And of=\r\n course as Narasimha has emphasized the sadhak needs to be satwik and have =\r\nsome accumulated spiritual energy.\n\nMy suggestion is do it with the feeling=\r\n of pleasing Lord Mahaganapthi. Do it for his pleasure. Do it for Him to be=\r\nstow His grace on you. Do it with an attitude of thankfulness for what you =\r\nhave. Do it with the feeling of gratefulness for what you already posses fo=\r\nr things can always be worse. And then sit back and watch as Lord Mahaganap=\r\nthi showers his grace and blessings. If you cultivate the above attitude co=\r\nnsciously it will permeate your subconsciousness and your homam will be tha=\r\nt much more better. As one of the stalwart of our group Rajarshi has aptly =\r\nsaid keeping working persistently on your devotion to Mahaganapthi.\n\nGod do=\r\nes not need our prayers, homas or japam. And He cannot be bribed either. Bu=\r\nt if performed with humility and loving devotion He might accept it.\n\nNot p=\r\nontificating at all but I have been performing homas regularly for the last=\r\n several months and can attest to the powerful effects on one&#39;s attitude, p=\r\nersonality and overall thinking.\n\nRegards,\nAlok.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Biswajit,\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; If you keep doing Mahaganapati homas regularly for a few months I am =\r\nsure things will become better.
