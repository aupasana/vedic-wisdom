It has been observed t=\r\nhat if you place coconut pieces where white portion remains up (pieces rest=\r\n on dark side) then there are all the chances that pieces may not burnt ful=\r\nly. this is my personal experience. so i can suggest few things as under:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep Dark side up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep the pieces s=\r\nuch that they don&#39;t pile on each other.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep the pieces such =\r\na way that it forms a pyramid shape (top of that shape is opened so that Aa=\r\nhuti can be offered conveniently in that. i mean, there should be a scope f=\r\nor air to pass under the pieces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my experien=\r\nce that coconut peices do get burnt completely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Be=\r\nst Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 1)While doing homam can we move the coconut pieces that are there in th=\r\ne havan kund, so that they get burned easily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i asked it be=\r\ncoz would it be right to poke in the fire with a stick while we are actuall=\r\ny assuming Ganpati is in that fire and the idol at that time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.
