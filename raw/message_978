I \nwas really afraid of doing it wrong (esp. my ishta devta =\r\nis nrisingha \ndeva and I wanted to be careful)\n I have a problem though, I =\r\nam trying as much as i can, but two \nthings are happening that are not unde=\r\nr my control and your guidance \nwill be kindly appreciated.\n1. I try really=\r\n hard to feel bhakti but i try to keep my mind as \ndistraction less as poss=\r\nible , but neither i feel bhakti and as i am \naware of all the distractions=\r\n throughout the japa, i really feel bad \nat the end of it. What else should=\r\n i be doing to atleast feel my \nattachment toward my ishta devta.\n\n2. the l=\r\naya of mantra changes slowly. after some purascharans, the \nmelody changes =\r\nand different characters starts getting different \nemphasis e.g. when sayin=\r\ng nrisihgha , gha comes out more vocal no \nmatter what i try. should i be s=\r\nticking to one laya , should i let it \nmold as i keep doing it?\n\nRegards\n\n =\r\n\n\n\n"}}
