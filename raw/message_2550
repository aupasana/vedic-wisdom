Is that a fact?=94 Laughingly Bhagavan said=\r\n, =93Yes, while I was\nin Virupaksha Cave, some ladies from the north came.\n=\r\n\nI was sitting on a platform under the tamarind tree with half-closed eyes,=\r\n\nwithout particularly noticing their arrival. I thought they would go away\n=\r\nafter a while.\n\nSuddenly there was a noise of breaking something. I therefo=\r\nre opened my eyes\nand saw coconut water trickling down my head.\n\nOne of tho=\r\nse ladies had done that abhisekam. What was I to do? I was in\nmouna and cou=\r\nldn=92t talk. I had no towel even to wipe the water off, and so\nthe water d=\r\nried on my body as it was.\n\nNot only that. There used to be lighting of cam=\r\nphor, pouring of water on the\nhead, thirthas (sacred waters), prasadas, and=\r\n several such troublesome\nperformances. It used to be quite a job stopping =\r\nsuch things.=94\n\nI myself have seen similar instances some four or five yea=\r\nrs back. In the\nroom where Bhagavan takes his bath, there is a hole through=\r\n which the water\nthat is used drains out.Below that, a gutter was construct=\r\ned to drain off\nthe water.\n\nAt the time of his bathing, some devotees used =\r\nto gather at that place,\nsprinkle on their heads the water that came out of=\r\n the room, wipe their eyes\nand even use it for achamaniyam (sipping drops o=\r\nf water for religious\npurposes).\n\nThat was going on quietly and unobserved =\r\nfor some time. But in due course\npeople began bringing vessels and buckets =\r\nto gather that water and soon\nthere was a regular queue.\n\nThat naturally re=\r\nsulted in some noise which reached Bhagavan=92s ears. He\nenquired and found=\r\n out the facts. Addressing the attendants,he said, =93Oh! Is\nthat the matte=\r\nr? When I heard the noise I thought it was something else.\n\nWhat nonsense! =\r\nWill you get this stopped or shall I bathe at the tap\noutside? If that is d=\r\none, you will be saved the trouble of heating water for\nme,and there will b=\r\ne no trouble for them either, to watch and wait for that\ntirtha. What do I =\r\nwant? Only two things, a towel and a koupinam.\n\nI can bathe and then rinse =\r\nthem at the tap and that completes the job. If\nnot the tap, you have the hi=\r\nll streams and the tanks. Why this bother? What\ndo you say?=94\n\nWhen Bhagav=\r\nan thus took them to task, they told everything to Sarvadhikari\nwho thereup=\r\non put a ban on any one going to the side of the bath room during\nthe bathi=\r\nng hour.\n\nAnother thing happened during those days. Bhagavan used to go to =\r\nthe hill in\nthe hot sun after taking meals in the forenoon.\n\nOn his return,=\r\n when he came to the platform near the hall, the attendants\nused to pour wa=\r\nter on his feet from the kamandalu (wooden bowl) and he used\nto wash his fe=\r\net\nand then go in.\n\nSome used to hide somewhere there and, as soon as he we=\r\nnt into the hall,\nthey used to collect that water and sprinkle it on their =\r\nheads.\n\nOnce an enquiry starts, all faults come to light, don=92t they? Bha=\r\ngavan\nappears to have noticed that also. One afternoon he saw through the w=\r\nindow\nan old and long standing devotee sprinkling this water on his head.\n\n=\r\nSeizing that opportunity, he began saying, =93There it is! See that! As I h=\r\nave\nnot been taking any special notice of it, it is going beyond all limits=\r\n.\nHowever long they are here and however often they hear what I say, these\n=\r\nridiculous things do not stop.\n\nWhat is it they are doing? I shall hencefor=\r\nth stop washing my feet, do you\nunderstand?=94 He thus reprimanded them sev=\r\nerely. That devotee was stunned,and\nwith shame and grief, went to Bhagavan =\r\nimmediately and begged to be excused.\n\nNot only did Bhagavan admonish him l=\r\nike that, but from the next day onwards,\nBhagavan refused to wash his feet =\r\nthere even though the attendants pleaded\nwith him to retain the existing cu=\r\nstom.\n\nSource: Letters from Sri Ramanasramam VOLUMES I, II & Letters from a=\r\nnd\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasramam By SURI NAGAMMA Translated by D.
