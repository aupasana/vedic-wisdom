The boy ca=\r\nme to Gauthama Rishi for knowledge and the Rishi asked him for his gotra. T=\r\nhe boy goes back to his mother and finds out that his mother is not aware o=\r\nf who the father was.\n\n\nThis is a popular misconception. Satyakama asks his=\r\n mother this\nquestion upfront. The mother does not know her child&#39;s gotra. =\r\nWhy? In\nolden days, women married young, and did not ask questions such as\n=\r\n&quot;Who are you? What is your gotra?&quot; to their husband. (In some areas,\nthis i=\r\ns still taboo today.) Over time, the gotra would be repeated\nduring various=\r\n samskara&#39;s, she would naturally remember it. The\nconclusion here is that h=\r\ner husband, whom she served with devotion,\ndied young.\n\n\n&gt; The boy comes ba=\r\nck and says the same to Rishi Guathama, who says that he shall teach the bo=\r\ny as the boy belongs to the gotra of truth, and thus by default is a Brahma=\r\nna.\n\n\nThe seers were tri-kAla-darshi-s. Gautama knew of his boy&#39;s pedigree\n=\r\nbefore asking him the question. After hearing his answer, he says &quot;A\nnon-br=\r\nahmin could not have said this . . . you have not swerved from\nthe truth&quot;. =\r\n&quot;satyam&quot; is explained as &quot;brAhmaNa-jAti-dharma&quot;.\n\nFirst, you have a jAti-br=\r\nAhmaNa who desires to go to a preceptor, on\nhis own, during childhood. He t=\r\nhen answers the preceptor&#39;s question\ntruthfully, in his mother&#39;s own words,=\r\n without embellishment. This is\na very rare set of events. Of course the ac=\r\nharyA sees the worthy\nstudent in front of him.\n\nbhavadIyaH,\n\n      ajit\n\n"}}
