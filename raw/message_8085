Full cocon=\r\nut(with skin) resembles the human head, burning the full coconut resembles =\r\nthe burning of our ego(I-ness)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. When the &quot;homam kunda&quot; is big enough=\r\n could burn a full coconut comfortably with wood log... In a small &quot;homam k=\r\nunda&quot;... its really adventurious! :) simply... it would not burn...\n&gt; \n&gt; 4.=\r\n Whether dry or not, the coconut slice should burn beautifully with wood lo=\r\ng and enough ghee...\n&gt; \n&gt; Best of luck...\n&gt; \n&gt; *** &quot;Its amazing how god mak=\r\nes his devotees do homams even in muslim land&quot; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; Priya Ji, it hurts =\r\nme... all we are the child of god! all path ends towords god! if the muslim=\r\n world exist... then there must be some intention of mother! after all... i=\r\nts her universe...\n&gt; \n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
