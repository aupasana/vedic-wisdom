They do not \nwant to ensure that their breathing is uniform, regular and relaxed all \nthe time, but they want to do a breathing exercise for 10 minutes \neveryday and ensure uniform, regular and relaxed breathing during that \ntime. People do not want to eat healthy food in moderation always, but \nwant to overeat junk at most times and fast now and then to compensate \nfor it. They do not want to pray to god regularly, but want to make it \nup one day every week or month or year by going to a temple/church or \ndoing a ritual.\n\nFriends, this approach isn&#39;t useful. Maintaining regularity and \nuniformity can work wonders.\n\nBreath calmly and regularly at all times and not just during pranayama. \nEat a balanced good moderately, just to sustain the physical body, and \nstop eating emotionally because something looks nice or smells nice and \nfasting now and then. Pray to god more regularly and, in fact, keep god \nin your mind at all times. Carry love and caring attitude for people \naround you, like parents, siblings, spouse, children, friends and \nrelatives, at all times and not just on special days.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
