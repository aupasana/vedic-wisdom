They are the oldest of the world scriptures.\n\nVedas, literally meanin=\r\ng the (true) knowledge, are not only the\nepitomes of philosophical, spiritu=\r\nal and religious vision, dogmas and\naptitudes, but also are a storehouse of=\r\n sociological\nprocesses, historical events and verily, the\ncultural thread =\r\nof the Indian subcontinent. However, most of us,\nwhether Indians or foreign=\r\ners, have failed to read correctly into\nthese great literature.\n\nIn an atte=\r\nmpt to understand these super scriptures, I have not only\ncreated web pages=\r\n http://www.geocities.com/siva_sai19/vedas, which\nhave had a wide acclamati=\r\non from the netizens, but also recently\nstarted a group on Vedic history.\n\n=\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedichistory\n\nThis group endeavors to read in=\r\nto the currently available Vedas and\nmake the reading a commentary on the h=\r\nistorical, cultural and\nspiritual saga of ancient India\n\nHowever, in Vedic =\r\nhistory, instead of projecting my views, I like\nmore learned and the common=\r\ners alike to join and exchange views.\n\nI cordially invite every one of you,=\r\n especially the spiritually\nelevated, to join my group to make it a success=\r\n and useful to others.\n\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedichistory/join \n\nI hope y=\r\nou will join and actively participate in this\nhumble, yet noble and holy, e=\r\nndeavor.\n\nMy other groups:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ancientindia\nhttp:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedicastrology-hyderabad\n\nRegards,\nKishore patnaik=\r\n\n\nKishorepatnaik09[at]gmail.com \n\n\n"}}
