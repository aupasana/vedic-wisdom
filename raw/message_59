There is a sma=\r\nll story behind it.\n\nMy spiritual guru Dr Manish Pandit had a dream a few y=\r\nears back. In the dream, eight Siddhas took him to Chennai and showed him a=\r\n big fire there. They told him that Mahaganapathi homam would be performed =\r\nby lakhs of people in future across the world and that the big fire was due=\r\n to that movement. They told him that this fire had to be lit now and that =\r\nhe had to start spreading Mahaganapathi homam in the world. He wondered if =\r\nspreading homam in Kali yuga was a good idea. They told him it was. They sa=\r\nid that even many religiously inclined and good people do not get to spend =\r\nmany hours everyday in sadhana unlike in the old days and that the times ar=\r\ne changing. With people spending a small amount of time on spiritual sadhan=\r\na everyday, they said a more powerful sadhana like homam is needed. An half=\r\n hour homam everyday is equivalent to 5 hours of meditation. In old days, p=\r\neople were happily spending 5 hours in meditation each day. That is no long=\r\ner possible for most people these days and hence homam can help. The Siddha=\r\ns told him that homam was very much needed in today&#39;s times. As adharma inc=\r\nreases in the world, more people need to be doing homam on a regular basis =\r\nto counter it.\n\nA few years after this dream, we went to the Kalikambal tem=\r\nple in Chennai for a Shata Chandi Homam. At that event, Manish Pandit saw t=\r\nhe same eight Siddhas who had earlier come in his dream. They were meditati=\r\nng on the premises of the Kalikambal temple!\n\nAfter doing his 21st Chandipa=\r\natham of the Shata Chandi, the Divine Mother appeared before him on a Frida=\r\ny afternoon. The temple was closed then and only Manish Pandit and another =\r\nperson were inside. Nobody else was around. The other person did not see th=\r\ne Divine Mother, but he reported that he smelled something out of the ordin=\r\nary and was baffled. The Divine Mother told Manish Pandit to start spreadin=\r\ng Mahaganapathi homam and said that the resources needed would be arranged.=\r\n The very next day, Swami Sathasivom had a friend gift some books on Mahaga=\r\nnapathi homam to Manish Pandit and me! Later, one thing led to another and =\r\nI have put together the document and the audio that is now available on my =\r\nwebsite (see below). Our idea was to come up with a simple Vedic procedure =\r\nthat takes only 30-45 minutes, which any householder can do as a daily prac=\r\ntice. We have some people actually doing this homam daily for several month=\r\ns now.\n\nI have revealed the above with permission from Manish Pandit.\n\nI gu=\r\ness the Siddhas who decided to spread Mahaganapathi homam simply chose us a=\r\ns the instruments and arranged things for us. In fact, how my wife and I me=\r\nt Swami Sathasivom in Boston and how it was decided to have the Shata Chand=\r\ni Homam with Manish Pandit at Chennai Kalikambal temple was all very intere=\r\nsting. A lot of interesting coincidences led to the preparation of the Maha=\r\nganapathi homam manual and audio. Hopefully, some more people will be able =\r\nto put the resources to practical use.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audi=\r\no: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannat=\r\nh.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_006D_01C7AA8B.DC4AE3A0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16441&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; font-color: black=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \ntitle=3Dpvr@... href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;=\r\nNarasimha P.V.R.
