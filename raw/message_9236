Bhargava=\r\n Rama is Venus as \nper Maharshi Pararsara. Venus is the spirit of happiness=\r\n within us. I \nwill explain how Bhargava Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how the \n=\r\nsense of happiness operates in its perfected form.\n=A0\nThis kind of subtle =\r\nesoteric understanding is difficult to put in words, but I will try my best=\r\n.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nJamadagni\n (jamat=\r\n+agni=3Dconstantly consuming fire) stands for divine awareness. \nRenuka (re=\r\nnu=3Dparticle) stands for matter. She was so pure that she could\n hold wate=\r\nr in a pot made of unbaked clay. When purified matter is \ninfused with divi=\r\nne awareness, it gives rise to a perfected form of \nhappiness or bliss.\n=A0=\r\n\nThis happiness is liberating in nature and \nso Bhargava Rama is a brahmana=\r\n and a rishi. This perfected form of \nhappiness is also too powerful and te=\r\nnds to dominate over other forces \nwithin one. So Bhargava Rama also had ks=\r\nhatriya qualities & \nancestry.\n=A0\nWhen Renuka was enamored by a gandharva =\r\ncalled \nChitraratha (chitra=3Dstrange, ratha=3Ddesire), Jamadagni ordered B=\r\nhargava \nRama to kill her. When the material that was instrumental in givin=\r\ng rise\n to bliss is tainted with strange attachment, it needs to be cut off=\r\n and\n be recreated pure. Bhargava Rama made Renuka alive again by asking \nJ=\r\namadagni for a boon after obeying his word.\n=A0\nLater, Jamadagni \nwas kille=\r\nd by Kartavirya Arjuna, a great king, and that greatly \ndisturbed Bharga Ra=\r\nma. Kartavirya means &quot;coming from Kritavirya&quot;. \nKritavirya means one who ha=\r\ns engaged in bravery. Coming from the verb \nrij (be firm and steady), Arjun=\r\na stands for steadiness and firmness. \n&quot;Kartavirya Arjuna&quot; stands for firmn=\r\ness and confidence coming from \nhaving engaged in bravery. When that cuts o=\r\nff the constant fire of \ndivine awareness (Jamadagni) in one, that greatly =\r\ndisturbs the poise of \none&#39;s bliss (Bhargava Rama). One&#39;s bliss returns to =\r\nnormal only after \ndestroying all instincts of domination, pride, control a=\r\nnd power inside \none (kshatriyas). Such instincts and bliss do not go toget=\r\nher well. So \nBhargava Rama disliked kshatriyas for ever.\n=A0\nHowever, Lord=\r\n Rama \nwas one kshatriya who Bhargava Rama had to bow to. As discussed befo=\r\nre, \nLord Rama is Sun (soul). Supreme are the power and command of soul, \nw=\r\nhich keeps on magnanimously supporting various aspects of \nindividualized c=\r\nonsciouness in their pursuits. It is immensely strong \nand powerful and no =\r\nwonder Rama was a kshatriya. Despite the supremely \nheroic work done by sou=\r\nl in supporting its subjects, it is perfect in \ndetachment and has no agend=\r\nas of its own. Finally Bhargava Rama met a \nkshatriya who was not only stro=\r\nng and heroic, but also had Brahma Tejas.\n He had to bow. Similarly, bliss =\r\nmay be averse to instincts of heroic \nstrength and control as they tend to =\r\ndisturb bliss, but, when bliss \nmeets soul, it sees a powerful hero with pe=\r\nrfect abandon, who is the \nsource of various kinds of bliss.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nSimilarly,\n story of Lord Koorma =\r\ndemonstrates how persistence/patience in us \noperates in its perfected form=\r\n, its nature, challenges it faces etc. \nStory of Lord Narasimha demonstrate=\r\ns how energy/drive in us operates in \nits perfected form, its nature, chall=\r\nenges it faces etc. And so on.\n=A0\nOur\n scriptures are not filled with mean=\r\ningless stories. They are true \nstories of events in some other realms of b=\r\neing. They also \nmetaphorically represent great inner truths that may occur=\r\n within us. \nThey can help us understand ourselves, how we can perfect vari=\r\nous \naspects of our personalities and how we can progress.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nChanting a deity&#39;s name or doing =\r\nother rituals to a deity, are the first step. If a mantra is working, a cor=\r\nresponding aspect of our personality will become purified and perfected ove=\r\nr time.\n\n=A0\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Res=\r\nources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=A0\n\n&gt;_____________________=\r\n___________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avata=\r\nrs are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going bac=\r\nk from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one=\r\n after the other upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I want to emphatically disagree with t=\r\nhis notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto K=\r\nrshna&quot;.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Each av=\r\natara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Maharshi P=\r\narasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Na=\r\nrasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;We also\n know that Sun,=\r\n Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifica=\r\ntions of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discr=\r\nimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spirit of =\r\ninnovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively).\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Correspon=\r\ndingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfec=\r\nted form. Each story is an example of how that aspect operates.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Lord =\r\nRama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s st=\r\nory is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a p=\r\nerfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s st=\r\nory is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Now, let us remember o=\r\nne basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us,\n learning spirit in u=\r\ns, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are=\r\n different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as=\r\n these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays different ro=\r\nles. There is no comparison between them.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect =\r\nof us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we =\r\nneed balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different asp=\r\nects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working togethe=\r\nr in the Cosmos.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0=\r\n\n&gt;One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story that de=\r\nmonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of min=\r\nd may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fa=\r\nscinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that\n demonstrates h=\r\now wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and subje=\r\nctive preference.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as =\r\na representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It i=\r\ns the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Once mind=\r\n fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the =\r\nindividualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dh=\r\narma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized =\r\nconsciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, d=\r\niscipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes=\r\n/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s =\r\nagendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later\n on. It =\r\ndoes all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas =\r\nnor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized c=\r\nonsciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting =\r\nthe fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dhar=\r\nma and does it impassionately.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps=\r\n not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the p=\r\nlay, may not seem interesting enough to some.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;On the other hand, mind=\r\n has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, =\r\ngetting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the ind=\r\nividualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in t=\r\nhe individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassi=\r\nonately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in ag=\r\nendas and passion and even decides/affects\n every entity&#39;s dharma. That way=\r\n, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s l=\r\nife appeals more to one who may be excited by this description!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Lord Krishna is obviously=\r\n awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Rama&#39;s lif=\r\ne demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana =\r\nfrom Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. =\r\nHe helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the la=\r\nst moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-moth=\r\ner and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though =\r\nhis father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he=\r\n himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassion=\r\nately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest\n with Lakshmana and going =\r\nafter the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when S=\r\nita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fou=\r\nght the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or fault=\r\ned Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with n=\r\no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravan=\r\na, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even =\r\nas Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects =\r\nthat were going to disappear with Ravana!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Rama is a perfect example o=\r\nf a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges =\r\none&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is=\r\n basically what soul does!\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;As another example, let us look at Lord\n Vaamana. His story is =\r\na perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;He was=\r\n born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a cha=\r\nritable demon king with many great qualities.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Wisdom/discrimination m=\r\nakes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted wit=\r\nh demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not=\r\n pleased until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire con=\r\nsciousness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Please think about the other=\r\n avataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how v=\r\narious aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi P=\r\narasara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them s=\r\neparately. Of course, if you are more\n attracted to one of them, please thi=\r\nnk about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of re=\r\nlieving us from samsara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it toda=\r\ny (there are different schools of thought).\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg \n&gt;--------\n&gt;\r\n---1593584224-319266861-1367187860=:64384\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;I\n will give another example, in more detail.

Kartavirya means &quot;coming from Kritavirya&quot;. \nKritavirya mea=\r\nns one who has engaged in bravery. Coming from the verb \nrij (be firm and s=\r\nteady), Arjuna stands for steadiness and firmness. \n&quot;Kartavirya Arjuna&quot; sta=\r\nnds for firmness and confidence coming from \nhaving engaged in bravery. Whe=\r\nn that cuts off the constant fire of \ndivine awareness (Jamadagni) in one, =\r\nthat greatly disturbs the poise of \none&#39;s bliss (Bhargava Rama). One&#39;s blis=\r\ns returns to normal only after \ndestroying all instincts of domination, pri=\r\nde, control and power inside \none (kshatriyas). Such instincts and bliss do=\r\n not go together well. So \nBhargava Rama disliked kshatriyas for ever.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;However, Lord Rama \nwas one kshatriya who Bhargava Rama had to bow=\r\n to.

It is immensely strong=\r\n \nand powerful and no wonder Rama was a kshatriya. Despite the supremely \nh=\r\neroic work done by soul in supporting its subjects, it is perfect in \ndetac=\r\nhment and has no agendas of its own. Finally Bhargava Rama met a \nkshatriya=\r\n who was not only strong and heroic, but also had Brahma Tejas.\n He had to =\r\nbow. Similarly, bliss may be averse to instincts of heroic \nstrength and co=\r\nntrol as they tend to disturb bliss, but, when bliss \nmeets soul, it sees a=\r\n powerful hero with perfect abandon, who is the \nsource of various kinds of=\r\n bliss.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Similarly,\n story of Lord =\r\nKoorma demonstrates how persistence/patience in us \noperates in its perfect=\r\ned form, its nature, challenges it faces etc. \nStory of Lord Narasimha demo=\r\nnstrates how energy/drive in us operates in \nits perfected form, its nature=\r\n, challenges it faces etc. And so on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Our\n scriptures are not =\r\nfilled with meaningless stories. They are true \nstories of events in some o=\r\nther realms of being. They also \nmetaphorically represent great inner truth=\r\ns that may occur within us. \nThey can help us understand ourselves, how we =\r\ncan perfect various \naspects of our personalities and how we can progress.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333px; font-f=\r\namily: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-styl=\r\ne: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); fon=\r\nt-size: 13.3333px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-colo=\r\nr: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Chanting a deity&#39;s name or doing other rituals to a deity, are the=\r\n first step.

A learned friend w=\r\nrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this=\r\n stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progres=\r\nsion of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krs=\r\nhna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Da=\r\nsavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto\n Krshna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Each avatara represents an aspect of Suprem=\r\ne in a perfected form.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras w=\r\nith planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mar=\r\ns, respectively.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We also\n know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, =\r\nJupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, e=\r\nnergy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of e=\r\nnjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking ba=\r\nrriers and detachment (respectively).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Correspondingly, each av=\r\natara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each =\r\nstory is an example of how that aspect operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lord Rama&#39;s s=\r\ntory is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a=\r\n perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected=\r\n example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a=\r\n perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us,=\r\n mind in us, energy in us,\n learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness =\r\nin us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different manifestations o=\r\nf the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, i=\r\nt has different qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison=\r\n between them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect=\r\n it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between=\r\n all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Bein=\r\ng are incomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One who is fascinated by the qualitie=\r\ns of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who i=\r\ns fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates =\r\nhow mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may=\r\n like the story that\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this=\r\n is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. S=\r\noul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attribu=\r\ntes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Once mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desir=\r\nes, soul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy=\r\n and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect o=\r\nf this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning=\r\n ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no=\r\n desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and=\r\n records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper=\r\n fruits later\n on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neith=\r\ner doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects o=\r\nf the individualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing=\r\n things and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It=\r\n sees that as its dharma and does it impassionately.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, does=\r\n this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassio=\r\nnate witness supporting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is=\r\n constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Mo=\r\nvement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is =\r\nthe support for everything else in the individualized consciousness, soul i=\r\ns a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the indi=\r\nvidualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affe=\r\ncts\n every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the indi=\r\nvidualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be exci=\r\nted by this description!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lord Kris=\r\nhna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he=\r\n received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did what=\r\never was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was g=\r\niven kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the =\r\nbehest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had=\r\n no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty=\r\n to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and follow=\r\ned his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest\n wi=\r\nth Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did i=\r\nt impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he s=\r\nearched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing hi=\r\nm to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted ever=\r\ny life situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. =\r\nEven as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his imp=\r\nassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully=\r\n learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas =\r\nwho impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of kar=\r\nmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As another example, let us look at Lord\n Vaamana. Hi=\r\ns story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to =\r\nrid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing =\r\ngood work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), on=\r\ne&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When wisd=\r\nom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are completely =\r\nsuppressed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Please think about the=\r\n other avataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of=\r\n how various aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maha=\r\nrshi Parasara.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate e=\r\nach of them separately. Of course, if you are more\n attracted to one of the=\r\nm, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL =\r\ncapable of relieving us from samsara.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there=\r\n are different schools of thought).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha=\r\n&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockq=\r\nuote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1593584224-319266861-1367187860=:64384--\r\n\n"}}
