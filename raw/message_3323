They say that=\r\n one can obtain everything if one takes\nrefuge in God wholly and solely, an=\r\nd without thought of any other. Does it\nmean sitting still at one place, an=\r\nd contemplating God entirely at all\ntimes, discarding all thoughts, includi=\r\nng even about food which is essential\nfor the sustenance of the body? Does =\r\nit mean that when one gets ill, one\nshould not think of medicine and treatm=\r\nent, but entrust one=E2=80=99s health or\nsickness exclusively to Providence=\r\n? From the definition of sthitha prajna\ngiven in Gita, (II:71):\n\nThe man wh=\r\no sheds all longing and moves without concern, free from the sense\nof =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, he attains peace.\n\n=E2=80=9CIt=\r\n means the discarding of all desires. Therefore should we devote\nourselves =\r\nexclusively to the contemplation of God, and accept food, water,\netc. only =\r\nif they are available by God=E2=80=99s grace, without asking for them? Or\nd=\r\noes it mean that we should make a little effort? Bhagavan! Please explain\nt=\r\nhe secret of this saranagathi.=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan saw that letter leisurely=\r\n and told the people near him: =E2=80=9CLook! =E2=80=98Ananya\nsaranagathi=\r\n=E2=80=99 means to be without any attachment of thoughts, no doubt, but\ndoe=\r\ns it mean to discard thoughts even of food and water, etc., which are\nessen=\r\ntial for the sustenance of the physical body? He asks, =E2=80=98should I ea=\r\nt\nonly if I get anything by God=E2=80=99s direction, and without my asking =\r\nfor it? Or\nshould I make a little effort?=E2=80=99 All right! Let us take i=\r\nt that what we have\nto eat comes of its own accord. But even then, who is t=\r\no eat? Suppose\nsomebody puts it in our mouth, should we not swallow it, at =\r\nleast? Is that\nnot an effort? He asked, =E2=80=98If I become sick, should I=\r\n take medicine or should\nI keep quiet leaving my health and sickness in the=\r\n hands of God?=E2=80=99\n\n=E2=80=98Kshudvyadeh aaharam=E2=80=99, it is said.=\r\n There are two meanings to this. One is,\nsince kshuth, i.e. hunger, is also=\r\n like sickness, so for the sickness called\nhunger, the medicine called food=\r\n must be given; the other is: like medicine\nfor vyadhi (sickness), food for=\r\n kshuth (hunger) must be given.\n\nIn the book Sadhana Panchaka written by Sa=\r\nnkara, it is stated,\nkshudvyadhischa chikitsyatam pratidinam bhikshoushadha=\r\nm bhudyatam=E2=80=99. It\nmeans, for treatment of the disease called hunger,=\r\n eat food received as\nalms. But then, one must at least go out for bhiksha.=\r\n If all people close\ntheir eyes and sit still saying if the food comes, we =\r\neat, how is the world\nto get on? Hence one must take things as they come in=\r\n accordance with one=E2=80=99s\ntraditions and must be free from the feeling=\r\n that one is doing them oneself.\nThe feeling that I am doing it is bondage.=\r\n It is therefore necessary to\nconsider and find out the method whereby such=\r\n a feeling can be overcome,\ninstead of doubting as to whether medicine shou=\r\nld be administered if one is\nsick or whether food should be taken if one is=\r\n hungry; such doubts will\ncontinue to come up and will never end. Even such=\r\n doubts as, =E2=80=98May I groan if\nthere is pain? May I inhale air after e=\r\nxhaling?=E2=80=99 also occur.\n\nCall it Ishwara or call it karma =E2=80=94 s=\r\nome Karta will carry on everything in\nthis world according to the developme=\r\nnt of the mind of each individual. If\nthe responsibility is thrown on him (=\r\nthe Karta), things will go on of their\nown accord.\n\n=E2=80=9CWe walk on thi=\r\ns ground. While doing so, do we consider at every step\nwhether we should ra=\r\nise one leg after the other or stop at some stage? Isn=E2=80=99t\nthe walkin=\r\ng done automatically? The same is the case with inhaling and\nexhaling; no s=\r\npecial effort is made to inhale or exhale. The same is the\ncase with this l=\r\nife also. Can we give up anything if we want to or do\nanything as we please=\r\n? Quite a number of things are done automatically\nwithout our being conscio=\r\nus of it.Complete surrender to God means giving up\nall thoughts and concent=\r\nrating the mind on Him. If we can concentrate on\nHim, other thoughts disapp=\r\near. If mano-vak-kaya karmas, i.e., the actions of\nthe mind, speech and bod=\r\ny are merged with God, all the burdens of our life\nwill be on Him. Lord Kri=\r\nshna told Arjuna in the Gita: (IX:22)\n\nTo those men who worship Me alone, t=\r\nhinking of no other, to those ever\nharmonious, I bring full security and at=\r\ntend to their needs.\n\n=E2=80=9CArjuna had to do the fighting. So Krishna sa=\r\nid, =E2=80=98Place all the burden on\nMe, do your duty; you are merely an in=\r\nstrument. I will see to everything.\nNothing will bother you.=E2=80=99 But t=\r\nhen, before one surrenders to God, one should\nknow who it is that surrender=\r\ns. Unless all thoughts are given up there can=E2=80=99t\nbe surrender. When =\r\nthere are no thoughts at all, what remains is only the\nSelf. So surrender w=\r\nill only be to one=E2=80=99s Self. If surrender is in terms of\nbhakti, the =\r\nburden should be thrown on God, and if it is in terms of karma,\nkarma shoul=\r\nd be performed until one knows one=E2=80=99s own Self. The result is the\nsa=\r\nme in either case.\n\nSurrender means to enquire and know about one=E2=80=99s=\r\n own Self and then remain in\nthe Self. What is there apart from the Self?=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nThat young man said, =E2=80=9CWhat is the path by which it can b=\r\ne known?=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan replied: =E2=80=9CIn the Gita several paths are=\r\n indicated. You are asked to\ndo dhyana. If you are not able to do it, then =\r\nbhakti or yoga or nishkama\nkarma. Many more have been indicated. And one of=\r\n the paths must be\nfollowed. One=E2=80=99s own self is always there. Things=\r\n happen automatically in\naccordance with the samskaras (the fruits of the a=\r\nctions of previous\nbirths).\n\n=E2=80=9CThe feeling that the doer is =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 is itself bondage. If the feeling is got\nrid of by vichara, t=\r\nhese questions do not arise.\n\nSaranagathi is not the mere act of sitting wi=\r\nth closed eyes. If all sit like\nthat, how are they to get on in this world?=\r\n=E2=80=9D While Bhagavan was speaking the\nbell of the dining hall rang.\n\n=\r\n=E2=80=9CThere goes the bell; should we not go?=E2=80=9D So saying with a s=\r\nmile, Bhagavan\ngot up.\n\nSources:\n1) Letters from Sri Ramanasramam by Suri N=\r\nagamma\n2) http://suri-nagamma.blogspot.com/2007/07/letter-109.html\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd2de5a903f80047b763af0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Letter 109&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10th A=\r\npril, 1947=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This morning, an Andhra youth handed over a letter =\r\nto Bhagavan in which it was written: =E2=80=9CSwamiji!
