S=\r\nri Yogeshwar was a very \nhighly\n&gt; realized saint. His book is very good. He=\r\n does mention about his\n&gt; prevoius birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba=\r\n had also \nconfirmed\n&gt; the same thing. Saccha Baba was another very highly =\r\nrealized saint \ntoo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai Baba =\r\nof shirdi and \nNaamdev\n&gt; and also many other saints too. The initiation he =\r\ngot on the bank \nof\n&gt; river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has descr=\r\nibed very\n&gt; accurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. =\r\nHe \nhad\n&gt; very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantast=\r\nic\n&gt; orator. His followers have done a very good job of putting up the \nweb=\r\n\n&gt; site and sharing the information for free both audio and books.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chi=\r\nti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, \nRamakrishna\n&gt; may h=\r\nave taken birth as more than one person and in future may take\n&gt; more birth=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others use pardon \n=\r\nmy\n&gt; lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifest from time to \ntim=\r\ne\n&gt; After reading this and other books, I feel that each one of us has \na\n&gt;=\r\n inner guru along with our atma and this inner guru in conjunction \nwith\n&gt; =\r\nour accumulated or sanchit sankaras give us visions of these \nmahatmas\n&gt; or=\r\n help us attach or attract to a Saint or some aspects of the \nsaint\n&gt; more =\r\nthan others. This inner guru is the same in all humam beings \nbut\n&gt; manifes=\r\nts uniquely based on each person. \n&gt; \n&gt; I also believe that one needs to ge=\r\nt initiated by a Guru who is\n&gt; present in physical form and seek guidance f=\r\nrom him time to time.\n&gt; There are many instances of other forms of inititat=\r\nions like\n&gt; initiation in dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms=\r\n of\n&gt; initiations though very important are very rare or uncommon.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aft=\r\ner reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up in \nmy\n&gt; mind a=\r\nbout him.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have guided=\r\n many\n&gt; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; 2=\r\n) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the \nbook\n&gt; abou=\r\nt it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after \nthat?\n&gt; 3) He=\r\n did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of \ngiving\n&gt; spirtual=\r\n talks? It seems unusual.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have also read somewhere that once a perso=\r\nn reaches a spiritual\n&gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for more than=\r\n few days, was \nthis\n&gt; the case?\n&gt; \n&gt; May be others who have read this book=\r\n can share more light.\n&gt; I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read =\r\nthis book if one \nhas\n&gt; time, it is available for free to download as a pdf=\r\n book on his \nweb site.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for=\r\n the betterment and\n&gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown. He=\r\n spread the \nDevi\n&gt; Gayatri mantra/homa and other things in a big way all a=\r\nround india.\n&gt; \n&gt; I feel like I have not even begun my spiritual journey wh=\r\nich is \nvery\n&gt; very long too and many obstacles in the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; \n&lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka t=\r\nold me many years back that Shri Ram \nSharma \n&gt; &gt; Acharya was born as Thaku=\r\nr Ramkrishna in previous life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another as intresting as well as eq=\r\nually confusing thing is that \n&gt; &gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) =\r\nhad also revealtion \nabout \n&gt; &gt; his past life and he also indirectly indica=\r\nted in his biography \nthat \n&gt; &gt; he was Thakur Ramkrishna in the previous bi=\r\nrth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@ &gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I would like to mention something that may be an interesting \n&gt; &gt; insi=\r\nght.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

This is an unbelieva=\r\nble experience \nthat I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my ow=\r\nn. I am writing \n&gt; &gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going b=\r\nack to the period of \n&gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are=\r\n in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at=\r\n Okha Port Post office near \n&gt; &gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 p=\r\nm and I was getting late fee \nallowance \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There wa=\r\ns a Telephone exchange just opposite to \nPost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same =\r\nDep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some \n&gt; &gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. O=\r\nne Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. \nPatel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working =\r\nas Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkr=\r\nishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always \ntalking \n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly \n&gt; &gt; gathering =\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs \ncreated=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\neeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of=\r\n \n30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty \nh=\r\nours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were=\r\n at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some gues=\r\nt have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. \nMy \n&gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wi=\r\nll come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go \nnow=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a \nplane \n&gt; &gt; cras=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed \nabout \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka b=\r\ny \nBus, \n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be pu=\r\nnctured. \nYet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka =\r\nas was \n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This a=\r\nll incidents made me to believe that he had some super \n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was \nattracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri=\r\n Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of \nshri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur=\r\n and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I \nsurrendered \n&gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I \nprayed \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow =\r\n\nhis \n&gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife =\r\nat 6.10 \nmorning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7=\r\n am I was \n&gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the mo=\r\nrning that I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife=\r\n was annoyed \nand \n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=\r\n=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a \nhasty \n&gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna =\r\nParamhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. \nHe \n&gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grea=\r\nt Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide \nus, \n&gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma \n&gt; &gt; Achar=\r\nya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her argumen=\r\nts were right at her place as people in general \nnot \n&gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much a=\r\nbout Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have \ntaken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty d=\r\necision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember tha=\r\nt Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was \ntelling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to t=\r\nest him before accepting him. I also \ndecided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immed=\r\niately told my wife that =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, \nMr. Patel \n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has \nnever =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our h=\r\nouse \n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selectio=\r\nn for \nThakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=EF=BF=\r\n=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t \nbelieve.=E2=80=\r\n=9D-\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to \nj=\r\nustify my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your=\r\n \nexistence \n&gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2=80=99\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, =\r\nMr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. Wh=\r\nat he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you kno=\r\nw what \nhappened?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to =\r\nmy home at \n05.30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours.=\r\n Suddenly \nThakur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to =\r\nyour friend=E2=80=99s \n&gt; &gt; house.
