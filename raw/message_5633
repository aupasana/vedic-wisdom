The brand new and fast-selling book &quot;The Ve=\r\ndic Way of Knowing God&quot; takes a unique approach to answering this question.=\r\n Revealing the profound philosophical insights of the world&#39;s most ancient =\r\nspiritual philosophy, this book not only boldly answers the question &quot;How d=\r\no I know God?&quot; from the distinctly Vedic (Hindu) perspective, but also expl=\r\nores the further issues of what it even means to be able to know God. With =\r\ngreater detail than any other book ever written to date, it reveals the pre=\r\ncise mystical mechanisms employed for knowing the Divine; the psychological=\r\n conditions necessary for such a spiritual endeavor; the transformative cog=\r\nnitive experiences that occur within the spiritual practitioner upon achiev=\r\ning God-realization; the integral relationship between transcendent Word, s=\r\npiritually revealed literature, and the important role of living teachers; =\r\nand the vast implications of the Vedic world-view on contemporary global ph=\r\nilosophy and religion. If you have ever asked the question &quot;How do I know G=\r\nod?&quot;, this is the book that will give you the precise road-map!\n\nSri Dharma=\r\n Pravartaka Acharya is widely recognized as one of the foremost spiritual a=\r\nuthorities and teachers of the Vedic tradition in the world today.\n\nOrder t=\r\nhis fast-selling book now and get a 5% discount!\n\nAll proceeds from the boo=\r\nk go directly toward supporting the non-profit International Sanatana Dharm=\r\na Society.  \n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/dharmastore/Vedic_Way_of_Knowing=\r\n_God.php\n\n\nPlease forward this announcement to all sincere spiritual seeker=\r\ns.
