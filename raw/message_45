Group.  \n\nFor lively discussion, dee=\r\nper insight, and valuable knowledge about \nthe ancient spiritual path of Yo=\r\nga.  \n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/yoga-spirituality/\n\n\n\nNamaste.  Our ne=\r\nw Yoga Spirituality discussion group is dedicated to \nexploring the philoso=\r\nphy, spiritual path, and practice of Yoga and \nSanatana Dharma (Hinduism). =\r\n\n\nWhile the practice of Yoga has exploded in popularity in the U.S. in \nrec=\r\nent years, most practitioners still limit their Yoga experience to \nmerely =\r\nthe physical benefits that Yoga offers. Yoga, however, is so \nmuch more tha=\r\nn just the &quot;aerobics of India&quot;. \n\nIn addition to the profound physical and =\r\nhealth benefits that Yoga \ngives us, Yoga is also a highly effective spirit=\r\nual path that can \nprovide deep meaning to our lives, inner peace and calm,=\r\n lasting joy \nand happiness, God-realization, and truly satisfying answers =\r\nto \nlife&#39;s most important questions. \n\nYoga is an ancient spiritual and phi=\r\nlosophical tradition. The goal of \nYoga is self-realization and God-conscio=\r\nusness=85and that is what this \nbrand new Yahoo! Group is here to discuss a=\r\nnd explore. \n\nIf you&#39;re a serious spiritual seeker who wants to fully explo=\r\nre the \nspiritual dimensions of Yoga, you&#39;re welcome to join! \n\n\n\nhttp://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/yoga-spirituality/\n\n\n\n\nPlease forward this information=\r\n to anyone you know who is interested \nin Yoga and spirituality.
