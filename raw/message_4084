It was later reprinted in the April, 1966 issue of the Mountain\nPa=\r\nth.\n\nIt describes Paul Brunton&#39;s first visit to Sri Ramanasramam and one of=\r\n the\ndialogues he had with the Maharshi. In this article, his former name &quot;=\r\nHurst&quot;\nwas used. He later adopted Paul Brunton as his pen name which he ult=\r\nimately\nmade his permanent name.\n\nIT WAS half past four in the afternoon an=\r\nd the disciples were sitting before\nthe Maharshi in the hall and were talki=\r\nng about a notification that had\nappeared in the dailies [newspapers] to th=\r\ne effect that a Mr. Hurst and a\nBuddhist Bhikshu were intending to visit th=\r\ne Ashrama. The clock struck five\nand there entered the hall a man in Europe=\r\nan costume, bearing a plate of\nsweets and followed by a Buddhist monk. The =\r\nvisitors offered the sweets to\nthe Maharshi and then, after making obeisanc=\r\ne in the Eastern way, they both\nsquatted on the floor before him. These wer=\r\ne the visitors of whom the\ndisciples had been talking. The man in English c=\r\nlothes was R. Raphael Hurst\n[Paul Brunton], a London journalist who was the=\r\nn on a visit to India. He was\nkeenly interested in the spiritual teaching o=\r\nf the East and thought that by\nan intelligent study and appreciation of it =\r\nthe cause of cooperation between\nEast and West might be greatly promoted. H=\r\ne came to Sri Ramanasramam after\nvisiting many other ashramas. The Bhikshu =\r\nwho came with him was also an\nEnglishman by birth. He was formerly a milita=\r\nry officer but was known as\nSwami Prajnananda. He was the founder of the En=\r\nglish Ashrama in Rangoon.\nBoth visitors sat spellbound before Maharshi and =\r\nthere was pin-drop silence.\nThe silence was broken by the person who had br=\r\nought the visitors, asking\nthem if they would like to ask any questions.\n\nT=\r\nhey were, however, not in a mood to do so, and thus an hour and a half\npass=\r\ned. Mr. Hurst then stated the purpose of his visit. In a voice of\nintense e=\r\narnestness he said that he had come to India for spiritual\nenlightenment. &quot;=\r\nNot only myself,&quot; he added, &quot;but many others also in the\nWest are longing f=\r\nor the Light from the East.&#39;&#39;\n\nThe Maharshi sat completely indrawn and paid=\r\n no attention. One of those who\nwere sitting there asked them if they had c=\r\nome to the East for a study of\ncomparative religions. &quot;No,&quot; the Bhikshu rep=\r\nlied, &quot;we could get that better\nin Europe. We want to find Truth; we want t=\r\nhe Light. Can we know Truth? Is\nit possible to get Enlightenment?&quot; The Maha=\r\nrshi still remained silent and\nindrawn, and as the visitors wanted to take =\r\na walk, the conversation ended\nand all dispersed.\n\n\nEarly next morning the =\r\nvisitors entered the hall and put some questions to\nthe Maharshi with great=\r\n earnestness. The conversation reproduced below is\nfrom rough notes taken w=\r\nhile it was going on.\n\nBhikshu: We have travelled far and wide in search of=\r\n Enlightenment. How can\nwe get it?\nMaharshi: Through deep enquiry and confi=\r\ndent meditation.\n\nHurst: Many people do meditate in the West but show no si=\r\ngns of progress.\nMaharshi: How do you know that they don&#39;t make progress? S=\r\npiritual progress\nis not easily discernible.\n\nHurst: A few years ago I got =\r\nsome glimpses of the Bliss but in the years\nthat followed I lost it again. =\r\nThen last year I again got it. Why is that?\nMaharshi: You lost it because y=\r\nour meditation had not become natural\n(sahaja). When you become habitually =\r\ninturned the enjoyment of spiritual\nbeatitude becomes a normal experience.\n=\r\n\nHurst: Might it be due to the lack of a Guru?\nMaharshi: Yes, but the Guru =\r\nis within; that Guru who is within is identical\nwith your Self.\n\nHurst: Wha=\r\nt is the way to God-realization?\nMaharshi: Vichara, asking yourself the &#39;Wh=\r\no am I?&#39; enquiry into the nature\nof your Self.\n\nBhikshu: The world is in a =\r\nstate of degeneration. It is getting constantly\nworse, spiritually, morally=\r\n, intellectually and in every way. Will a\nspiritual teacher come to save it=\r\n from chaos?\nMaharshi: Inevitably, when goodness declines and wrong prevail=\r\ns He comes to\nreinstate goodness. The world is neither too good nor too bad=\r\n; it is a\nmixture of the two. Unmixed happiness and unmixed sorrow are not =\r\nfound in\nthe world. The world always needs God and God always comes.\n\nBhiks=\r\nhu: Will He be born in the East or the West?\n\nThe Maharshi laughed at the q=\r\nuestion but did not answer it.\n\nHurst: Does the Maharshi know whether an Av=\r\natar already exists in the\nphysical body?\nMaharshi: He might.\n\nHurst: What =\r\nis the best way to attain Godhood?\nMaharshi: Self-enquiry leads to Self-rea=\r\nlization.\n\nHurst: Is a Guru necessary for spiritual progress?\nMaharshi: Yes=\r\n.\n\nHurst: Is it possible for the Guru to help the disciple forward on the\np=\r\nath?\nMaharshi: Yes.\n\nHurst: What are the conditions for discipleship?\nMahar=\r\nshi: Intense desire for Self-realization, earnestness and purity of\nmind.\n\n=\r\nHurst: Is it necessary to surrender one&#39;s life to the Guru?\nMaharshi: Yes. =\r\nOne should surrender everything to the Dispeller of Darkness.\nOne should su=\r\nrrender the ego that binds one to this world. Giving up\nbody-consciousness =\r\nis the true surrender.\n\nHurst: Does a Guru want to take control of the disc=\r\niple&#39;s worldly affairs\nalso?\nMaharshi: Yes, everything.\n\nHurst: Can he give=\r\n the disciple the spiritual spark that he needs?\nMaharshi: He can give him =\r\nall that he needs. This can be seen from\nexperience.\n\nHurst: Is it necessar=\r\ny to be in physical contact with the Guru, and if so,\nfor how long?\nMaharsh=\r\ni: It depends on the maturity of the disciple. Gunpowder catches fire\nin an=\r\n instant, while it takes time to ignite coal.\n\nHurst: Is it possible to dev=\r\nelop along the path of the Spirit while leading\na life of work?\nMaharshi: T=\r\nhere is no conflict between work and wisdom. On the contrary,\nselfless work=\r\n paves the way to Self-knowledge.\n\nHurst: If a person is engaged in work it=\r\n will leave him little time for\nmeditation.\nMaharshi: It is only spiritual =\r\nnovices who need to set aside a special time\nfor meditation. A more advance=\r\nd person always enjoys the Beatitude whether\nhe is engaged in work or not. =\r\nWhile his hands are in society he can keep his\nhead cool in solitude.\n\nBhik=\r\nshu: Have you heard of Meher Baba?\nMaharshi: Yes.\n\nBhikshu: He says that he=\r\n will become an Avatar in a few years.\nMaharshi: Everyone is an Avatar of G=\r\nod. &quot;The kingdom of heaven is within\nyou.&quot; Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Krishna=\r\n, all are in you. One who knows the\nTruth sees everyone else as a manifesta=\r\ntion of God.\n\nBhikshu: Will the Maharshi make a statement about Meher Baba?=\r\n\nMaharshi: What statement? That (the existence of an outer Avatar) is a\nque=\r\nstion which seekers of Truth need not consider.\n\nBhikshu: Will the world be=\r\n rejuvenated?\nMaharshi: There is One who governs the world and it is His bu=\r\nsiness to look\nafter it. He who has created the world knows how to guide it=\r\n also.\n\nBhikshu: Does the world progress now?\nMaharshi: If we progress the =\r\nworld progresses. As you are, so is the world.\nWithout understanding the Se=\r\nlf what is the use of understanding the world?\nWithout Self-knowledge, know=\r\nledge of the world is of no use. Dive inward and\nfind the treasure hidden t=\r\nhere. Open your heart and see the world through\nthe eyes of the true Self. =\r\nTear aside the veils and see the divine majesty\nof your own Self.\n\nSource: =\r\nhttp://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1997/?pg=3Dsep-oct\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1821c3523c60482ff2826\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe following article was first published in the September 1931 =\r\nmonthly magazine called PEACE, the journal of Swami Omkar&#39;s Shanti Ashr=\r\nama in Andhra Pradesh.
