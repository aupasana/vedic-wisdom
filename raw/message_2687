One pur=\r\nsuing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read m=\r\nany scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts =\r\nwith the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or=\r\n an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not bei=\r\nng Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it=\r\n is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of eliminat=\r\nion, finally finds the true Self.

Can&#39;t we? Then,=\r\n why can we try to narrow our focus and try to see prana/atma sceintificall=\r\ny? I am not for this path, but, to say, that is not a path, is perhaps unfa=\r\nir to all those who are destine to traverse that path.\n\n        My statemen=\r\nt was not against the &quot;path of Gyana&quot;. Indeed it is one of the finest path =\r\nI am sure.\n\n        However, my understanding of this path differs a little=\r\n from your understanding. Gyana, I believe, is not really study of scriptur=\r\nes or scholarly arguments, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my opin=\r\nion, is a state of being,  where one percieves a certain oneness in the uni=\r\nverse. It is achieved through sadhana. To be constantly in a state of discr=\r\nimination between real and not-real, rejecting the non-real, such that what=\r\never is finally left is nothing but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the=\r\n marga called Gyan. But sadhana it is without a doubt.\n\n        Whatever be=\r\n the path, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Shankara, they say=\r\n, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. But I feel, he en=\r\ngaged in all these once he had already become a gyani through his sadhana. =\r\nHe was not a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scriptures, he was=\r\n a gyani because he had achieved a state of oneness. \n\n        IMHO, script=\r\nural knowledge is not the marg of gyana.Gyana marg is more complex and requ=\r\nires more than mere intellectual abilities.\n\n        -Regards\n         Raja=\r\nrshi\n         \n        The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva S=\r\nutra\n\n\n        --- On Tue, 29/9/09, pvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n=\r\n          From: pvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;\n          Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Re: Order of Creation (of mahabhuta/tattwa)?\n          To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com\n          Date: Tuesday, 29 September, 2009, 11:09 AM\n\n\n =\r\n           \n          Rajarshi,\n\n          With all due respect, I disagree=\r\n.\n\n          There is no question that is useless and there is no answer th=\r\nat is not relavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that =\r\nGod is not there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be per=\r\nceived. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your =\r\ncurrent knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing y=\r\nou can not otherwise.\n\n          There are 4 known margas for self realisat=\r\nion. My understanding of any of these limited.\n          1. Bhakthi - Surre=\r\nnder to God. Here you rest all other thoughts but for thought pertaining to=\r\n God. You do not question any thing related to him and give-in completely t=\r\no the believe that he is there and is your master. By doing so, you are com=\r\ning out of the clutches of the regular perceptions or dimentions of this ma=\r\nterial world.\n\n          2. Raja - You focus on doing specific postures and=\r\n concentrate deeply on the way you do things and draw your self away from t=\r\nhe regular senses.\n\n          3. Karma - Unattached karma. If you can do it=\r\n, you are not even thinking about God, but, have got him.\n\n          4. jna=\r\nna - By questioning available information, using logic and try to break out=\r\n of current assumptions and try to discover. Saying, this will not yield re=\r\nsults is not a wise thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most defficult. B=\r\nut, with so many others who are experiancing God, not sure, why the wrong i=\r\nn current axioms can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who are realise=\r\nd, do not perhaps think it is relavent.\n\n          There is a soul. Now is =\r\nSoul physical or not? Can it be seen? If not with naked eyes, to see it mat=\r\nerialistically, what is needed?\n\n          We can see the difference betwee=\r\nn a body with prana and with out prana. Can&#39;t we? Then, why can we try to n=\r\narrow our focus and try to see prana/atma sceintifically? I am not for this=\r\n path, but, to say, that is not a path, is perhaps unfair to all those who =\r\nare destine to traverse that path.\n          Best regards,\n          Vijay\n=\r\n          --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14=\r\n@ ...&gt; wrote:\n          &gt;\n          &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n          &gt;  \n         =\r\n &gt; With all due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how does it matter?=\r\n Can anyone here really know for sure which came after which?

Gyana, I believe,&nbsp;is not really study of scriptures \n =\r\n       or scholarly arguments, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my =\r\n\n        opinion, is a &lt;EM&gt;state of being,&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp; where one percieves a=\r\n \n        certain oneness in the universe. It is achieved through sadhana. =\r\nTo be \n        constantly in a state of discrimination between real and not=\r\n-real, \n        rejecting the non-real, such that whatever is finally left =\r\nis nothing \n        but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the marga calle=\r\nd Gyan. But \n        sadhana it is without a doubt.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Whatever be the pa=\r\nth, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi \n        Shankara, they s=\r\nay, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural \n        debates. But I =\r\nfeel, he engaged in all these once he had already become \n        a gyani t=\r\nhrough his sadhana. He was not a gyani because he debated a lot \n        or=\r\n knew many scriptures, he was a gyani because he had achieved a state \n    =\r\n    of oneness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;IMHO, scriptural knowledge is not the marg of gyana.G=\r\nyana marg is \n        more complex and requires more than mere intellectual=\r\n abilities.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n        &lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;=\r\nSTRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN \n        style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: V=\r\nerdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n        face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=\r\n=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of \n        consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;- Shiva \n        Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-=\r\n-- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, \n        29/9/09, pvklnrao &lt;I&gt;&lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;=\r\n/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n        &lt;BLOCKQUOTE \n        style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MAR=\r\nGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: \n          =\r\npvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: \n       =\r\n   Order of Creation (of mahabhuta/tattwa)?&lt;BR&gt;To: \n          vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, 29 September, 2009, \n          11:09 AM&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n          &lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1544596217&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n          &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;W=\r\nith all due respect, I disagree.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There \n          is no question tha=\r\nt is useless and there is no answer that is not \n          relavent. The re=\r\nason we are not able to perceive God is not that God \n          is not ther=\r\ne, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be \n          perceiv=\r\ned. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, \n          mak=\r\ne your current knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to \n        =\r\n  percieve thing you can not otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are 4 known margas \n  =\r\n        for self realisation. My understanding of any of these limited.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n1. \n          Bhakthi - Surrender to God. Here you rest all other thoughts =\r\nbut for \n          thought pertaining to God. You do not question any thing=\r\n related to \n          him and give-in completely to the believe that he is=\r\n there and is your \n          master. By doing so, you are coming out of th=\r\ne clutches of the regular \n          perceptions or dimentions of this mate=\r\nrial world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. Raja - You \n          focus on doing specific posture=\r\ns and concentrate deeply on the way you \n          do things and draw your =\r\nself away from the regular senses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. \n          Karma - Unattached =\r\nkarma. If you can do it, you are not even thinking \n          about God, bu=\r\nt, have got him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4. jnana - By questioning \n          available info=\r\nrmation, using logic and try to break out of current \n          assumptions=\r\n and try to discover. Saying, this will not yield results \n          is not=\r\n a wise thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most defficult. \n          Bu=\r\nt, with so many others who are experiancing God, not sure, why the \n       =\r\n   wrong in current axioms can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who \n=\r\n          are realised, do not perhaps think it is relavent.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There i=\r\ns a \n          soul. Now is Soul physical or not? Can it be seen? If not wi=\r\nth naked \n          eyes, to see it materialistically, what is needed?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;We can see \n          the difference between a body with prana and with =\r\nout prana. Can&#39;t we? \n          Then, why can we try to narrow our focus an=\r\nd try to see prana/atma \n          sceintifically?
