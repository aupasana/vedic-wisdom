The order used traditionally is tarpana first, then sandhya vandana, then homa. Tarpana was integrated with bath. You take bath in a river and do tarpana right there (and leave the water right there in the river). Then you come out, do sandhyavandana and other rituals.\n \nMy recommendation based on the lifestyles now and the needs and capabilities of people now is contained in:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2357\n \n2. Yes! Pitripaksha that started yesterday/today is a fantastic time to do tarpana. Doing it everyday or atleast on as many days as possible, during this fortnight, is a great idea.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n \n---- Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; |om rishibhyo namah|\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha, pranaams\n&gt; \n&gt; Today Pitrupaksha started and I did the supershort tarpanam procedure after\n&gt; doing the sandhya vandanam. Something interesting happened today!\n&gt; \n&gt; Before starting the tarpanam, I prayed that I may be given some positive\n&gt; signal. Immediately after I completed the tarpanam procedure, my wife came\n&gt; and asked me about the contents of some packet which was lying for a long\n&gt; time inside the shelf. It contained some darbha grass and a small packet of\n&gt; rice which was the akshatas from a previously performed &#39;thevasam&#39; or\n&gt; sraddha puja in memory of my father. I took it as a signal that my father\n&gt; had come today and blessed us in thought. It also is noteworthy that my\n&gt; father&#39;s day of death was the day after poornima ie., today.\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------- Forwarded message ----------\n&gt; From: Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Fri, Sep 4, 2009 at 9:40 AM\n&gt; Subject: Tarpana questions\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; |om|\n&gt; Dear Narasimha, pranaams\n&gt; \n&gt; Tomorrow Pitrupaksha starts. I have some questions regarding tarpana:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Is the recommended order of performing as sandhya vandanam --&gt; homam --&gt;\n&gt; tarpanam?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Can I perform tarpanam on all the days in pitrupaksha? Or do the\n&gt; restrictions outlined in your manual apply even during pitrupaksha?\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n\n\n"}}
