However, depending on who one was earlier and =\r\nwhat one did earlier, one may experience different levels of affinity towar=\r\nds different practices and also get results at different speeds with differ=\r\nent practices.\n \nNormal people can only give you good advice from THEIR per=\r\nspective. They cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective. Only a sadguru=\r\n, who knows more about the real you than you yourself do, can give you advi=\r\nce from your perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not one.\n \nIf you want my su=\r\nggestion nevertheless, here are some basic suggestions.\n \n(1) In &quot;Yoga Vaas=\r\nishtham&quot;, Maharshi Vasishtha prescribes company of saints as the first step=\r\n in acquiring self-knowledge. Spend some time every week with spiritually i=\r\nnclined people discussing spiritual matters.\n \n(2) Identify one personal we=\r\nakness (e.g. anger, jealosy). Make a sincere effort to overcome it. Wheneve=\r\nr the weakness strikes you (e.g. you become angry), consciously restrain yo=\r\nurself and divert your mind to something else (e.g. repeating a mantra).\n \n=\r\n(3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend atleast 30 minutes everyday =\r\nrepeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a reasonably straight back and =\r\nclosed eyes and repeat the mantra. If your mind wanders off the mantra and =\r\nits deity and you get distracted by all kinds of thoughts, do not worry. Ac=\r\ncept it as the nature of mind and make a conscious effort to pull the mind =\r\nback into the mantra and its deity.\n \n(4) Before that japa, do a simple pra=\r\nnayama for 5 minutes. Breath in through the right nostril for n seconds, br=\r\neath out through the left nostril for n seconds, breath in through the same=\r\n left nostril for another n seconds and then breath out through the right n=\r\nostril for n seconds. Keep the time duration - n seconds - approximately th=\r\ne same in all steps. If you want, you can use a small mantra as the measure=\r\n of time and say it mentally in each step. Keep repeating this sequence for=\r\n 5 minutes.\n \n(5) Cultivate the thinking that you do not own anything. Thin=\r\nk that you are just a *temporary caretaker* of things that seem like your p=\r\nossessions (e.g. you relations, your house, your car and even your own body=\r\n, name, fame etc). Tell yourself that all these are god&#39;s property and that=\r\n you are servant and a temporary caretaker. Just as a servant working at a =\r\nrich man&#39;s house takes excellent care of things entrusted to him without de=\r\nveloping the &quot;it is mine&quot; attachment to the things, tell yourself that you =\r\ntoo have to take excellent care of all the things entrusted to you (e.g. yo=\r\nur relations, your house, your car, your body, name, fame etc) while cultiv=\r\nating the &quot;it is god&#39;s and not mine&quot; sense.\n \nThis is a very important step=\r\n and just keep on trying if you keep failing.\n \n(6) Read a little of some s=\r\ncripture or teachings of a holy man everyday. Examples are BhagavadGita, Jn=\r\naneshwari etc. I particularly recommend &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;. Ramakrishn=\r\na Parahamahamsa was a great master who taught the highest knowledge in simp=\r\nlest terms to all kinds of people. Read his teachings with an open mind, un=\r\nderstand them and try to follow them.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf some previ=\r\nous karmas are blocking one&#39;s spiritual progress, one has to either burn th=\r\nose karmas through sadhana or experience the result of the karmas. Then onl=\r\ny the blockage will go away. There is no other way.\n \nEach minute spent in =\r\nspiritual sadhana - including japam, homam etc - contributes to that. No ef=\r\nfort is wasted. One should never get disheartened.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimh=\r\na\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam ma=\r\nnual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Kishore Chitrapu \n  To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, June 17, 2007 10:08 AM\n  Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] vedic wisdom for learners\n\n\n  Dear PVR,\n\n  There is a pr=\r\nofound gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here.
