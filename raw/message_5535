They are the greatest linguists and teach and communica=\r\nte with us in the language of the universe since inception in an unparellel=\r\nable ways. It is with her concurrence that her infant is named after birth.=\r\n And she already knows her child by more than a thousand names. Based upon =\r\nthe star positions or choice of the parents - mAta and pitA in that order a=\r\nnd helped by vedanga jyotiShya\nif parents so desire. \n\nOne of the fascinati=\r\nng names of the Hindu universe is Narasimha.\n\nnRu is is the dhAtu - How doe=\r\ns it become nara? and how does the generic female and mother become nAri. T=\r\nhis happens in a very logical way and according to unchangeable rules of gr=\r\nammar. the dhAtu (unfortunately called root by western grmmarians - It ough=\r\nt to be called element - nothing grows up from the root as any person with =\r\nelementry knowledge of biology - roots and shoots are part of a living thin=\r\ng that grows up from seeds) \n\nWhy these rules are important - grammar is a =\r\nboring subject - And if I were not bribed by my mother I would have run awa=\r\ny from school at first opportunity. It is trust in her and not the teacher =\r\nthat kept me in school.\n\nThe most important reason for grammar is &quot;communic=\r\nations&quot;. We are fortunate to live in the era of man-machine communications =\r\n- first time in the known history of Mankind can man talk to and be underst=\r\nood by a machine. Our lives more or less are interlinked with machines in a=\r\nlmost every aspect of life in a matter of just 20 - 30 years. And greater t=\r\nhings are yet to come.\n\nyantra - the closest Sanskrit word for machine - ha=\r\ns ultimately the dhAtu &quot;yam&quot; - &quot;yantru&quot; ultimately meaning &quot;restraint &quot;&quot;dea=\r\nth&quot; and &quot;dharma&quot; (yama dharma rAju) Why should a machine have these as the =\r\ndhAtu? Most amazing and simple logic - the dhAtu of all machines is &quot;restra=\r\nint&quot; and &quot;caution&quot; and &quot;dharma&quot; - This dhAtu manifests itself because that =\r\nis th guNA and inescapable fact - satyaM in the universe - For humans - the=\r\n wheels and high powered engines and wings are as important as keeping cons=\r\ntantly in mind the &quot;yama dharma&quot; in the machines that is bound to manifest =\r\ninevitably - So, how to stop a machine is as important as how to build and =\r\nkeep a machine running... how to plan for parking space and prevent polluti=\r\non is as important as mass produce cars - And as recent experience - how to=\r\n stop the rocket from  exploding is as important is sending it up with chee=\r\nrs.\n\nlakShmi - the godess of weatlth and prosperity. The first part is [lak=\r\nSh] meaning objective . In this one word is the truth of finance and human =\r\nendeavour. And the entire science of management.\n\nObjective - first; Strate=\r\ngy to achieve the objective, Tactics to implement the strategy- Operations =\r\nto undertake activities according to some operational plan. Each of these l=\r\nayers have objectives or [lakShya]\n\nIn short without [lakShya] lakShmi may =\r\nbid you good bye. Related also is taking your own inventory and not others.=\r\n Successful busines take their own inventory very well and get rid of junk =\r\nas soon as possible. \n\n125396nRu * &#92;[nR]&#92;1&#92;[n&#39;R]&#92; m.
