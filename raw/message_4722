For e=\r\nxample, Han dynasty declared Confucianism as the official state culture and=\r\n Taoism as the official religion. Thus, worship of deities, demigods, xians=\r\n, supernatural beings (e.g. dragon) and ancestors (pitris!) as practiced in=\r\n these folk religions were not replaced by Confucian philosophy but they co=\r\n-existed. Moreover, Confucianism stressed honesty, rituals and rites (which=\r\n extended to proper social behavior), sacrifice and filial piety.\n \nThus, e=\r\nven if Chinese may not explicitly believe in a specific definition of God, =\r\nan implicit concept of god has influenced the evolution of the value system=\r\n, philosophy and culture they so faithfully followed.\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nOf course, communist rule changed things.

As I could not do my daily homam in the hot=\r\nel room there, I mentally did the homam procedure in the fire that is withi=\r\nn and then meditated. I felt nice energy as I meditated. Though Korea is no=\r\nt as good as India, it is better than US in spiritual energy.

That =\r\nis why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not deserve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe service of paramhamsas now.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I am afraid our understanding of =\r\nthe word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Swan is supposed to able=\r\n to remove water from milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa (absolute swan) is one=\r\n who can extract out the bad in a person and leave him with the good that i=\r\ns already in him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who can interact wit=\r\nh ANYONE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one into an ideal=\r\n person. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with drunkards and=\r\n womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed them.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one =\r\nthinks the world does not deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave, one m=\r\nay be great and realized, but not a paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In fact, look at Parasara&#39;s directives on finding a paramaham=\r\nsa. He said Mercury in 5th from karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Merc=\r\nury and why not Jupiter?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is flexible=\r\n and adaptive. Mercury can identify with anyone. Mercury is compassionate a=\r\nnd can place himself in the shoes of anyone and think/feel like that person=\r\n. That is also why Mercury is the karaka for good communication skills. A g=\r\nood communicator can visualize from the angle of his audience.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna once identified with grass so strongly that when a crow walked on=\r\n the grass, there were bloody scratches on his body. Such ability to identi=\r\nfy with someone else is needed for transforming someone else. That is why P=\r\narasara mentioned Mercury for Paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas even today.

Creating a Chandragupta is easy for someon=\r\ne of Chanakya&#39;s caliber.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I agree with Rajarshi on this. If a Chan=\r\nakya is on earth and ready to guide Chandragupta, a Chandragupta would auto=\r\nmatically come. If a Samartha Ramadas is on earth and ready too guide Shiva=\r\nji, a Shivaji would automatically come.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In fact, Swami Vivekanand=\r\na once humbly said that Ramakrishna could have created one thousand Vivekan=\r\nandas from sand!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All your stateme=\r\nnts in this thread are true, but sometimes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differences in our languag=\r\ne create unnecessary confusions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find your statemen=\r\nts to be absolutely true.

But I was presenting a different perspective =\r\nto balance the presentation of ideas. However, the bottomline is that it is=\r\n never possible to articulate this knowledge perfectly, using vaikhari. Kno=\r\nwledge like this can be digested and absorbed only though experience and no=\r\nt through reading or hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But then, words spok=\r\nen in vaikhari can serve the important purpose of inspiring one, perhaps to=\r\n investigate and/or to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There is no alternative to sad=\r\nhana, whether meditation or homam or contemplation or hatha yoga or whateve=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rhetorical Question, Vinay_ji.=\r\n..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If ALL references of GOD were to be possibly wiped out from=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; collective memory of humanity -- All kinds and forms of Gods and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their NAMES really ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How would the world and society =\r\nlook, feel, behave, act or react?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Religion has two purposes: (1) =\r\nEnable some seekers to experience Self and become liberated and (2) maintai=\r\nn some sanity, righteousness and order in the world.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If there is =\r\nno concept of god, no faith in god and no faith in after-life, world can th=\r\nen degenerate into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pursuit of selfish nee=\r\nds of each person.

To LIVE in limelight as a general rule is foolishness fo=\r\nr a Gyani, but sometimes Gyanis may come into limelight for some specific c=\r\nause; it is the cause they care for and not the limelight or lack of it.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //What a gyani does *after* self-realization varies from one gya=\r\nni to another.//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Your keyword in &quot;What a gyani does&quot; is  =\r\n&quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma of a Gyani. It is very difficult to understand KARMA, as =\r\nGita says. Proper definitions of Karma, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are needed. S=\r\nince nobody can live without doing something, as Gita says, what is Akarma =\r\nin fact? Whatever be the mode or type of action of a Gyani, it is done with=\r\nout any desire of fruit for self, and therefore the actions of a Gyani shou=\r\nld not be included in general Karma. The Karma which does not produce phala=\r\n for the performer is Akarma. Brahmasutra speaks of four types of Moksha.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //What a self-realized person does is dependent on the previous=\r\n history of that soul and what Nature expects from one.//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both=\r\n YES and NO! A self-realized soul has to bear whatever is written in his/he=\r\nr birthchart for THIS LIFE.

But why the Surya is performing Ta=\r\npa? What Surya will gain? Loka-samgraha, because the Surya perceives all ot=\r\nher souls as its own parts and wants their well being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //to re=\r\nmain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, and yet rem=\r\nain in oneness with the underlying oneness//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, this is the =\r\nproper way of living in this world for a self realized soul. There is no al=\r\nternative in this world. One cannot remain in perpetual nirvikalpa samadhi =\r\nin this world. But it is not proper to call the former as a &quot;higher state&quot;.=\r\n It is not advisable to discuss real Samadhi in a public fora. These things=\r\n are taught by a spiritual Guru to the disciple according to the propensity=\r\n and ability of the latter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As you have used the term &quot;higher =\r\nstate&quot;, let me say that the highest state of samadhi is indeed that type of=\r\n samadhi which was attained in battlefield by entire dynasty of Rama, and f=\r\nor sometime by Arjuna. It is &quot;Yoga of the Rajarshis&quot; according to Gita, whi=\r\nch had vanished from this world after Ikshvaku dynasty and was temporarily =\r\ngiven to Arjuna after a long absence during entire Dvapar yuga. There were =\r\nmany rishis and paramhamsa in Dvapar. But only Arjuna attained Rajarshi-yog=\r\na. Lord Krishna was not a yogi, He was and is the aim of all yogas (=3DComm=\r\nunion).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find your statements to be absolutely true.

They retain their identity till the end of the creati=\r\non cycle and yet are ever liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am quoting a relev=\r\nant writeup from message 438 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup titled &quot;Rishis&quot;:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that our senses p=\r\nerceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the power of duality. If the =\r\nveil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and all is ONE uniform and=\r\n undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana =\r\nor Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided consciousness is known as &quot;unm=\r\nanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality, where there are many different ob=\r\njects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that went through some mo=\r\ndification and manifestation. It is known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both are=\r\n Brahman only.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Normally, living in the domain of duality =\r\nwithout being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near to imp=\r\nossible. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the underlyin=\r\ng oneness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality withou=\r\nt experiencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of duality is =\r\nalmost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of onene=\r\nss with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no =\r\nobjectification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is the ad=\r\nvaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, maharshis have described higher states. It is possi=\r\nble to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at th=\r\ne same time. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses perceivin=\r\ng objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness=\r\n (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either at=\r\ntraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of objects=\r\n by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some att=\r\nractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain in=\r\n a state where there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object is =\r\npossible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such a state is experienced by very few beings.=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda also experienced it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rishis are beings wh=\r\no are always in a very high state. They are always alert to the maya and ye=\r\nt not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality and yet are not attract=\r\ned or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and repulsion and y=\r\net remains in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But because one is =\r\nneither attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has no personal ego=\r\n and one has no reason to do anything for personal ego. Then one becomes an=\r\n instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature through =\r\none&#39;s actions, which are performed without any attachment or personal ident=\r\nification. One who has a personal ego can do limited things. One who has a =\r\nvery very small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do ANY thin=\r\ng. But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the natural or=\r\nder of the universe. They can change the course of history of nations and p=\r\nlanets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rishi in this state may engage in various actio=\r\nns of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no attachment with the=\r\n actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIf one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman=\r\n forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unm=\r\nanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he wi=\r\nll freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such =\r\na rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as a process runn=\r\ning in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task.=\r\n Even if the computer process has finished all the initialization and early=\r\n work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again.=\r\n Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process of over=\r\ncoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a Vivekananda is =\r\nborn from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overco=\r\nme the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an=\r\n ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness a=\r\nnd with the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument=\r\n of Nature performing actions of tremendous consequences without any person=\r\nal ego driving those actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna specifical=\r\nly said six of his disciples were ever liberated.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The full message can be read at:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Rish=\r\nis&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ..spiritual G=\r\nuru of Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vasishtha, Viswamit=\r\nra and Rama were all gyanis.

One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Anoth=\r\ner good saint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnation of Sara=\r\nda Mata. Satya Sai Baba said \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he identified a particular y=\r\noung man as the reincarnation of Swami \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ramakrishn=\r\na was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disciples=\r\n of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they nearly \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next century.

Anyone who \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claims to be Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada, MUST BE associated and su=\r\nrrounded by a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of ATLEAST 15/20 very high caliber sadhaka=\r\ns.=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1  These very high caliber \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nadhakas=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 who will surround a reborn Ramakri=\r\nshna or Ma Sarada will each be like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual stalwarts in the=\r\nir own rights, like each of Ramakrishna and Ma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada&#39;s discip=\r\nles were (Swami Brahmananda, Swami Premananda, Swami Sivananda \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n etc etc) when they had=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 incarnated. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So unless this condition is met, (which Ramakrishna him=\r\nself had specified in his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last birth), most of the Ramakrishna=\r\n or Ma Sarada reincarnation-claimants have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be dis-qualified=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have an impression that if and when=\r\n Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swamiji reincarnate, they would=\r\n have an association with the Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mission. This is, in=\r\n my opinion, an incorrect assumption. When Lord Krishna was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bo=\r\nrn, he did not spend his time trying to find out where is Ayodhya since he =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 also=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1 Lord Rama is his=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 past life.

And only a soul of Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n caliber can do it. Anyone lesser, would only fizz out=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1 with time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not that=C3=83=C6=92=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 they (Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1 Swamiji) will find the work to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy at all. Fo=\r\nr startes, the dunces would be in confederacy against them. When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Vivekanada, before he became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was bitt=\r\nerly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opposed by the &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city on various=\r\n issues. Then a young \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and=\r\n decided he will leave Kasi and never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return to that city unti=\r\nll he &quot;falls on society like a thunderbolt&quot;. Well, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is pre=\r\ncisely what he did. He fell on Indian society like a thunderbolt, after \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which those very pandits of Kasi wrote to him, asking him to come=\r\n and grace \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their city! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let us kee=\r\np our fingers crossed and not=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 focus on emt=\r\npy speculations, rather \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wait for the most interesting coming=\r\n=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 decade to unfold in all its=C3=83=C6=92=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 sound and fury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, what would be your name and religion and national=\r\nity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though religion us=\r\nually stays the same, it CAN \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change. Nationality can of course=\r\n change too. Job, skills, external nature, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks, gender, even=\r\n yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can all change \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fr=\r\nom birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, the seed of one&#39;s ne=\r\nw birth is formed at the time of one&#39;s death. As \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s connect=\r\nion is severed with the body, the last desires/thoughts/ponderings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of the mind become the seed for the next life. Nature chooses for one =\r\na future \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course that allows one to pursue those desires, as mu=\r\nch as allowed by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous karmas and debts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is able to not entertain ANY desire as one element afte=\r\nr another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated=\r\n. All the spiritual sadhana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we see you again a=\r\nnd do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YO=\r\nU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I and you like each other and your rebirth a=\r\nnd my rebirth meet each other, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they will start off taking a li=\r\nking to each other. If I and you dislike each \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other and your r=\r\nebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they will start off \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dis=\r\nliking each other. This will happen without either being consciously aware =\r\nof \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who one was and who the other person was, in the last life.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, if your question is how we can recognize=\r\n that so and so person is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so a=\r\nnd so person is a rebirth of Paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, the an=\r\nswer is complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reborn person may not look li=\r\nke the old person or do similar work or have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much *external* s=\r\nimilarity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; one. After all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; R=\r\nama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna had thous=\r\nands \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wives. Rama was a great warrior and killed Ravana in t=\r\nhe biggest war of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times. Krishna was a key player in the b=\r\niggest war of his time, but did not take \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a weapon at all. The =\r\ngame can be diffent in each coming..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul,=\r\n it can become a trap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna explicitly told=\r\n Sarada Mata that he would be back after 100 years \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that ev=\r\nerybody else who came with him would have to come back with him. When \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did not have a=\r\n choice! Even \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to c=\r\nome back once more. The Master \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I am to come back once mor=\r\ne with him&quot;. When questioned &quot;you have to come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back because Sh=\r\nri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he replied, &quot;souls like that have great \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ramakrishna said that people would g=\r\net \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberated en masse during his next coming and that would be=\r\n the last opportunity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time to come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of R=\r\namakrishna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!)=\r\n. Another good saint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that she is the re-incarnation =\r\nof Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that he identified a parti=\r\ncular young man as the reincarnation of Swami \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda. Ram=\r\nakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; di=\r\nsciples of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they near=\r\nly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual India for the next centu=\r\nry. None of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by peo=\r\nple of such caliber or fit the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It i=\r\ns not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themsel=\r\nves and of course ego is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the root of delusion!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, is it necessary to recognize whether X is a rebirth of Y=\r\n, given that X \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Y are different and play a different game? =\r\nA small discussion on this point \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though external factors like nationality, religion, name,=\r\n job, looks, gender etc \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can change, some internal factors may =\r\nremain the same. Moreover, who one likes, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who one dislikes, wh=\r\nat values one is attracted to internally, etc, may remain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; esse=\r\nntially the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, suppose rajput king=\r\n Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim emperor Akbar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (as said by Vim=\r\nalananda). One was a Hindu and the other was a Muslim. However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; both were very brave, unafraid of death, inherently spiritual, had a refi=\r\nned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous c=\r\nonnections with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raise=\r\nd when his mother was hiding at a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajput household, before mov=\r\ning to Delhi. Despite being a Muslim, he actually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helped the H=\r\nindu causes (to the extent possible at that time) by putting an end \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to barbaric practices like killing defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu=\r\n priests in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conquered places. He promoted acceptance of other =\r\nfaiths, canceled pilgrimage \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taxes on Hindus and even came up w=\r\nith his own religion of humanity towards the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end of his life b=\r\ny integrating various religions. In one life, he tried to save \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n India from invading barbarians. In another, he was born as a cultured man =\r\namid \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; barbarians and tried to save India by changing the ways o=\r\nf his own people. There \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a subtle continuity in the agenda a=\r\nt a deeper level!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpa=\r\nna:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;jyotish_vani@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Lokesh_ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As nearly ALL of do =\r\nexcept this &quot;BABAJI&quot; Character described in Lahiri Mahashay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(=\r\nno connection with the ayanamshaa that is causing lot of problems for many!=\r\n), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yukteshwar and Yognanda and Kriya Yoga -- shall probably d=\r\nie and hopefully be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;born again -- here is a simple question f=\r\nrom a simpleton:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, what would be =\r\nyour name and religion and nationality, when we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;see you again=\r\n and do you know how we shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not being FLIPPANT at all but just reminding you a=\r\nnd myself how evanescent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;each of us truly ARE!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rohiniranjan\n\n\n"}}
