Nature has created a \nsituation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has placed that \nperson in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.\n\n(2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the \nopportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in the \naction while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;), he now gets a \nnew karma. He will be paid back later.\n\nBoth are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with identification \nand he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being paid \nback for what you did before.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn order to break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody does something \nto you. Do not hate the person or pity yourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it \nhave to happen to me&quot;. Think only about your current action (&quot;what is the \nbest thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) and do NOT think about what happened, why it \nhappened, who did it and how things happening to you are unfair.\n\nThe tricky thing is when Nature places you in a position to pay back \nsomebody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong temptation for you to do so. \nYou may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad thing to someone! But \nremember one thing. Any thought or action with a sense of doership (&quot;I am \ndoing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the other person brought it on \nhimself with a previous action.\n\nIf you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and surrendering \nthe action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that is \nvery very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can also \npostpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the \ntemptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we live \nin a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion, \nself-control and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most \ntroublesome karmas to a later time.\n\nWhen the reactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through who is \nnot in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. So you \ncan do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a large \nextent under your control. Use your will power to do the right things.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:19 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n\n\n&gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:\n&gt;\n&gt; is it that everything that is happening to us in this life is all reaction \n&gt; to some of our past actions?it is difficult for me to understand this.\n&gt; To me, it can also be that someone is pushing this suffering onto us as \n&gt; his action than a reaction of our old karmas.\n&gt; In any case, if we are getting cheated and we know it clearly why should \n&gt; we sit back and just let things happen against us, why should we not fight \n&gt; back?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Fantastic question! Before I answer it, I want to say that I am impressed \n&gt;&gt; with the decription of your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live in \n&gt;&gt; the greater Boston area too?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Karma and karmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing something and \n&gt;&gt; being pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object with some force and that object pushes \n&gt;&gt; you back karmically with the same force at a later point of time, it is \n&gt;&gt; not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to push again. \n&gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That is \n&gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has \n&gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and \n&gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction \n&gt;&gt; later.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of mental equanimity and stability does \n&gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which binds \n&gt;&gt; him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like \n&gt;&gt; this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who wants so \n&gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of \n&gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If \n&gt;&gt; the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound from \n&gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So \n&gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets \n&gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and \n&gt;&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature \n&gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to \n&gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Nature \n&gt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of \n&gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will \n&gt;&gt; continue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions from that \n&gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an \n&gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being \n&gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend \n&gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver \n&gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result of \n&gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or \n&gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s good \n&gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one feels \n&gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one should \n&gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s bad \n&gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. You cheated \n&gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats you now. How \n&gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old action-reaction \n&gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm does \n&gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening now, \n&gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous \n&gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His \n&gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does it \n&gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it becomes a new karma for that \n&gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and \n&gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose \n&gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop the person from cheating you. Then your current \n&gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction \n&gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you \n&gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you described below. Accept whatever comes \n&gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and relaxed \n&gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do at \n&gt;&gt; the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing \n&gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts and \n&gt;&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to be in a neutral \n&gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few \n&gt;&gt; &gt; years\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the hospital and took care of all of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the family. His wife was a very spiritual person\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident, his wife told him of her \n&gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation experience and that she would probably be leaving her body\n&gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even during the funeral process. Some folks felt \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a stable mind. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt;&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spiritual and mental bond and they have \n&gt;&gt; &gt; two\n&gt;&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I have the utmost reverance towards him and also in awe \n&gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his spiritual level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; never feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n\n\n"}}
