Most such statements in folklore are neither \nentirely =\r\nincorrect nor fully accurate. One needs the right context and \nperspective =\r\nto understand.\n\nThe microcosm inside us reflects the entire universe. By ha=\r\nrnessing the \nability of consciousness to focus on some things, it may be p=\r\nossible to \ncreate changes inside and outside. But what that requires is a =\r\ncertain \nstate of mind. A densely conditioned mind cannot focus on anything=\r\n. A \nmind that overcame most of its conditioning can focus well and \naccomp=\r\nlish things.\n\nTo remove internal conditioning, we engage in various externa=\r\nl practices \n(such as pooja, homam etc). External symbols cause resonance i=\r\nnside and \nmodify internal conditioning with time. For example, when we do =\r\nhomam, \nexternal fire resonates with the internal fire (aspect of conscious=\r\nness \nthat burns conditioning) and one progresses.\n\nSimilarly, external sma=\r\nshana where bodies are burnt will cause resonance \ninside consciousness and=\r\n promote an &quot;internal smashana&quot; where \nconditioning dies, burns and disappe=\r\nars.\n\nCreate an internal smashana in your mind, where various types of \ncon=\r\nditioning and various wants, agendas, likes and dislikes are killed \nand pu=\r\nt to rest so as to not rise again. Without a good internal \nsmashana, sadha=\r\nna done in an external smashana will not be that \neffective. With a good in=\r\nternal smashana, sadhana done anywhere will be \nvery effective.\n\nYes, for a=\r\n few, sitting in an external smashana and seeing the play of \nNature will b=\r\ne conducive to creating an internal smashana. If so, one \ncan go and sit in=\r\n a smashana. But, if one with dense conditioning goes \nto a smashan and doe=\r\ns a sadhana with high expectations of certain \nresults (spiritual or materi=\r\nal), because one read that smashana sadhana \nis powerful for begetting resu=\r\nlts, one may be deluding oneself.\n\nJust my 2 cents, take it or leave it...\n=\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n"}}
