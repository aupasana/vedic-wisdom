It is the nectar that can confer immortality =\r\nand perennial peace. Repeat the Name of the Lord always and attain the fear=\r\nless state. You can repeat any divine Name you like. All names of the Lord =\r\nare equally potent.\n\nSing the Lord=E2=80=99s glory. Worship the Lord with a=\r\nll your heart and with all your mind. Remember Him always. All your miserie=\r\ns will come to an end. Your heart will be purified. The Lord will soon reve=\r\nal Himself to you. You will truly feel His presence everywhere. Pray ferven=\r\ntly to the Lord for the descent of His light and grace. Crave for His mercy=\r\n. Yearn for communion with Him. Melt the mind in divine love. Burn the lowe=\r\nr nature in the fire of devotion.\n\nMan is not a helpless being. He has a fr=\r\nee will of his own. Self-effort ensures divine grace. Therefore, overcome a=\r\nll your unfavourable circumstances by right aspiration and application. Hav=\r\ne courage. Be bold. Never despair. You will surely succeed. There is nothin=\r\ng in this world which cannot be achieved by a man of determination, perseve=\r\nrance and the right kind of effort.\n\n\n"}}
