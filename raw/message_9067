I did not mean to say =\r\notherwise. =C2=A0 But just having an ishta devata is not enough to be &quot;prot=\r\nected&quot; from deep and troublesome instabilities when one&#39;s body-mind complex=\r\n goes through a big transformation. Not every aspiring devotee becomes a Pr=\r\nahlada - some become Ravanas. After all, out of the two examples Leelaji ga=\r\nve below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana of=\r\n Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a deity and pray to him/her can end up w=\r\nith hallucinations, mental and spiritual disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s=\r\n conditioning and desires!) interpretation of internal/external experiences=\r\n and even madness. =C2=A0 True surrender/devotion to ishta devata will defi=\r\nnitely protect one, but cultivating it is as difficult as cultivating detac=\r\nhment through wisdom! In fact, true surrender and detachment are almost the=\r\n same. =C2=A0 This is\n why I said that *lightness of conditioning* is the m=\r\nost important thing. One with dense conditioning will find SOME way to fail=\r\n even if a great guru or god are ready to help. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=\r\n=A0 Now, the question is: How do we reduce our conditioning? Unfortunately,=\r\n there is no single magic bullet. Thinking of a god, mantras, bhajans, japa=\r\nm, homam etc can help, but they need to be augmented by regular introspecti=\r\non and self-improvement. =C2=A0 Taking mind away from its current pre-occup=\r\nations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing good sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I d=\r\nid not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am better than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at an=\r\ny cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually overcoming conditioning, for these th=\r\noughts keep *reinforcing* the conditioning! =C2=A0 To reduce the regular pr=\r\ne-occupations of mind, different imagery/visualization may work better for =\r\nsome people. =C2=A0 One approach is to contemplate god whenever possible, i=\r\nn the middle of\n any activity. You can imagine a being in your mind, either=\r\n as an ideal/able person or as a principle/ideal/ability that exists in man=\r\ny beings, that is so perfect and fascinating for the mind to contemplate th=\r\nat it does not care about other objects around that are making shadripus an=\r\nd ashtapashas work on the mind. Whenever mind is about to entertain its reg=\r\nular debilitating pre-occupations, one can try to contemplate god instead. =\r\n=C2=A0 Mind is a wild animal. As Pi says in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about th=\r\ne tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t be transformed or domesticated, but=\r\n they can be trained into some habits! =C2=A0 Whenever one is enjoying a se=\r\nnsual pleasure, if one thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is enjoying this thru th=\r\nis instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of that god instead o=\r\nf thinking too much about limited sense objects, one is better placed to re=\r\nduce the damage done by shadripus. Whenever one is angry at someone for wha=\r\nt they did, if\n one thinks &quot;the omnipresent God is giving me the fruits of =\r\nmy karmas thru that instrument&quot; and starts contemplating the qualities of t=\r\nhat god instead of being angry at someone, one is better placed to reduce t=\r\nhe damage done by shadripus. And so on. =C2=A0 In the beginning, even conte=\r\nmplation of god becomes laced with ego. Every now and then, the activity en=\r\nds up becoming about oneself rather than about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice=\r\n bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress t=\r\nhrough this&quot;). With effort and perseverance, one can avoid making it about =\r\noneself and keep it centered on the supreme power that runs the show. Just =\r\nas it takes a long time to train a wild animal, it takes a long time to tra=\r\nin mind! =C2=A0 Try to develop devotion and surrender. Based on all that yo=\r\nu read and heard, develop of a concept/principle of god that is so superb a=\r\nnd fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate that concept as frequently as possib=\r\nle, especially\n when meditating. When mind veers off into other things, gen=\r\ntly steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much time dissecting what mind is doing =\r\nand why. Just put it back gently into contemplating god. Try to make it abo=\r\nut god rather than about yourself. =C2=A0 The main drawback of the sadhana =\r\nof most people is that they make it about themselves at some level or the o=\r\nther. Though that is unavoidable, try to break free from it. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Finally, one can try to overcome the limited sense of self =\r\nand engage in selfless actions that benefit a larger set of people than one=\r\nself. What stops us from truly loving god is our deep and sub-conscious lov=\r\ne for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* notion of self that drives the curren=\r\nt body-mind complex). One way to overcome that is to selflessly love others=\r\n. After all, other people around us are as much replicas of god as we are. =\r\nIf we cannot empathize with them, love them and give them unconditionally,\n=\r\n how can we ever hope to transcend the limited sense of Self and truly love=\r\n omnipresent God? =C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Sp=\r\nirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 201=\r\n3 10:35 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Dear Friends ,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0All psychosomatic or schizophrenic ca=\r\nses are not defined as=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 wrongly=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 experime=\r\nnted=C2=A0=C2=A0kundalini=C2=A0=C2=A0 experiences .

These are not my word&#39;s,=\r\n but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, one =\r\ndoes not get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort tow=\r\nards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life an=\r\nd may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But o=\r\nne may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes i=\r\nn this life.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many sp=\r\necific desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (beca=\r\nuse of constraints on what\n Nature can give you right now, arising from YOU=\r\nR OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, =\r\nwhen you no longer want it or want something else. For example, one may pra=\r\ny for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man=\r\n in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health=\r\n. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowled=\r\nge or money. In another case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film=\r\n. One may be reborn as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not r=\r\neally enjoy that experience. Basically, people keep going in circles throug=\r\nh various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body =\r\nexperience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n previous karmas constrain=\r\n one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this sp=\r\necific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind =\r\nit).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not ne=\r\ncessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude an=\r\nd detachment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I=\r\n went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I=\r\n went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would k=\r\nill it!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap c=\r\nalled this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slo=\r\nw death!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current bod=\r\ny-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastra=\r\ns say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some\n stage involve stepping=\r\n out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioni=\r\nng is overcome, is far better than Kundalini rise forced when some really u=\r\nndesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;When =\r\none transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, =\r\nanother notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the su=\r\nrface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there m=\r\nay be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings=\r\n on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint=\r\n etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be =\r\na great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated=\r\n X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kund=\r\nalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person ma=\r\ny show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck bad=\r\nly.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable condi=\r\ntioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause=\r\n serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of =\r\nKundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your weaknesses and impro=\r\nve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is=\r\n not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the =\r\nother side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment. =C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;D=\r\non&#39;t worry about whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether y=\r\nou are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta =\r\npashas) or not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are makin=\r\ng progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making pro=\r\ngress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) w=\r\nill automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal dei=\r\nty. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simp=\r\nly do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is=\r\n the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and =\r\nplease give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you a=\r\nnd please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is somethin=\r\ng you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas,=\r\n desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;=\r\ns fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anythi=\r\nng Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as L=\r\nord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lor=\r\nd with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong =\r\nnotions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thi=\r\nnking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one =\r\nas said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to=\r\n my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect i=\r\nt, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* fr=\r\nom God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like g=\r\nrave danger that one\n should run away from!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop disp=\r\nassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken =\r\naway anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prep=\r\nared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental co=\r\nnditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kund=\r\nalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s n=\r\nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meet=\r\ning True Self.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning i=\r\ns.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality=\r\n Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Februa=\r\nry 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha=\r\n to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All th=\r\ne so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow the =\r\nother entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the=C2=\r\n=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha =\r\n,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose th=\r\ne human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more det=\r\nachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, gr=\r\need etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has=\r\n to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far=\r\n more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - =\r\nA good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does=\r\n - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entiti=\r\nes, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless,=\r\n and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. T=\r\nhey take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utiliz=\r\nes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n vital. 4 - Whil=\r\ne someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakt=\r\ni awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of th=\r\nis. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insuffi=\r\ncient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the a=\r\nura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and =\r\nhelps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to variou=\r\ns reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can =\r\nallow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances=\r\n of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various pos=\r\nsiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover=\r\n, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right k=\r\nnowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often=\r\n doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.\n Sometimes it will have=\r\n results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point i=\r\ns a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sa=\r\nna in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wy=\r\naktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttam=\r\nam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@....u=\r\nk&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 Februa=\r\nry 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome=\r\n based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatr=\r\ny job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems t=\r\no think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childh=\r\nood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the =\r\nbody. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until he=\r\nr symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been ab=\r\nle to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it mig=\r\nht be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally =\r\nill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneo=\r\nus kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this =\r\ntopic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-u=\r\nnderstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n k=\r\nundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the ku=\r\nndalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini s=\r\nhould not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times be=\r\ncause the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will c=\r\nonsume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what sol=\r\nution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Div=\r\nine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this=\r\n woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I r=\r\nequest that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like=\r\n her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let=\r\n us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselv=\r\nes. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safes=\r\nt to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to=\r\n God&#39;s will.

But on a deeper level, the conviction that only the Reaity exi=\r\nsts, remains all along.&lt;br&gt;Bhakti is a progressive detachment from material=\r\n objects. As long as there is some form of definition, contamination, attac=\r\nhment and conditioning, Bhakti has never reached its full maturity.&nbsp; U=\r\nntil a certain point, attachment to the deity remains and eventually the de=\r\nity vanishes too.

I did not mean to say otherwise. &nbsp; But just having an =\r\nishta devata is not enough to be &quot;protected&quot; from deep and troublesome inst=\r\nabilities when one&#39;s body-mind complex goes through a big transformation. N=\r\not every aspiring devotee becomes a Prahlada - some become Ravanas. After a=\r\nll, out of the two examples Leelaji gave below for &quot;psychological disorder&quot;=\r\n, the second lady &quot;did much sadhana of Srirama&quot;. Even those who think of a =\r\ndeity and pray to him/her can end up with hallucinations, mental and spirit=\r\nual disorders, wrong (colored by one&#39;s conditioning and desires!) interpret=\r\nation of internal/external experiences and even madness. &nbsp; True surren=\r\nder/devotion to ishta devata will definitely protect one, but\n cultivating =\r\nit is as difficult as cultivating detachment through wisdom! In fact, true =\r\nsurrender and detachment are almost the same. &nbsp; This is why I said tha=\r\nt *lightness of conditioning* is the most important thing. One with dense c=\r\nonditioning will find SOME way to fail even if a great guru or god are read=\r\ny to help. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Now, the question is: How do we red=\r\nuce our conditioning? Unfortunately, there is no single magic bullet. Think=\r\ning of a god, mantras, bhajans, japam, homam etc can help, but they need to=\r\n be augmented by regular introspection and self-improvement. &nbsp; Taking =\r\nmind away from its current pre-occupations (e.g. &quot;I am smart&quot;, &quot;I am doing =\r\ngood sadhana&quot;, &quot;I am mad at X&quot;, &quot;I did not get what I deserve in Y&quot;, &quot;I am =\r\nbetter than X&quot;, &quot;I must have Y at any cost&quot; etc etc) is key to eventually o=\r\nvercoming conditioning,\n for these thoughts keep *reinforcing* the conditio=\r\nning! &nbsp; To reduce the regular pre-occupations of mind, different image=\r\nry/visualization may work better for some people. &nbsp; One approach is to=\r\n contemplate god whenever possible, in the middle of any activity. You can =\r\nimagine a being in your mind, either as an ideal/able person or as a princi=\r\nple/ideal/ability that exists in many beings, that is so perfect and fascin=\r\nating for the mind to contemplate that it does not care about other objects=\r\n around that are making shadripus and ashtapashas work on the mind. Wheneve=\r\nr mind is about to entertain its regular debilitating pre-occupations, one =\r\ncan try to contemplate god instead. &nbsp; Mind is a wild animal. As Pi say=\r\ns in the movie &quot;Life of Pi&quot; about the tiger on the boat, wild animals can&#39;t=\r\n be transformed or domesticated, but they can be trained into some habits! =\r\n&nbsp; Whenever one is enjoying a sensual pleasure, if one\n thinks &quot;the omn=\r\nipresent God is enjoying this thru this instrument&quot; and starts contemplatin=\r\ng the qualities of that god instead of thinking too much about limited sens=\r\ne objects, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. Whe=\r\nnever one is angry at someone for what they did, if one thinks &quot;the omnipre=\r\nsent God is giving me the fruits of my karmas thru that instrument&quot; and sta=\r\nrts contemplating the qualities of that god instead of being angry at someo=\r\nne, one is better placed to reduce the damage done by shadripus. And so on.=\r\n &nbsp; In the beginning, even contemplation of god becomes laced with ego.=\r\n Every now and then, the activity ends up becoming about oneself rather tha=\r\nn about god (&quot;*I* am doing this nice bhajan&quot;, &quot;*I* am doing this nice homam=\r\n&quot;, &quot;I think *I* am making progress through this&quot;). With effort and persever=\r\nance, one can avoid making it about oneself and keep it centered on the sup=\r\nreme power that runs the show. Just as it\n takes a long time to train a wil=\r\nd animal, it takes a long time to train mind! &nbsp; Try to develop devotio=\r\nn and surrender. Based on all that you read and heard, develop of a concept=\r\n/principle of god that is so superb and fascinarting. Visualize/contemplate=\r\n that concept as frequently as possible, especially when meditating. When m=\r\nind veers off into other things, gently steer it back. Don&#39;t spend too much=\r\n time dissecting what mind is doing and why. Just put it back gently into c=\r\nontemplating god. Try to make it about god rather than about yourself. &nbs=\r\np; The main drawback of the sadhana of most people is that they make it abo=\r\nut themselves at some level or the other. Though that is unavoidable, try t=\r\no break free from it. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Finally, one can try to =\r\novercome the limited sense of self and engage in selfless actions that bene=\r\nfit\n a larger set of people than oneself. What stops us from truly loving g=\r\nod is our deep and sub-conscious love for *ourselves* (i.e. our *limited* n=\r\notion of self that drives the current body-mind complex). One way to overco=\r\nme that is to selflessly love others. After all, other people around us are=\r\n as much replicas of god as we are. If we cannot empathize with them, love =\r\nthem and give them unconditionally, how can we ever hope to transcend the l=\r\nimited sense of Self and truly love omnipresent God? &nbsp; \n&lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\nBACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica=\r\n, clean, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:13px;&quot;&gt;Best regards, Narasim=\r\nha -------- Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicast=\r\nrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STYL=\r\nE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);F=\r\nONT-SIZE:13px;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-=\r\nLEFT:rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica=\r\n, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, n=\r\new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Aria=\r\nl&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc =\r\n1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#=\r\nccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719hr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGH=\r\nT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGH=\r\nT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, February 28, 2013 10:35 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kund=\r\nalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv255306719&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv255306719ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR=\r\n:#fff;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;COLOR:#000;FONT-S=\r\nIZE:10pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;Dear Friends ,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;A=\r\nll psychosomatic or schizophrenic cases are not defined as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; wrongly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; experimented&nbsp;&nbsp;kundalini&nbsp;&nbsp; e=\r\nxperiences .

It is just A SMALL STEP in o=\r\nvercoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me give an analo=\r\ngy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this body-mind =\r\ncomplex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace ov=\r\ner time and\n move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasion=\r\nally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out=\r\n of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact,=\r\n it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in=\r\n it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without =\r\nany out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishth=\r\na&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, one does not get something w=\r\nithout wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have de=\r\neply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough ef=\r\nfort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (an=\r\nd ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has=\r\n a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what=\r\n\n Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR OWN previous actions). S=\r\no Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it=\r\n or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s w=\r\nhole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not=\r\n enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, =\r\none may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span =\r\nid=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;In another case, one may =\r\ndeeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn as a tiger or a do=\r\ng and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that experience. Basically=\r\n, people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;kee=\r\np going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they a=\r\nre &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply =\r\ndesires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s\n pr=\r\nevious karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in=\r\n next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enou=\r\ngh karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundal=\r\nini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in te=\r\nrms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to=\r\n a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to sh=\r\nake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scare=\r\nd that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to th=\r\ne mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from=\r\n a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this=\r\n current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self=\r\n&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some\n stage invo=\r\nlve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without being scared?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable condi=\r\ntioning is overcome, is far better than Kundalini rise forced when some rea=\r\nlly undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Wh=\r\nen one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what one need=\r\ns, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the=\r\n surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, ther=\r\ne may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness cli=\r\nngs on to (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan class=3D&quot;yiv255306719userContent&quot;&gt;e.g. a great doctor, a great leader,=\r\n a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/span&gt;). As an extreme example, if one =\r\nperson had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues\n the world, =\r\nhe may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world no=\r\nw. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such no=\r\ntion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and ye=\r\nt remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An awakened Kundali=\r\nni in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesse=\r\ns and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual pro=\r\nblems.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2=\r\n_19_1362067846619_158&quot;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in ter=\r\nms of Kundalini and its rise.

Though true surrender is helpful=\r\n, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though peop=\r\nle may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&quot;I want X, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;I will pray to yo=\r\nu and &lt;/span&gt;please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will =\r\npray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. Ther=\r\ne is something you want and you ask god\n for it. True surrender has no plac=\r\ne for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing o=\r\nneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is ac=\r\ncepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly=\r\n painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is t=\r\nhinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and dur=\r\ning) Death.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desire=\r\ns and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped,=\r\n despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;p=\r\nrotect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If yo=\r\nu go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying =\r\nto protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *=\r\nrun away* from God&#39;s protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned=\r\n mind like grave danger that one\n should run away from!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv255=\r\n306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wh=\r\nether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detac=\r\nhment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. En=\r\njoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose eve=\r\nrything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very=\r\n light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to m=\r\neet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distra=\r\nct rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resource=\r\ns: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-=\r\nCOLOR:transparent;FONT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, clean, sa=\r\nns-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);FONT-SIZE:13px;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1=\r\n362067846619_60&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_59&quot;&gt;------=\r\n--&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_165&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_62&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;B=\r\nORDER-LEFT:rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_136206=\r\n7846619_65&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;FONT-SI=\r\nZE:10pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_168&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255=\r\n306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_69&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new r=\r\noman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_1=\r\n9_1362067846619_167&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_70&quot;&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTO=\r\nM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER=\r\n-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719hr&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Leela Sastry &l=\r\nt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, Febru=\r\nary 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n255306719&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv255306719ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:#fff;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, ti=\r\nmes, serif;COLOR:#000;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_13=\r\n62067846619_79&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishta=\r\ndevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra all=\r\now the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with t=\r\nhe&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are under the protection of&nbsp; a mahadev=\r\natha ,all the other&nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .=\r\n But&nbsp; it can be attained by the righteous behaviour along with manthra=\r\nnushtana .

Constant efforts of purification of the vario=\r\nus elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words th=\r\nis translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness,=\r\n control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini=\r\n awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with great=\r\ner force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then take=\r\ns care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens -=\r\n IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to vari=\r\nous other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whil=\r\ne some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make\n use of the in=\r\ndividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=\r\nr and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=\r\ns even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an ex=\r\nperience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of p=\r\nsychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west t=\r\noday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also po=\r\nssible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from var=\r\nious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can g=\r\net &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifest=\r\nyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the=\r\n mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are v=\r\nery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list =\r\ndown every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis\n is correctly done, v=\r\nery few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who cla=\r\nim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess w=\r\nork. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ach=\r\nieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient G=\r\nreeks used to say - &lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv255306719st&quot;&gt;Mens sana in corpore san=\r\no.&lt;/span&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv255306719MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv2=\r\n55306719Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(153,153,153);&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv255306719Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT=\r\n-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_=\r\n3_2_0_2_134243527249950 yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_92&quot;&gt;awaktam =\r\nwyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY=\r\n:Verdana;COLOR:navy;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_2_0_2_13424=\r\n3506227946 yiv255306719yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_17=\r\n_1362045432997_73 yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_93&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwy=\r\nayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monos=\r\npace, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067=\r\n846619_95&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, ser=\r\nif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_96&quot;&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM=\r\n:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-=\r\nTOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv255306719hr&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt=\r\n;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:b=\r\nold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrom=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv255306719&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div=\r\n id=3D&quot;yiv255306719ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of=\r\n kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine.
