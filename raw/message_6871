He was trying hard to break in to the suprem=\r\ne realm of Nirvikalpa Samadhi uder guidance of his Guru Totapuri but every =\r\ntime he attempted to enter THAT, a well adored form of Mother Kali came in =\r\nbetween and he could not succeed much to the irritation of the Naagaa Sadhu=\r\n. Finally Ramakrishna resolved and with Sharp sword of Discrimination & wis=\r\ndom cut through the form of Mother Kali and entered in to the zone of Nirvi=\r\nkalpa i.e. merged in the formless Brahman.\n\nTo my mind, Durga saptashati in=\r\ndicates the different layers of the spiritual truths in a simple way. Hold =\r\non to a Form of Deity and the deity will over show that everything in creat=\r\nion is Maya including the form of the deity and lastly one will realize the=\r\n Brahman wich pervades everything or realization of nothing except 1.\n\n\n\n"}}
