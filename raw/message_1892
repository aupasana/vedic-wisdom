Sanchit karma is our past k=\r\narma that is sitting bottled up in jars, out of which one jar is open and t=\r\nhose sanchit karma become prarabdh karma, i.e. fruitification of sanchit ka=\r\nrma. This karma we have to endure there is no way to get out of it.\n\nNow fr=\r\neewill is that capacity gifted by god to human beings that dictates how we =\r\nendure these prarabdh karma, i.e. do we accumulate more karmas or we endure=\r\n them such that our other sanchit karma also diminish. Remember there is no=\r\nthing like good or bad karma, every one only have their relative way to app=\r\nreciate.\n\nRecently I read a very inspiring story in a newspaper although th=\r\ne story was about aan dana for donation of food, but it applies here very a=\r\nppropriately.\n\nThe story goes like this, there was man who never got enough=\r\n food.\nsome days he would get very little and other days nothing. Tired of =\r\nthis hardship he goes to a fakir and complains about not getting enough foo=\r\nd The fakir was a realized seer and sees what&#39;s in store for the man. The f=\r\nakir tells the man, you have a very long life but you only have 5 bags of f=\r\nood that has come with it due to your past actions and so you go without fo=\r\nod many days and somedays you get some food. The man thought for a moment a=\r\nnd requested the faqir to get all remaining bags at once. The fakir was sur=\r\nprised but gives into the wish of the man. Next day the man gets 3 bags of =\r\nfood, he cooks all the food at once, feeds himself nicely and donates the r=\r\nest of the food to other needy people and they all enjoy food. He goes to s=\r\nleep feeling satisfied. Next day he wakes up and again there is 3 bags of f=\r\nood, he does the same thing, what he did yestarday. He was very surprised a=\r\nnd shocked. This goes on and on. After a while he goes back to the fakir an=\r\nd narates everything and thanks fakir and god for a miracle. The fakir unde=\r\nrstands the situation and suggests that the power of donating food to the n=\r\needy is very great it is one of the best and greatest gifts anyone can make=\r\n.\n\nSo here the man uses his freewill to change his destiny or accumulated k=\r\narma.\n\nSometimes in Life we have choice and our selection is the free will =\r\npart, but again we still accumulate karmas after the selection.\n\nShri Aurob=\r\nindo learns painting and music at a very old age. He wanted to set an examp=\r\nle that one learn anything if one applies himself with dedication and works=\r\n hard, this is freewill. Now what karma he accumulated or not only he knows=\r\n.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh \n\n\n"}}
