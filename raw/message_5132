They should go east-west and connect homa kundam to your seat. M=\r\nelt the ghee and place the bowl containing it on those lines.\n&gt; &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Due =\r\nto technical restrictions, i am not able to effectively observe the above a=\r\nspect given in the Manual. My Havan Kunda is on Bricks or on a metalic Stan=\r\nd due to which it does not make feasible to connect The Havan Kund and Asan=\r\na. How important this aspect is w.r.t. connection of external fire with Int=\r\nernal fire? i am hardly observing this rule. Any thoughts/suggetions on thi=\r\ns?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
