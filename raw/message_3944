I compliment him for asking it and having the courage to ask it.\n\nLor=\r\nd Shiva in Guru Gita tells to Devi Parvati --- &quot;There is no mukti without b=\r\nukti&quot;.\n\nAny good saint I have had a chance to read or listen or speak to,\nn=\r\never says that &quot;Do Sadhana with spiritual expectations only&quot; In general I m=\r\nean any type of Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donatio=\r\nn, bhajan,satsang and many other types.\n\nThey always try to increase furthe=\r\nr the Shraddaha of a sadhak in things that captivates a Sadhaka&#39;s mind due =\r\nto his or her state of sanskars.\n\nThey always try to help the Sadhak walk o=\r\nn the path that leads towards spirituality. They always wish well for their=\r\n disciples and have good amount of patience.\n\nMany Sadgurus take care of th=\r\neir disciples for many life times, helping and guiding in each life time.\n\n=\r\nThey always preach many things and show value for different types of sadhan=\r\nas depending on their state, time, and type of disciple.\n\nFor householders =\r\nalways there are challanges and one should request God to look into it and =\r\ngive guidance and help, whether it is food, house, marriage, car, or any ma=\r\nterial issue. There is nothing wrong in doing this, even if sadhana done fo=\r\nr materialistic benefits.\n\nToday even those who have renounced householder =\r\nlife have to pray god to fulfill some of their material needs.\n\nWe live in =\r\nvery difficult and challanging times and it appears it is going to become m=\r\nore challenging.\n\nSome material gain can at times make a person better or m=\r\nore balanced or be more prepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. \n\nEv=\r\nen during an eclipse many people do mantras etc to solve problems or improv=\r\ne material conditions, there is nothing wrong about it. I have read message=\r\ns in the past on this group suggesting natives not to do it or it is wrong.=\r\n These type of messages are not correct, it only confuses people. Time duri=\r\nng the eclipse is very good for getting results for any sadhana done during=\r\n that time. it is equally good for material or spiritual type.\n\nEveryone ha=\r\ns right to have a opinion and share their views but one needs to also under=\r\nstand the influence aspect of those views.\n\nEvery Shotra or prayer or even =\r\nGeeta or Ramayan, there are riders at the end for results like becoming wea=\r\nlthy, overcoming challenges, enemies etc.\nIf it were inappropriate the Seer=\r\ns from the past would not write it.\nAre they wrong in writing that?\n \nThey =\r\nwrite it to motivate people to read them as one reads more times there is a=\r\n possibility that may lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n\nMoving to o=\r\nriginal set of questions,\n\nEvery one is born with accumulated sanskars out =\r\nof which as a native interacts with the world some of these accumulated or =\r\nsanchit sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskars=\r\n give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are lik=\r\ne seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears fruit.\n\nAll human =\r\nbeings are also born with another quality and that is known as will power. =\r\nThey say will power can change destiny ...\n\nWhen one does sadhana like say =\r\nHomaam or Japam. Many things happen\nat many levels, at times there is impro=\r\nvement in materialistic situation, problems get solved or if the problems r=\r\nemain that state of sadhaka becomes such that he or she pays less attention=\r\n to the problem or attaches less importance to the problem. God or Guru or =\r\nShakti shows the sadhaka a path to move forward. Sadhana does increase will=\r\n power and makes one more tolerant and \nSadhana also help in eliminating th=\r\ne sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your =\r\nsanchit sanskars will get crushed such that they can never germinate or fru=\r\nitify into prarabdh sanskars.\n\nSo yes doing sadhana can help one overcome m=\r\nany things at different levels and help one move in the right direction. At=\r\n times one moves faster or very slowly. The important thing is moving and i=\r\nf one falls down, than one should immediately get up.\n\nThere are many ways =\r\nto improve and move faster towards spirtuality,\nVimalanda is not just one s=\r\naint, there are many who have reached similar or higher or lower realizatio=\r\nns adopting different methods and have written very good books too. Spritua=\r\nlity is much bigger, deeper and broader than what Vimalanada has described =\r\nin his books.\n\nI find it little cultish to just refer him all the time in t=\r\nhe group. Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.\n\nPlease note that I hav=\r\ne nothing against Him, I respect him as I respect other saints from the bot=\r\ntom of my heart. I did spent money to get his books and plan to read in nea=\r\nr future.\n\nI urge all the readers of this group to read more books from dif=\r\nferent sects, different saints and try to get appropriate influence. Get br=\r\noader and deeper views as that helps forming a good base for spirituality. =\r\nSpirtuality is about tolerance and remaining neutral in different situation=\r\ns.\n\nThe Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda,\n=\r\nDatta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christain saints (The book of Mirdad=\r\n) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper realiz=\r\nations and experiance. There are many sects in south india too, kerala, tam=\r\nil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajasthan, gujarat and other states, a=\r\nll of them had great saints.\n\nGenerally these saints never bothered to writ=\r\ne or explain or were not able to explain. But some did write and a lot of g=\r\nood work is out there to explore along with doing sadhana.\n\nWe live in time=\r\ns where there is very little guidance available on the path of spirituality=\r\n. So in these times we have to make up with reading good books written by s=\r\naints of yestaryers and surrender more to god.\n\nThere is scarcity of Sadgur=\r\nus and good Sadhaks, we have many entry level and confused situation :-) ..=\r\n..\n\nIf you look at sikhism, the last sadguru dev from their sect made the b=\r\nook &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru instead of making anyone else take his seat.=\r\n\n\nWhen Lahiri Mahashaya met a famoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect=\r\n from him. Some of the famous saint&#39;s disciple were upset,\nat that the sain=\r\nt reminds them that to reach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so year=\r\ns but Lahiri Mahashaya did it in one birth.\nHis name slips my tongue, he wa=\r\ns big and very strong lived in water many hours at a time, his name starts =\r\nwith tri. They say that one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue =\r\nof the saint at his samadhi mandir.\n\nOne must always try to broaden ones pe=\r\nrspective, all of us have a long long way to go, even if some may feel that=\r\n oh I only have some more things left so I may be done in some years, even =\r\nthat is an interesting situation as there is always a chance of falling dow=\r\nn.\n\nEven for Saint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevated but =\r\nhe also had some sanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy first and=\r\n than suffer due to pingala. He was already realized before his birth as th=\r\ne rajah.\n\nI did not intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertan=\r\ntly did it I appologize in advance, Narashima has written very well many ti=\r\nmes and of late has written some good stuff.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh \n\n--- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nDear Raju,\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems honest outburst.

It sounds like- because =\r\n&#39;Agni&#39; is very effective medium for praying, one is taking its advantage to=\r\n get all the mundane benefits, release from various troubling issues, fulfi=\r\nlling the worldly ambitions. It&#39;s like switching the source (Normal prayers=\r\n in temples, Japam etc...) for asking the same thing. It&#39;s like acting very=\r\n smart with God. \n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha Insisted in his homam manual about the men=\r\ntal attitude.

Make us sit on your lap by purifying us.\n&gt; After some few years=\r\n struggle, i have understood that one must not confuse Spiritual rituals wi=\r\nth Material benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Narayana said our money, fame etc...are the r=\r\nesult of Rnas/Karmas. \n&gt; \n&gt; We must pray during homam for the continuation =\r\nof daily Homam.
