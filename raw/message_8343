Thanks for =\r\nmaking &quot;surrender/loving&quot; point extremely clear.\n\nI have heard lot of thing=\r\ns from some very senior guys in &quot;ayi panth&quot; nath sampradaya. Some are accom=\r\nplished in 52-53veer/64yogini. They focus on devotion+method. They do have =\r\nishta as shiva but then they do sadhana for all gods with all kinds of mant=\r\nra from sabar/muslim/hindu. They sometimes give particular sadhana/process =\r\nfor certain end results (wordly-money/health/solving problems). Some are ea=\r\nsy to activate, some are not-so. Siddhi is of course a different ball-game,=\r\n Far difficult to digest as compared to getting one. Even they dont carry t=\r\nhe extreme view on surrender and there is always a method.\n\nYou got to writ=\r\ne things that makes sense to lesser mortals. And hell not after your single=\r\n malts. \n\nAre you up for some questions so that we can learn a bit. Because=\r\n for some grand reason 99.99% people do get it wrong. and for the few who d=\r\no get it right &quot;nothing else matters&quot;\n\nTo entice you further Will throw in =\r\nchoice for you, you can choose to ignore 1 out of 10 questions.\n\nRegards,\np=\r\nriyank\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt;  \n&gt; * Insert Awkward long silence here =\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ahem&quot;\n&gt; Oh yaar bhen marrayen yeh sab saari sadhnayeen, tum log bha=\r\ngwaan pe kyun nahin focus karte ho, aaltoo faltoo dhakke khane ki bajaiye,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Kisi ko bhagwaan se toh pyaar hai nahin, bas siddhi chahiyen inko, yeh=\r\n saadhna karni hai, woh saadhna karni hai, karna kuch hai nahin, bas bolna =\r\nhai, apne mann ki tasalli karne ke liye.\n&gt; \n&gt; First develop true love for g=\r\nod, then you need not ask what will this bring and what will that bring, wh=\r\nat karmas, what siddhis, what superpowers, what anything.\n&gt; \n&gt; No amount of=\r\n pdf&#39;s, books, reading material will take you to god, till god turns into y=\r\nour beloved and no sacrifice on your end is too extreme to catch a glimpse =\r\nof your beloved.\n&gt; \n&gt; Everybody on this board (excluding a few) wants &quot;expe=\r\nriences&quot;, i Have seldom come across anyone who wants god.\n&gt; \n&gt; You people w=\r\nant proper procedures on doing reading  stotra, reading 10 different stotra=\r\ns, doing worship for &quot;different&quot; deities, which direction should the idol b=\r\ne in, this , that , its too much noise.\n&gt; Worship god as an ignorant child =\r\n,a lover lost in love, then you will automatically know what to do.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tu=\r\nmhen bhagwan chahiye, ya experiences???\n&gt;  Everybody is after the results o=\r\nf a homam, kyun bhai business deal chal rahi yahan pe, yah pooja??\n&gt; \n&gt; Yeh=\r\n blog waali sadhna tum tab karna ya karmon ka hisaab lagana jab tumhen pehl=\r\ne bhagwaan se sacha pyaar ho, jab sacha pyaar hoga, toh &quot;tum&quot; toh beech mei=\r\nn hoge nahin, sadhana bhi siddh, minimal karmas, plus connection with god w=\r\nill come then.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fools approach these practices for &quot;experiences&quot;, &quot;powe=\r\nrs&quot;, and get stuck there.\n&gt; \n&gt; First have the love to play this to your cho=\r\nsen form of your wroship\n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DzkbaRP8xtLI\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; And for saadhnas like those mentioned in that blog, try playing the so=\r\nng for beings who appear &quot;fierce&quot;, for beings whom &quot;you&quot; are ready to die f=\r\nor, for a form of god that you will go all out for.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once there was a m=\r\nan in Gujrat, who hankered on and on and on how will do anything for god, o=\r\nne night in a cremation ground  he was given an axe, a bottle of whiskey ( =\r\nto get Drunk), and was told , Cut your arm off for god, you said you will d=\r\no anything right???

Even so called V=\r\nedic Sadhanas are often done for material gains. Recall how most of the San=\r\nskrit stotras of various deities contain a phalastuti (the expected results=\r\n), is that not material gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health ben=\r\nefits, isn&#39;t that a material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of =\r\nthe sadhaka which determines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhan=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tool=\r\ns also acquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduc=\r\nt of the path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing =\r\nthem or commercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gai=\r\nn a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, =\r\nas it stands today, is roughly divided into two major geographic and philos=\r\nophical demarcations. The style practiced in South India - mostly Dakshina =\r\nMargi - and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly Vama Margi=\r\n. In my personal opinion, the adherents of the path in both cases, generall=\r\ny speaking, have been trapped in two delusions born out of collateral bypro=\r\nducts of their respective paths. The first step of Shakti sadhana is genera=\r\nting shakti. Second step is holding the shakti. Third step is channeling th=\r\ne shakti. In view of this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent today has=\r\n tied itself up in too much of technicalities, such that on an average they=\r\n forget to capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme=\r\n Goddess). WHile the other school is able to generate and hold shakti much =\r\nbetter, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it (generally speaking=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  expcetions are there too). End result, both eventually do not end =\r\nup producing enough genuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i am wond=\r\nering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one might be gettin=\r\ng into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda =\r\nsays. Theoretically, when the *right person* performs many of the things me=\r\nntioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff there is not exactly accuratel=\r\ny portrayed), he/she will know how to balance the karmic impact well. In th=\r\ne hands of an immature individual, it can lead to disaster. Further, the so=\r\n called division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sha=\r\nrp and clear as it is made out there. Each influences the other and is very=\r\n much intermingled.=C2=A0 Every sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm spi=\r\nritual basis. Performed correctly, with the right attitude, and by the righ=\r\nt individual, it leads to very high spiritual states.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bazeecha-e-at=\r\nfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ek baat h=\r\nain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; __________________________=\r\n______\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  From: priyank_priyank &lt;aks_day@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, 12 June 2012 10:14 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been following some tantra=\r\n groups and in tantra there seems to be 3 attitudes. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.
