After\nwe shifted to the palmyra gro=\r\nve, I took the book and found it to be in\nMalayalam script. Having already =\r\nlearnt that script, I easily learned to\nread and write.=94\n\n=93When did you=\r\n learn Telugu?=94 asked someone.\n\n=93When I was in the Virupaksha Cave,=94 =\r\nsaid Bhagavan,\n\n=93Gambhiram Seshayya and others asked me to write some sta=\r\nnzas in Telugu and\nso I transcribed letter by letter from Sanskrit into Tel=\r\nugu script and\npractised them. Thus I slowly learnt Telugu in the year 1900=\r\n.=94\n\nI asked him when he had learnt the Nagari script.=93That must also ha=\r\nve been\nabout the same time,=94 said Bhagavan. =93Muthurama Dikshitar and o=\r\nthers used to\ncome frequently, as they had books in Nagari script, I used t=\r\no copy the\nletters and in that way got used to them.=94 Someone said, =93We=\r\n had heard that\nyou learnt Telugu only after Nayana came to you.=94\n\n=93No,=\r\n=94 said Bhagavan, =93I learnt it much earlier, but I got used to speaking\n=\r\nit freely only after he came, that=92s all.=94 =93We had heard,=94 said ano=\r\nther,\n=93that you learnt Telugu in your boyhood days.=94\n\n=93I did not know=\r\n how to write or read Telugu at that time,=94 said Bhagavan.\n=93My grandfat=\r\nher=92s younger brother knew Telugu; he used to keep me by his\nside on the =\r\ncot and teach me Telugu alphabet. That was all. I learnt Telugu\nonly while =\r\nwriting the stanzas. Subsequently, when I wrote =91Upadesa Saram=92,\nYogi R=\r\namiah wanted it in Telugu, so I wrote it in couplets (dvipada),\nclosely fol=\r\nlowing the Tamil metre.\n\nI then showed it to Nayana who said that it was no=\r\nt a correct Telugu couplet\nand he taught me the metres (ganas) of the Telug=\r\nu verses.\n\nI wrote them down in Tamil script and then made the required alt=\r\nerations.\nWhen I showed it to Nayana,he said it was correct and could be gi=\r\nven to the\nprinters.\n\nLater,when Balarama Reddy got me a copy of the Sulaks=\r\nhana Saram,I learnt the\nmetres of the other verses, copied them on two page=\r\ns of paper and pasted\nthem in our copy of the Telugu primer.\n\nThat has been=\r\n sufficient for my purposes. Now, if anyone reads a verse, I\ncan easily fin=\r\nd out in what metre it is and what mistakes, if any, there\nare. I learnt on=\r\ne language after another in the same way.
