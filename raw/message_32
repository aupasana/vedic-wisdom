This was disrupted for last two and half years due to deaths i=\r\nn\nfamily. Because of the cumulative method you explained I hope I could\nres=\r\nume, even during a short visit, the chandi paths with a sata chandi\npath, r=\r\nest mother&#39;s wish.\n\nWith my best regards\nSwadhin \n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Swadhin,\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne normal interpretation is to add the counts of all participants.\nIf ten \n&gt;=\r\n people read nine times each, the count is 10x9=3D90.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we did Sata=\r\n Chandi homam, we did it that way. Actually, we did\nnot do \n&gt; over ten days=\r\n. It was 7 days. We cumulatively chanted 90 times in 4\ndays and \n&gt; then cha=\r\nnted 10 times *in the fire* over the final 3 days.\n&gt; \n&gt; The priest arranged=\r\n for some other priests to read Chandipath during\nthose 4 \n&gt; days and clear=\r\n the count of 90 with a safe margin. But not all of\nthem were \n&gt; reading it=\r\n at the temple. They were reading it at their homes with the \n&gt; mental sank=\r\nalpam to contribute to the homam at the temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; The homam was due to t=\r\nhe sankalpam of my spiritual master Dr Manish\nPandit \n&gt; from Manchester, UK=\r\n. He suggested that we should actually get to the\ncount \n&gt; of 90 *at* the t=\r\nemple if possible. So some of us chanted several\ntimes a day \n&gt; and actuall=\r\ny covered the count of 90 at the temple itself with a\nmargin. In \n&gt; additio=\r\nn, some more people read it at homes, based on the previous\nplan of \n&gt; the =\r\npriest. So we made the count in different ways.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was not there all th=\r\ne 7 days. During the first 4 days, I was away\nfor 2 \n&gt; days, visiting Tirup=\r\nati, Tirunannamalai, Kanchi etc. But my guru was\nthere \n&gt; chanting all the =\r\nseven days. On 5 out of 7 days, I too was there at the \n&gt; temple. However, =\r\nwe left the temple and went to the house of the\nhead priest \n&gt; to sleep in =\r\nthe nights. It may have been a good idea to sleep at the\ntemple \n&gt; itself. =\r\nAgain, it is a very alive temple with so many kinds of\nenergies...\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes=\r\n, we think we are the doers, but we are just pawns. Just read the \n&gt; kavach=\r\na, argala and keela in the beginning of chandipath on each day\nfor \n&gt; prote=\r\nction.\n&gt; \n&gt; I took a vow at the Sata Chandi homam to read Chandipath for 10=\r\n8\nconsecutive \n&gt; days and completed it in June 2006. A couple of months aft=\r\ner that,\nthe head \n&gt; priest of that Kalikambal temple visited Boston. He wa=\r\ns at our house\nand we \n&gt; did 10 Chandi homas at my house. We did 8 on a Sat=\r\nurday (starting in\nthe \n&gt; morning and going on till 2 am!), the 9th on Sund=\r\nay morning and did an \n&gt; elaborate final one on Sunday afternoon. It was si=\r\nx months after the\nSata \n&gt; Chandi homam in Chennai and it can also be consi=\r\ndered a different\nkind of \n&gt; Sata Chandi homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Swadh=\r\nin&quot; &lt;beherajapan@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, =\r\nMarch 16, 2007 3:51 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] need some calrifications a=\r\nbout chandi-path ; to \n&gt; Narasimha ji\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha ji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n have a few questions regarding the chandi path and I hope you can\n&gt; &gt; help=\r\n me with your knowledge as you have much experience in this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How do=\r\n you do certain number of chandi paths? Does one person reads\n&gt; &gt; the book =\r\ncontinuously until the number of pathas is completed?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was wonderi=\r\nng if it is OK to do simultaneous paths by say 7 people\n&gt; &gt; to complete sap=\r\nta chandi path? If that is possible then sata chandi\n&gt; &gt; path can be comple=\r\nted even in one day. But I remember you did that in\n&gt; &gt; Chennai over a peri=\r\nod of 10 days or so. In this case did the person\n&gt; &gt; (I think you) who took=\r\n the sankalp to complete the sata chandi path\n&gt; &gt; stayed in the temple from=\r\n start to end?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I understand from my experience that without mother&#39;=\r\ns wish such a\n&gt; &gt; thing is not possible but do people invoke mother&#39;s prote=\r\nction in\n&gt; &gt; some way besides choosing an auspicious time (as you did)\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and with my best regards\n&gt; &gt; Swadhin\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
