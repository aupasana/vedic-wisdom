On the=\r\n other hand, all your views are based on your subjective understanding of v=\r\narious factors and your subjective opinions.\n=A0\nAs for Hanuman being Shiva=\r\n tattva, you too agreed that &quot;Hanuman was an exceptional amsa of Shiva&quot;. So=\r\n we both basically agree on Hanuman being Shiva tattva.\n=A0\nBottomline: My =\r\nviews are based on objective factors.

There is a bit o=\r\nf the paramatma in everyone, in which case\n&gt; the whole idea of amsas and av=\r\nataras would not be meaningful at\n&gt; all because it would be too generic. Gi=\r\nta mentions very clearly\n&gt; that as the Lord Supreme (Paramatma) sits in the=\r\n heart of all\n&gt; matter and manifestation.\n=A0\nYou missed the word &quot;more&quot; in=\r\n what I said. Yes, all beings have some paramatmamsa, but a lot more jivatm=\r\namsa. Those who have &quot;more&quot; paramatmamsa are avataras. Very few avataras ex=\r\nist that are completely free from jivatmamsa and Parasara calls them &quot;poorn=\r\navataras&quot;. That way, most avataras are &quot;amsavataras&quot;.\n=A0\nTo summarize, onl=\r\ny paramatmamsa=3Dpoornavatara, a lot of paramatmamsa and some jivatmamsa=3D=\r\namsavatara, a lot of jivamsa and a little paramatmamsa=3Dnormal people.\n=A0=\r\n\nHappy Akshaya Tritiya again!\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrolog=\r\ny & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n--------\n=A0\nFr=\r\nom http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1rk8rga:\n=A0\n@homam108 I am combining a=\r\n few answers to some of your twits in here.\n\nYou said : &lt;&lt;Rama=3DVishnu tat=\r\ntva+Shiva tatva, Krishna=3DVishnu tatva+Shakti tatva, Hanuman=3DShiva tatva=\r\n.&gt;&gt;\n\nTo substantiate your point, such that others find it acceptable, you m=\r\nust corroborate this with valid examples from confirmed primary texts, and =\r\nyour derivation from those examples. That would make a meaningful debate. O=\r\ntherwise, anyone can have any opinion. What do others care?\n\nI disagree. Ve=\r\nry simply put, I understand Shiva tattwa as detachment. Shakti tattwa is an=\r\ny form and manner and display of Shakti (this is the most fluid definition)=\r\n, and Vishnu tattwa as an instinct of preserving and protection for dharma =\r\nfor a spiritual purpose. As one becomes more universal, so does ones dharma=\r\n.\n\nIn an objective study of Krshna&#39;s life as it comes down to us from the M=\r\nahabharata and the 10th Canto of the Bhagwatam, I find ample and more evide=\r\nnces of Shiva Tattwa in him. Leaving aside the Supernatural Godly feats tha=\r\nt he performed as a powerful, but dharmik, display of supernatural Shakti, =\r\nit is his perfect detachment and therefore perfect self-confidence in every=\r\n move - even when he runs away from battle in a well calculated plan as per=\r\n Mbha- that is most striking. If this is not Shiva tattwa, I don&#39;t know wha=\r\nt Shiva Tattwa is. That is why he was considered the perfect Purusha, while=\r\n everyone else, male of female is a Shakti with respect to Krshna. In Krshn=\r\na Avatara there is Shiva, and Shakti tattwa working in perfect synergy, and=\r\n of course Vishnu Tattwa, otherwise he would not have bothered with the gre=\r\nater dharma.\n\nToday Hanumana is famous as the best devotee of Rama or the g=\r\nreatest warrior. But the original Valmiki Ramayana - and that is why I so l=\r\nove the original Ramayana as opposed to later retellings - described him as=\r\n an expert in all forms of music, expert in poetry, expert in grammer/logic=\r\n, expert in speech, a pundit of the highest order, a very multifaceted char=\r\nacter! That is why the Narada Purana says he contains amsas of both Shiva a=\r\nnd Vishnu in him.\n\n\n&lt;&lt;These words r used subjectively. Beings coming down w=\r\nith more paramatmamsa r called avataras. Even they may contain only a 1/2&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n\nConceptually I disagree with this understanding too and here is why. Ther=\r\ne is a bit of the paramatma in everyone, in which case the whole idea of am=\r\nsas and avataras would not be meaningful at all because it would be too gen=\r\neric. Gita mentions very clearly that as the Lord Supreme (Paramatma) sits =\r\nin the heart of all matter and manifestation.\n\nThe specific use of the term=\r\ns amsa vs avatara is important. Why is Rama or Krshna not called an amsa of=\r\n Vishnu but Avatara of Vishnu, but Hanumana is called an amsa of Shiva? I d=\r\non&#39;t think the ancient sages used words and terms loosely. Because the core=\r\n philosophy of the shaivas was that Shiva has only archetypal avatars like =\r\nSadyajata, Tatpurusha Vamdeva, Aghora, Ishana. Later it was extended to inc=\r\nlude Bhairava, and all the 8 Bhairavas as avatars of Shiva, and Virabhadra.=\r\n These beings are not directly involved, in a catalytic way, with human lif=\r\ne as the main Vishnu Avataras are. Hanuman therefore comes as an aid to Ram=\r\na, not to win the battle by himself which he very well could have done, but=\r\n only in establishing the principle and purport of Rama&#39;s life and act.\n\nSo=\r\n I adhere to that school of thought that says Shiva takes no avatars. Thoug=\r\nh various amsas of his comes down often for different works. Hanuman was an=\r\n exceptional amsa of Shiva.\n\nVimalananda, IMO, nails it perfectly when he s=\r\nays Shiva or Paramashiva is Unmanifested Absolute. His stories, his Avatara=\r\ns, his iconography - smashan, sitting naked on the himalayas in samadhi ETC=\r\n - all is but an attempt to explain/capture this concept of the Unmanifeste=\r\nd Absolute.\n\nNarayana is that aspect of the Absolute which guides the consc=\r\niousness and spiritual path on earth. Hence the name - Nara + Ayana.\n\nNaray=\r\nana and Paramashiva are too ways of looking at that Absolute, based on thei=\r\nr generic functions.\r\n---1593584224-807765955-1368414171=:86514\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Repl=\r\nying to one of your posts on twitter:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Narasimha said : &l=\r\nt;&lt;Rama=3DVishnu tattva+Shiva tatva, Krishna=3DVishnu&lt;br&gt;&gt; tatva+Shak=\r\nti tatva, Hanuman=3DShiva tatva.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; To substantiate y=\r\nour point, such that others find it acceptable,&lt;br&gt;&gt; you must corroborat=\r\ne this with valid examples from confirmed&lt;br&gt;&gt; primary texts, and your d=\r\nerivation from those examples.
