And after that we had conversed on many different topics, (when I=\r\n say conversation, mostly him talking I listening or asking questions). So =\r\nI have forgotten large part of the conversation, I represented whatever I c=\r\nould assimilate and remember.\n=C2=A0\nAbout tattwas he had told me that inde=\r\ned everything around us is but a play of these five. During those days I us=\r\ned to suffer from cronic depression. He looked at me and told me, &quot;when the=\r\n jal tattwa in the body reduces compared to the agni, the jal becomes vayu =\r\nand vayu increases disproportionately. This when not controlled, leads to s=\r\ntates which modern medical science calls depression&quot;..\nI don&#39;t know if it s=\r\nounds too simplistic, but that is what he had told me one day. And he had s=\r\ntressed that even God himself cannot have perfect mastery over more than 16=\r\n kalas when he manifests in a human form. But that itself is exceptional. N=\r\no other being except for Krishna had such a state, or will ever have such a=\r\n state in this cycle of creation. \n=C2=A0\nThese 64 kalas (jyotish was one o=\r\nf the kalas in there i remember) also relate to the 64 yognis.However the y=\r\noginis supposedly represent the raw energy associated with the kalas. There=\r\nfore, the yoginis can be VERY harmful unless one knows what one is doing. I=\r\nt is like raw lightning. When controlled and brought into our homes as elec=\r\ntricity its wonderful, but when unleashed in nature, they are entirely dest=\r\nructive.\n=C2=A0\nI remember whenever he was meeting someone new or in a new =\r\nplace, every five ten minutes he would keep staring at his own palm for a f=\r\new second. Very intensely. One day I asked him, why does he do that. He sai=\r\nd, &quot;I check the placement and degree of the tattwas around me. The five fin=\r\ngers give me an indication of the tattwas at that time and place which in t=\r\nurn tells me everything about the person or situation around me. What has h=\r\nappened, what is happening and what is most likely to happen.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nSorry=\r\n this may not be what you had wanted to know, but this is what I could reme=\r\nmber at this moment. Most part of the conversation would fly off tangential=\r\nly above my head when he used to tell me these things.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n--- O=\r\nn Wed, 12/11/08, Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Rama=\r\nkrishna &lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Du=\r\nality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today)\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com\nDate: Wednesday, 12 November, 2008, 10:37 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRajarshi Ji=\r\n,\n=C2=A0\nThank you for sharing this.

This person was telling me about the 64 kala=\r\ns. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, but let m=\r\ne try and reproduce whatever I could understand.\n=C2=A0\nHe showed me an old=\r\n diagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre like =\r\na whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64 ka=\r\nlas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; placed at various places on th=\r\ne circle. At the centre was atmavidya. \nHe said these 64 represent 64 diffe=\r\nrent kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born in this ph=\r\nsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas.=\r\n It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this physical bod=\r\ny. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why=C2=A0he is purna avatar.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nEven Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of =\r\none more then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going into other =\r\nsubtle realms. \n=C2=A0\nFor an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I m=\r\nean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptiona=\r\nl feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.\n=C2=A0\nNow =\r\nthis 16/64 is theoritically=C2=A0the maximum knowledge of all aspects of=C2=\r\n=A0the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is roughl=\r\ny 1/4th. \n=C2=A0\nWhile talking about this, he was also trying to explain to=\r\n me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree=\r\n should each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him to be able=\r\n to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking m=\r\nostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which a=C2=A0 rea=\r\nlly spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained whether he had =\r\nuse and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha tattwas&quot; of this physi=\r\ncal plane of existence. \n=C2=A0\nAnyway I know this may all sound very jumbl=\r\ned up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of un=\r\nderstanding. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n--- On Tue, 11/11/0=\r\n8, Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Ramakrishna &lt;ram=\r\nakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re:=\r\n Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today)\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n=\r\nDate: Tuesday, 11 November, 2008, 11:33 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarasimha garu,\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nNamaste.\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; When a being like Krishna is \n&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He =\r\ncan do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \n&gt;&gt; When a being like=\r\n Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \n&gt;&gt; things in the d=\r\nual world that are impossible for others.\n\nI heard Kalas in the context of =\r\nmoon (moon phases).

Even great =\r\njnaanis are \noccasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanife=\r\nsted non-dual \nBrahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fu=\r\nlly ever. She is \ncapable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wron=\r\ng idea as soon as \none ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *=\r\nanything*. What She \ndoes and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. =\r\nThe only way to deal \nwith Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.\n\n&gt; on =\r\nthe other hand we are all a part of Divinity\n\nBTW, though we are all part o=\r\nf the same Divinity, we are all not the same. \nIn the non-dual field, we ar=\r\ne all the same. But, in the field of duality, we \nhave differences due to p=\r\nrevious vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what \nand how much we can do =\r\nwithin the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \nborn with 16 kalas, He=\r\n can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \nWhen a being like S=\r\nai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \nthings in the dual w=\r\norld that are impossible for others.\n\nRealizing the non-dual Self is someth=\r\ning that is possible for anyone, but \nthere are limits imposed on what thin=\r\ngs one can do in the dual world, based \non the force of previous conditioni=\r\nng. Thus, all are the same at one \n(non-dual) level and all are different a=\r\nt another (dual) level.\n\nBut it is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s calibe=\r\nr is. Thus, your basic \npoint holds. But I just wanted to point that all ar=\r\ne not indeed the same.

He =\r\nwas reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attend=\r\ning this weekly\n&gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years =\r\nold. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily a=\r\nt 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; O=\r\nne day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbha=\r\ni,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=\r\n=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son ca=\r\nme to call him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will =\r\nbe a plane\n&gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much=\r\n impressed about\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had =\r\nto go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus =\r\ntire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not com=\r\ne from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super\n&gt; &gt; pow=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\n&gt; &gt; mys=\r\nelf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I pr=\r\nayed\n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and be=\r\nstow his\n&gt; &gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wif=\r\ne at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from =\r\n7 am I was\n&gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the mo=\r\nrning that I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife =\r\nwas annoyed and\n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy sho=\r\nuld you take such a hasty\n&gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a d=\r\nevotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He\n&gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru=\r\n should be living one, who can guide us,\n&gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc.=\r\n Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; since you are =\r\ndoing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at=\r\n her place as people in general not\n&gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I =\r\nwas confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in t=\r\nhe influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had tol=\r\nd me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accep=\r\nting him. I also decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife t=\r\nhat =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. Yo=\r\nu have also not seen him. He has never\n&gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living=\r\n. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minute=\r\ns, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=C3=A2?=\r\n=EF=BF=BD--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it is possible? I =\r\ndon=C3=A2?Tt believe.=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD-\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur t=\r\no send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my w=\r\nife. =C3=A2?~I want to test your existence\n&gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; today.=C3=A2?T\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test =\r\nThakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night du=\r\nty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried t=\r\no sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told =\r\nme that-=C3=A2?o Go to your friend=C3=A2?Ts\n&gt; &gt; house. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting =\r\nfor you. He wants to test me.

And afte=\r\nr that we had conversed on many different topics, (when I say conversation,=\r\n mostly him talking I listening or asking questions). So I have forgotten l=\r\narge part of the conversation, I represented whatever I could assimilate an=\r\nd remember.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;About tattwas he had told me that =\r\nindeed everything around us is but a play of these five. During those days =\r\nI used to suffer from cronic depression. He looked at me and told me, &quot;when=\r\n the jal tattwa in the body reduces compared to the agni, the jal becomes v=\r\nayu and vayu increases disproportionately. This when not controlled, leads =\r\nto states which modern medical science calls depression&quot;..&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I don=\r\n&#39;t know if it sounds too simplistic, but that is what he had told me one da=\r\ny. And he had stressed that even God himself cannot have perfect mastery ov=\r\ner more than 16 kalas when he manifests in a human form. But that itself is=\r\n exceptional. No other being except for Krishna had such a state, or will e=\r\nver have such a state in this cycle of creation. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;These 64 kalas (jyotish was one of the kalas in there i remember) also =\r\nrelate to the 64 yognis.However the yoginis supposedly represent the raw en=\r\nergy associated with the kalas. Therefore, the yoginis can be VERY harmful =\r\nunless one knows what one is doing. It is like raw lightning. When controll=\r\ned and brought into our homes as electricity its wonderful, but when unleas=\r\nhed in nature, they are entirely destructive.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nI remember whenever he was meeting someone new or in a new place, every fiv=\r\ne ten minutes he would keep staring at his own palm for a few second. Very =\r\nintensely. One day I asked him, why does he do that. He said, &quot;I check the =\r\nplacement and degree of the tattwas around me. The five fingers give me an =\r\nindication of the tattwas at that time and place which in turn tells me eve=\r\nrything about the person or situation around me. What has happened, what is=\r\n happening and what is most likely to happen.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Sorry this may not be what you had wanted to know, but this is what I coul=\r\nd remember at this moment. Most part of the conversation would fly off tang=\r\nentially above my head when he used to tell me these things.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;S=\r\nTRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR=\r\n: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; =\r\n- Hamlet&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Wed, 12=\r\n/11/08, Ramakrishna &lt;I&gt;&lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb=\r\n(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is st=\r\nill alive today)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Wednesday, 12=\r\n November, 2008, 10:37 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1584688772&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-t=\r\next&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rajarshi Ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you =\r\nfor sharing this.

This person was telling me about the 64 =\r\nkalas. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, but l=\r\net me try and reproduce whatever I could understand.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He showed me an old diagram where there was one circle that was movi=\r\nng out from a centre like a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm =\r\nwas one layer of the 64 kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; plac=\r\ned at various places on the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;He said these 64 represent 64 different kinds of knowledge across the thr=\r\nee realms. A man when born in this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acqui=\r\nre mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas. It is impossible to master even one m=\r\nore Kala staying in this physical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery=\r\n.That is why&nbsp;he is purna avatar.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Even Lor=\r\nd Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16=\r\n would mean leaving the physical body and going into other subtle realms. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For an ordianry person, even mastery (by maste=\r\nry I mean perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exce=\r\nptional feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Now this 16/64 is theoritically&nbsp;the maximum kn=\r\nowledge of all aspects of&nbsp;the universe that a man can gain from his ph=\r\nysical body. Which is roughly 1/4th. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While ta=\r\nlking about this, he was also trying to explain to me how these kalas inter=\r\nact with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree should each tattwa inter=\r\nact with a person in his system for him to be able to gain mastery of any p=\r\narticular of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and =\r\nthat by knowing the exact age at which a&nbsp; really spiritual person leav=\r\nes his body, it can be ascertained whether he had use and access to tattwas=\r\n beyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha tattwas&quot; of this physical plane of existence. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway I know this may all sound very jumbled =\r\nup and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of under=\r\nstanding. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&quot;This above all: to thi=\r\nne own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 11/11/08, Ramakrishna &lt;I&gt;&lt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. co=\r\nm&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2=\r\npx solid&quot;&gt;From: Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_ blr@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject:=\r\n Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive t=\r\noday)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, 11 November, =\r\n2008, 11:33 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv486352971&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nTABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=\r\n=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Narasimha garu,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&gt; When a being like Krishna is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; bor=\r\nn with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do=\r\n a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; things in the dual world that are impossible for oth=\r\ners.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I heard Kalas in the context of moon (moon phases).

Yes he may have guided many&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2=\r\n) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n about it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after\n that?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; spirtual talks?

There was a Telephone exchange=\r\n just opposite to Post&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=C3=A2?T=\r\nt; I had friendship with some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; oper=\r\nators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he =\r\nwas always talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We cam=\r\ne close day by day. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; gathering\n at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was=\r\n reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters we=\r\nre attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday=\r\n evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nen. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day=\r\n when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawal=\r\nbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is reme=\r\nmbering me.

I shall have to go now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there\n will be=\r\n a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happen=\r\ned. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He =\r\ncould foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be p=\r\nunctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come =\r\nfrom Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. Thi=\r\ns was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to beli=\r\neve that he had some super&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and this wa=\r\ns due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nhri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house be=\r\nfore Thakur picture.

I told to my wife in the morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted S=\r\nhri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev.

I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thaku=\r\nr was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before acceptin=\r\ng him.
