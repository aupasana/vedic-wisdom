An online searcheable version of the rig veda &\nkri=\r\nshna yajur veda is available from http://sanskritweb.net. If you\nsearch the=\r\n taittiriya brahmana, you will find references to puNya and\npApa.\n\nIn gener=\r\nal, saying that &quot;xyz&quot; is not found in the vedas is not\nsomething to be take=\r\nn lightly. Just a small fraction of the various\nbranches of veda are availa=\r\nble to us today. So, the best that we can\nsay is that some subject doesn&#39;t =\r\nappear (in a literal sense) in the\nfraction of vedic texts that we have not=\r\n yet lost. And we can only say\nthat after an exhaustive search.\n\n\n&gt; it is b=\r\netter to look the whole thing as law of Karma\n\n\nI agree.\n\nHowever, when we =\r\nare caught in the pains of suffering, this is very\ndifficult to internalize=\r\n. Instead of spending too much time wondering\nabout who set the building on=\r\n fire, it is better to get out of the\nburning building. Later, there will b=\r\ne plenty of time to point the\nfinger at everyone else, and then, reluctantl=\r\ny, point the finger back\nto choices that we freely undertook at a different=\r\n time.\n\nWhen the mind is calm, we can try to contemplate on the nature of\nk=\r\narma. Then, we can use our new wisdom to try and keep the mind calm\nwhen it=\r\n faces agitating situations. But, when the mind is already\nagitated, trying=\r\n to contemplate on the nature of karma may not be the\nbest way to calm the =\r\nmind.\n\nsasneham,\n\n     ajit\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Mar 1, 2012 at 9:21 AM, vedic_pathak=\r\n &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; If you say so, I would not =\r\nargue much on that. You are much more learned in Shastras.\n&gt;\n&gt; My basis was=\r\n Aghora-3 - Law of Karma (Page 100) and i remember of having read Vivekanan=\r\nda&#39;s writing in the same Line.\n&gt; Vimalananda says thus :&quot;That is why there =\r\nis only one perfect religion :the Veda. It is eternal Dharma because there =\r\nis no question of sin. show me even a single mention of distinction of sin =\r\nin the Veda....&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; ***\n&gt; However, even if there is a mention of Sin (Paap=\r\na) in Veda, I have a independant opinion on this. I am convinced that it is=\r\n better to look the whole thing as law of Karma or Action & Reaction which =\r\nis the only law without exception. but that is my opinion and every body el=\r\nse is free to ignore.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; The vedas *do* mention punya and papa.
