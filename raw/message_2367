Balasubramanian,&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One more reason for this is the fact that=\r\n the deities whom we invoke are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ethereal beings and eat with =\r\ntheir nose (smell). They don&#39;t eat with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mouth as we d=\r\no, and they have a powerful sense of smell and can detect the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n menses, which irritates them causing them to go, which obviously defeats t=\r\nhe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; purpose of inviting/invoking them! This is also the reason=\r\n why we were told&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not to smell the prasad before offering, as=\r\n this would be akin to soiling&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, it is not clear why menses (apart f=\r\nrom the toxicity of it you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; just mentioned) is treated differe=\r\nntly as opposed to someone who lets say&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; travelled long distan=\r\nce and is sweaty and smelly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narayan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;vedic-wisdom%&lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;40yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;, G&lt;di=\r\nv class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rao,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Thanks for providing this info.
