We were then on a pilgrimage to\nT=\r\nirupati and had halted in Tiruvannamalai, from where my grandmother hailed.=\r\n\nWe were not strangers to this town.\n\nSome eight years later, I came to Tir=\r\nuvannamalai to visit my sister, who was\nmarried there. One evening, two com=\r\npanions and I went to visit Kavyakanta\nGanapati Muni up on the hill where h=\r\ne had his ashram. What can I say about\nthat great seer of Mantra Sastra?\n\nI=\r\n was just then out of college after finishing my masters degree in physics.=\r\n\nI presented to Kavyakanta the latest views of Einstein, Planck and others =\r\nin\nregard to the constitution of matter and the universe. He gave a patient=\r\n\nhearing, and then said, &quot;Can you put it in a brief way?&quot; Answering in the\n=\r\naffirmative, I went on explaining that there is a continuum in which time\na=\r\nnd space are involved, wherein particles change into waves and waves change=\r\n\ninto particles and all can dissolve into a single unitary medium. That is\n=\r\nthe prospect of the future.\n\nHe listened patiently to all this and said, &quot;T=\r\nhe world picture is in that\nframe,&quot; and after a pause he exclaimed, &quot;chitra=\r\nm, chitram!&quot; These words mean\n=E2=80=98picture=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 you may c=\r\nall it a movie-picture. Those words sent a thrill\nthrough my body, through =\r\nmy whole frame. I suddenly felt disembodied. I was\nmyself the whole space i=\r\nn which the pictures were placed =E2=80=94 this body being\none of the pictu=\r\nres. This experience lasted for a brief eternity. When I\ncame round to myse=\r\nlf we took leave of Kavyakanta.\n\n\nThe next day we had a meeting with Bhagav=\r\nan. This was about the time he\narrived at the present site of Sri Ramanasra=\r\nmam (1922). There were no\nbuildings at all, except for a small shed coverin=\r\ng the samadhi of the\nMother. Bhagavan was seated on a bench under the shade=\r\n of a tree, and with\nhim, lying on the same bench, was the dog named Rose. =\r\nBhagavan was simply\nstroking the dog.\n\nI wondered, among us Brahmins the do=\r\ng was such an animal that it would\ndefile all purity. A good part of my res=\r\npect for the Maharshi left me when I\nsaw him touching that unclean animal =\r\n=E2=80=94 for all its apparent cleanliness and\nneatness it was unclean from=\r\n the Brahmin point of view.\n\nI had a question for the Maharshi. At that tim=\r\ne I was an agnostic. I thought\nnature could take care of itself, so where i=\r\ns the need for a Creator? What\nis the use of writing all these religious bo=\r\noks telling =E2=80=98cock and bull=E2=80=99\nstories, which do not change th=\r\ne situation.\n\nThen I wanted to put to him straight questions: is there a so=\r\nul? Is there a\nGod? Is there salvation? All these three questions were cond=\r\nensed into one:\nWell sir, you are sitting here like this =E2=80=94 I can se=\r\ne your present condition\n=E2=80=94 but what will be your future sthiti? The=\r\n word sthiti in Sanskrit means\n=E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98conditio=\r\nn=E2=80=99.\n\nMaharshi did not answer the question. &quot;Oho,&quot; I thought, &quot;you a=\r\nre taking\nshelter under the guise of indifferent silence for not answering =\r\nan\ninconvenient question!&quot; As soon as I thought this the Maharshi replied a=\r\nnd I\nfelt as if a bomb had exploded under my seat.\n\n&quot;Sthiti, what do you me=\r\nan by the word sthiti!&quot; he exclaimed.\n\nI was not prepared for that question=\r\n. &quot;Oho, this man is very dangerous, very\ndangerously alive. I will have to =\r\nanswer with proper care,&quot; I thought.\n\nSo I said to myself, &quot;If I ask him ab=\r\nout the sthiti or =E2=80=98state=E2=80=99 of the body\nit is useless: the bo=\r\ndy will be burned or buried. What I should ask him was\nabout the condition =\r\nof something within the body. Of course, I can recognize\na mind inside of m=\r\ne.&quot; Then I was about to answer &quot;By sthiti, I mean mind,&quot;\nwhen it struck me =\r\nwhat if he counter-questions with &quot;What is mind?&quot; This I\nam not prepared to=\r\n answer.\n\nAs all this was passing through my mind he was sitting there star=\r\ning at me\nwith a fierce look.\n\nI then questioned within me, &quot;What is mind? =\r\nMind is made up of thoughts.\nNow, what are thoughts?&quot; I landed in a void. N=\r\no answer. I then realised that\nI could not present a question about a mind =\r\nwhich did not exist!\n\nUp to that point, the mind was the greatest thing tha=\r\nt existed for me. Now I\ndiscovered it did not exist! I was bewildered. I si=\r\nmply sat like a statue.\n\nTwo pairs of eyes were then gripping each other: t=\r\nhe eyes of the Maharshi\nand my eyes were locked together in a tight embrace=\r\n. I lost all sense of\nbody. Nothing existed except the eyes of the Maharshi=\r\n.\n\nI don=E2=80=99t know how long I remained like that, but when I returned =\r\nto my\nsenses, I was terribly afraid of the man. &quot;This is a dangerous man,&quot; =\r\nI\nthought. In spite of myself, I prostrated and got away from his company.\n=\r\n\nMy next visit to the Maharshi was in 1934 on a Jayanti Day. He was sitting=\r\n\non a raised platform under a pondal (thatched roof), specially constructed=\r\n\nin front of the Mother=E2=80=99s Shrine. As the celebration was going on, =\r\nall the\ndevotees were seated around him.\n\nWhile sitting there, my eyes were=\r\n intensely fixed upon the Maharshi and I\nsaw his form assume different mani=\r\nfestations. It first changed to the Avatar\nof Vishnu (Vahar Avatar). Then h=\r\nis form changed into that of Ganesha, the\nelephant God. Next it suddenly ch=\r\nanged and I saw Ramana and Arunachala as\none. Then I had the vision of the =\r\nwhole Arunachala Hill =E2=80=94 the top of the\nHill was transparent and ins=\r\nide it I saw a Shiva Lingam, similar to what we\nsee in temples.\n\nLater that=\r\n evening in the Old Hall I sat at the feet of the Maharshi. He was\nreclinin=\r\ng on the couch gazing westward and I sat on the floor facing him.\nOur eyes =\r\nfixed, one upon the other, were pinned together for quite a long\ntime. I th=\r\nen saw the form of the Maharshi take the shape of Ardhanareswara.\n\nArdhanar=\r\neswara is one aspect of Shiva =E2=80=94 one half is the Mother and the othe=\r\nr\nhalf is the Father; one half of the form had a breast and the other had a=\r\n\ntrident. Around us the pundits were reciting Sanskrit verses.\n\nIn those da=\r\nys I was repeating the mantra =E2=80=98Ram, Ram=E2=80=99. So I said to myse=\r\nlf:\n&quot;Ram =E2=80=94 that is one thought; and Ram again =E2=80=94 that is ano=\r\nther thought. But in\nthe interval between these two thoughts there is silen=\r\nce. That Silence is\nthe Self.&quot; And so, I came to the conclusion that if I g=\r\no on repeating =E2=80=98Ram,\nRam=E2=80=99 it will resolve itself into that =\r\nSilence.\n\nI was very happy. I rushed home and found I was my normal mundane=\r\n self,\nteaching my classes in the usual way. But all the time, even while t=\r\nhe\nlectures were going on, =E2=80=98Ram, Ram, Ram=E2=80=99 went on repeatin=\r\ng in my Heart. For\nnine years it went on like that and then stopped of its =\r\nown accord. It ended\nin Silence.\n\nSource: http://bhagavan-ramana.org/nrkris=\r\nhnamurtiaiyer.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13998d4a2fd047e71ba24\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;I am now ninety-two years old and I first met the Maharshi in the summer=\r\n of 1914, when I was just a boy of sixteen.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0We were then on a p=\r\nilgrimage to Tirupati and had halted in Tiruvannamalai, from where my grand=\r\nmother hailed.
