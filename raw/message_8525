Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychologica=\r\nl constructs are created by religions to protect an average person from the=\r\n real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if and =\r\nwhen it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average life =\r\nand pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.\n\n\nI will briefly narrate =\r\na true and interesting incident. \n\n\nAn individual - say X - had gone to Vri=\r\nndavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famou=\r\ns sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing u=\r\nnblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing a=\r\nt the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the rag=\r\nged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please=\r\n tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why?=\r\n Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all =\r\nwill run away. So please continue with your lectures as you were doing befo=\r\nre I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile=\r\n the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky=\r\n and then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who =\r\nwas lecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes t=\r\no Vrindavan once in a while,\n but he has probably lost his mental balance d=\r\nue to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird=\r\n reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy=\r\n was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around =\r\nand spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and =\r\njoin me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in E=\r\nnglish and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew En=\r\nglish (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). \n\n\nThe man =\r\ncontinued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer=\r\n by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu sin=\r\nce then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsa=\r\nng? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself =\r\nis source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, no=\r\nt ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religiou=\r\ns troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have=\r\n so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu=\r\n for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is=\r\n it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there =\r\nis only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, mer=\r\nely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not=\r\n accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of\n all this proble=\r\nm is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever.=\r\n What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. =\r\nAt best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with s=\r\nuper-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create =\r\nthis form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernat=\r\nural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as a man=\r\n of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem =\r\nis trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing =\r\nthat one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a s=\r\nmall tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chil=\r\nlum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing=\r\n the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young m=\r\nan. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n confused by all these show o=\r\nf spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of =\r\nterrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young ma=\r\nn in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothi=\r\nng better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realize=\r\nd what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he r=\r\neached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl came out of t=\r\nhe house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too =\r\ncome inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay =\r\nat their house. I will show you something interesting if you join me.\n\n\nAft=\r\ner an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The wo=\r\nman was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young=\r\n girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the=\r\n hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else=\r\n but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a househo=\r\nlder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he=\r\n saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded=\r\n hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X =\r\nwas sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turne=\r\nd round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in sho=\r\nck. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat =\r\non the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin =\r\nwas dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the\n whol=\r\ne room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with en=\r\nchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god s=\r\nitting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-look=\r\ning Mr Iyengar.\n\n\nX did not know what was happening. He saw the young man g=\r\nestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotize=\r\nd, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lo=\r\nst all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a re=\r\nmote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, =\r\nheld his hand and took him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhun=\r\ni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash=\r\n all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditat=\r\ning man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was tal=\r\nking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vr=\r\nindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing di=\r\nrections of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again an=\r\nd immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into=\r\n\n unconsciousness again. \n\n\nWhen X woke up, he was in the room in that hous=\r\ne, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, wit=\r\nh a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as direct=\r\ned. \n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n=C2=A0\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAm=\r\nabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n__________=\r\n______________________\n From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\nTo: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8:13 AM\nSubject: Re=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any re=\r\nligion\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Prasanth,\n\n&gt; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99=\r\nt believe in any religion\n\n\n\n\nIn general, many of those who don&#39;t believe i=\r\nn religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, most =\r\npeople who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. Al=\r\nl of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our God=\r\ns. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.\n\nWhile bein=\r\ng mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer=\r\n can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the day.=\r\n And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all the suf=\r\nfering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; ar=\r\ne the culprit.\n\nWe all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipelin=\r\ne. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both ki=\r\nnds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It =\r\nis us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;=\r\n. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers =\r\nto be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, an=\r\nd laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nFor the most part, our=\r\n bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is =\r\nparticularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in wo=\r\nrldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we ex=\r\npect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly =\r\nbhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We =\r\n&quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nThe best way to bring about new waves of =\r\nbhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All w=\r\ne have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with our=\r\nselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.\n\nIf we see=\r\n God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is di=\r\nfficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a s=\r\ntepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on =\r\ntop of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us t=\r\no accept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with=\r\n reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any fart=\r\nher.\n\nsasneham,\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n \r\n--4813690-1527789056-1343037848=:50884\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ve=\r\nrdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Ajit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I am in complete agreement with =\r\nyour thoughts.&nbsp; A spiritual man once said, &quot;Religion has been created =\r\nto shield people from God&quot;.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I fi=\r\nrst heard this I was not convinced and thought it was some fake secularism.=\r\n Lately I realized this is literally true.

He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has =\r\nan idea what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach t=\r\nhat desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he w=\r\nas losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into unconsciousness again. &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When X woke up, he was in the room in that hous=\r\ne, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, wit=\r\nh a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as direct=\r\ned. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam ma=\r\nnyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227=\r\n946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_2_0_18_134302381638082&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT=\r\n-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D=\r\n&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:=\r\n24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size=\r\n: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;=\r\n&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;=\r\najit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: =\r\nbold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 23 July 2012\n 8:13 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who sa=\r\ny that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv id=3D&quot;yiv1835422707&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1835422707ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n     =\r\n &lt;div&gt;Dear Prasanth,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; To those who say that th=\r\ney don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are=\r\n being more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in=\r\n God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and a=\r\nssumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion ha=\r\ns simply served to formalize these biases.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While=\r\n being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere p=\r\nrayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the=\r\n day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all th=\r\ne suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believer=\r\ns&quot; are the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We all have plenty of paapa =\r\nand punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be =\r\nsteadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; an=\r\nd leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives,=\r\n ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya =\r\nphala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial obse=\r\nrver sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the c=\r\nulprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the most part, our bhakti is weak. W=\r\nhen we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particularly weak,=\r\n and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, ou=\r\nr bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God to reward=\r\n our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An imparti=\r\nal observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; ar=\r\ne the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The best way to bring about new w=\r\naves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert the=\r\nm. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest =\r\nwith ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we see God as the limitless power that he is, h=\r\ne is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religion.=\r\n Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us =\r\nto _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfo=\r\nrtunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question. They ask =\r\nus to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spirit=\r\nually advanced from going any farther.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasneham,=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--4813690-1527789056-1343037848=:50884--\r\n\n"}}
