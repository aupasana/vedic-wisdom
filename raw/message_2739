After all,\n \naham = I\nkaara = ness\nahamkaara = I-ness.\n \nThus, ahamkaara *IS* the I-ness of an individualized consciousness. You are talking of ahamkaara being the &quot;cause of&quot; I-ness. But ahamkaara IS the I-ness!\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhether you talk about physical body or subtle body or causal body, I-ness in various layers is still ahamkaara. When ahamkaara binds more to one layer, one looks at oneself primarily from the perspective of that layer. When ahamkaara does not bind to anything at all, one is in nirvikalpa samadhi, i.e. established in Brahman. Ahamkaara or I-ness is a fundamental property of an individualized consciousness and remains as long as there is some individualization.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt;     THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS,\n&gt; while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.\n \nSo you are accepting that there as &quot;I-ness of manas&quot; and &quot;I-ness of chitta&quot;. I-ness=aham-kaara. If we replace I-ness in these terms, we get &quot;ahamkaara of manas&quot; and &quot;ahamkaara of chitta&quot;. When scriptures defined the 19 proerties of individualized consciousness, they only defined one ahamkaara apart from manas, chitta etc and did not define &quot;ahamkaara of manas&quot; and &quot;ahamkaara of chitta&quot; etc.\n \nFor what I termed as ahamkaara (I-ness) working through manas and ahamkaara (I-ness) working through chitta, you are coining new terms like &quot;I-ness of manas&quot; and &quot;I-ness of chitta&quot; because you have this strange notion that ahamkaara is tied to physical body.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt;    IF THE AHAMKARA IS NOT SUPPRESSED AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH, THE PERSON WILL\n&gt; KEEP CARRYING THE SAME EARTHLY IDENTITY TO THE ASTRAL PLANES, AND BRING IT\n&gt; BACK AT REBIRTH TO THE EARTH. AND THEN, HE WILL RECLAIM HIS LOST TERRITORY\n&gt; AND WEALTH - THE CONFLICTS THAT WILL ARISE WILL BE BEYOND ANYBODY&#39;S CONTROL. \n&gt;     THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS,\n&gt; while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.\n \nOf course, ahamkaara (I-ness) associating mainly with a physical body is bad. We have no disagreement there.\n \nThe astral sphere may be beautiful to some. But, to a true jnaani, it is a source of problems too, though the problems are lighter than the problems of the physical domain.\n \nCelestials without physical bodies and having only ethereal bodies have desires too and they are bonded too.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI still think this is a case of a Pascal language programmer unfamiliar with C language misunderstanding some software written in C language and passing comments. But unfortunately that programmer seems to be hasty in using labels like &quot;flawed&quot;, &quot;incorrect&quot;, &quot;incoherent&quot; etc about other programmers whose language he is unable to understand.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yeeahoo_99&quot; &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; Namaskar Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt;    Thanks for your contribution - all you have done is to prove what is already known.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in beyond the death for a normal \n&gt; &gt; human being.

My comments on that is:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details. Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One does not &quot;read up&quot; these things in a single place. There are different abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized consciousness. There are several sources that speak of different aspects of this knowledge in slightly different terms. One will assimilate this knowledge better if one reads as many sources as possible and contemplates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ ...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please Ignore my previous-mail, it was not completed - i will try to delete it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t go in details. Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into various groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing that path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very difficult to follow in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vichaara (contemplation) is the process of sadhana for an adherer of pure gyaana yoga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the gyaana (knowledge of Self) achieved by such a person at the end is not really different from the knowledge of Self achieved by a person following another path.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
