I was also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finalizing my new book which deals specifically =\r\nwith Tamil Nadu religious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; politics, and in particular with the role o=\r\nf various nexuses based overseas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I decided to jump into the eye o=\r\nf the storm of this scandal in order to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; investigate whether similar n=\r\nexuses were at work in this case. Naturally, at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one level I have seen=\r\n this scandal through the framework of a civilization\n&gt; &gt; &gt; encounter in wh=\r\nich Vedic culture is pitted against the Dravidian\n&gt; &gt; &gt; divisiveness that i=\r\ns being backed by Christian evangelism. At another level,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I found tha=\r\nt the sensationalized media reports were too one-sided, and none\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of t=\r\nhem had a single statement to report from the swami himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Furtherm=\r\nore, there was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from Swami\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nithy=\r\nananda&#39;s inner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dif=\r\nferently had they managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nlaborate later in this article. Given this, another interest of mine has\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; been to extrapolate important lessons from this episode for other Hindu=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organizations, which I predict will face similar scandals as and whe=\r\nn their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses become understood by those opposed to them. This a=\r\nrticle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; highlights my findings at these multiple levels and issues.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; During this 2-week investigative period, I have been loyal to my=\r\n pledge to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give Swami Nithyananda&#39;s organization the benefit of doubt=\r\n and to report\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their side of the story. Besides wanting to balance ou=\r\nt the one-sided media\n&gt; &gt; &gt; depictions, I wanted access to the ashram&#39;s cor=\r\ne group for my own research\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the broader subject of civilization en=\r\ncounters. I respect the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitivities of that organization consisting=\r\n of many decent and dedicated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devotees who have sacrificed a great de=\r\nal and stand to lose a lot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I have concluded that the situ=\r\nation is now beyond repair for Swami\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nithyananda and that his continu=\r\ned involvement can only damage the broader\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interests of dharma as wel=\r\nl as jeopardize the ashramites. Along with two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other sympathizers who=\r\n are not ashramites, I have personally recommended to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Nithyanan=\r\nda that the best course at this stage would be for him to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resign comp=\r\nletely from his organization. He should turn it over to a small\n&gt; &gt; &gt; team =\r\nof senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets can be used in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ninterests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of these mahatmas he must\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institutional responsibili=\r\nties.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Because the head of any organization must accept responsibility=\r\n that &quot;the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; buck stops here,&quot; only such a move can salvage the organiz=\r\nation and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this=\r\n resignation would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has bui=\r\nlt up against him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a =\r\nsadhu. It is up to him to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accept or reject this advice. The basis for=\r\n this conclusion becomes clearer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; once the reader has gone through the=\r\n rest of this article.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I want to begin by examining some principles a=\r\nbout the relationships between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), =\r\nmorality, Tantra and sex. This will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; provide the framework in which to=\r\n interpret what has happened. Then I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; turn to my initial interest=\r\n in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; south India from a var=\r\niety of forces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) an=\r\nd Morality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A few days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour priva=\r\nte conversation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh.=\r\n I introduced myself as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an independent researcher who is writing a se=\r\nries of books on Indian\n&gt; &gt; &gt; civilization in the context of the global cha=\r\nllenges and opportunities. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my volumes will be specifically on =\r\nthe major global gurus since the 1960s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =96 including Krishnamurti, Sw=\r\nami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pabhupada, among others - as w=\r\nell as living global gurus such as Sri Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself. I have been inves=\r\ntigating what happened to such gurus, in terms of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the shifts in their=\r\n Western followers over time, their scandals, their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Indian followers =\r\nand critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; position sandw=\r\niched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western\n&gt; &gt; &gt; modernity on t=\r\nhe other. The relevance of this in the context of Swami\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nithyananda w=\r\nill become clear very soon.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The first provocative question I a=\r\nsked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powers: What is the relati=\r\nonship between siddhis and morality? If siddhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are a scientific phen=\r\nomena dealing with powers that can be harnessed by all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; humans then on=\r\ne must bear in mind that science deals with truths that are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morally n=\r\neutral. If Einstein was declared to have lived an immoral life it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wou=\r\nld not invalidate his scientific theories. A person who designs aircrafts\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; or any other complex technological systems may or may not be moral in =\r\norder\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be effective in his technical work. In other words, rtam (th=\r\ne patterns of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the cosmos), which we discover and call science, functi=\r\nons independently of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; human morality. This is why a scientific princip=\r\nle can be used either\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morally or immorally, because it is independent=\r\n of morality. There are moral\n&gt; &gt; &gt; persons who lack any siddhis or even or=\r\ndinary scientific competence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Conversely, there are great siddhas (li=\r\nke Ravana) who lack morality. Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri&#39;s pranayama techniques would al=\r\nso produce results for an immoral person.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri seeme=\r\nd impressed by this question, and agreed with my overall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; position on =\r\nthe independence between siddhis and morality. But he pointed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out tha=\r\nt the moral dimension, while not determining the siddhis, was also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; im=\r\nportant because it led to receiving the grace of the divine. I agree with\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So there are two separate phenomena involved: (i) sp=\r\niritual technologies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are objective and that allow anyone to harn=\r\ness spiritual energies, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (ii) morality which is important in itsel=\r\nf, not for attaining siddhis, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in order to have a positive relatio=\r\nnship with the divine. Either one can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; developed without the other;=\r\n however, the dharma tradition encourages us to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cultivate both. The r=\r\neason that meditation systems prescribe things like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian diet, =\r\nahimsa, etc. is because an inappropriate lifestyle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interferes with th=\r\ne mental tranquility required to advance. This lifestyle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; change can b=\r\ne appreciated regardless of whether one believes in a personal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; God or=\r\n not. This absence of a personal God is clear in Buddhist meditation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Different Hindu systems place different levels of emphasis upon a personal=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; God for the yoga to function. This is why many secular and scientifi=\r\ncally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minded persons are also drawn towards meditation techniques. In=\r\n other words,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something cannot be a science if it depends upon morali=\r\nty, because science\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is objective and stands independent of morality.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The relevance of this question is as follows: Many persons who=\r\n have learned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to know=\r\n if any moral\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breaches by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim =\r\nof achieving higher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; states of consciousness. When a far worse sex sca=\r\nndal against the legendary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Muktananda emerged in the 1990s, inv=\r\nolving charges by a large number\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his Western female disciples, the=\r\n Western academy rashly condemned not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only one man&#39;s morality, but al=\r\nso the whole legitimacy of the Indian\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tradition itself. In that serie=\r\ns of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Caldwell, etc.), I took t=\r\nhe same position then as I am taking now: that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Muktananda&#39;s capabilit=\r\nies in harnessing spiritual energies are separate and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; independent fro=\r\nm whether or not he violated any code of morality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patanjali w=\r\narns against getting lured by siddhis which appear along the way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when=\r\n one practices advanced meditation persistently. One is not supposed to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; indulge in them. This warning is found in various Hindu systems that dea=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution, because these e=\r\nnergies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are very powerful and can get out of control. Another point t=\r\nhat is worth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noting is that the techniques taught by Swami Nithyanand=\r\na are not his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; original ones; he has made it clear repeatedly that the=\r\ny are from the Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sutras which have a long history in our civiliza=\r\ntion. I feel that he does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have the siddhi of being able to transmit t=\r\nhese techniques very effectively\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to others. For instance, I have neve=\r\nr before in my life been able to sit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still and alert in meditation fo=\r\nr the whole night, but he had a few hundred\n&gt; &gt; &gt; persons in a large hall a=\r\nchieving this. The point here is similar to saying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that the mathemati=\r\ncs and golf I have learned from someone is not invalidated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when the t=\r\neacher is found to be immoral.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, the issue of his moralit=\r\ny must be pursued separately and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; independently from whether his siddh=\r\nis are genuine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is Tantra a Part of Hinduism?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\n second question that I asked Sri Sri could not be completely dealt with\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; in the time available for our meeting. I hope to pursue this some day w=\r\nith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and with various other acharyas for my own benefit. Its signi=\r\nficance in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the present scandal becomes clear soon. I asked whether th=\r\ne Shiva Sutras are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; valid, pointing out that among the 112 spiritual e=\r\nnlightenment techniques\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taught in them, about 6 deal with sexual cont=\r\nact between a male yogi and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; female yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well=\r\n as the Tantra traditions have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; included exemplars that practiced thes=\r\ne techniques. Recently, Osho tried to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; revive them and nowadays Deepak=\r\n Chopra has brought some elements of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into his repertoire. Sunth=\r\nar Visuvalingam, a US based scholar of Tantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kashmir Shaivism, i=\r\ns one of the voices who brings out the authenticity of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these approach=\r\nes in the tradition, despite the common rejections by society\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at larg=\r\ne. The tradition considers itself not suitable for mainstream society\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and is meant only for a small subset of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many popular =\r\nHindu rituals and symbols have emerged out of the Tantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; traditions =\r\n=96 such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic traditions were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\not separate until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integration is found in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Adi Shankara all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrator of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Vaishnavism who took Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and even more recently in=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; practitioners, but they do it privately and not publicly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n have an unpublished monograph that shows the history of this shift in\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Indian consciousness concerning Tantra. It was under British rule that\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; certain Indian leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started to condemn (as p=\r\nart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of their &quot;reform&quot; of Hinduism) those aspects of Hinduism that bot=\r\nhered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; puritan Christian values. It must be noted that Christianity ha=\r\ns had a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; negative posture towards the human body starting with th=\r\ne Biblical episode\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called =\r\n&quot;witches&quot;) got demonized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by the Church in its very official genocide =\r\nof several million practitioners\n&gt; &gt; &gt; across Europe. This Church prosecuti=\r\non was called the Inquisition and was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; widespread for a few centuries.=\r\n The use of shakti and anything concerning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the body as a spiritual re=\r\nsource was considered not only immoral but also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; demonic, and was outl=\r\nawed with draconian enforcement. The term &quot;occult&quot; was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used to refer =\r\nto a vast assortment of such practices and was heavily\n&gt; &gt; &gt; condemned by t=\r\nhe Church as the work of the Devil.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This mentality entered India unde=\r\nr the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; India was passed by the Bri=\r\ntish in the late 1800s. It listed several dozen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tribes that practiced=\r\n such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were officially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; persecuted into ext=\r\ninction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism evolved as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mark of be=\r\ning &quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus be proud of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our ident=\r\nity, now that it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; practices of our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ances=\r\ntors.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this history of removing Tantra out of Hinduism, some=\r\n people include\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda among those who undermined Tantra. =\r\nI disagree with this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charge. He was saying a separate set of things t=\r\no his Western audiences than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Indians. In his Western lecture tours=\r\n, he presented a Hinduism that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Westerners could relate to and appreci=\r\nate, but he did not ask Indians to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shift their practice. It is unfort=\r\nunate that after his death, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Mission he started has di=\r\nluted itself into a sort of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pseudo-Christianity. Kali and other relat=\r\ned Tantra deities, symbols and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rituals that were dear to Ramakrishna =\r\nhimself, have become &quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;private&quot; use by the monks, but=\r\n are marginalized publicly and considered as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an embarrassment. Their =\r\nlead in this direction has spread across modern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hinduism to such an e=\r\nxtent that Vedic Hinduism has become separated from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra, and Tantr=\r\na is now widely condemned by many Hindu gurus. This is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a factor =\r\nthat worked against Swami Nithyananda&#39;s reputation among orthodox\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hin=\r\ndu leaders, for he uses Tantric techniques that arouse body energies,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n such as kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My own feeling is that Tantra is making a =\r\nbig comeback. First there was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Western popularity of distorted version=\r\ns of Tantra; but this is now being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; followed by more clinical experime=\r\nntation by psychologists and others. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whole issue of latent human =\r\nenergies and potentials (both positive and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dangerous) is a hot topic =\r\nof serious scientific investigation. Hindus should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reclaim this aspec=\r\nt of their own tradition rather than waiting for U-Turned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (appropriat=\r\ned) versions to get re-exported back to India, packaged as &quot;Made\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in U=\r\nSA&quot; spiritual science. This requires an attitude of experimentation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; u=\r\nnder the appropriate controls to prevent abuses and quackery.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI just returned from Kumbh Mela where I walked amidst several tens of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n thousands of naga sadhus who were completely naked. I did not consider the=\r\nm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as either vulgar or primitive. The old guard of Hindu orthodoxy rej=\r\nects\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra at least in public, and yet lives in contradictions becau=\r\nse they do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; respect the naga sadhus and also the various symbols and r=\r\nituals that have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their foundations in Tantra. The vacuum left by avoi=\r\nding the subject of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra has created opportunities for the likes of=\r\n Wendy Doniger to formulate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distorted interpretations. I feel that Hi=\r\nndu spiritual practitioners as well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as intellectuals must take back c=\r\nontrol over Tantra as an intrinsic part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our tradition.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sex and Morality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Against this backdrop, I will address the i=\r\nssue of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morality. Just to recap:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My first p=\r\noint above has been that the morality issue about Swami\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nithyananda d=\r\noes not impact the effectiveness of the meditation techniques\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he has =\r\ntaught very successfully. Their efficacy is best evaluated by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ten=\r\ns of thousands of practitioners for themselves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My second point was t=\r\nhat there is nothing inherent about sex that is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rejected by Hinduism =\r\nacross the board, although certain strains of Hinduism\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do reject sex =\r\nseeing it as harmful to spirituality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here it must be noted that brah=\r\nmacharya (involving sexual abstinence) is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just one of the spiritual p=\r\naths of Hinduism. The first half of my recent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stay in Haridwar was as=\r\n a guest of the Gayatri Pariwar, one of the greatest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and largest Hind=\r\nu movements, that does not advocate being brahmachari. Its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; founder, i=\r\nts present head and its members at large, are householders and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; br=\r\nahmacharis. But for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral authenticity under\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; this system, he would have to pronounce himself as a householder and not=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sannyasin. He has never done that, so we must examine his morality=\r\n by some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other criteria.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another approach for him could =\r\nhave been to announce himself as an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experimenter of Tantra for modern=\r\n times, thereby making himself transparent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of any such charges. This =\r\nwould place him in the same category as Osho. Many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; times in his publi=\r\nc discourses and teachings, he has praised Osho as his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; greatest teach=\r\ner and enlightened exemplar. He even said that many of his own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teachi=\r\nngs were derived from Osho. But he failed to publicly clarify whether\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n he was practicing those techniques that involve sex. Privately, he explain=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to me in recent days that Shiva Sutras have two categories of tech=\r\nniques.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most of the sutras do not involve physical contact with anoth=\r\ner person and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only use the four senses of sight, sound, taste and sme=\r\nll as pathways to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual experiences. Hence an individual practice=\r\ns these techniques\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entirely on his/her own. This path is what he has =\r\ntaught thus far to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public. The best pursuit of this path is as a =\r\nbrahamachari according to him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and he has initiated many followers in=\r\nto it. But for a small number of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; persons, he feels that the 6 sutras =\r\ninvolving sexual Tantra need to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tested and perfected for modern ti=\r\nmes, before they can be safely taught more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; widely. This he considers =\r\nto be like any R & D done in a lab for developing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a product.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My=\r\n sense is that he did practice Tantra with a very small number of persons,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and I believe that he even entered into written legal contracts with =\r\nthem to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make sure that both parties were clear about the arrangement.=\r\n The reason for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this &quot;Non-Disclosure Agreement&quot; was to make sure that=\r\n someone who willingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approaches him for Tantra does not later accus=\r\ne him of inappropriate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical contact. On March 9 (about a week ago=\r\n), I did a specific video\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interview with him dealing with this issue =\r\nvery specifically. But this video\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was blocked by his ashram leaders e=\r\nven though he personally felt that it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a good idea to show it. I g=\r\nave up arguing in favor of showing it, because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his ashram management =\r\ntook a firm stand against it. I still feel that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was a blunder th=\r\ney made. Swami Nithyananda is very forthright and clear in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that inter=\r\nview =96 I felt that it was the best interview of all the ones I did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwith him, but it was never made public.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I surmise that Ranjitha, the =\r\nTamil actress in the scandalous videotape, was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practicing Tantra with=\r\n him. He taught her the self-control she had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; achieve before any in=\r\ntimacy. I have tried to interview her in order to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her side of the=\r\n story, but so far I have not succeeded in getting through to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her. Ba=\r\nsed on third party reports from some persons who are in touch with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he=\r\nr, and the media reports of her statements, her stance seems to be along\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the following lines: She took the sexual initiative with him on the occ=\r\nasion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shown in the videotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. =\r\nBut this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; activity did not proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. =\r\nShe has also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said that the videos being shown on TV are manipulated v=\r\nersions of what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually happened, because they exaggerate the situat=\r\nion. They do not show\n&gt; &gt; &gt; portions where he asked her to stop. Different =\r\nclips from various videos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seem to have been turned into a single vide=\r\no by editing. She has not filed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any complaint against him. So in the =\r\nworst case, this was consensual sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; between adults, and that too back=\r\ned by a formal written contract between the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; parties. Because she has =\r\nrefused to give any statement against Swami\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nithyananda, she feels th=\r\nreatened by those who set her up and who did this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sting operation. I =\r\nhear that she has gone overseas to protect her safety\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from this mafia=\r\n-like conspiracy. I have not been able to corroborate this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thesis dir=\r\nectly from her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My concern about his morality is, therefore, n=\r\not based on sex between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consenting adults. Rather, my moral issue is =\r\nabout the lack of transparency\n&gt; &gt; &gt; before the public. He could have openl=\r\ny said that he wants to select a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yoginis to experiment Tantra und=\r\ner mutual consent. At worst this would have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; upset many followers and =\r\npushed them away. In response to my concern over\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his lack of transpar=\r\nency, he could offer the argument that this was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; private activity be=\r\ntween adults who are under no obligation to disclose it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the public=\r\n. After all, people do not go about broadcasting their sexual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lives. =\r\nSo long as this was under mutual consent, he might say, it cannot be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nan offense. And if it was done under the Tantra portions of the Shiva Sutra=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was also an act within the Hindu tradition despite the controver=\r\nsy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrounding Tantra today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Having given this best case=\r\n argument on his behalf, I must say that there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; could also be the alte=\r\nrnative scenario, namely, that this was mere lust\n&gt; &gt; &gt; packaged as Tantric=\r\n spirituality. David White, one of Wendy&#39;s Children, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; written exte=\r\nnsively making the claim that all Tantra is &quot;hard core porn&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that get=\r\ns wrapped up before the public in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo to appear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nto be legitimate spirituality, which he calls &quot;soft porn&quot; coating. White&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; latest book takes this allegation to the extreme, and states that all=\r\n major\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yogic exemplars in Indian history were basically not engaged i=\r\nn any kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were deve=\r\nloping personal power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the purpose of exploiting others. I am unqu=\r\nalified to comment on whether\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this noti=\r\non of &quot;soft porn,&quot; or whether it was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have=\r\n adequate factual data of what happened to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pass judgment either way.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This concludes what I have to say about his morality issue as shown i=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sex tapes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My Impressions of Swami Nithyananda Pri=\r\nor to this Scandal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was introduced to Swami Nithyananda a couple of =\r\nyears ago, by a prominent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hindu leader based in California. This man =\r\nwas so impressed by the young\n&gt; &gt; &gt; swami that he frequently called me to s=\r\npeak about him in glowing terms. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told him that I had a guru already=\r\n, and that my present interest in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; interacting with gurus was mainly a=\r\ns a part of my research for my book on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; global gurus. He arranged a pr=\r\nivate meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which I used mostly to e=\r\nxplain the civilization threats facing Hinduism,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; citing numerous exam=\r\nples, and questioned him on his position in this regard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I found him =\r\nto be very sharp, a great listener, and in agreement that we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; must eng=\r\nage social issues rather than pursuing the &quot;world negating&quot; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;escap=\r\nist&quot; paths that are typical of many gurus today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later on, I attended=\r\n a weekend course in USA where he taught the Patanjali\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga Sutras. I=\r\n have read several translations of this great classical work,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I h=\r\nad never before seen it taught experientially. Swami Nithyananda gave\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the attendees their own personal inner experience of every one of the eigh=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; limbs of Patanjali&#39;s system, right up to and including samadhi. Thi=\r\ns was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; quite an achievement in two days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Overall, my inte=\r\nractions with him remained centered largely on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; geopolitics of rel=\r\nigions. I saw him as a prominent swami who was not running\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away from =\r\ntroubling issues, such as Christian conversions and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dravidianizat=\r\nion of Tamil identity. Given that I have been writing a book\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for thre=\r\ne years (now in the editing stage) on this very issue as it exists\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\n Tamil Nadu, I was especially impressed by his experimental program of a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Hindu temple on wheels traveling from village to village. In each villa=\r\nge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this mobile temple stops and offers chanting, a talk by one of the=\r\n leaders,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; food, medicines, etc. So it combines religion with social s=\r\nervice and thus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; competes directly against Christian evangelism. Rathe=\r\nr than building a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temple in every village and needing a purohit in ea=\r\nch of the thousands of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; villages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was t=\r\no bring to each village this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by=\r\n my own independent fact-finding was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that wherever this temple on whe=\r\nels went, the missionaries were upset\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because it blunted their conver=\r\nsion efforts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I attended his 21-day meditation program in December 20=\r\n09. The various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques in it are very deep and transformative. Th=\r\ne best evaluation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this can be done by the hundreds of attendees, w=\r\nho were divided roughly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; equally between Indians and whites from North=\r\n America.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In several side conversations with him as well in th=\r\ne public forum, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pursued the point that I already have a guru since =\r\n1994, so I was not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looking for a new guru. Since my guru had left the=\r\n body a few years ago, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to continue learning new techniques f=\r\nor my practice. I explained to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him that I had previously learned and =\r\npracticed meditation techniques from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; multiple sources for over 30 yea=\r\nrs, including: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Ravi Shankar, Yogi Amri=\r\nt Desai (who certified me as a teacher), Deepak\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chopra, Vipassana, an=\r\nd more. Additionally, I had practiced numerous bhakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; traditions, as =\r\nwell as formal Vedanta education from Swami Chinmayananda and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna Mission. I went through a serious study of the writings by Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nurobindo, various Madhyamika Buddhist systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Ramana\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Maharshi, etc. So I was not seeking a new guru like most others who took=\r\n his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; courses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to say that he never pressured me t=\r\no adopt him as my new guru, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even said that one must remain loyal =\r\nto one&#39;s guru. To be classified as a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devotee/disciple of his, there a=\r\nre two criteria, neither of which applies to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me. First, there is an o=\r\nptional program one can sign up for, to do &quot;paada\n&gt; &gt; &gt; puja&quot; at the guru&#39;s=\r\n feet, in order to develop a special link with him. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; second is tha=\r\nt one can ask to be given an initiation with a new name, in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which cas=\r\ne his policy is that the person must legally change his/her name,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n use this new name publicly. I did not do either of these steps. So my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; relationship is not as a devotee or disciple, but more arms-length.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a two-way street. While he taught me meditation, I brought t=\r\no him my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scholarship on the geopolitical positioning of Hinduism whic=\r\nh I feel the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gurus know only superficially. They do not adequately kn=\r\now things like:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Western philosophy, neither of the religious nor the =\r\nsecular variety; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Western history; or Western institutions that hav=\r\ne been set up explicitly to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spread its civilization; or various globa=\r\nl campaigns under way to invade\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Indian civilization through conversio=\r\nns, education, media, political\n&gt; &gt; &gt; policymaking and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\ne requested that I should present him my findings on such matters so that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; he and his senior acharyas could learn. I told him that most gurus hav=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little time to listen attentively to a layperson like me, because t=\r\nhe gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like to do all the talking. He replied that he would sit and=\r\n listen to me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously. I made it clear that I was disinterested in =\r\ngiving a short talk\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a few minutes, because my findings required co=\r\nnsiderable time to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; examined seriously. I told him that I would nee=\r\nd two full days of undivided\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attention, so that I could present 300 P=\r\nowerpoint slides.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda sent me an invitation when=\r\n I was in Delhi to visit his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashram and present my research. I was de=\r\nlighted to have such an important\n&gt; &gt; &gt; audience. I was very impressed by t=\r\nhe fact that he sat through two long days\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my talks, about 12 hours=\r\n per day. He asked his 40 top acharyas and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; various thought leaders in=\r\n his ashram to sit and listen to me for both the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days. The interactio=\r\nns were intense, and I explained many points from my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forthcoming book=\r\ns. I felt that he and I had a peer relationship, each side\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being an e=\r\nxpert in his domain to teach the other. After my two days of talks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we=\r\nre over, he asked me to help him incorporate my core ideas into his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nurriculum, so as to make sure that his teachings helped position the Vedic\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; civilization properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; No other guru in the world has in=\r\nvested so much time with me to try and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learn these global issues so d=\r\neeply. (The only other prominent guru I know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personally who understan=\r\nds these issues about the external challenges is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Dayananda Sara=\r\nswati.) Most gurus tend to either be dismissive by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; resorting to spiri=\r\ntual loftiness, or imagine that they already know whatever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is w=\r\north knowing. Thus, my primary interest in Swami Nithyananda was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a=\r\n vehicle to spread greater awareness of the kinds of issues that I was\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; researching. (For instance, he bought a couple of hundred copies of the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; book, &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot; at the full price, and made it required re=\r\nading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for all his ashram residents.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I must balance this=\r\n praise with criticism. In my 2-day talks, I had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explicitly discussed=\r\n that many gurus were falling prey to sex scandals,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; often with women =\r\nplanted as part of sting operations, or women in the inner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; circle who=\r\n got too close and let things get out of control. Despite these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warni=\r\nngs, it seems that nothing concrete was done to prevent or at least\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnticipate the crisis that was to follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My Approach to this I=\r\nnvestigation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the scandal broke out I was in Delhi. I call=\r\ned the Bangalore ashram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; management and found them confident but confu=\r\nsed. Probably they felt that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the matter would soon get forgotten if l=\r\neft alone. But exactly the opposite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happened, as each day brought fre=\r\nsh allegations and sensational media\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coverage. After several days had=\r\n passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; study the situation for m=\r\nyself. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice with any =\r\nwomen. Whatever I knew was based on what his followers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me, becau=\r\nse he was personally inaccessible for several days even after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I reach=\r\ned Bangalore. I spent many hours daily with some of his ashram&#39;s top\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nteam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I wrote earlier in this article actually comes late=\r\nr in the chronology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my investigation. But I presented it up front =\r\nbecause most readers are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obsessed with getting my answer to only one =\r\nsingle question: did he or did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he not have sex? Nothing else seems to=\r\n matter to them, whereas my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; investigation&#39;s emphasis has been about i=\r\nssues broader and more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consequential than any one man&#39;s morality.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Until I concluded my fact-finding 2-week period recently, I was u=\r\nnable to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discuss the sexual acts shown in the videotapes. I had to re=\r\nspect the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; policies of his people as part of the trust being placed in=\r\n me to gain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; access. They also needed legal clearance on what can and =\r\ncannot be said by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them. Their policy on the sex tapes was that Swami =\r\nNithyananda would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directly explain his acts. The Tamil actress&#39; lawye=\r\nr was also in contact\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with them and her sensitivities had to be respe=\r\ncted. The sensitivities of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 140-strong ashramites had to be protec=\r\nted also. Given this set of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; circumstances facing me, I feel that it w=\r\nas unfair to demand that I should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hound him with the one critical que=\r\nstion. People have assumed that it was up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to me to decide what would =\r\nbe within the scope of each interview. As I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned earlier, e=\r\nven after certain interviews were recorded by me, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashram leadersh=\r\nip used its discretion not to air them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In response to my crit=\r\nics on how I conducted my interviews, I would also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like to explain wh=\r\ny I chose to focus on the criminal charges being made\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against Swami N=\r\nithyananda. Besides the sex-tape being off limits as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in the=\r\n foregoing paragraph, the criminal charges became my focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for two re=\r\nasons. These charges could be ascertained with objectivity =96 such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\ns asking for documents on the land ownership, the medical reports on the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; death of one meditation participant 2 years ago, and so forth. The evid=\r\nence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was more clear-cut than the evidence on what exactly happened in=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; videotapes between two persons none of whom were willing to talk=\r\n with me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about it. Secondly, the consequences of criminality would be=\r\n far more severe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than mere moral fallibility. While immoral conduct i=\r\ns a big concern for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devotees, it is not enough grounds by itself =\r\nfor the state to confiscate the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entire property that runs into very l=\r\narge sums of money. Also, as a matter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of principle, regardless of whe=\r\nther or not he is guilty of the morality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charge, I felt opposed to sp=\r\nurious criminal charges being piled up by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; irresponsible media jus=\r\nt to create sensationalism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Conspiracy against Swami Nithy=\r\nananda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I had arrived at the scene while writing my book =\r\non the conspiracy in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu religious politics, it was natural to=\r\n start with that as my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis for the investigation. But in this sh=\r\nort article I have decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; focus on the matters surrounding his co=\r\nnduct and his organization&#39;s conduct,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because these have assumed a mo=\r\nre urgent nature. The details of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conspiracy belong in my book as =\r\ncorroborating evidence for my thesis there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The types of parties repo=\r\nrted to be behind the conspiracy, both foreign and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; India based, were =\r\nremarkably similar to the ones I have written about in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; book. So f=\r\nor now I shall merely summarize some of the main points concerning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nis conspiracy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; First one must understand why Swami Nithyananda=\r\n became such a target. He was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; virtually unknown 7 years ago, but once=\r\n he appeared in public his popularity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; catapulted at a dramatic rate. =\r\nFor example, last year, YouTube wrote to him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that he was the most wat=\r\nched of all Indian spiritual leaders on the Internet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and proposed a c=\r\nloser collaboration for their viewers. This letter also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stated that a=\r\nmong all spiritual leaders worldwide (not just Indian) he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sec=\r\nond most popular one, the Vatican being first. His meditation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; program=\r\ns have become very popular in USA and in certain Indian states. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nain factors are that participants almost invariably report experiencing\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; higher states of consciousness, and he has healed a large number of pers=\r\nons\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a variety of diseases. His healing powers are what brought tog=\r\nether his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; core inner group of devotees from around the world =96 doct=\r\nors, businessmen,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IT professionals, corporate executives. Many of the=\r\nm have explained their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personal healings from terminal illnesses as t=\r\nhe turning point in their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lives. His meditation programs sometimes br=\r\ning up to a few thousand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attendees for periods ranging from a few day=\r\ns to several weeks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While the funds come mostly from upper str=\r\nata participants in India and USA,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a large portion of the expenses ha=\r\nve been allocated to develop grass-roots\n&gt; &gt; &gt; social and spiritual program=\r\ns focusing primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native\n&gt; &gt; &gt; state. This is where h=\r\ne is seen as a threat by Dravidian as well as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Christian forces. For i=\r\nnstance, in December 2009, about 600 villages across\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu sent =\r\ntheir local &quot;Nithyananda leaders&quot; for a celebration and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; planning sess=\r\nion in his main ashram near Bangalore. I happened to be present\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for t=\r\nhe event. These common folks, mostly from the lower strata of Tamil\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nociety, had walked 300 kilometers for this journey, which they saw as a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; spiritual pilgrimage. The reason for the anger of Christian and Dravidia=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forces is that his activities have put a dampener to conversions in=\r\n many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; districts, and several Christians have returned to Hinduism by =\r\ngetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiated formally into his organization. The swami himself h=\r\nas spoken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against conversions, and has also stated that the Dravidian=\r\n movement had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; made Tamil people unspiritual in their lives, and that =\r\nthis had caused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; social decay. His Tamil language publications and cou=\r\nrses have become his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; most popular ones, far exceeding the numbers in =\r\nEnglish. Also he is a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; big threat because he is not a Brahmin. Be=\r\ncause he cannot be targeted using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the classic attack strategies used =\r\non Brahmins, and because the masses in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu were rising to swel=\r\nl his ranks, the threat he posed to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; existing political power stru=\r\ncture had to be stopped one way or another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The attack against=\r\n Swami Nithyananda has consisted of two prongs, destroying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his image =\r\nand alleging legal misdeeds. At first a highly sensational sexual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cha=\r\nrge was broadcast in order to devastate his credibility and create an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n atmosphere in which any and all kinds of outlandish allegations would be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; taken at face value. Once the media and popular sentiments had been tu=\r\nrned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; against him, there was one amazing allegation after another in r=\r\napid\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sequence. It was clear that none of this was spontaneous but was=\r\n being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; centrally orchestrated under a systematic plan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhat became evident to me was that there was &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; unofficial ways among the media, police and lower level judiciary. In =\r\nfact,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many third parties were aware of the attack in advance and had =\r\nwarned his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people before it happened with specific details of the pla=\r\nn. For instance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one of his top devotees got a phone call from someon=\r\ne based in New York\n&gt; &gt; &gt; describing the media and police attack that was t=\r\no come. His predictions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; turned out to be accurate but at that time th=\r\ne ashramites did not take the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; threat literally. He said that for the =\r\nright sum of money he could be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; helpful in preventing such an attack. =\r\nHe claimed that the planning for this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attack had started a year ago. =\r\nHe mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was allocated by some ove=\r\nrseas groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; south India, and n=\r\named two south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coordinate th=\r\nis strategic plan. (I am presently pursuing these leads as part\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my=\r\n book investigation.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There was another concrete extortion effort abo=\r\nut eleven or twelve days\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prior to the scandal breaking out. A lawyer =\r\ncontacted them and claimed that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his client had compromising videos, a=\r\nnd that the client was seeking money or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; else they would get released.=\r\n The same intermediary later sent a letter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; containing a variety of un=\r\nsubstantiated criminal allegations against Swami\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nithyananda, and thi=\r\ns letter&#39;s distribution list included India&#39;s Prime\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Minister, Preside=\r\nnt, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various Chief Ministers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and police=\r\n heads, various national criminal investigation and security\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organiza=\r\ntions. I have a copy of this letter, and it makes the Nithyananda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; org=\r\nanization seem like a terrorist outfit that needs to be attacked for the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; sake of public safety. This letter along with a DVD of the sex video wa=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delivered to the Chief Minister of Karnataka state two hours before=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; videotape was first aired. Clearly, the attack was well planned =\r\nand executed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; across many locations, and was persistently carried out =\r\nover several days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not the work of some isolated individuals.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There were warnings given to individuals in the ashram that t=\r\nheir phones\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were being tapped and that they better leave to save thei=\r\nr own lives,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because something horrible was about to happen. One frie=\r\nndly man based in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami =\r\nNithyananda, told the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashram a week in advance of the attack that som=\r\ne such catastrophe would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen. He named his source as a man in the =\r\nBangalore Press Club. Another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; publisher in Hyderabad who distributes =\r\nSwami Nithyananda&#39;s books in Telugu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; called three times to warn that =\r\na graphic video would be released and gave a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; precise time for this to=\r\n happen. It was also reported that an American\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devotee who had fallen=\r\n out of the ashram was working in association with one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jody Razdik wh=\r\no specializes in guru bashing at a prominent web site. He was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; being h=\r\nelped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was once very deeply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; invol=\r\nved inside the Nithyananda organization but had turned malicious. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n only man who has openly come out as the main accuser was an ashramite who\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; had a falling out when he got demoted due to his conduct. It was rece=\r\nntly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reported that he had a prior criminal record against him but nob=\r\nody in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashram had checked out his background before admitting him=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There were constant threats received to harass the ashramite=\r\ns and scare them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away, with claims that &quot;narcotics will be planted to=\r\n cause arrest warrants.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The actions by the police were being leaked =\r\nto the media ahead of time and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even to the opposing side, leading to =\r\nnumerous &quot;tips&quot; received by &quot;friends&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asking the ashram dwellers to r=\r\nun away before &quot;the attack comes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But even after a couple of =\r\nweeks since the scandal has erupted, the lawyers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for Swami Nithyanand=\r\na&#39;s ashram have failed to get copies of any concrete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; charges filed wi=\r\nth the police, except a few trivial ones. Each time they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approach for=\r\n specific details they are told that there is no formal charge,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; excep=\r\nt relatively minor ones. So the intimidation has been carried out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mai=\r\nnly through media reports, without any legal due process starting where\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; facts and arguments could get cross-examined. This lack of formal charge=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has enabled an atmosphere of intimidation using rumors and threats =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot be pinned down officially.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is important t=\r\no contrast this with the manner in which Indian media\n&gt; &gt; &gt; treats scandals=\r\n facing Islamic or Christian groups. The numerous scandals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; occurring =\r\noverseas often get blocked by Indian media entirely, or are given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mil=\r\nd treatment with tremendous sensitivity, in order to be seen as &quot;secular&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; and not &quot;communal.&quot; By contrast every kind of allegation against any H=\r\nindu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; group gets clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated as a =\r\nsocial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scourge equivalent to terror groups.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The media&#39;s =\r\nhounding mentality and mafia tactics deserve to be condemned. In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nSwami Nithyananda case, they have used carrots and sticks to lure and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n threaten, using whatever would get them more sensational footage. Several =\r\nTV\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stations and journalists camped out in Haridwar and sent me emails=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requesting my help in arranging an interview. When I failed to deliv=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (because it was not up to me to deliver any such thing), some of t=\r\nhem turned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nasty against me. One TV woman promised the swami&#39;s people=\r\n &quot;positive&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coverage if she got an exclusive. But after the interview=\r\n, she betrayed them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and turned it into more distortion and smut. This=\r\n led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; handlers to give interviews to more stations=\r\n in order to counteract this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distortion. But the more they said befor=\r\ne TV cameras, the worse the scandal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; became. One station was blatant i=\r\nn its threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you don&#39;t give us an inter=\r\nview right away, we will show you the power of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; media to destroy y=\r\nou.&quot; At one point a major TV station also wanted to drag\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Ramakrish=\r\nna Mission with similar allegations, but someone was able to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stop tha=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Failures of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s Organization\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nindu tradition separates three kinds of Varna (skills), each representing a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; form of social capital, and these three were never supposed to be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; concentrated in a single person, thereby preventing too much concentrat=\r\nion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of power. I use the terms Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not as b=\r\nirth based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;caste,&quot; but as merit based social capital and areas of co=\r\nmpetence. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahmin job description focuses on spirituality and res=\r\nearch; Kshatriya on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; governance, politics and leadership; and Vaishyas=\r\n on commerce and financial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capital. Swami Nithyananda had persons wit=\r\nh Brahmin qualities performing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; duties that demand Kshatriya and Vaish=\r\nya skills. This was counterproductive.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The ashram leaders were select=\r\ned and trained for skills and roles that are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very different than this=\r\n situation demands. Too often their bhakti and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual practice sub=\r\nstituted for professional competence in managing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rapidly growing gl=\r\nobal enterprise. The sole emphasis was placed on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; traditional Brahmin =\r\nqualities, and none on what would be considered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kshatriya qualities.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, there are a large number of white devotees who do have\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Kshatriyata - leadership expertise, courage and commitment. But even a=\r\nfter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this attack the ashram organization has blundered in its failure=\r\n to leverage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and deploy them. I met some of these Westerners at the K=\r\numbh and found them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remarkably willing to stand up for their guru, bu=\r\nt nobody had bothered to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organize them and take advantage of the fact=\r\n that Swami Nithyananda has a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; global following. Instead of such initi=\r\natives to deal with the crisis, his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organization was in utter chaos, =\r\nreacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the other side.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Its leaders were running sc=\r\nared, driven by one rumor after another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Decisions were being made in=\r\n desperation and panic. The group was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cognitively disoriented and man=\r\ny of its members were psychologically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; breaking down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\n organization was too much of a one-man show with the leaders operating\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; like children dependent on the swami for every decision. The swami had\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; become the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inner circle. Their proximity=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him became their measure of personal power and identity. This is =\r\nclassical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cult-like behavior that cannot survive the onslaughts that =\r\nare inevitable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nowadays. Such a concentration of all varnas into one =\r\nman not only makes an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enterprise incompetent, but it also can also ge=\r\nt to the leader&#39;s head and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make him power hungry. Especially when the=\r\n guru has siddhis, this power can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easily become co-opted by his ego i=\r\nnto a dangerous mixture. The result is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that he surrounds himself with=\r\n sycophants who tell him what he wants to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear, and this feedback loo=\r\np of self glorification turns into group\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delusion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I not=\r\niced this in the form of the inner circle&#39;s inability to make common\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsense judgments, and their misrepresenting the facts to their leader by\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; giving him too much &quot;good news.&quot; The result was that the honest truth di=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not come out fast enough to allow pragmatic and realistic planning.=\r\n I had a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult time to get dependable information, and the storie=\r\ns kept changing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not only over time but also between one person and an=\r\nother within the group.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I could not tell if there was a cover up and =\r\nif new lies were fabricated to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cover prior lies. In such an atmospher=\r\ne one cannot tell which individuals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; might have a separate stake and v=\r\nested interest from the group. Lacking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; competent Kshatriyas, the swam=\r\ni had not anticipated that such a crisis was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ever possible, despite t=\r\nhe fact that outsiders (including myself in my 2-day\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talks at his ash=\r\nram) had explained to them the threats facing every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prominent Hindu m=\r\nahatma today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; While on the one hand I blame those in positions of res=\r\nponsibility at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashram, ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the res=\r\nponsibility as he selected\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them, defined their roles, evaluated their=\r\n performance, motivated and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supervised them very closely. In this reg=\r\nard, his spiritual capabilities had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; failed to evaluate those very clo=\r\nse to him as well as the external reality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An enlightened master must=\r\n do better than this, or else he must not try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; control everything s=\r\no personally.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I acknowledge that being a global guru is very demandin=\r\ng today, given that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one has to represent a very old tradition authent=\r\nically and yet in a manner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that appeals to modern people. This is why=\r\n Hindu leaders need a crash course\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on matters that are well beyond th=\r\ne traditional education in their own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sampradayas (lineages).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Hindu Chaos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s own support base in India has st=\r\narted to distance itself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out of self preservation amidst all the rumo=\r\nrs and slander. His closest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supporters were not approached soon enoug=\r\nh with his side of the story, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by the time they were approached th=\r\ne damage to his credibility was already\n&gt; &gt; &gt; irreversible. They did not wa=\r\nnt to risk being associated with a &quot;fallen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru.&quot; Many Hindu gurus ha=\r\nve started to publicly lash out against the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;fallen godman&quot;; others b=\r\necame silent or neutral publicly, while offering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; private sympathy but=\r\n refusing to stick their necks out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One factor is that the swa=\r\nmi&#39;s approach was too conservative for some and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; too liberal for other=\r\ns. It is too filled with deities, symbols and rituals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of a very ortho=\r\ndox kind for the aesthetic taste of modern global gurus who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; propagate=\r\n a whitened, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism that is abstract and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metaph=\r\nysical but devoid of imagery associated with &quot;primitive paganism.&quot; At\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the other end of the spectrum are orthodox Hindu leaders who find his idea=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of youthful dancing, celebration, and liberal atmosphere to be not &quot;=\r\nreal&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hinduism. A couple of shankaracharyas interviewed on NDTV lashe=\r\nd out against\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;false&quot; gurus and claimed that only the shankaracharyas=\r\n had the authority to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certify who was qualified to be a guru. So Swam=\r\ni Nithyananda fits neither\n&gt; &gt; &gt; end of this spectrum.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many of=\r\n the gurus I met have told me in confidence that they fear that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simil=\r\nar attacks are coming to more Hindu gurus, but that there is no central\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Hindu mechanism to deal with these episodes along the lines of various\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Church mechanisms that intervene when Christianity faces a scandal. I =\r\nsent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feelers to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha as to whether it shoul=\r\nd offer to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; step in and take over the ashram and its related organizat=\r\nions, thereby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bringing new management to clean up matters and bring s=\r\ntability to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enterprise. I was told that while this was a &quot;good id=\r\nea in principle,&quot; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was not practical because HDAS is simply not set=\r\n up to deal with this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Way Forward\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My overriding con=\r\ncern throughout this investigation has been to find a way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to do damag=\r\ne control in order to protect the broader interests of dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This r=\r\nequires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affairs, it seems\n&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nat the mess cannot be created without the swami leaving the movement and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; going into a strictly private life of meditation and self inquiry. I wo=\r\nrry\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the young ashramites who I feel are amazing individuals but i=\r\nn need of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; proper mentoring. They have a solid commitment to the cause=\r\n and their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personal spiritual paths, but they lack the sophistication=\r\n and maturity to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deal with what they face today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swami N=\r\nithyananda should resign immediately and hand over all his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; organizati=\r\nons to senior spiritual masters, preferably Shaivites practicing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nShiva Sutras and related traditions. He told me in an interview hat I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n recorded on March 9th that he was willing to leave everything and become a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wandering sadhu again. I wish that interview had been aired.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The new spiritual leaders would give the ashram a new life and chance=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; revive itself. It could either remain a place for spiritual train=\r\ning or turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; itself into a Hindu social service organization. Either w=\r\nay it would be a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better outcome than the likely alternative of the go=\r\nvernment stepping in to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; take over the ashram and turn it over to admi=\r\nnistrators who are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; positively disposed to Hindu spirituality =96 =\r\nas has happened in numerous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; similar cases of government takeovers of =\r\nHindu temples and organizations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; despite government claims of its acti=\r\nons being &quot;secular&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Besides giving up the organization, Swami=\r\n Nithyananda should return to his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; personal sadhana under the guidance=\r\n of these spiritual leaders. Let them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate him and his organizati=\r\non, and issue their independent report to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; public. Swami Nithyanan=\r\nda should fearlessly and humbly submit himself to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their judgment of w=\r\nhat happened and what the remedies ought to be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hinduism has s=\r\nurvived for many millennia and faced many kinds of crises,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just like =\r\nall the other major religions of the world. It has its own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; internal r=\r\nesources and mechanisms to deal with such situations. These need\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to b=\r\ne put to use and they need to become modernized. This is not the last\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n such scandal Hindu groups are going to face in the near future.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist=\r\n so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
