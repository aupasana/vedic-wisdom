You jump into the water, just move your hands and legs and there you go. A teacher cannot teach you. You have to jump and discover it yourself&quot;. It seems so easy and natural to him, but not for one who cannot swim. If one just jumps into water and starts moving hands and legs, one may even drown!\n \nThough a swimming instructor cannot ensure that you learn swimming in a specific time period or that you become an expert in swimming, he can engage in practices that maximize the probability of you learning swimming successfully oneday. He can also stop you from drowning in the beginning.\n \nIt is true that there is no formula to ensure self-realization in a specific time period. One can look at self-realization as a happy accident that just happens. However, rishis and seers gave many ways and factors that increase the probability of that accident considerably. Guidance from a good guru will also increase the probability of that accident considerably. However, even a good guru cannot ensure realization. One can only maximize its chance.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAadi Shankara is so correct and wise in saying that a guru is the tiger in a dream who awakens you from the world of dreams. The tiger may just be a dream object and unreal, but, one would stay in the dream much longer if not for the tiger roaring in the dream!! Similarly, a guru is just imaginary. All that exists is god and the tendency to see different people/obejects (instead of seeing all as god and only god) is like imagining various dream objects. So guru, friend, enemy, wife, son etc are all detailed imaginations of the mind and all that exists is god. However, one will be stuck in this long dream called samsaara (wordly life), if the tiger called guru does not appear and roar. A beautiful and highly meaningful analogy!\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe use of gurus who are pretentious, gurus who have not realized themselves, gurus who have pride, gurus who have selfish agendas and gurus with a bloated sense of self-importance, is very limited. However, please remember that even such gurus can be of immense benefit to *some* people. Everyone has a role to play and that is why Nature has created them!\n \nBut an ideal sadguru who can really give you a strong push in your spiritual pursuits is one who has no ego, one who does not have a bloated sense of self-importance, one who has no pride, one who identifies with and is guided by the Infinite and one who is fulfilling his/her dharma without any expectations.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. If the fact is that there is no I but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for Brahman, why all this Maya?\n \nLet me ask a similar question:\n \nIf whatever happens in a dream is not really happening and just being imagined in your mind, why all that imagination? Why not just be dreamless?\n \n*That* is not the correct or useful question! If the fact is that you *are* in a dream, a more useful question is: How can I realize that I am in a dream and come out of the dream into a state of wakefulness?\n \n*        *        *\n \nI briefly described how my relatitonship with my spiritual guru  started in the mail that Utpal mentioned below. During the time Manish was waiting for me to start using the rudraksha mala he sent, he used to call me now and then and talk about spiritual matters. He would sometimes talk about very specific things that I was thinking of just before he called. He would address my question without my asking. A couple of times, I mentioned that to him and said he was answering exactly what I was thinking of, as though he read my mind. He would humbly say, &quot;do you think that I know your thoughts? I have no clue. I am just saying what I feel like saying. Shiva wanted to answer your question and used me as an instrument to answer your question. It is god who does everything. We are mere instruments.&quot;\n \nOnce he said, &quot;my message is *not* that I am special. My message is that *you* are special. My message is that *everyone* is special. I am not here to just experience divinity and go. I am here to show people that it is possible even today and make *thousands* of people experience divinity. I do not want people to become like me. I want to see thousands of people becoming *better than* me.&quot;\n \nHe also said once, &quot;I am not here to show an alternative spiritual path to people. If one is a Krishna devotee, let one remain a Krishna devotee. If one is an aghori, let one remain an aghori. If one is in a religious movement, let one remain in that movement. If one is a Christian, let him remain a Christian. I just want people to realize the essence of religion and spirituality, imbibe it in their thinking and become better in their own chosen path.&quot;\n \nAlready, so much change happened in the 5.5 years since he called me first. I never thought I could be in the state I am today. I never thought the changes in my thinking that happened in the last few years were possible. I never thought so many seemingly normal people would be able to perform a homam regularly. When Manish told me that today&#39;s times need a lot of people performing homam regularly and that a lot of people were out there who would start homam and make great progress with 5-6 years of homam, I was not so sure. Manish always knew what to do, was quite confident and did not worry about how and whether it would get done. At the same time, he never lost the attitude of &quot;She is doing and I am just an instrument&quot; and imbibed that attitude in me too!\n \nAs I said before, the sign of a good guru is that you see transformation within yourself. The sign of a good guru is that you see things getting done that once seemed impossible or very difficult. The sign of a good guru is that you achieve far more than before and yet have far less attachment to (and pride in) what you do.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Rajarashi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha is contemporary to us and a professional with family life.

It is my belief that even if no formal Guru is there in the Life of a MUMUKSHU, Brahman is always there for him as Guru hence to put it anotherway, NO sincere seeker is WITHOUT GURU.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; by the way following is the chain of message in VA list which triggered an event where Satchidanda became a Tangible guru for me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 382 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The above probably relevent to your first two questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i again give a quote form VC where in Shankara again suggest a beautiful idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;We all are God who have forgotten that reality&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for your third query, i wish to ask a counter question? Why we create dreams while sleeping and then play happy, sad and frightened?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; Again, i&#39;ve no realisation myself. it si probably all partially cooked or uncooked knowedge which is reproduced, which was liked by intelligence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@ .&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Recently one of my friend had a question for me:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Can a Guru help us? He took Jiddu Krishnamurthy&#39; s view on this. JK claims that a guru can not help any one and the self realisation has to come from with in. My friend is asking, if a Guru is useless as JK claims, why did JK write so many books (no offence to JK followers)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. If a person has to realise on himself, how it can be?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. If the fact is that there is no I but for Brahman, why all this Maya? Why is Braham that is me has to go through the misery and in the end realise that he is Brahman? Why not Brahman be Brahman and not create any thing?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I could not give convincing answers to any of the questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vijay\n\n\n"}}
