The e=\r\nssence of cosmic being (Parama Purusha) who evolved from Brahman fills all.=\r\n\n \nBut at this level, there is no difference between birth or death, happin=\r\ness or sadness, pleasure or pain, killing or being killed. The opposites ar=\r\ne but a delusion here. So killing is of no consequence.\n \nBut, for most peo=\r\nple, these opposites are quite different. We are caught in duality and ther=\r\ne is no point in mixing up with non-duality. At the level of duality, there=\r\n are good and bad, gods and demons, pleasure and pain, birth and death etc,=\r\n and they are different. There are opposites, one is desirable and the othe=\r\nr undesirable. Most rules given in scriptures are based on the dual world, =\r\nbut sometimes people mix up some principles of non-duality with it and crea=\r\nte confusion.\n \nDuality and non-duality are two totally different concepts =\r\nand one should NOT mix them up. Unfortunately, pseudo-scholars have mixed t=\r\nhem up and created paradoxes and confusions in the last few centuries.\n \n* =\r\n       *        *\n \nIf you see difference between Rama and Ravana and betwe=\r\nen Dharmaraja and Duryodhana, you are in duality. Don&#39;t pretend that all is=\r\n the same (god) then. For you, there are opposites and there is good and th=\r\nere is bad. All is not god.\n \nTo promote good and control bad, do what your=\r\n conscience tells you to do, with as little attachment with the actions as =\r\npossible.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Murahari =\r\nVadapalli \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2=\r\n009 3:55 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Nice article on dharma by Rob=\r\nert Svoboda\n\n\n        Namaste, \n        Confusing statements:\n        a) Ki=\r\nlling is prohibited as God is sarva vyapakeswara and is existent in everyon=\r\ne\n\n        b) Killing is alright when seen through the filter of dharma or =\r\ndetachment.

To=\r\n know teh simple truth that that which goes out will come back to you and t=\r\nhat, if you had not been bad at some point, nothing bad will ever come to y=\r\nou. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a life based on and being o=\r\nn the right side of karma, is much easier and profitable  than trying to fi=\r\nnd that elusive dharma which anyway won&#39;t help one in the long run.\n       =\r\n           &gt;  \n                  &gt; Just my feeling on the subject.\n        =\r\n          &gt;  \n                  &gt; -Regards\n                  &gt;  Rajarshi\n  =\r\n                &gt;  \n                  &gt;  \n                  &gt;  \n           =\r\n       &gt; Much better option\n                  &gt;  \n                  &gt; \n    =\r\n              &gt; \n                  &gt;  \n                  &gt; \n               =\r\n   &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n             =\r\n     &gt; \n                  &gt; --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

If, based on one&#39;s \n                  &gt; &gt; mental tendencies an=\r\nd karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \n                  &gt; &gt; =\r\nritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s=\r\n \n                  &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a =\r\nperson to make a lot of \n                  &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple=\r\n, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; The dharma =\r\nof a being may change from one life to another.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n    =\r\n              &gt; &gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to=\r\n kill his gurus, \n                  &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then=\r\n was such that there was too much weight \n                  &gt; &gt; on earth an=\r\nd nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n          =\r\n        &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a g=\r\nreat extent, \n                  &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone f=\r\nor it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \n                  &gt; &gt; it was his dhar=\r\nma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \n                  &gt;=\r\n &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n   =\r\n               &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born aga=\r\nin in the 19th century as one of \n                  &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n                  &gt; =\r\n&gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in th=\r\nis \n                  &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce mater=\r\nial life despite his \n                  &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and liv=\r\ne the simple life of a monk and inspire \n                  &gt; &gt; generations =\r\nto embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \n             =\r\n     &gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakr=\r\nishna \n                  &gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place =\r\nmay be something else.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; The tricky questi=\r\non is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n                  &gt; &gt; \n   =\r\n               &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;fol=\r\nlow your own dharma \n                  &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; i=\r\nn the light of castism. Though the concept \n                  &gt; &gt; of caste =\r\n(varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n       =\r\n           &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who=\r\n lived by \n                  &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a =\r\nmaharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n                  &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a po=\r\nwerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \n                  &gt; &gt;=\r\n later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna=\r\n \n                  &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to i=\r\nn childhood. As one \n                  &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s=\r\n own varna based on what one does.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                 =\r\n &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know=\r\n your \n                  &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, the=\r\nre are not just 4 dharmas in \n                  &gt; &gt; the world. Each person =\r\nhas individual dharma.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; Knowing=\r\n what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n        =\r\n          &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have=\r\n a part of our \n                  &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is=\r\n, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n                  &gt; &gt; noise from other =\r\nparts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n                 =\r\n &gt; &gt; confused.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; We should make =\r\nthe best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \n             =\r\n     &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but=\r\n doing \n                  &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n      =\r\n            &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is =\r\nof utmost importance is to engage in \n                  &gt; &gt; actions without=\r\n identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not \n                  &gt; =\r\n&gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not buil=\r\nd \n                  &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We shoul=\r\nd engage in the best \n                  &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our =\r\nbest judgment on what our dharma in the given \n                  &gt; &gt; situat=\r\nion is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the \n      =\r\n            &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should =\r\nleave the result \n                  &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did =\r\nit&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n                  &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Suc=\r\nh adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n                  &gt;=\r\n &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness sl=\r\nowly. \n                  &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper=\r\n and tell our dharma clearer. \n                  &gt; &gt; There is a positive fe=\r\nedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n                  &gt; &gt; d=\r\nharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,=\r\n \n                  &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n             =\r\n     &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not follo=\r\nwing one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n                  &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma=\r\n&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with \n                  &gt;=\r\n &gt; little attachment.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n                  &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s =\r\ndharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n                  &gt; =\r\n&gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One ca=\r\nn \n                  &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is =\r\ngiven to one&#39;s spiritual \n                  &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders t=\r\no a spiritual master, one can take the words of \n                  &gt; &gt; the =\r\nmaster to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n                 =\r\n &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma =\r\nwas and thought killing gurus \n                  &gt; &gt; and relatives was not =\r\ndharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n                  &gt; &gt; d=\r\nharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma =\r\n\n                  &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a seclude=\r\nd place to do sadhana, \n                  &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried=\r\n and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n                  &gt; &gt; worl=\r\nd and do the work of Mother for him.\n                  &gt; &gt; \n               =\r\n   &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, wha=\r\nt one&#39;s \n                  &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one c=\r\nan err in the judgment of what \n                  &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If o=\r\nne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \n                  =\r\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n              =\r\n    &gt; &gt; \n                  &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n                  &gt; &gt; \n =\r\n                 &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set=\r\n of principles and \n                  &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, d=\r\nharma changes from person to person, from \n                  &gt; &gt; time to ti=\r\nme and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \n        =\r\n          &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understan=\r\nding of one&#39;s \n                  &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. =\r\nBy doing various kinds of spiritual \n                  &gt; &gt; sadhana (like ho=\r\nmam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \n                  &gt; &gt;=\r\n attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding o=\r\nf \n                  &gt;

So \n                  from teh point of view of dharma, how =\r\ncan he be blamed? \n                  Therefore, the statement taht &quot;Dharmo =\r\nrakshati rakshitah..&quot; , \n                  does not make sense. How is his =\r\ndharma protecting him? What is \n                  he getting in return, oth=\r\ner than a bag load of strong karmas \n                  to fend off at a lat=\r\ner date, when he may not even be aware why \n                  he has this k=\r\narmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can there is \n                  conflicting D=\r\nharmas for one person? Or more important \n                  vs&nbsp;less im=\r\nportant dharma? Swadharma should be \n                  situational. Sant Tu=\r\nlsidas&#39;s&nbsp; broader dharma may have \n                  been realizing Ra=\r\nma, but as a husband, his dharma should have \n                  been to kee=\r\np his wife happy. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can \n                  ever =\r\nfull perform every dharma that is expected of us. \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I believe the reason this idea of \n                  Dhar=\r\nma was existent in ancient times, was mostly because \n                  nat=\r\nure has created various kinds of people, each with varying \n               =\r\n   tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or \n         =\r\n         the best way to tell men that we are all different and yet we \n   =\r\n               are not incorrect in anyway. This is much better than the ne=\r\nw \n                  ages philosophies which outright deny reality and clai=\r\nm \n                  everything and everyone is born equal. It is not so.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n                  &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The word religion is a 13 century =\r\ninvention \n                  and, etymologically, and inherently competitiv=\r\ne in nature. \n                  Unlike Dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also,=\r\n as Narasimhaji&#39; s \n                  mail shows correctly, following Dharm=\r\na is no gaurantee of \n                  anything, least of all Moksha. It j=\r\nust continues the cycle. \n                  But what is the big deal in con=\r\ntinuinng the cycle, it would \n                  any way continue which ever=\r\n path one choses, dharma or \n                  adharma. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; A much better way of \n                  conduction life, I feel, is ma=\r\nknig a mental note of Karma.

The time then was such \n              =\r\n    that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on earth and \n            =\r\n      nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n      =\r\n            &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization \n =\r\n                 destroyed to a great extent, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to welcome Kali=\r\n \n                  yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warr=\r\nior, \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that.=\r\n Some \n                  people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; respected=\r\n were on the \n                  other side and it was his dharma to kill th=\r\nem.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was =\r\nborn again in the 19th \n                  century as one of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; R=\r\namakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s \n                  sishyas (Swami Yogananda had b=\r\neen Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  previous life, according t=\r\no Ramakrishna) , his dharma was \n                  different in this &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; new time and place. He was \n                  born to renounce mate=\r\nrial life despite his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  aristocratic upbring=\r\ning and live the simple life of a monk and \n                  inspire &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of \n                  mental =\r\ndetachment and service to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; others. When he \n                  =\r\nis born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n                  =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place \n              =\r\n    may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n                  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what \n                  is o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some people have \n                 =\r\n interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma \n              =\r\n    &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of \n         =\r\n         castism. Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has \n  =\r\n                been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n   =\r\n               &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki wa=\r\ns \n                  a shudra who lived by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; killing birds. He =\r\nbecame a \n                  brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was =\r\na &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  kshatrita and a powerful king. He became=\r\n a brahmana and and a \n                  maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; later. Basi=\r\ncally varna shows one&#39;s \n                  aptitude. One starts off with th=\r\ne varna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of \n                  father, because that is what on=\r\ne is exposed to in childhood. \n                  As one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; devel=\r\nops in life, one gets one&#39;s own \n                  varna based on what one =\r\ndoes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, \n                  the misinterpreta=\r\ntion of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to \n                  know your &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. \n                  Moreover, th=\r\nere are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the \n                  world. E=\r\nach person has individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very \n                  diff=\r\nicult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; enough, one will \n                  *kn=\r\now* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n                  =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is \n           =\r\n       surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; noise from other parts of \n    =\r\n              our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n                  confused.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We should make the=\r\n best \n                  judgment combining discrimination and intuition an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it =\r\nsincerely. We may \n                  err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the best =\r\nwe can is all that we \n                  can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n More than following dharma, \n                  what is of utmost importanc=\r\ne is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  actions without identifi=\r\ncation. *That* alone ensures that we \n                  are not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not \n                  increasing the load=\r\n. We should not build &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; too \n                  much attachment =\r\nto what we are doing. We should engage in the \n                  best &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best \n                  judgment on=\r\n what our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  situation is=\r\n), with as little attachment and \n                  self-identification wit=\r\nh the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; action as possible. \n                  When the action =\r\nis finished, we should leave the result \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to=\r\n god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what \n                  will happen =\r\nnow&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such \n                  adherence o=\r\nf nishkama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt; =\r\nunattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our \n                  =\r\nconsciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As we become purer, our \n              =\r\n    mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n         =\r\n         &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly \n        =\r\n          enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow \n   =\r\n               it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n                  &gt; but not as difficult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not foll=\r\nowing \n                  one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;this i=\r\ns my dharma&quot; \n                  gets refined with time if one engages in ac=\r\ntion with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt; little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; \n                  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intel=\r\nlect and \n                  intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Another=\r\n external input \n                  is the words of scriptures and learned m=\r\nen. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them.=\r\n A special place is given \n                  to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; master. If one surrenders to \n                  a spiritual master, one =\r\ncan take the words of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  the master to determ=\r\nine one&#39;s dharma and follow it \n                  sincerely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused \n                  about what his dha=\r\nrma was and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt; and rela=\r\ntives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna \n                  who clari=\r\nfied his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath \n                  (Swami =\r\nVivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt;=\r\n and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded \n                  p=\r\nlace to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa \n                =\r\n  cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          =\r\n        &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n       =\r\n           &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not \n =\r\n                 know who one is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; debts are and wh=\r\nat \n                  nature expects from one can err in the judgment of wh=\r\nat \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an el=\r\nevated \n                  soul with a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns inner core, \n                  such a guru can give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; \n                  *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or an=\r\nybody) cannot outline \n                  a set of principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; declare that as the \n                  dharma. No, dharma changes from =\r\nperson to person, from \n                  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; time to time and fr=\r\nom place to place. Also, \n                  there are no thumbrules to find=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s \n                  dharma is.

By doing \n                  various kinds of =\r\nspiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, \n                  japam etc) =\r\nand engaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  attac=\r\nhment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s \n                  un=\r\nderstanding of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual \n                  dharma.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  Nara=\r\nsimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- \n                  ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a \n                  Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; \n                  tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; \n                  rolo=\r\nger.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n               =\r\n   href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank \n                  rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ \n                  tarpana&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; \n                  targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ \n                 =\r\n group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): \n            =\r\n      &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank \n                  re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            =\r\n      &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \n                  href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank \n                  rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \n                  href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank \n                  rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n                  ------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- \n                  --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message \n                  ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ \n                  yahoo.co. in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ \n                  yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September \n                  27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] \n                  Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora \n                  series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt;&gt; Vimalanda say=\r\ns path of dharma is very \n                  personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Can =\r\nsomebody share views on that \n                  and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt;&gt; Does it has to=\r\n do something with vedas and \n                  upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                  &gt;&gt; \n          ji=\r\ntender&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n          &lt;=\r\nDIV style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; COLOR: white&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial color=3D#000000 =\r\n\n          size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY=\r\n&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;CLEAR: both; COLOR: white&quot; width=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \n  color=3D#000000 size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- Start Recommen=\r\ndations --&gt;&lt;!-- End Recommendations --&gt;&lt;!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| -=\r\n-&gt;&lt;!-- |**|begin egp html banner|**| --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0281_01C9B7CF.AEE38770--\r\n\n"}}
