Most =\r\nof them are premonitions of bad events(fire,train derailment,murder,kidnapp=\r\ning etc) going to happen around the world. The fear tension that gropes aro=\r\nund a person when he is kidnapped or murdered etc runs through my body. Alm=\r\nost everyday I get up at the middle of night upset/scared apply vipudhi and=\r\n sleep. Shouldn&#39;t homams give one bliss then why do I feel so much pain of =\r\npeople? How is this related to spirituality? Kindly advice and is there a s=\r\nolution to this. \n\nMany thanks,\nPriya\n \n\n\n"}}
