I have already implemented some of =\r\nthe recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam Tva Gana=\r\npatim HAVAMAHE&quot; from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians spea=\r\nk Hindi, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, &quot;=\r\nRam&quot;, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit =\r\nthat a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel.=\r\n But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They car=\r\nry that habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the No=\r\nrth Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bha=\r\nja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, w=\r\nhich sounded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like=\r\n Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa=\r\n&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi=\r\n also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, =\r\nthat approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana Saro=\r\nja\n&gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Guruc=\r\nharan saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on this aspect as well. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Re: Common Sanskrit Pronunciation Errors (Part 1)\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discuss=\r\nion, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot!&quot;&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear narasimha guruj=\r\ni \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you are doing a great job to this universe by sharing your knwl=\r\nedge\n&gt; &gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo humble!!!.Truth ia truth and wha=\r\nt ever you are saying is also truth .no need to consider yourself as an idi=\r\not\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pv=\r\nr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahams=\r\na once said that even Vedas are corrupted these days. It is the nature of K=\r\nali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many peo=\r\nple, including highly learned Vedic scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sans=\r\nkrit mantras (including Veda mantras) incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, =\r\npronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the spirit of surrende=\r\nr to god is even more important. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Es=\r\npecially, correct pronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pr=\r\nonunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most complete experience=\r\n of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can memorize and repea=\r\nt Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct pronuncia=\r\ntion and point out some common errors. If you do not think that correct pro=\r\nnunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of the errors=\r\n or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore my writi=\r\nngs on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing your pr=\r\nonunciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestio=\r\nns if you find them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;=\r\nt&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sah=\r\nasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. =\r\nThey change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is =\r\na reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nev=\r\nertheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/s=\r\nyllable/akshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowe=\r\nl sound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of a=\r\nksharas, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still e=\r\nxperience something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never exper=\r\nience the mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aksha=\r\nra means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an ak=\r\nshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has n=\r\no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you=\r\n pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain =\r\nthe sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It =\r\nhas no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; i=\r\ns one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the =\r\nakshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of =\r\nthat akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When=\r\n you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know f=\r\nor sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one =\r\nlistens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very qu=\r\nick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o=\r\n&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound g=\r\nets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara an=\r\nd the chhandas changes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pro=\r\nnouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes =\r\nvery clear to hear, so that his students would not get confused when learni=\r\nng. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;=\r\n) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standard =\r\npractice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the Eng=\r\nlish word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the e=\r\nnd of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel so=\r\nund to be added at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonan=\r\nts applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly =\r\nencountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also=\r\n, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up chang=\r\ning the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is als=\r\no wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sou=\r\nnd &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;=\r\ndha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols =\r\nof tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is differe=\r\nnt. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound becau=\r\nse of their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now pron=\r\nouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be =\r\nthe odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two=\r\n different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds for the same =\r\nsymbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are diff=\r\nerent too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) wit=\r\nh a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha ch=\r\naturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusha=\r\nrthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (wo=\r\nrk and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment=\r\n)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaard=\r\nha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddha=\r\nrdham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis=\r\n-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committ=\r\ned by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantri=\r\nka/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dh=\r\na&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in =\r\nthe mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha fo=\r\nr dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in=\r\n my view) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit man=\r\ntras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever t=\r\nhe Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and =\r\ntake my input into consideration in altering your pronunciation (if you are=\r\n open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I am saying or want to =\r\ncontinue as taught by your gurus, I can understand that. I am not here to c=\r\nhange everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She inspired me to share my t=\r\nhoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are SOME who are destined =\r\nto change their pronunciation based on my views. That is why I am writing t=\r\nhese mails.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and=\r\n just ignore this idiot!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Ganapath=\r\ni Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
