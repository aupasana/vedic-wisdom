Difference being that Sama Veda is to be sung, not chanted.\n&gt; &gt; @homam1=\r\n08: SamaVeda is also &quot;chanted&quot; with rigid specification on \n&gt; &gt; timing & pi=\r\ntch. It sounds closer 2 songs & may hv given rise 2 music. \n&gt; &gt; @I_am_Rajar=\r\nshi: Your views on why Lord Krishna compares Himself to \n&gt; &gt; SamaVeda among=\r\n Vedas?\n&gt; \n&gt; When Krishna says &quot;I am so and so among so and so&quot;, please not=\r\ne that &quot;I&quot; \n&gt; stands for &quot;unconditioned Self&quot;, which is the *essence* of Cr=\r\neation. \n&gt; Also, do not think that X is superior to Y and Z, if Krishna say=\r\ns &quot;I am \n&gt; X among XYZ&quot;. It means that X is the *essence* of XYZ.\n&gt; \n&gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; For comparison, take a couple of other things Krishna =\r\nsays. He says &quot;I \n&gt; am Om among all sacred mantras&quot;. Of course, there are s=\r\no many powerful \n&gt; mantras, like panchakshari, ahstakshari, dwadasakshari, =\r\nnavakshari, hare \n&gt; krishna mahamantra, so many Vedic hymns, so many purana=\r\n mantras, so many \n&gt; beeja mantras etc. But, Om is the *essence* of all man=\r\ntras. One with \n&gt; different kinds of conditioning can use other mantras to =\r\novercome \n&gt; conditioning. But, once all conditioning is gone, one&#39;s uncondi=\r\ntioned \n&gt; mind is established in the essence, which is represented by the m=\r\nantra \n&gt; Om.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, Krishna says, &quot;I am japa among yagyas&quot;. One wi=\r\nth a \n&gt; conditioned mind benefits from homas/yagyas performed materially wi=\r\nth an \n&gt; external fire and overcomes conditioning. But, once one&#39;s conditio=\r\nning \n&gt; drops and one become very pure, one&#39;s own internal fire is strong a=\r\nnd \n&gt; japa itself is a yagya. As one meditates with a mantra, all of one&#39;s =\r\n\n&gt; thoughts and desires are sacrificed in the internal fire and one is \n&gt; e=\r\nstablished in the divine.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, regarding Veda=\r\ns. The word &quot;R^ik&quot; in Rigveda is from the root &quot;R^ic&quot; \n&gt; and means &quot;to prai=\r\nse/extol&quot;. The word &quot;yajus&quot; in &quot;Yajurveda&quot; is from the \n&gt; root &quot;yaj&quot; and me=\r\nans to sacrifice. The word &quot;sAma&quot; in Samaveda is from \n&gt; the root &quot;sama&quot; an=\r\nd means &quot;same, equal, in oneness&quot;. The hymns of \n&gt; Rigveda extol various as=\r\npects of Supreme Self. The hymns of Yajurveda \n&gt; describe how to sacrifice =\r\nconditioning to realize unconditioned Self. \n&gt; The hymns of Samaveda descri=\r\nbe an experience of various aspects of \n&gt; Supreme Self (in oneness). That i=\r\ns why Samaveda is the essence of Veda \n&gt; and Krishna says &quot;I am Samaveda am=\r\nong Vedas&quot;, just as He said &quot;I am Om \n&gt; among mantras&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;     =\r\n               http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
