The \npooja was very nice and sincere and I loved it, but I noticed one bad \npractice and honestly told them what I thought. I want to share the same \nwith all of you.\n\nShowing deepam or lamp to the lord is one of the upacharas (services) \nperformed in the pooja after the abhishekam (bathing). In some \ntraditions, they show multiple lamp setups with multiple numbers of \nwicks, each setup with a specific mantra. While the abhishekam and \nupacharas were going on, I was sitting with eyes closed and meditating \nwith Gayatri mantra. After the showing of various lamps, I felt \nsomething negative and opened my eyes. I saw that one person was \nforcibly extinguishing the fire in each wick with a rose petal.\n\nGod knows if the idol or Shiva lingam used in a pooja has divine \npresence or not, but live moving fire DOES have god in it. It is not at \nall a good idea to extinguish fire forcibly. If keeping tens of wicks \nburning is not practical, put very little oil in each wick so that it \nlights for a small time only. If you can&#39;t wait, then don&#39;t light so \nmany wicks. Just light 1-5 wicks and show them with all mantras. That is \nfar better than showing a lamp with 21 wicks, another lamp with another \nnumber of wicks and so on and then forcibly extinguishing all the tens \nof wicks. Even if an auspicious material like rose petal is used to \npress and extinguish, that does not make it acceptable.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
