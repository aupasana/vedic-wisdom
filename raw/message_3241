Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very hon=\r\nest. \n&gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chicken, =\r\netc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable. with that logic, those people=\r\n who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright.=\r\n even people who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and no=\r\nt doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\n&gt; &gt; To talk about Karma=\r\n, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the l=\r\nogic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well=\r\n with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.\n&gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cul=\r\ntures have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved.

My point is, as=\r\n a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to =\r\nplants, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=83=E2=80=9A this logi=\r\nc that many vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to=\r\n quit eating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I pe=\r\nrsonally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its =\r\npathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cuttin=\r\ng of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so=\r\n cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the h=\r\numans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which c=\r\nomes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t hav=\r\ne proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). an=\r\nd then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally=\r\n do not share them. Call me cruel hearted. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen the question of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for=\r\n such. It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pai=\r\nned about may not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyon=\r\ne.=C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-vegetarian f=\r\nriends were watching discovery channel where they showed that people in som=\r\ne parts of the world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them=\r\n, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A =\r\nif someone eats an insect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a =\r\ncertain culture in a certain set of value, one gets the believe that what o=\r\nne is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life =\r\ntime they were to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eating inse=\r\ncts without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible p=\r\nroduct of our own conditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the prob=\r\nlem happens when we think our conditions are the only possible conditioning=\r\n in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas=\r\n. That is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is. Ev=\r\nerything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this li=\r\nfe, if he gets born in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid whi=\r\nle eating the same. I know=C3=83=E2=80=9A people who faint at the sight of =\r\nblood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations daily. So my point =\r\nis, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an individual, but i=\r\nt=C3=83=E2=80=9A cannot be=C3=83=E2=80=9A a universal logic applicable to a=\r\nll.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the=\r\n idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly kill=\r\ning an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys de=\r\nad meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if so=\r\nmeone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=E2=80=9A does not want to deal in the raw fl=\r\nesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that y=\r\nou would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple daa=\r\nl which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who has ch=\r\neated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in =\r\nall food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broil=\r\ner eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten becaus=\r\ne they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma d=\r\noes one get for consuming that? God\n knows.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; An=\r\n average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an om=\r\nnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and =\r\n20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good combina=\r\ntion. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple =\r\ndiet, are prone to serious heath issues at a younger age. But this 80-20 ve=\r\ng/non-veg, is biologically good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be full of fi=\r\nshes:), Earth will be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable=\r\n if everybody will become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not, put up=\r\n such arguments to defend however as i said earlier they are themselves not=\r\n convinced.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The above arguments are incorrect.

However , I&#39;ll honestly say that=\r\n i have no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The people who argue=\r\n such as&#39;: Most eat meat in the world, Egg is vegetarian, Plant also has li=\r\nfe, One will not get required nourishments only with vegetarian food, If we=\r\n don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of ch=\r\nickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if everybody will become vegeta=\r\nrian :Etc...are more often than not, put up such arguments to defend howeve=\r\nr as i said earlier they are themselves not convinced.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vegeter=\r\nian people have their own arguments but all these are mere arguments. I per=\r\nsonally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its p=\r\nathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting=\r\n of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so =\r\ncruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the hu=\r\nmans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which co=\r\nmes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have=\r\n proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and=\r\n then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bottom line is that =\r\n&quot;They cannot overcome&quot; the cravings for the meat, fish and eggs. This is a =\r\nnaked reality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi, However i try, i am not convince=\r\nd with arguments in favour of Nonveg food. Only at the cold places and dese=\r\nrts where survival was the main consideration, i can slightly agree but tha=\r\nt too during ancient days. not now...Now everywhere Veg food is easily avai=\r\nlable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Few months back, a young girl from Germany ca=\r\nme to work in my office for 6 months. once i casually asked her as to what =\r\nshe eats during lunch. what she said was not at all expected. she said that=\r\n she is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg food since 3 years now and wants =\r\nto continue that way whole life. As expected, i was very happy and i furthe=\r\nr asked the reason. The answer she gave so much happiness. She said that Sh=\r\ne does not want to kill to eat. Vow! I salute her from my heart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear U=\r\ntpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I s=\r\nlightly disagree with your below mail.

Dharma (Non\n Violence)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; against Adha=\r\nrama (Killing Innocent creatures).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyway, my=\r\n point is, I understand that it is good to eat totally vegetarian food when=\r\n you engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, or else it conflicts =\r\nwith your system badly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana=\r\n, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing for filling st=\r\nomach is if Not right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not right in all conditions=\r\n*. it is a different matter, if in future i succumb to challanging conditio=\r\nns and start eating meat but even then it&#39;ll not justify and make it proper=\r\n thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t g=\r\net offended by my message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; your second Para and some writings in your earlier message gives me i=\r\nmpression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... doe=\r\ns not appeal me. to be very\n honest. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In my opinon, if one can=\r\n justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under the Sun =\r\nis eatable. with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, i=\r\nnsects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have started eati=\r\nng human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the =\r\n&#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture e=\r\ntc..., and try to make quality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; =\r\nand &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a ph=\r\nilosophy to cover up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultures have becom=\r\ne Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an example of one s=\r\nuch person and there are few more i know. howvever they are very very very =\r\nrare.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The above arguments are incorrect.

T=\r\nhats how i also take it when such people talk such nonsense.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *=\r\n**&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Lastly, i&#39;ll add a philospohical thought. If so much of kil=\r\nling every hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on i=\r\nn the world, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have=\r\n a peacefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma=\r\n (Cause &amp; effect) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human soci=\r\neties.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Om Shaanti Shaanti Shaanti:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ..&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope you or others won&#39;t get offended =\r\nby my mails.

My point is, as a non-vegeta=\r\nrian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants, over =\r\nanimals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=83=E2=80=9A this logic that many v=\r\negetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eating =\r\nnon-veg, does not hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; I personally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging =\r\ngoats. its pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in\n queue to se=\r\ne the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The=\r\n flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tas=\r\nty for the humans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a =\r\nfish which comes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water =\r\n(i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out o=\r\nf water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I understan=\r\nd and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me =\r\ncruel hearted. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When t=\r\nhe question of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for suc=\r\nh. It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained =\r\nabout may not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Some =\r\nof my non-vegetarian friends were\n watching discovery channel where they sh=\r\nowed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends seemed =\r\ndisgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what i=\r\ns wrong=C3=83=E2=80=9A if someone eats an insect. Just because one is born =\r\nin a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one gets =\r\nthe believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told th=\r\nem if in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they would =\r\ngladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. We hu=\r\nmans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinion is =\r\nall right. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are the onl=\r\ny possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t oth=\r\ners share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the world di=\r\nverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life,\n if he gets born in a place/culture/ =\r\nfamily in a later lifetime which=C3=83=E2=80=9A eats non-vegetarian food, h=\r\ne would not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do mu=\r\nltiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very=\r\n good reason for an individual, but it=C3=83=E2=80=9A cannot be=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A a universal logic applicable to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the idea of karma=\r\n. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing an animal,=\r\n not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/e=\r\ngg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-v=\r\negetarian)=C3=83=E2=80=9A does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can bu=\r\ny some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would get f=\r\nor it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=83=E2=80=9A It i=\r\ns similar to the one you\n would get for buying some simple daal which has c=\r\nome to the market through the hands of a middle man who has cheated the far=\r\nmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we e=\r\nat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - whi=\r\nch never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten because they never =\r\ngrow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does one get f=\r\nor consuming that? God knows.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; An average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actu=\r\nally an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulse=\r\ns etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a go=\r\nod combination.
