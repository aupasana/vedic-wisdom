We had in the past done a couple of homans in \nthe ho=\r\nme and both times the priest(different) used aluminium trays\nand inthat the=\r\ny poured first sand and then on top of sand they used \ndry coconut and in t=\r\nhe US we also get something called quick burning \nfire logs I suppose they =\r\ncontain some wood and the same material they\nuse to make candles, Oops I fo=\r\nrgot the name of this material and some \nother things.\n\nSo I also when I st=\r\narted did use initially aluminium trays and also\nquick burning log along wi=\r\nth coconut.\n\nFurther more I have actually wrapped the copper kunda with alu=\r\nminium \nfoil so that the kunda remains clean. May be I should remove the \na=\r\nluminium foil.\n\nAny conclusive guidance about wrapping haven kunda with alu=\r\nminium foil\nand usage of quick burning log in the homa is appreciated.\n\nFur=\r\nther I think there are few other things that are also needed, I am \nnote su=\r\nre or understand their usage\n\nSuchi, srava, proksani and pranita and sphya.=\r\n I have no understanding \nof these items as to how to use them. again any m=\r\nore information very \nmuch appreciated\n\nFurther I read somewhere that one n=\r\needs to also invoke brahma for the \nentire time from start till poornahuti =\r\nis done and is to be seated on \nthe south side, I am not sure how to do it.=\r\n\n\nTarpana in the Ganapati homan, there is tarpana details but others \nlike =\r\nlaxmi or krishna or saani homan manuals do not seem to have or I \nmissed it=\r\n. Do we need to do tarpana always with milk for all homans. \nI suppose so. =\r\nAgain some clarification would go long way\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, aparajita Vidya \n&lt;aparajita_vidya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Namaste \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; So aluminium aslo should not be considered a good thin=\r\ng as it means \nrahu...\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Best Wishes\n&gt; =C2=A0Aparajita\n&gt; \n&gt; --- O=\r\nn Fri, 21/11/08, Sanjay Prabhakaran &lt;sanjaychettiar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: =\r\nSanjay Prabhakaran &lt;sanjaychettiar@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: I=\r\nron Homkunda\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, 21 November=\r\n, 2008, 5:21 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; || Om Gurave Namah ||\n&gt; Dear Aparajita,=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0I dont know the sanskrit name for Aluminium.
