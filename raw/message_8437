The thought of=\r\n Vishnu turning on his watery resting place and glancing in this direction =\r\nis rather sweet. You&#39;ve motivated me to do the mantra with even more enthus=\r\niasm now. Thank you. :) I will pester Her for help with this......Ramakrish=\r\nna says you have to keep tugging at Her sari till she gives you something v=\r\naguely worthwhile like devotion.\n\nVery interesting to hear of your experien=\r\nce in Delhi. I agree that the Name provides protection against dodgy situat=\r\nions. I don&#39;t like to think about ghosts/spirits etc.... I&#39;m embarrassed to=\r\n say that have always been scared of the dark since childhood, slowly getti=\r\nng over it now. \n\nOnce at university, around 7 years ago, I was preparing f=\r\nor some exams. It was after term-time and I had stayed back to revise.  I w=\r\nas moved to a room that was different to the one I had been staying in, as =\r\nmy usual room was being used for some conference guests. I used to hang out=\r\n with the Hare Krishnas then, and was really into chanting the Hare Rama ma=\r\nhamantra then (still love this mantra, but chant Om Namo Narayanaya more no=\r\nw)- used to do 2 hours a day and it made me feel good. \n\nI was lying on my =\r\nback in this new room trying to sleep around 11 pm, and was in some sort of=\r\n light sleep state. At that point I had a very nasty sensation that can onl=\r\ny be described as something or someone trying really hard to strangle me! I=\r\n felt very frightened, and couldn&#39;t move, speak or wake myself up.\n\nIn this=\r\n state, my mind started repeating &quot;Hari, Hari, Hari,Hari, Hari&quot; very very f=\r\nast in terror. I think I chose this name because it was short and I could s=\r\nay it very fast with concentration! The frightening experience then passed =\r\nand I felt the Name saved me.\n\nI woke up and turned on the light feeling ab=\r\nsolutely petrified and unable to go back to sleep. I then did something I w=\r\nouldn&#39;t normally do. I rang the Sivananda Yoga centre in London at that tim=\r\ne of night (I knew they don&#39;t sleep till about midnight as I&#39;ve stayed ther=\r\ne) and had the nerve to ask to speak with a senior lady Swami who initiated=\r\n me into my chosen mantra. Despite the late hour of 11 pm, she very kindly =\r\ncame to the phone and reassured me saying it could have been some real nega=\r\ntive force or just something from my imagination. Either way, she reassured=\r\n me saying I had done nothing wrong to cause it, and repeating the Name was=\r\n the right approach. She suggested chanting before bedtime to avoid similar=\r\n experiences. I then chanted some rounds of the Mahamantra before going to =\r\nbed and slept fine (had to sleep with the light though on because I&#39;m a cow=\r\nard ;).\n\nSince then, I keep up the practice of repeating the Name before be=\r\ndtime. I feel it keeps the err...nasties..away! And brings positive Divine =\r\nenergy to my mind ensuring better sleep. :)\n\nBest wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0Hello,\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =A0 Thanks for writing this mail and the=A0link=\r\n to to the article.=A0.=A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This is a very powerful and sacred mantr=\r\na and I am sure regular japa=A0brings peace and protection. Some years back=\r\n I went to Delhi for few days and stayed at my friend&#39;s house which was on =\r\nfifth floor. The building was new and he told me after he moved in with his=\r\n family they had done big haven of this mantra.\n&gt; During night before I wen=\r\nt to sleep I was trying to do=A0a eye open meditation and was in a slight t=\r\nrance.Suddenly I noticed some spirits/entities were trying to come in the r=\r\noom through window but they could not come as there was a covering of white=\r\n light there. I knew immediately it is the effect of that haven in the hous=\r\ne. Now in the link article same thing is mentioned as a psychic shield. Pro=\r\nbably=A0this shield =A0was all round the=A0.building but more=A0so on fifth=\r\n floor.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; In your previous mail you have said how you are doing mantr=\r\na japa to complete the required number. You are doing such a intense workou=\r\nt with your everyday normal life and it is making Divine Lord take a turn o=\r\nn His Waterbed in Milk Ocean and take a look towards earth plane. Did you k=\r\nnow this?\n&gt; And what will happen when you are holding phone and pretending =\r\nand it actually rings. Your workmate will know your secret.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks.=\r\n\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: sunrise=\r\n_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday=\r\n, 25 June 2012, 19:37\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mahamrityunjaya and Divine =\r\nNamapathy\n&gt; \n&gt; Greetings,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you&#39;re all well, and that your sadhanas=\r\n are going fantastically well (especially after we all told each other to g=\r\net verrrry serious). \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve had a gruelling few shifts in hospital the =\r\nlast few days, including witnessing some unfortunately inevitable deaths in=\r\n very sick people...something that has become part of my daily life as a do=\r\nctor. It is weird to see how the body loses all importance the moment it di=\r\nes. It is also strange how a dead body looks just like an empty house...exa=\r\nctly like someone just left. It certainly makes one think that there must b=\r\ne something more to us than this fleshy cage. This cage that becomes unattr=\r\nactive in old age, filled with appalling miseries in serious illness, and h=\r\nideous in death. \n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesting to think about what one can do to =\r\nhelp the sick and dying, when they reach a stage beyond all human aid. It i=\r\ns not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling utterly helpless to relie=\r\nve suffering. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sivananda used to have great faith in the Name- he used=\r\n to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While modern medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki etc =\r\nall have their place, he used to say that, Namapathy was an outstanding way=\r\n to prevent disease and heal us on all levels- physical, mental and spiritu=\r\nal. \n&gt; \n&gt; While he said all names of God- Rama, Allah, Buddha, Jehovah- are=\r\n equal, he often mentioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra specially for healing=\r\n purposes. And especially for those who are very sick or dying.\n&gt; \n&gt; He say=\r\ns &quot;Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurable diseases and be=\r\nstow long life and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I visited =\r\nthe Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some years ago,=\r\n and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day with chanting of =\r\nmantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each other and =\r\nthe whole world. I believe it is the same with the little Ashram hospital i=\r\nn Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating mantras wi=\r\nth your colleagues. \n&gt; \n&gt; I wanted to mention the power of this mantra for =\r\nanyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you yours=\r\nelf are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of God t=\r\no ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;Thy W=\r\nill be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking for =\r\na miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God). \n&gt; \n&gt; At any po=\r\nint in time, there are several human beings, animals and various creatures =\r\nwho are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during the process of dy=\r\ning. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to re=\r\nduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here i=\r\ns a link for those who are interested in learning more about this great man=\r\ntra.
