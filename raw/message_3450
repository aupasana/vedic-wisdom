I had no difficulty in recognising Narasimha as he had appeared in my=\r\n room at night several years ago and his picture is on video. I knew immedi=\r\nately in dream that other person is Rajarshi although I do not know him.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hay guys, what you were doing in that line? Were you queueing for nirv=\r\nekalp or sahaja samadhi or similar hocus pocus or just mundane new years sa=\r\nle?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I saw Rajarshi so clearly that I would\n have recognised him amon=\r\ng several persons in physical world but now the image has become very dim i=\r\nn my memory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was good to see&nbsp; you both.&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;LaxmiNaray=\r\nan&lt;/span&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;input id=3D&quot;gwProxy&quot; type=3D&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;input i=\r\nd=3D&quot;jsProxy&quot; type=3D&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;refHTML&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;=\r\n/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;=\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: wh=\r\nite; clear: both;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n \n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1752745522-1263598247=:99333--\r\n\n"}}
