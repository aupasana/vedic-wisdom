Since it is relevant to the topic, wish to add my 2=\r\n cent...\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sopari&quot; (Betel Nut) is one good item to offer as a Purnaahut=\r\ni. Especially for those, who are doing homam in close apartment with dry co=\r\nconut pieces. Somebody suggested me to offer it in Homam long back and sinc=\r\ne then I usually offer it every time along with a Dry Coconut Half. I did n=\r\not realize initially the purport of the suggestion but after more than a ye=\r\nar of offering, i understood the meaning. Sopari is an extremely hard subst=\r\nance-Very difficult to break. Symbolical of our false Ego and Pride. our pa=\r\ntterns & Habits. However one caution! If one starts offering it as purnaahu=\r\nti then one may need to be ready to face situations where in Ego is hurt, I=\r\nnsults are mounted, feathers are ruffled.
