&#2412;&#2412;&#2414;&#2407;=\r\n&#2413;\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Saurabh,\n&gt; \n&gt; I think these are very genuine queries. So=\r\nme important things to ponder over regarding this question:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. What do=\r\nes it mean to &quot;see&quot; a devata? If one does not see, can one &quot;hear&quot; a Devata,=\r\n or feel His/Her presence?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Is seeing a Devata similar to seeing ano=\r\nther person or a shopping mall or a Disney land? If it is same then why can=\r\n&#39;t we see Devatas whenever we wish. If not, what is different?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. What=\r\n do you expect to happen if and when you see a Devata? Assuming that it wer=\r\ne possible. For example if you say want to see/meet Barrack Obama you have =\r\na certain expectation in your mind about how the interaction will go. Simil=\r\narly what kind of expectation is in the mind about the idea of seeing/meeti=\r\nng a Devata..\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Krshna was a Devata who lived like a Devata in this m=\r\naterial plane. We can be sure of this from the list of miraculous incidents=\r\n surrounding Him from childhood. His lifting a mountain on a finger, showin=\r\ng the Universe to his mother inside his mouth, displaying his 4 armed forms=\r\n, using the Sudarshana Chakra to cut off the head of Sishupala, causing an =\r\neclipse to happen by will, cloning Himself into multiple number of exactly =\r\nsame forms such that he could be present with all the gopis at the same tim=\r\ne etcetera. These are things which a Devata can do and a human can&#39;t. So pe=\r\nople around Him were effectively seeing Devata in flesh and blood, in full =\r\npotency. Did it really cause a massive spiritual turn in their lives? For s=\r\nome yes, for others no. INfact strangely it was the Gopis, whose interactio=\r\nn with Krshna was for the least period of time compared to many others - si=\r\nnce Krshna could never come back to Vrndavana once He left for Mathura - wh=\r\no benefitted\n&gt;  maximum (spiritually speaking) from Him. Then as He spoke t=\r\nhe Gita, Krshna showed a Virat Roopa - a Universal Form, so infinite that i=\r\nt is impossible to experience properly by the five senses even if they have=\r\n been made subtle by His blessings - to Arjuna who got so scared that he be=\r\ngged the Lord to change the form into the one which is easier for him to gr=\r\nasp, 4-armed Vishnu. SO what kind of meeting/seeing/darshan is our mind exp=\r\necting when it comes to a Devata? \n&gt; \n&gt; The normal/human form - which may o=\r\nr may not benefit a seeker depending on the internal state of the seeker? (=\r\nIt benefitted Gopis, it did not benefit many others)\n&gt; \n&gt; The special form =\r\n- in case of Krshna with four arms holding shankha, chakra, gada etc? This =\r\nform has benefitted many. Yet, when Krshna appeared in this form to Gopis, =\r\nthey refused to accept Him and asked Him to come back in his form as Krshna=\r\n. So we cannot say for sure that this kind of a Divine form is sufficient t=\r\no push a seeker into a high spiritual state.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally the Universal For=\r\nm. This cannot be digested by anyone. Irrespective of Divine Sense or gross=\r\n senses. No body in the history of spirituality has been able to experience=\r\n the truly and infinitely Universal Form and stay sane or not feel fear and=\r\n awe. Not one instance. There was in Bengal a great sadhaka named Swami Nig=\r\namananda Saraswati about 150 years ago. He was a disciple of the great Agho=\r\nri Vamakhepa and by Vama&#39;s blessing he had realized the Goddess Smashan Tar=\r\na. One day the disciple insisted that he wanted to see the Universal form o=\r\nf the Mother Tara. Vama his guru tried to dissuade him. But he was adamant =\r\nand kept asking the form of Ma Tara that he could see and interact with, to=\r\n appear in the Universal form. The next thing he saw was just a face, whose=\r\n fierce blood-dripping fangs encompassed the whole sky and covered his enti=\r\nre range of vision. Swami Nigamananda fainted immediately. Mind you, he had=\r\n by then already acquired great proficiency\n&gt;  in worship of Smashan Tara -=\r\n the very same Devata whom he requested to appear before him in a Universal=\r\n form. Later when he came back to senses, he saw Vama fanning his head and =\r\ntelling him never to ask Her for the Universal form. It simply CANNOT be di=\r\ngested by anyone! \n&gt; Basically this \n&gt; mean, to me, that our consciousness =\r\nCANNOT ever comprehend INFINITY as \n&gt; it is. It will always make an approxi=\r\nmation for its own good. Moses \n&gt; could not take the raw Light of God in th=\r\ne burning bush episode on Mt Sinai. Same thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; So is it this form of =\r\na Devata that we want to see? Is it even possible to see/hear/touch/experie=\r\nnce?\n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, what is the difference between these various se=\r\neings? Infact, why are they different in the first place?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The impor=\r\ntant question to ask would be, IMHO, not whether Devatas can be &quot;seen&quot;, but=\r\n what do we, as seekers, expect to happen IF a Devata chooses to manifest H=\r\nimself/Herself on our consciousness? Unless we are very, very, very excepti=\r\nonal, such that a Devata has pre-decided based on certain karmas and promis=\r\nes from past existences to come and intervene in our lifepath - as it happe=\r\nned with Aghori Vimalananda - and pull our strings, chances are that we may=\r\n not derive much benefit from a casual meeting with a Devata, just like so =\r\nmany in the Kurukshetra never derived any benefit from meeting Krshna, who =\r\nwas a Devata no doubt.\n&gt; \n&gt; A Devata has various roopas depending on which =\r\ninstrument we are using to percieve Him/Her. The sthoola roopa - gross form=\r\n (rare but not impossible for a Devata). You need the gross phsyical sense =\r\nto experience this. The sukshma roopa where we need subtle senses to percei=\r\nve the Devata. This is what mostly happens with people who &quot;see&quot; Devatas. S=\r\nuch an interaction can very good, to just another day with nothing special.=\r\n It all depends on how much internal preparation has been done by the seeke=\r\nr. As an analogy, you can, if lucky, go and meet Barrack Obama say hi and c=\r\nome back. Nothing much happens. Over time you forget it and life goes on. O=\r\nr you can also meet Obama and then maybe impress him so much that he in tur=\r\nn does something really nice for you which he is well capable of, which sus=\r\ntains long and changes your life. \n&gt; \n&gt; Then there is the causal form and t=\r\nhe greater causal form. These are too rare. To have a &quot;Darshan&quot;/experience =\r\nof a Devata in these forms, one will have to do solid work of self-transfor=\r\nmation. That is detachment, control of internal enemies, etc etc, the stand=\r\nard advices which all scriptures and sadgurus tell us. One experience of an=\r\ny Devata in the causal form is sufficient to leave a massive impact on a pe=\r\nrson&#39;s life for ever. And the greater causal is mostly offlimits for just a=\r\nbout 99.999999% of us. That is the Universal Form. These are similar to exp=\r\nerience of the Self or the soul, as enumerated in the Upanishadic literatur=\r\ne.
