He meditated for a long time and then he went south to\n&gt; &gt; Devas, a sm=\r\nall town near Indore. The legend is, a drop of blood \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; Sati when=\r\n Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse feel in Devas too. \n&gt; And \n&gt; &gt; in the s=\r\name place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A \nlot \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; grea=\r\nt Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating there, \n&gt; &gt; starting=\r\n with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai and \n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; Sheel=\r\nnath Maharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th \n&gt; &gt; century.

I am sure there are others \nwho \n&gt; &gt; benefited too.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; They all stayed at the Temple in devas.
