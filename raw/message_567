unparalle=\r\nled not only in Hinduism, but also in the world wide\n&gt; scriptural literatur=\r\ne. They are the oldest of the world scriptures.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vedas, literally meani=\r\nng the (true) knowledge, are not only the\n&gt; epitomes of philosophical, spir=\r\nitual and religious vision, dogmas \nand\n&gt; aptitudes, but also are a storeho=\r\nuse of sociological\n&gt; processes, historical events and verily, the\n&gt; cultur=\r\nal thread of the Indian subcontinent. However, most of us,\n&gt; whether Indian=\r\ns or foreigners, have failed to read correctly into\n&gt; these great literatur=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; In an attempt to understand these super scriptures, I have not only=\r\n\n&gt; created web pages http://www.geocitie s.com/siva_ sai19/vedas, which\n&gt; h=\r\nave had a wide acclamation from the netizens, but also recently\n&gt; started a=\r\n group on Vedic history.\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedichisto ry=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This group endeavors to read into the currently available Vedas and\n&gt;=\r\n make the reading a commentary on the historical, cultural and\n&gt; spiritual =\r\nsaga of ancient India\n&gt; \n&gt; However, in Vedic history, instead of projecting=\r\n my views, I like\n&gt; more learned and the commoners alike to join and exchan=\r\nge views.\n&gt; \n&gt; I cordially invite every one of you, especially the spiritua=\r\nlly\n&gt; elevated, to join my group to make it a success and useful to \nothers=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; groups.yahoo. com/group/ vedichistory/ join \n&gt; \n&gt; I hope you will jo=\r\nin and actively participate in this\n&gt; humble, yet noble and holy, endeavor.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; My other groups:\n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ancientind ia\n&gt; ht=\r\ntp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedicastro logy-hyderabad\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Kis=\r\nhore patnaik\n&gt; \n&gt; Kishorepatnaik09[ at]gmail. com\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
