Cessation of Ahamkara =\r\nand purity seems to be only required in the initial stages when you are sti=\r\nll struggling to acquire a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. O=\r\nnce you have achieved some level of success, discipline that may have been =\r\nrequired in the initial stages is no longer necessary.\n=C2=A0\nI have read a=\r\n few of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website for=\r\n free downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a steady =\r\nmind, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual act=\r\nivity as would be=C2=A0in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you m=\r\nind, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he=\r\n did a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana tha=\r\nt people thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....once =\r\nhe had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana=\r\n alone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across R=\r\nishi&#39;s who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be ev=\r\ner ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of the=\r\nm seemed to have big egos.\n=C2=A0\nI do not know if you have read the Aghora=\r\n books on Vimalananda,=C2=A0 but if you read that, even when Vimalananda ta=\r\nlks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like being challenged on any =\r\nmatter and this is time and again=C2=A0seen in his books.\n=C2=A0\nOfcourse a=\r\nbove all, you need to keep your ego in control before the Lord even though =\r\nyou may be reckless to other humans. There is someone I know....I do not kn=\r\now him personally but only through message exchanges over groups like this.=\r\n He seems to have knowledge of a lot of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite a=\r\n lot of them. Success seems to illude him though. According to him, when he=\r\n does sadhana for others, it succeeds immediately but not when he does this=\r\n for himself. And he was once=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help him=\r\n out with the situation. I really do not know much about the various sadhan=\r\nas for achieving specific needs. So I suggested that instead of of asking f=\r\nor suggestions of different sadhana from everybody, why does he not just te=\r\nll the lord in his prayer one day that the effects of his bad karmas are ge=\r\ntting too much to bear and if the Lord could provide him the success he is =\r\nlooking for in his life. He retorted and shot back at me that\n he did not s=\r\npend time and energy in learning these various tantric sadhanas just to beg=\r\n before god, he only knows how to demand from god.! I reminded him that all=\r\n this while, he was not having any problems begging for help and suggestion=\r\n from other group members and yet, he is not willing to beg from god when r=\r\neally god is the one and only who can really do anything the problems he is=\r\n facing. I do not think even Ravana had that attitude that this person did,=\r\n=C2=A0when he would sit down for his sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nCheers,\nBhupendra\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nFrom: silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com\nSent: Mon, November 15, 2010 11:44:16 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Success with Mantras\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nNamaskar,\nHow did Ravana got success wi=\r\nth Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss of Ahamkara and pur=\r\nity of mind ?\nWhere is the liberation without shakti, even the slaves were =\r\nhumble, devoted and with complete surrender to their masters, what results =\r\ndid they ever get ?\nThere is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobhti us bhuja=\r\nng ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet saral ho&quot;=\r\n.

Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems =\r\nto be only required in the initial stages when you are still struggling to =\r\nacquire a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. Once you have achi=\r\neved some level of success, discipline that may have been required in the i=\r\nnitial stages is no longer necessary.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have r=\r\nead a few of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their websit=\r\ne for free downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a st=\r\neady mind, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexua=\r\nl activity as would be&nbsp;in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady =\r\nyou mind, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravan=\r\na, he did a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravan=\r\na that people thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....=\r\nonce he had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at R=\r\navana alone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come acr=\r\noss Rishi&#39;s who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they&nbsp;seem to =\r\nbe ever ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most o=\r\nf them seemed to have big egos.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do not know =\r\nif you have read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,&nbsp; but if you read tha=\r\nt, even when Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not li=\r\nke being challenged on any matter and this is time and again&nbsp;seen in h=\r\nis books.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ofcourse above all, you need to keep=\r\n your ego in control before the Lord even though you may be reckless to oth=\r\ner humans. There is someone I know....I do not know him personally but only=\r\n through message exchanges over groups like this. He seems to have knowledg=\r\ne of a lot of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite a lot of them. Success seem=\r\ns to illude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana for others, =\r\nit succeeds immediately but not when he does this for himself. And he was o=\r\nnce&nbsp;asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I=\r\n really do not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific =\r\nneeds. So I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of differen=\r\nt sadhana from everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his prayer =\r\none day that the effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear and=\r\n if the Lord could provide him the success he is looking for in his life. H=\r\ne retorted and shot back at\n me that he did not spend time and energy in le=\r\narning these various tantric sadhanas just to beg before god, he only knows=\r\n how to demand from god.! I reminded him that all this while, he was not ha=\r\nving any problems begging for help and suggestion from other group members =\r\nand yet, he is not willing to beg from god when really god is the one and o=\r\nnly who can really do anything the problems he is facing. I do not think ev=\r\nen Ravana had that attitude that this person did,&nbsp;when he would sit do=\r\nwn for his sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Cheers,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bhupend=\r\nra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, s=\r\nerif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Mon, November =\r\n15, 2010 11:44:16 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN=\r\n&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Success with Mantras&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/S=\r\nPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1959359882ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskar,&lt;BR&gt;How did Ravana go=\r\nt success with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss of Aham=\r\nkara and purity of mind ?&lt;BR&gt;Where is the liberation without shakti, even t=\r\nhe slaves were humble, devoted and with complete surrender to their masters=\r\n, what results did they ever get ?&lt;BR&gt;There is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Ksham=\r\na shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahi=\r\nt vineet saral ho&quot;.

Bhakti and me=\r\nditation always would work!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other gurujis are reading this, I would a=\r\nppreciate it if they take the leadership to develop such mantras and circul=\r\nate for the benefit of the members.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very much!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With deep regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.co=\r\nm/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrol=\r\nogy@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C=\r\nhant the below mantra at least 108 times everyday with deep belief and&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopala Mantram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishn=\r\na Krishna Mah=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82yogin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Bhakt=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82n=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82m Abhayam Kara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82nanda&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82na Ya=\r\n\n !!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi, you give shelter to your devot=\r\nees.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, You are the giver of=\r\n Supreme Bliss.
