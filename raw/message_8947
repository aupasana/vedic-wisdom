Very go=\r\nod question!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Usually, people do not make offerings in fire to speci=\r\nfic deceased persons. One idea is to make an offering to your deceased ance=\r\nstors together. You can say &quot;OM pitR^ibhyaH svAhA&quot; (in iTrans notation) and=\r\n make an offering (or several offerings by repeating it several times) in f=\r\nire. At the end, sprinkle a little water on the tips of right hand fingers.=\r\n Then proceed with the rest of the homam. This can be ideally done at the e=\r\nnd of homam, before uttarangam.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; An ideal offering to pitris is a mi=\r\nxture of black and white sesame seeds and ghee.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; You can also do Pit=\r\nri Tarpana and include your late father.
