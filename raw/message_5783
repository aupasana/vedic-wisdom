Who sees the defects in the eye whether\nthere =\r\nis cataract or not? It is the Buddhi (intellect). Who sees the defects\nin t=\r\nhe Buddhi whether there is confusion or clarity?

This =E2=80=9CAham=E2=80=9D is=\r\n Kutastha or Atma or\nBrahman,illuminator of everything.\n\nAs a punishment fo=\r\nr a certain crime you would rather prefer to have your\nhands cut off than t=\r\nhe eyes removed. This indicates obviously that the\nIndriya is closer to you=\r\n and dearer also than the external instruments.\nInstead of sentence for dea=\r\nth you would rather prefer to have your two eyes\nremoved. This shows that l=\r\nife is dearer and closer to you than the Indriya.\nWhen you suffer from a se=\r\nrious, protracted ailment, you wish to give up your\nlife also, to get happi=\r\nness. This shows that the Self or Atma is dearer than\nlife or Prana.\n\nMan g=\r\nenerally argues at the time of his death, =E2=80=9CI have undergone many\nmi=\r\nseries,troubles and difficulties in this life. I have done various good\nact=\r\ns. They may not go in vain. After all, is it for this one life alone I\nhave=\r\n laboured so much? This cannot be. I must be immortal.=E2=80=9D He invents =\r\nthe\ntheory of Immortality. Even commonsense will tell everybody that there =\r\nmust\nbe an immortal Atma.\n\nYou had been a child playing in your mother=E2=\r\n=80=99s lap. Then you grew up into a\nschool-going boy. Then you became a si=\r\nghing lover in adolescence. Then you\nreached adult manhood. Lastly you beca=\r\nme a veteran with grey hairs.

That unchanging Self is Brahm=\r\nan. It is the substratum for all\nthese changing experiences of life. An inv=\r\nariable Self must link\ncontinuously the varying childhood, boyhood, manhood=\r\n and old age.\n\nA spermatozoon, which is a millionth part of a drop of semen=\r\n, and an ovum\nfrom the ovary joined together give rise to the formation of =\r\nthis body. What\na great mystery! That subtle power which is the source for =\r\nthis semen and\novarian product, that subtle essence which sustains all thes=\r\ne,is thy own\nSelf. That is Truth. That is Soul.

By some unknown process of growth one o=\r\nf the tissues preponderates\nand the distinguishing characteristics of sex a=\r\nre developed by about the\nthird month. The testicles are in the abdomen of =\r\nthe male child. They\ndescend into the scrotal bag by about the seventh mont=\r\nh.What a great wonder!\nThe Lord only, who is the source of all beings and t=\r\nhe ruler of all\ncreatures,knows Himself by Himself.\n\nJust as one thread pen=\r\netrates all flowers in a garland, so also one Self\npenetrates all these liv=\r\ning beings.

Just as\nbutter is perceived when milk is converted into cur=\r\nd and churned, so also\nBrahman is perceived through the churning of meditat=\r\nion.\n\nJust as hunger, thirst, pain, taste, etc., have to be experienced, bu=\r\nt\ncannot be seen by the fleshy eyes,even so Brahman has to be experienced\nt=\r\nhrough deep meditation and Samadhi.
