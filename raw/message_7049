Such blanket statements=\r\n are incorrect \n&gt; and gloss over nuances and create a totally wrong picture=\r\n. \n=C2=A0 \nWhat I said is not a &quot;blanket statement&quot;, but an explicit teachi=\r\nng of Vasishtha to Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is also absolutely consiste=\r\nnt with Upanishadic learning. \n=C2=A0 \nYou talk about taking the words of a=\r\n great instead of speculating. In fact, did Vimalananda *explicitly* write =\r\nthat Ramakrishna is only a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; and not a siddha or a natha or a r=\r\nishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or natha or siddha or paramahamsa, an=\r\nd so on? In my case, my statement above is explicitly and unambiguously sta=\r\nted by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda&#39;s question &quot;will siddhis help me=\r\n in god realization&quot; in the negative, Ramakrishna also affirmed this teachi=\r\nng of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentially refers to the same thing in Bhaga=\r\nvad Gita when he talks about seeking small things from demigods vs seeking =\r\n&quot;me&quot; (Self). Vaishtha&#39;s words, however, are the clearest and most unambiguo=\r\nus. \n=C2=A0 \nYoga Vaasishtham was taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the p=\r\nresence of Vishwamitra and other great sages and recorded by Valmiki. It is=\r\n the highest watermark of spiritual knowledge. \n=C2=A0 \nAghora series is ni=\r\nce, but can give wrong notions to some who may tend to be fascinated by ext=\r\nernal miracles. I have no doubt that Vimalananda had no confusions himself,=\r\n but some people reading those books can form misconceptions (though it is =\r\nstill ok if that makes them do sadhana. The only problem is if they start d=\r\noing the bad karma of making negative judgments on greats thinking they are=\r\n blindly following Vimalananda). It is a good idea to balance the perspecti=\r\nve with some Vedantic understanding such as Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad Git=\r\na. \n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Infact it also violates a point which you yourself made in an=\r\n earlier mail. The \n&gt; external is connected to the internal. Some siddhis a=\r\nre not possible unless one \n&gt; attains a very rarified level of realization.=\r\n And they manifest externally. \n=C2=A0 \nYes, some external siddhis are poss=\r\nible only at a very rarefied level of realization. But some with the same o=\r\nr higher level of realization may not possess the same external siddhi. Thu=\r\ns external miracles cannot be used as measures of one&#39;s level. \n=C2=A0 \nThi=\r\ns is like the analogy I gave of collecting fruits from the trees on the sid=\r\ne of the road to the hilltop. Some keep tavelling on the road and accept on=\r\nly those fruits that land in their lap by themselves. Some get distracted f=\r\nrom the journey and pursue the fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neithe=\r\nr necessary nor sufficient for reaching the top. Though having a fruit that=\r\n is available only at a very high altitude shows that one has reached great=\r\n altitude, it cannot be used as a measure of one&#39;s progress, for someone ma=\r\ny have climbed greater heights without collecting that (or any) fruit. \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \nExternal and internal do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence. Just as=\r\n you cannot tell what is inside a house by looking at it from outside, so c=\r\nannot you tell one&#39;s state of mind from looking at one. One&#39;s spiritual mat=\r\nurity and attainment is in one&#39;s state of mind. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; If a loved and revered spiritual figure is percieved to be questi=\r\noned, \n&gt; naturally a reaction is expected.

Yes that is why they were Nitya Siddhas. \n=C2=A0 \nI see Siddhis i=\r\nn other beings as a thermometer. It can be used to make some assessments. Y=\r\nou too mentioned the same in one of your mails. I respect all self-realized=\r\n beings, but based on mental tendencies I am drawn more towards some than o=\r\nthers. Just like any other person, including you. \n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;You, on the ot=\r\nher hand, are regarding him as a &quot;paramahamsa&quot;, who according to you is &quot;lo=\r\nwer&quot; than &quot;siddhas, nathas and rishis&quot;.&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nI cannot, have not and w=\r\nill not comment on Ramakrishna. He was, as per his words an Avatar too. \n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nOtherwise, as per Vimalananada&#39;s, the hirerchy is well defined. But=\r\n what is also important is to remember great beings send their amsa for spe=\r\ncific works, which is far more important. So one not needing to achieve a c=\r\nertain state, may not do so. \n=C2=A0 \nTo get a better understanding, why do=\r\nn&#39;t we get some inputs from someone who maybe more spiritually qualified to=\r\n pass a judgement on these things, whether a Paramahamsa is same as a Siddh=\r\na or a Nath or a Muni or a Rishi instead of speculation? Your word vs my wo=\r\nrd will not settle this. \n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt; \nAnd you believe that you are a good y=\r\nogi&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nYou assume much.

People who are so focused on the external=\r\n seek to see siddhis in external things only and forget that the biggest si=\r\nddhi one can get is internal! \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Added to=\r\n this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the \n&gt; disciple=\r\ns of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special \n&gt; spiritual bei=\r\nng, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. \n=C2=A0 \nWell, they =\r\nnot only regarded him as &quot;higher than them&quot;, but they also regarded him as =\r\nthe highest. They regarded him as the Supreme Being himself.

It could very well be a fact=\r\n. \n=C2=A0 \nFatness is external and judgable. Internal things (e.g. A is hap=\r\npier than B) cannot be judged the same way. Same with spiritual attainment =\r\n(siddhi=3Dattainment). It is internal and not observable externally. \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; For an ordinary man, all saints maybe equally elevated.

Siddhis are not a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress and neither nec=\r\nessary nor sufficient for liberation. \n(2) It is unwise to pass judgments o=\r\nn yogis like Vivekananda. Ramakrishna never tolerated anyone speaking anyth=\r\ning slightly critical of Vivekananda as he regarded Vivekananda as Narayana=\r\n himself.

If six disciples were &quot;Nithya=\r\n Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; as you say, can he be a &quot;Paramahamsa=\r\n&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than them?&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nSimple! Ramakrishna says =\r\nVivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in =\r\nfullforce, but sufficient part of the Rishi&#39;s consciousness that comes down=\r\n for a secific purpose and once the purpose is served, goes back to the sou=\r\nrce. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi i=\r\ns full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis o=\r\nne way or the other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) =\r\nsuch that the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). They are =\r\nNitya-siddha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts of =\r\nextremely higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely eve=\r\nntually go back to the source when the work is done. \n=C2=A0 \nHowever, in t=\r\nheir forms as specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these amsa att=\r\nain the specific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will determine=\r\n if they are to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are her=\r\ne for a purpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true =\r\nsense is when he, as Vimalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific s=\r\nhaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into =\r\nit, deeper and deeper.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 \nThere is a book of conversations betw=\r\neen Totapuri and a certain sadhaka (his disciple) when Totapuri lived in Pu=\r\nri. He used to stay in the Swargadwara smashana and later someone build a s=\r\nmall ashram for him. Totapuri&#39;s ashram still exists in Puri. In that conver=\r\nsation, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of what is a siddha and high=\r\ner. And how only a Siddha and none less is a true Vigyani. He further menti=\r\nons that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the stage of a Siddha. H=\r\nis work was specific, he did the work and went off. He did not need to and =\r\ntherefore did not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. \n=C2=A0 \nAdde=\r\nd to this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the discipl=\r\nes of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual being=\r\n, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. \n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;It is not n=\r\necessary that there is a clear order of greatness.

This=\r\n is a delicate area where many have misconceptions and I will try to addres=\r\ns them. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nMaharshi Vasishtha&#39;s teaching to =\r\nLord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The goal of existence and sadhana i=\r\ns self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither specifically sought nor speci=\r\nfically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature gives one some siddhi(s), o=\r\nne should accept them with neither excitement nor disappointment. But one s=\r\nhould NOT run after them, for they are neither necessary nor sufficient for=\r\n self-realization and liberation. \n=C2=A0 \nVivekananda used the same princi=\r\nple when Ramakirishna proposed to give his siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked=\r\n whether the siddhis will enable him to realize god. Ramakrishna said no. V=\r\nivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, when Ramakrishna gave=\r\n them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda&#39;s two actions demonstrate=\r\n Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nLet us use=\r\n the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one&#39;s spiritual sadhana. =\r\nReaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the hill from differ=\r\nent sides and using different paths. There may be trees with nice fruits on=\r\n the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special abilities. \n=C2=A0 \nIf =\r\none gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one&#39;s=\r\n journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha =\r\nsays a seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. \n=C2=A0 \nBut if some fru=\r\nits fall in one&#39;s lap by themselves, one can keep them. Similarly, siddhis =\r\nthat come to one by themselves can be accepted by a seeker of Self. \n=C2=A0=\r\n \nNow an important distinction: \n=C2=A0 \nThere are some trees that are foun=\r\nd at lower altitudes also, but some really special trees are found at very =\r\nhigh altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it shows that one has climbed=\r\n great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not mean much, but some siddhis =\r\nare very special and only really elevated sadhakas can obtain them (whether=\r\n by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates such a siddhi, yo=\r\nu can see that one progressed a lot. However, the key is that one who climb=\r\ned the same or more distance may not have that or any other fruit. \n=C2=A0 =\r\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nUnlike in the example of climbing hill, which is=\r\n an external activity, spiritual progress in real life is *internal*. There=\r\n is NO way for anyone to know for sure how much progress one has made, how =\r\nmuch self-control one has internally and what exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind=\r\n. We may try to judge it from external factors such as actions, words etc, =\r\nbut it is not necessarily accurate. \n=C2=A0 \nHere, some people swayed by si=\r\nddhis may be tempted to use one&#39;s siddhis to judge how high one climbed. Bu=\r\nt that is faulty. One person who reached the absolute top may not have any =\r\nfruits, while one person who still has ways to climb may have gotten some r=\r\neally nice fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that are neither n=\r\necessary nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one&#39;s progress=\r\n is unsound. \n=C2=A0 \nGiven that spiritual progress is internal, how can we=\r\n judge it and compare people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a=\r\n sarvaantaryaami - a perfected being who has access to each being&#39;s interna=\r\nl state - can do that. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nRajarshi, you are a=\r\nssuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scal=\r\ne. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; Abhedananda, Vivek=\r\nananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and hence Vimalanan=\r\nda is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. \n=C2=A0 \nIs P=\r\naramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa=\r\n because he is known so? See, how people are famously known may or may not =\r\nreflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you=\r\n cannot see it. \n=C2=A0 \nWe do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really =\r\nis. He may not be just a paramahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, but be a siddh=\r\na or a natha or even a rishi. He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself =\r\nsaid and some religious experts of that time declared based on various sign=\r\ns. If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda e=\r\ntc can definitely be rishis or naths in Vimalananda&#39;s scale. If your argume=\r\nnt is that they cannot be because they did not demonstrate siddhis compatib=\r\nle with that status, that is a non-point as I explained above. The disagree=\r\nment between then boils down a difference in the relevance and importance o=\r\nf externally demonstrated siddhis. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nWhy thi=\r\ns is relevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to hav=\r\ne misconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing =\r\nmiracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. \n=C2=A0 \nVasishtha =\r\nis not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught Lord=\r\n Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will=\r\n balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis=\r\n are neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don&#39;t be distra=\r\ncted by them or be infatuated with them. \n=C2=A0 \nThe goal of sadhana is th=\r\nat your notions of &quot;this is I and these are mine&quot; get subtler and subtler a=\r\nnd hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and weaker. Others ma=\r\ny or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you know your prog=\r\nress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no relevanc=\r\ne or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your sadhana. \n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nBest regards, \nNarasimha \n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- \n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings, \n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana: \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom \n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @h=\r\nomam108 \n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n- \n=C2=A0 \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;=\r\n wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a long friendly ;-) exchange=\r\n between Rajarshi and me on Friday \n&gt; (July 29) on twitter on measuring spi=\r\nritual caliber. This came from the \n&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s comments on the=\r\n &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding their attit=\r\nude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and said their sp=\r\niritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was 2 power 1=\r\n6. He also talked about \n&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by =\r\nV. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of musings on that. \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------=\r\n------------ \n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here are a few =\r\ncomments on your statements a couple of days \n&gt; back on Twitter comparing s=\r\npiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, rose, jas=\r\nmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n&gt; which is a better flower. They have =\r\ndifferent properties like color, \n&gt; size, shape, number of petals, type/int=\r\nensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; values depend on the purpose and they cann=\r\not be quantified universally. \n&gt; How can any sane person then say that spir=\r\nitual caliber of different \n&gt; people can be compared and quanitified? The f=\r\nield of duality has \n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi ha=\r\ns infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a=\r\n person as one \n&gt; number and compare them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even attempts t=\r\no understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; Rishi),=\r\n please note that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for deities =\r\nalso. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; where Vishnu is supreme. Some=\r\n consider a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some consider a=\r\n hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None of them i=\r\ns absolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; and for specific purposes, i.e. fro=\r\nm a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; people who take them as absolute and=\r\n argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so and so th=\r\ning taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; know that none of the hierarchies is ab=\r\nsolute. \n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare the wisdo=\r\nm of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakris=\r\nhna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi =\r\nSai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya,=\r\n \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath \n&gt; =\r\nMaharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, \n&gt; i=\r\ns a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific \n&gt; limite=\r\nd perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n&gt; another=\r\n Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n&gt; on. You=\r\n cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n&gt; You shoul=\r\nd just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n&gt; of them th=\r\nat you like the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from specific=\r\n perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, his words should make one realize that t=\r\nhere is always \n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery=\r\n over the field \n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One should neve=\r\nr rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and s=\r\ntarting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statem=\r\nents like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and =\r\nthinking \n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed=\r\n to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even i=\r\nf Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume \n&gt; that y=\r\nou can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramakrishna wa=\r\ns popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per Vimalanan=\r\nda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or may be a =\r\ndeity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; the details=\r\n we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; stature based =\r\non his own classification? \n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each di=\r\nsciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably=\r\n made this statement based on \n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimalananda. Fo=\r\nr the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he was a real =\r\nperson or an imagined \n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!=\r\n) left the latter \n&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book! \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a \n&gt; simple=\r\nr definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \n&gt; one&#39;s &quot;sp=\r\niritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; told Abhed=\r\nananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \n&gt; back, but=\r\n he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \n&gt; one more bi=\r\nrth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; the other h=\r\nand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \n&gt; waiting fo=\r\nr him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; Abhedanand=\r\na alone is superior to Vimalananda! \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that this is j=\r\nust one definition. One can have many \n&gt; definitions. The key is not to jum=\r\np to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is weightier =\r\nthan Y and so what he said must \n&gt; be more correct&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; People with lops=\r\nided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \n&gt; to be absolute =\r\nand jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \n&gt; are doing the sa=\r\nme now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t fall int=\r\no the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n&gt; absolute. Written words a=\r\nre always relative and never absolute. \n&gt; Discriminate relative knowledge u=\r\nsing intellect at first and hopefully \n&gt; using experencial realization late=\r\nr on. \n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, =\r\nwe should \n&gt; not commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments =\r\nof greats \n&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more th=\r\nan us. \n&gt; ------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, \n&gt; Narasimha =\r\n\n \r\n--0-1652936880-1312424755=:76107\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste,&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since these discussions c=\r\nentered a lot on Swami Vivekananda and siddhis...here is what he had to say=\r\n about them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&quot; &lt;/span&gt;Al=\r\nl powers and all  purity and all greatness =E2=80=94 everything is in the \n=\r\nsoul.

In fact, did Vimalana=\r\nnda *explicitly* write that\n Ramakrishna is only a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; and not a =\r\nsiddha or a natha or a rishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or natha or s=\r\niddha or paramahamsa, and so on? In my case, my statement above is explicit=\r\nly and unambiguously stated by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda&#39;s questi=\r\non &quot;will siddhis help me in god realization&quot; in the negative, Ramakrishna a=\r\nlso affirmed this teaching of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentially refers to=\r\n the same thing in Bhagavad Gita when he talks about seeking small things f=\r\nrom demigods vs seeking &quot;me&quot; (Self). Vaishtha&#39;s words, however, are the cle=\r\narest and most unambiguous. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEF=\r\nT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Yoga Vaasishtham was=\r\n taught by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the presence of Vishwamitra and other =\r\ngreat sages and recorded by Valmiki. It is the highest watermark of spiritu=\r\nal knowledge. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div\n align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font colo=\r\nr=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Aghora series is nice, but can gi=\r\nve wrong notions to some who may tend to be fascinated by external miracles=\r\n. I have no doubt that Vimalananda had no confusions himself, but some peop=\r\nle reading those books can form misconceptions (though it is still ok if th=\r\nat makes them do sadhana. The only problem is if they start doing the bad k=\r\narma of making negative judgments on greats thinking they are blindly follo=\r\nwing Vimalananda). It is a good idea to balance the perspective with some V=\r\nedantic understanding such as Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad Gita. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verd=\r\nana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; Infact it also violates a point which you yourself mad=\r\ne in an earlier mail.

Some keep tavelling on the road and accept only tho=\r\nse fruits that land in their lap by themselves. Some get distracted from th=\r\ne journey and pursue the fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neither nece=\r\nssary nor sufficient for reaching the top. Though having a fruit that is av=\r\nailable only at a very high altitude shows that one has reached great altit=\r\nude, it cannot be used as a measure of one&#39;s progress, for someone may have=\r\n climbed greater heights without collecting that (or any) fruit. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Ver=\r\ndana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;External and internal do NOT have a one-to-one corresponde=\r\nnce.
