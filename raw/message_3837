It =\r\nis the summit, accessible by a thorny path that has steps, slippery steps. =\r\nI have ascended them step by step, the hard way; but at every step I have e=\r\nxperienced God coming into my life and lifting me easily to the next step.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; My father was fond of ceremonial worship (puja) in which he was very r=\r\negular. To my child-mind, the image he worshipped was God; and I delighted =\r\nin helping father in the worship, by bringing him flowers and other article=\r\ns of worship. The deep inner satisfaction that he and I derived from such w=\r\norship implanted in my heart the deep conviction that God is in such images=\r\n devoutly worshipped by His devotees. Thus did God come into my life first =\r\nand placed my foot on the first rung of the ladder.\n&gt; \n&gt; Growing up\n&gt; \n&gt; As=\r\n an adult, I was fond of gymnastics and vigorous exercises. I learnt fencin=\r\ng from a teacher who belonged to a low caste; he was a harijan. I could go =\r\nto him only for a few days before I was made to understand that it was unbe=\r\ncoming of a caste Brahman to play the student to an untouchable. I thought =\r\ndeeply over the matter. One moment I felt that the God whom we all worshipp=\r\ned in the image in my father&#39;s puja-room had jumped over to the heart of th=\r\nis untouchable. He was my guru, all right! So I immediately went to him wit=\r\nh flowers, sweets and cloth, and garlanded him, placed flowers at his feet =\r\nand prostrated myself before him. Thus did God come into my life to remove =\r\nthe veil of caste-distinctions.\n&gt; \n&gt; How very valuable this step was I coul=\r\nd realize very soon after this: for I was to enter the medical profession a=\r\nnd serve all, and the persistence of caste-distinction would have made that=\r\n service a mockery. With this mist cleared by the light of God, it was easy=\r\n and natural for me to serve everyone. I took very keen delight in every ki=\r\nnd of service connected with healing and alleviation of human misery. If th=\r\nere was a good prescription for malaria, I felt that the whole world should=\r\n know it the next moment. Any knowledge about the prevention of diseases, p=\r\nromotion of health and healing of diseases, I was eager to acquire and shar=\r\ne with all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then, God came into my life in the form of the sick in Mal=\r\naya. It is difficult for me now to single out any instance; and perhaps it =\r\nis unnecessary. Time and space are concepts of the mind and have no meaning=\r\n in God. I can look back now upon the whole period of my stay in Malaya as =\r\na single event in which God came to me in the form of the sick and the suff=\r\nering. People are sick physically and mentally. To some, life is lingering =\r\ndeath; and to some others, death is more welcome than life. Some lead a mis=\r\nerable life, unable to face death; some invite death and commit suicide, un=\r\nable to face life. The aspiration grew within me that if God had not made t=\r\nhis world merely as a hell where wicked people would be thrown, to suffer, =\r\nand if there is (as I intuitively felt there should be) something other tha=\r\nn this misery and this helpless existence, it should be known and experienc=\r\ned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Conscious search for God\n&gt; \n&gt; It was at this crucial point in my l=\r\nife that God came to me as a religious mendicant who gave me the first less=\r\non in Vedanta. The positive aspects of life here, and real end and aim of h=\r\numan life, were made apparent. This drew me from Malaya to the Himalaya. Go=\r\nd came to me in the form of all-consuming aspiration to realize Him as the =\r\nSelf of all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meditation and service went on apace; and with them came =\r\nvarious spiritual experiences. The body, mind and intellect, as the limitin=\r\ng adjuncts, vanished; and the whole universe shone as His Light. God then c=\r\name in the form of this Light in which everything assumed a divine shape; a=\r\nnd pain and suffering, that seem to haunt everybody, appeared to be a mirag=\r\ne, the illusion that ignorance creates, on account of low sensual appetites=\r\n that lurk in man.\n&gt; \n&gt; One more milestone had to be passed in order to kno=\r\nw &quot;Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma.&quot; Early in 1950 (on the 8th Jan.) God came to me=\r\n in the form of a half-demented assailant, who disturbed the night satsanga=\r\n at the ashram. His attempt failed. I bowed to him, worshipped him and sent=\r\n him home. Evil exists to glorify the good! Evil is a superficial appearanc=\r\ne; beneath its veil, the one Self shines in all.\n&gt; \n&gt; A noteworthy fact oug=\r\nht to be mentioned here. In this evolution nothing gained previously is ent=\r\nirely discarded at any later stage. One coalesced into the next; and the Yo=\r\nga of Synthesis was the fruit. Murti-puja, selfless service of the sick, me=\r\nditation, the cultivation of cosmic love that transcended the barriers of c=\r\naste, creed and religion, with the ultimate aim of attaining Cosmic Conscio=\r\nusness, was revealed. This knowledge had immediately to be shared. All this=\r\n had become an integral part of my being.\n&gt; \n&gt; The mission had been gatheri=\r\nng strength and spreading. It was in 1950 that I undertook the All-India To=\r\nur. Then God came to me in His virat-svarupa, multitudes of devotees, eager=\r\n to listen to the tenets of divine life. At every centre I felt that God sp=\r\noke through me, and He Himself in His virat-form spread out before me as th=\r\ne multitude, listened to me. He sang with me; He prayed with me; He spoke a=\r\nnd He listened. Sarvam Khalvidam Brahma.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
