But please note that it was *Jarasandh* who \nattacked.\n\nIn the case of the debate in question, it was agreed to by *both* the sides, \npre-planned as a mega event, rules were laid out, it was advertized well and \n50,000 people showed up! Many more must have watched it.\n\nZakir Naik is someone who claimed *on TV* that 9/11 was an insider&#39;s job \ndone by George Bush himself so that Bush could then attack oil-rich \ncountries. When he was visiting Cardiff, Welsh MP David Davies described him \nas a &quot;hate-monger&quot; and said his views did not deserve a &quot;public platform&quot;. \nKhushwant Singh, a highly prominent Indian journalist, used the word to \n&quot;&quot;juvenile&quot; to describe Naik&#39;s arguments and said that &quot;they seldom rise \nabove the level of undergraduate college debates, where contestants vie with \neach other to score brownie points&quot;. When Dr Naik offered to engage in a \nlive public debate with Pope Benedict XVI, the Pope ignored him and did not \neven dignify him with a response. This is the kind of opponent we are \ntalking about.\n\nWhen a person like this wants to debate one on religion, one should ideally \nignore him. If one actually engages him, one should tear him to pieces and \nput him in his place, which is quite possible to do without stooping down or \nlosing one&#39;s class. At the very least, one should hold one&#39;s own. Sri Sri \nwas like a fish of out water, came across as being clueless, did not even \nutilize all of his allotted time, and allowed himself to be destroyed by the \nruthless Dr Naik. He cut a sorry figure. If Dr Naik later shot up to Number \n3 on the Indian Express list of &quot;Top 10 Spiritual Gurus of India&quot;, it was \nmost probably due to the debate with Sri Sri. I am not saying these ratings \nmatter, but the bottomline is that Sri Sri&#39;s utter failure in the debate \nincreased following for a person with crazy and fanatical views (e.g. see \nabove), who misunderstands sanatana dharma and yet puts it down very \nemphatically and enthusiastically. And this debate was not forced on Sri \nSri, but he pre-agreed and they pre-planned this as a mega event!\n\nYes, an avatar may choose to lose if it is necessary for a larger purpose in \nthe leela as you said, but I fail to see any &quot;larger purpose&quot; in this thing \nyet.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; In hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an \n&gt; intellectual\n&gt; explanation for something that I myself have not yet intellectually \n&gt; understood.\n\nThanks for admitting that you yourself have not yet intellectually \nunderstood it!\n\nBecause of your *faith* that Sri Sri is a yogi in &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot;, you \nbelieve that there must be some higher purpose served by this action of his. \nI respect your faith. Faith not supported by logic and intellectual \nunderstanding cannot be discussed further. As you believe, Sri Sri may \nindeed be someone in &quot;sahaja samadhi&quot; and there may be a higher purpose to \nbe served by his action. But there are other possibilities as well.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBottomline is that we are discussing things intellectually when we use \nvaikhari (*tangible* words - written or spoken) to communicate. We are not \ncommunicating here using para or pasyanti or madhyama modes. Of course, even \nin the debate, Sri Sri and Dr Naik seemed to be using vaikhari only.\n\nSometimes, you see some great masters communicating at levels higher than \nvaikhari. There is something unsaid (para, pasyanti or madhyama) that lies \nbehind the said words (vaikhari) and gets into the mind of the listener and \ncreates an indelible effect on the mind. Swami Vivekananda&#39;s historic 1893 \nspeech at Chicago, for example, had a far more mesmerizing effect on the \naudience present there than you would expect those mere words to have. \nThough he was not in sahaja samadhi at that stage, he had a high level of \nrealization. Moreover, he accumulated shakti by controlling his mind from \ndesires, attachments, likes, dislikes and shadripus for several years. He \nalso received the shakti accumulated likewise by his master, before the \nlatter left body. Due to all that shakti, his thoughts directly touched the \nminds of people around him.\n\nIf master debaters like Swami Vivekananda or Aadi Shankara had debated \nsomeone of the stature of Dr Naik, I can imagine what they would have done.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;schinnas&quot; &lt;schinnas@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, November 18, 2009 5:50 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: AOL: Seamless blend of Raja, Karma, Bhakti and \nGnana Yogas\n\n\nDear Shri. Narasimha,\n    I was giving an explanation from my understanding, but it was still at \nmy mental level. The actions of an englightened master established in Sahaja \nSamadhi does not need to satisfy our mental concepts of how things should \nbe.\n\n For example, when Sri Krishna - an Avatar of the highest order, ran away \nfrom the battlefield when Jarasandh attacked Mathura instead of fighting and \ndefeating Jarasandh. Sri Krishna himself years later would advice Arjuna \nagainst dropping arms in a fight. Can we give a satisfying intellectual \nanswer to it if people raise questions?\n\nSri Aurobindo gave a beautiful explanation about it. It was something like: \nIf Krishna were constrained to win all times, that would be a limitation in \nitself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is necessary for a larger and \nmore complete victory in the scheme of the lela. You ofcourse have to read \nthe original to get his exact words.. I read it long ago.\n\nAnother instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and beat up Ramana \nMaharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram. Ramana Maharishi bore it \nwith equanimity. Sri Ramana was the Spiritual head of the Ashram and one can \nintellectually argue that it was his dharma to protect the ashram and \ninmates from the thieves.\n\nBesides, there were certain things that I did not want to put in an public \nemail.\n\nSome clues - AOL silverjubilee with over 2 million people meditating and \ndoing sudarhsn Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006. There were \nseveral threats from certain militants from one community about planting \nbombs or disrupting it in other ways police security provided was not \nsufficient for that sized gathering.\n\nThe concerned debate where lot of SIMI members were among the participants \nhappened few weeks earlier on Jan 21, 2006.\n\nSome people believe Sri Sri&#39;s presence in the event changed the heart of \nsome miscreants.\n\nMany does not know that Sri Sri had cancelled meetings with the future head \nof state of a superpower few minutes before the meeting was to happen. \nSometimes he attends some events which cannot be explained logically by his \ndisciples such as the debate with Zakir Naik. The beauty about an \nenlightened Master living in Sahaja Samadhi is that we cannot contain them \nin our mind. They operate from a plane of consciousness that is much higher.\n\nAs the Mother would say if something is beyond our mental understanding, we \ncan maintain a respectable silence about it.\n\nI do not expect my answers to satisfy all the questions. I feel I have said \neverything I had to say.\n\nIn hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give an \nintellectual explanation for something that I myself have not yet \nintellectually understood.\n\nI did want to object to some statements saying Sri Sri did not know what do \nsay or was confused. It was a judgement of those without any knowledge or \nunderstanding of Sri Sri, just as someone who does not understand Sri \nKrishna might judge him differently for several of His acts which could not \nbe intellectually explained. Having observed him in person with questions \nseveral times tricker than what Zakir Naik said, I can confidently say that \nit was not true.\n\nBest regards,\n-Siva.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt;\n&gt; Respectfully, I want to offer a different perspective.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth!\n&gt;\n&gt; If he &quot;never debates on Truth&quot;, why did he agree to take part in the \n&gt; debate?\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show the way\n&gt; &gt; to Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in\n&gt; &gt; anything else.\n&gt;\n&gt; One can &quot;show the way to Realization of Truth to those that are ready&quot; \n&gt; without accepting to take part in a debate like that!\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart\n&gt; &gt; of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and\n&gt; &gt; let it pass, however big the occasion may be.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one answers only when there is &quot;sincerity in the heart of the \n&gt; questioner&quot;, why would one then agree to debate a ruthless debater who is \n&gt; known to not have &quot;sincerity in the heart&quot; and who only wants to \n&gt; ruthlessly destroy the views of opponents? After all, opponent in a debate \n&gt; is different from a &quot;questioner&quot; or a disciple seeking spiritual \n&gt; direction.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot;\n&gt; &gt; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of\n&gt; &gt; discussion.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a yogi has such stature, one can do &quot;justice to the topic&quot; without even \n&gt; taking part in the debate and just by being oneself.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; When people of little or no understanding were debating Truth/God and \n&gt; misleading the world, great teachers in the past stepped in and directed \n&gt; the debate in the right direction, whether it is rishis or recently Aadi \n&gt; Shankaracharya or Swami Vivekananda. They had the knack of steering the \n&gt; debate in a direction that they wanted - a direction that would help \n&gt; establish sanatana dharma. They did not tolerate adharma and ignorance \n&gt; with &quot;polite words&quot;. They destroyed adharma and ignorance with the sword \n&gt; of detached, and yet firm, actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Fighting with hatred or anger or agitation in the heart is bad. But, \n&gt; fighting with a calm and equanimous mind is completely saattwik.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;schinnas&quot; &lt;schinnas@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt;    Very good question. In fact, this is a question that was raised by \n&gt; &gt; disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know him. In fact, if one \n&gt; &gt; looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that somebody like Sri \n&gt; &gt; Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an \n&gt; &gt; authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who \n&gt; &gt; recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody \n&gt; &gt; teaching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various forums \n&gt; &gt; across the world on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining \n&gt; &gt; some simple questions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To \n&gt; &gt; him Truth / God is not an article of debate. He can show the way to \n&gt; &gt; Realization of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in \n&gt; &gt; anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity in the heart of \n&gt; &gt; the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words and let it \n&gt; &gt; pass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the questions that were \n&gt; &gt; raised in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in his \n&gt; &gt; various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The \n&gt; &gt; topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and \n&gt; &gt; Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment \n&gt; &gt; of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those \n&gt; &gt; that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would have \n&gt; &gt; benefited.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, \n&gt; &gt; especially those among us that are intellectually curious about \n&gt; &gt; spirituality than practicing it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge \n&gt; &gt; later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big congregation of \n&gt; &gt; thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say very simple things or \n&gt; &gt; share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence would convey what \n&gt; &gt; needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master may not be \n&gt; &gt; interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept for \n&gt; &gt; another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence. \n&gt; &gt; A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are \n&gt; &gt; secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words is \n&gt; &gt; to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, \n&gt; &gt; there is no point in talking!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of \n&gt; &gt; a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely \n&gt; &gt; if we listen to them from our Being instead of our mind. In Sri \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable examples of very simple people \n&gt; &gt; benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectuals would \n&gt; &gt; debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when \n&gt; &gt; he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance \n&gt; &gt; and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would \n&gt; &gt; have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an \n&gt; &gt; illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a \n&gt; &gt; fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous \n&gt; &gt; as it will become yet another mental concept and will actually be a \n&gt; &gt; hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dangerous \n&gt; &gt; hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, \n&gt; &gt; etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail. However I have one issue with Sri Ravishankar. Why did he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accept to debate the infamous Zakir Naik on Hinduism? Sri Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ravishankar maybe an enlightened master but he just cannot debate. If \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you see the vedios of that debate that happened a couple of years \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back, you will find Sri Ravishanker utterly clueless on stage, not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; knowing what and how to counter the polemical queries of the Zakir \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Naik.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now when Sri Sri choses to accept an offer to debate Naik on stage, he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; does not� go there merely in his� own capacity but as a representative \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the religion - Hinduism. And when he fails miserably on stage, it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; becomes shameful to watch for hindus.

Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a disciple and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few things to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blissful. That does not make it in any way inferior to paths of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practices of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commentary on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available commentary on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for those that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every step of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some in person and several via various other ways. However, to get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guide disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogis of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness at will during meditation. They may be not fully \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doubt them when they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum number of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to follow the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that no deserving person should be denied a course because they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people took \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n\n\n"}}
