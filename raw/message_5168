So I have no comment.\n\n2) I am not awar=\r\ne of this view and practice.\n\nGoddess Swaahaa being the shakti of Agni, Agn=\r\ni acts through swaahaa. Whenever we use Agni for a work (e.g. carrying an o=\r\nblation to Savita or some other deity), it is a good idea to think of Agni&#39;=\r\ns shakti. So adding swaahaa at the end of mantras is customary.\n\nHowever, i=\r\ndeally speaking, even if you just say a mantra without swaahaa and make an =\r\noffering, but having the mental intention that Agni should carry that oblat=\r\nion to a deity, won&#39;t Agni know it and act on it? If you do not specificall=\r\ny say the name of Swaahaa devi, won&#39;t Agni&#39;s shakti be invoked?\n\nSo, some p=\r\neople may advocate skipping swaahaa at the end of some Veda mantras, so tha=\r\nt those who are not comfortable with the rules may use wrong intonation on =\r\nthe last syllable. After all, if you add &quot;swaahaa&quot; to a Veda mantra, the in=\r\ntonation of the last syllables may have to change accordingly and some peop=\r\nle may not know. Instead of explicitly acknowledging Mother Swaahaa and mes=\r\nsing up the intonation of the Veda mantra, some may think it better to not =\r\nexplicitly acknowledge Mother Swaahaa and be safe with the intonation.\n\n3) =\r\nNever worry about offending me and feel free to be frank. Learned persons l=\r\nike you are always humble and have saattwik intentions.\n\nGenerally speaking=\r\n, Ganapathi atharvaseersham, Narayana sooktam, Chandipath, Savitru Gayatri =\r\nmantra etc are all very similar in spirit and essence, but there are subtle=\r\n differences.\n\nGayatri mantra stresses the absolute Truth that all is supre=\r\nme consciousness. Chandipath stresses that all is supreme consciousness man=\r\nifesting as various beings and things (&quot;aham vibhutyaa bahubhiriha rUpairya=\r\ndA sthitA&quot;), but also acknowledges that there is doubt regarding that and e=\r\nxplains how that doubt is overcome. Gayatri mantra is about the end target =\r\nand Chandipath is about the end target and also a path to it.\n\nCertain sadh=\r\nanas like Chandi homam can clear the undesired conditioning powerfully and =\r\nmaximize one&#39;s experience with various other mantras.\n\nEven with various im=\r\npurities in one&#39;s consciousness, one may be able to experience *something* =\r\nwith Gayatri mantra japam (or some other such staple mantra) and that can b=\r\ne enough to *sustain* one&#39;s spiritual life. However, Chandi homam can clear=\r\n the impurities further and help one experience higher. One with weak diges=\r\ntion may eat a sumptuous food item and digest it reasonably, but, if the sa=\r\nme person takes herbs that improve one&#39;s digestion, one can digest better.\n=\r\n\nWe are living in deeply polluted times, both materially and spiritually. T=\r\nhere are negative influences all around us. It is very difficult to remain =\r\nfree from them. If one is capable of handling sadhana of an ugra devata suc=\r\nh as Chandi, it can help in accelerating one&#39;s spiritual progress.\n\nOf cour=\r\nse, sadhana of any deity will help eventually in cleansing one&#39;s consciousn=\r\ness. One should in the end feel comfortable with the sadhana one does and f=\r\neel some attachment.\n\nBest regards\nNarasimha\n------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http:=\r\n//SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Dear Naras=\r\nimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have a couple of doubts regarding the gAyatrI mantra and homam=\r\n.\n&gt; Since you have previously written about having performed homam with\n&gt; t=\r\nhis mantra for several months, I hope that you can guide me with my\n&gt; upAsa=\r\nnA.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) nichRd-gAyatrI vs. gAyatrI -- In the book &quot;gAyatrI-bhAShyam&quot; by=\r\n\n&gt; Ganapati Sastri, he opines that the nichRd-gAyatrI is used only for\n&gt; ja=\r\npa, and &quot;Nya&quot; is to be extended to &quot;Niya&quot; in homam etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) svAhA -- In=\r\n another book, Mutthu Shroutigal says that the\n&gt; svAhA-kAra is to be exclud=\r\ned -- pratyekam [Ahutim] gAyatryA agnau\n&gt; AdadhyAt (AdadhyAt iti vacanAt na=\r\n svAhAkAraH).
