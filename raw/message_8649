I think you are treating him as Spiritual Consultant. \nA=\r\nnyway, as Narasimha ji has said it is finally individual preference. So eve=\r\nn he try out on request, what do you expect him to say one is 80% effective=\r\n, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this is my comparative ju=\r\ndgment but it may be different for you.=C2=A0 So best you try out and read =\r\nhis post on spiritual progress and judge what works better for you, or you =\r\nwant both. \nNow on my experience, I learnt SK in 2002 and within 25 days le=\r\narnt PS. =C2=A0I have practiced both regularly for 1 years and SK alone for=\r\n 7 years. I have done Advance course 8 times. Also have listen Narad Bhakti=\r\n Sutra, Astavakra Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL service is considere=\r\nd very important part, I had also done lots of volunteering activities in A=\r\nOL including being Administrator for Primary School. Since 2009, I have sto=\r\npped practicing SK, as I felt that I after initial couple of years of progr=\r\ness, I did not find progressing much on spiritual level. I found really hel=\r\npful in stress relief and mental calmness, but considered commodity/retail =\r\nspirituality. \nNow from last 10 months, by taking Ganapathi as Guru, I have=\r\n started doing japa every day and homam every weekend. I have not spent equ=\r\nal amount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you comparison. Yes, i=\r\nt will take longer than SK to master the technique, and initially mind is m=\r\nore occupied in maintaining the fire. \nSo can only say, if you like in the =\r\nreasoning and explanation of Narasimha ji, better try yourself and see how =\r\nyou feel. Anyway, AoL also teaches Agnihotra, and also homam in their Veda =\r\nschool. During Navaratri in Bangalore ashram there are all the homam done. =\r\nSo =C2=A0Homam is not contradiction to AOL. \nHope this helps. \nRegards, \nMi=\r\nhir. --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Guruji,\n&gt; I consider you as my Guru as you are the one=\r\n of the 4\n&gt; prominent people who have influenced & inspired me on spiritual=\r\n path(whatever\n&gt; little I do) & I find your explanations\n&gt; very very convin=\r\ncing.

So even he try out on request, what do you expect him to say one is=\r\n 80% effective, same, or 110% effective. He will still say that this is my =\r\ncomparative judgment but it may be different for you.&lt;span&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;So=\r\n best you try out and read his post on spiritual progress and judge what wo=\r\nrks better for you, or you want both.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv926=\r\n895155MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;Now on my experien=\r\nce, I learnt SK in 2002 and within 25 days learnt PS. &lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;I =\r\nhave practiced both regularly for 1 years and SK alone for 7 years. I have =\r\ndone Advance course 8 times. Also have listen Narad Bhakti Sutra, Astavakra=\r\n Geeta etc. As you mentioned that AOL service is considered very important =\r\npart, I had also done lots of volunteering activities in AOL including bein=\r\ng Administrator for Primary School. Since 2009, I have stopped practicing S=\r\nK, as I felt that I after initial couple of years of progress, I did not fi=\r\nnd progressing much on spiritual level. I found really helpful in stress re=\r\nlief and mental calmness, but considered commodity/retail spirituality.&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv926895155MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;Now from last 10 months, by taking Ganapathi as Guru, I hav=\r\ne started doing japa every day and homam every weekend. I have not spent eq=\r\nual amount of time in Homam as in SK practice to give you comparison. Yes, =\r\nit will take longer than SK to master the technique, and initially mind is =\r\nmore occupied in maintaining the fire.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv92=\r\n6895155MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;So can only say, =\r\nif you like in the reasoning and explanation of Narasimha ji, better try yo=\r\nurself and see how you feel. Anyway, AoL also teaches Agnihotra, and also h=\r\nomam in their Veda school. During Navaratri in Bangalore ashram there are a=\r\nll the homam done. So &lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Homam is not contradiction to AOL.=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv926895155MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;Hope this helps.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv9268=\r\n95155MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Calibri&quot;&gt;Regards,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;p class=3D&quot;yiv926895155MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;=\r\nCalibri&quot;&gt;Mihir.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vina=\r\nyak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste Guruji,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; I consider you as my Guru as you are the one of the 4&lt;br&gt;&gt; prom=\r\ninent people who have influenced &amp; inspired me on spiritual path(whatev=\r\ner&lt;br&gt;&gt; little I do) &amp; I find your explanations&lt;br&gt;&gt; very very co=\r\nnvincing.
