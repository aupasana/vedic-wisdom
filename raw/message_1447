Apaana is the downward force. When one attains a perfect focus on a ma=\r\nntra and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from lungs/stoma=\r\nch and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana combine, they can move =\r\nupward at a rapid speed.\n \nWhen praana and apaana combine for the first tim=\r\ne, it may feel like an explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will fe=\r\nel like one is freed from the body and one does not exist. This is similar =\r\nto death, except that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel=\r\n a kind of bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s foc=\r\nus on mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts an=\r\nalyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one becoming worrie=\r\nd and confused. So one should sustain the state where there is full focus o=\r\nn mantra and no other distractions, for as long as possible.\n \nThese things=\r\n happen automatically without thinking about them and engaging in any speci=\r\nfic practicies. In fact, thinking about them, desiring them and doing speci=\r\nfic practices may become an obstacle and delay things. If you surrender to =\r\na deity and do a mantra with a high level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT =\r\nrun after any experience and think of an experience as an end result. The f=\r\nocus should be mantra and mantra alone.\n \nEven when an experience occurs, I=\r\n tell people to not be tied to it and not think too much about it.\n \nSuchak=\r\na dream is a vision of something that is going to happen.\n \nBest regards,\nN=\r\narasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath=\r\n.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n =\r\n ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Tuesday, March 03, 2009 5:17 AM\n  Subject: Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Re: On Remedial Measures Difference (Re: Resolving Points)\n\n    =\r\n    Namaste\n\n        One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the ey=\r\nes.\n        A few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where t=\r\nhe deity possesses the sadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very qui=\r\nckly( Urdhwa Retas), \n        During all meditation the sadhaka sees the fe=\r\net or clothes or hands or face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along w=\r\nith minute details of the room (even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\n=\r\n        The sadhak typically becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.\n =\r\n       The whole day the sadhaka behaves like a love lorn person.

How can i again exper=\r\nience the Beloved.\n                      That then is the experience of man=\r\ntra when it is done correctly.\n                      When the sadhak&#39;s pers=\r\nonality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sa=\r\ndhak experiences himself as that Deity(Devata) .\n                      Ther=\r\ne then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain=\r\n thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that which appears=\r\n to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the per=\r\nson care almost for nothing himself, so self identification is minimised an=\r\nd the person&#39;s spiritual evolution continues.\n                      Remembe=\r\nr, there is very little according to me which is black magic. It is all a u=\r\nse of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand =\r\nChandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be that of God =\r\nhimself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the death of the body, such a sa=\r\ndhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni=\r\n goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings. \n                     =\r\n Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads of=\r\n the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( Patan c=\r\nomes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti causing =\r\nan earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here the=\r\nre is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, and yo=\r\nu will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to =\r\n10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with the =\r\nuniverse and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks you=\r\n, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie =\r\nGod or the universe).\n                      If people persist in using the =\r\nShakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shak=\r\nti which can be used, moreover then their minds and intellects will not be =\r\nfree of identification with the body and so their actions are those which a=\r\nre generally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same spir=\r\nits which they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experi=\r\nence.\n                      Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for=\r\n a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity =\r\nand such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of =\r\nhis previous effort).\n                      On the other hand somebody doin=\r\ng this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind =\r\nevery mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.\n            =\r\n          According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let=\r\n me suggest an easy sadhana.\n                      If one is so inclined, t=\r\nhen starting on some good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call =\r\nthis the Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constrain=\r\nts\n                      Same time every day.\n                      Same pl=\r\nace.\n                      Same materials.\n                      Same direc=\r\ntion.\n                      As little movement as one can.\n                =\r\n      Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n                 =\r\n     Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the bod=\r\ny), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n                      Do not eat 2 hr=\r\ns before you start, make sure your bowels are empty before you start.\n     =\r\n                 Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 t=\r\nimes.\n                      See the difference in your personality before a=\r\nnd after.\n                      Long and short , what is important is that =\r\nlife may be short, so do some sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as=\r\n long as is physically possible.\n                      I hope this clarifie=\r\ns some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n\n                      K=\r\nind Love and Regards\n                      manish\n                      You=\r\n may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you feel that this=\r\n is suitable.\n\n                      On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Naras=\r\nimha P.V.R.

If anyone has=\r\n said otherwise, I\n                        &gt; also disagee with him/her.\n\n  =\r\n                      I mentioned the above with respect to the need of tho=\r\nusands of mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god a=\r\nnd wants to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need f=\r\nor thousands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands=\r\n of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of diff=\r\nerent results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. Howe=\r\nver, this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I wil=\r\nl elaborate.\n\n                        Also, commanding god is NOT black mag=\r\nic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, which can be accomplished e=\r\nven by a person not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy e=\r\ngo. However, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a s=\r\npiritually elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding =\r\nthat I am referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist c=\r\nannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individua=\r\nl ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previou=\r\ns mail to clarify:\n\n                        The universe has many lokas (pl=\r\nanes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. There are infinite k=\r\narmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite p=\r\nossible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill i=\r\nt* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind=\r\n constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of s=\r\nelf-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of ene=\r\nrgy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes co=\r\nrresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmic inter=\r\nactions between various objects.\n\n                        Each set of &quot;karm=\r\nic interactions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are=\r\n for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra ful=\r\nly and getting a specific result from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god.=\r\n Whether you like the term or not, it is essentially that.\n\n               =\r\n         *        *        *\n\n                        But the bottomline is=\r\n this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific =\r\nresults from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting =\r\nas an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature=\r\n). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis ar=\r\ne meant for such sadhakas.\n\n                        Those are hardly of use=\r\n to so many people out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish resul=\r\nts. They cannot command specific results from god (because of their heavy a=\r\nttachment to the result, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a =\r\nlimited ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all=\r\n the associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with thes=\r\ne technicalities, they will be better off learning to be good beggars at Go=\r\nd&#39;s door.\n\n                        Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mant=\r\nra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so many technicalities, an=\r\nd learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for him to g=\r\nive you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he gives.\n=\r\n\n                        Keep praying every day or every second when you ar=\r\ne able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your actio=\r\nns. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it i=\r\ns his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly =\r\nthe dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is=\r\n faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekday=\r\n, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from quest=\r\nionable sources!).\n\n                        *        *        *\n\n          =\r\n              There may be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra) for =\r\nclimbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (different experience) =\r\non the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrolog=\r\ners) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery=\r\n (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped person without legs =\r\n(a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs =\r\nand one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (=\r\na reasonably detached person with very little ego).\n\n                      =\r\n  Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually climb the =\r\nmountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and traverse th=\r\ne long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are bogged=\r\n down by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantra advic=\r\ne from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by doing t=\r\nhat &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a powerful =\r\nmantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after* one su=\r\ncceeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a path l=\r\neading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particularly bea=\r\nutiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive the climb=\r\n along the long path.\n\n                        We need to emphasize the att=\r\nitude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the c=\r\nhoice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great=\r\n spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize p=\r\nicking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized ha=\r\nving the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, pers=\r\nistence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and us=\r\neful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and imp=\r\nress god.\n\n                        *        *        *\n\n                   =\r\n     &gt; when should the worship of a graha be done?

Parasara does not ment=\r\nion any day for doing homam to a graha.\n\n                        In fact, i=\r\nf one wants, one can do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every da=\r\ny. It is even better that way.\n\n                        If an astrologer su=\r\nggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is fine. But saying that doing it on so an=\r\nd so day will bring serious dangers because Mars is an enemy of so and so p=\r\nlanet would be stretching things.\n\n                        &gt; [Sanjay Rath:]=\r\n Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his\n              =\r\n          &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did =\r\nthey get it from?\n                         \n                        From Se=\r\nlf - from within.

Vara is also agni tattva among the panch=\r\nanga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi. Karma has been adv=\r\nised in the vaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora of the lords of the=\r\n rashi related to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting and other such karm=\r\na related to rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].=\r\n\n                        &gt; \n                        &gt; Moon is the significa=\r\ntor of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya manif=\r\nestation of everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the=\r\n karma associated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of se=\r\nlf punishment and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Ju=\r\nst as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related=\r\n to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the sufferin=\r\ng in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content =\r\nhas not been addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs and p=\r\neople find their partners, get married and get along with life. Proof lies =\r\nin the pudding and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL days a=\r\nnd have got result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why =\r\nfast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with th=\r\ne raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related to the material effe=\r\ncts of the bhava and that is what people are looking for when they come to =\r\nth astrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should =\r\nworship a female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fast=\r\ning. I wonder if they really follow this.\n                        &gt; \n      =\r\n                  &gt; Why not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun is al=\r\nways good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limited thi=\r\ns to day fasting and not night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This is my =\r\ninterpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have given long periods of fast=\r\n starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of child!=\r\n You think I should be doing that! You think anyone will lsiten.

Let=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s say Shiva wor=\r\nship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the Sun and is not worshi=\r\npped on Sundays but on Mondays.

I got into this thread because =\r\nstatements were made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a cha=\r\nrt can cause &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot; and &quot;danger to spouse&quot;, b=\r\nased on these far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.\n\n                    =\r\n    &gt; Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.\n\n          =\r\n              Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth a=\r\nnd arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/percepti on. That was meaningful. Now, you =\r\nassociated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri a=\r\nnd water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is really in line wi=\r\nth everything you have learnt (and taught).\n\n                        BTW, I=\r\n specifically asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your o=\r\nwn thinking or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full =\r\ncontext). Like so many times with similar questions I asked privately and r=\r\necently publicly, you did not respond.\n\n                        *        * =\r\n       *\n\n                        &gt; Statement 1 is an arrogance that the en=\r\ntire Jyotisha shastra is bogus\n                        &gt; and has no relevan=\r\nce as the remedial measures prescribed by\n                        &gt; Parasar=\r\na and others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and\n                =\r\n        &gt; not of much consequence.\n\n                        First of all, P=\r\narasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis based on=\r\n any arudhas or houses in a chart.\n\n                        For doshas in b=\r\nirth chart or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessi=\r\nngs of planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described h=\r\now to perform them. His section on remedial measures is full of various hom=\r\nas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am =\r\nin fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by the=\r\nmselves.\n\n                        Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or=\r\n tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for s=\r\npecific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tit=\r\nhi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not base=\r\nd on any house or arudha in the chart.\n\n                        Thus, the p=\r\nrinciples I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n\n                      =\r\n  Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complica=\r\nted principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scarin=\r\ng people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cause =\r\n&quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horo=\r\nscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There=\r\n may be a little difference between doing an austerity on different days, b=\r\nut my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doing =\r\nand not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause dang=\r\ner as being suggested.\n\n                        Third, our shastras primari=\r\nly talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the ene=\r\nrgy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekd=\r\nay or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irres=\r\npective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man co=\r\nmes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is b=\r\netter off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is =\r\nmore important.\n\n                        Choosing the day of a remedy based=\r\n on the deity is more important and the variations based on individual horo=\r\nscope are less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variation=\r\ns. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are actua=\r\nlly well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question ov=\r\ner-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable origi=\r\nn and scaring people on that basis.\n\n                        *        *    =\r\n    *\n\n                        &gt; Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entir=\r\ne mantra shastra is useless\n                        &gt; and the Rishi=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for\n       =\r\n                 &gt; the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishn=\r\nu or Hanuman\n                        &gt; when any one mantra would suffice. O=\r\nR it is like saying that we can\n                        &gt; take paracetamol =\r\nand pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to\n                      =\r\n  &gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic\n =\r\n                       &gt; seers.\n\n                        I did not say it i=\r\ns &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is limited and w=\r\ne should take our limitations into consideration.\n\n                        =\r\nThe universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings and man=\r\ny objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Ac=\r\ncordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfect=\r\nly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the m=\r\nantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantr=\r\na. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes inte=\r\nrnal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to=\r\n the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe=\r\n and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n\n          =\r\n              However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is =\r\nirrelevant to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to a=\r\nbsorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-=\r\nawareness is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such see=\r\nrs are extremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience=\r\n any mantra and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.\n\n    =\r\n                    *        *        *\n\n                        Just repea=\r\nting a combination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may t=\r\nhink that certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of =\r\ntimes. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickl=\r\ny and another may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. =\r\nAbsorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to reall=\r\ny work and it is much more difficult than one may think.\n\n                 =\r\n       *        *        *\n\n                        A highly learned schola=\r\nr in the court of a king may be able to command the king and get whatever h=\r\ne wants from king. An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather =\r\nthan trying to command (and failing for sure).\n\n                        Sim=\r\nilarly, most people are better off begging god for what they want rather th=\r\nan trying to use the right mantra to command what they want. A beggar does =\r\nnot need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of hu=\r\nmility and helplessness, surrender, patience and persistence are what help =\r\na beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. =\r\nIn this age and time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good beg=\r\ngar at god&#39;s door.\n\n                        What people today need for mate=\r\nrial and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better attitude =\r\nin begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras and oth=\r\ner specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result from g=\r\nod.\n\n                        It is worth noting that so many great spiritua=\r\nl teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking th=\r\ne right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the =\r\ncorrect attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, =\r\ndiscipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than tr=\r\nying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n\n =\r\n                       *        *        *\n\n                        One mor=\r\ne thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but the guidelines from rish=\r\nis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very li=\r\nmited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based on them. They use all =\r\nkinds of other rules coming from various traditions. They are not free from=\r\n corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associate various mantras wit=\r\nh various results, irrespective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of =\r\nwho is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Anga=\r\nraka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is ov=\r\nerplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guideli=\r\nnes.\n\n                        If one has a sadguru, I recommend following t=\r\nhe word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoretician.\n\n        =\r\n                If not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path. P=\r\nick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) ins=\r\ntead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter is =\r\nthe key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. Choi=\r\nce of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in being =\r\na really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great sch=\r\nolars.\n\n                        Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, pan=\r\nchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare kris=\r\nhna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra =\r\netc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without=\r\n the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n\n  =\r\n                      *        *        *\n\n                        I hope t=\r\nhis sufficiently clarifies my stand.

If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n       =\r\n                   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, a=\r\nnd gandanta may\n                          &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come=\r\n into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n                          &gt; \n     =\r\n                     &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and =\r\nnot that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n         =\r\n                 &gt; \n                          &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raas=\r\nhi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dv=\r\nadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n                =\r\n          &gt; \n                          &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the el=\r\nement of fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and one worships Go=\r\nuri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marr=\r\niage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by water elemen=\r\nt and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity an=\r\nd well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on th=\r\ne weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire element rep=\r\nresented by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n             =\r\n             &gt; \n                          &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya a=\r\nnd is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the crea=\r\ntor of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everything through the sha=\r\nkti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of=\r\n the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *mo=\r\nre correct* answer.\n                          &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n    =\r\n                      [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are rep=\r\nresented by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n\n         =\r\n                 Thus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the appar=\r\nent creator in the field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associa=\r\nted with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (percep=\r\ntion) should actually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, =\r\nthat is what we do in the tripod method in dasa judgment.\n\n                =\r\n          Thus, it is actually more logical to say that 12th house and 12th=\r\n lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tatt=\r\nva of Moon.\n\n                          Is the above &quot;*more correct* answer&quot;=\r\n based on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradition?\n\n   =\r\n                       &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n                        &gt;=\r\n The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more ef=\r\nfective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on =\r\ndigestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fa=\r\nst or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of=\r\n the mantra.\n                        &gt; \n                        &gt; [Sanjay R=\r\nath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best blessing for goo=\r\nd mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger ca=\r\nusing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct =\r\neating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than complete fasting.\n\n   =\r\n                     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n                        [Nara=\r\nsimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to expend some energy=\r\n on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bot=\r\ntomline is that shastras say that one should meditate either without or wit=\r\nh very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree th=\r\nat meditation sessions after heavy eating are heavily restrained in effecti=\r\nveness.\n\n                        &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n               =\r\n         &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts=\r\n is quite illogical.\n                        &gt; \n                        &gt; [=\r\nSanjay Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandant=\r\na =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burn=\r\ning match in a glass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra =\r\nganda between Kanya and Tula.\n\n                        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n                        [Narasimha] Putting a burning match in a glass=\r\n of water does indeed kill fire. But the question is of contact. If I am th=\r\ninking of fire in my mind while standing in water, it does not kill the fir=\r\ne. There is no contact.\n\n                        My point is that the examp=\r\nles given have no real identifiable contact between water and fire.\n\n      =\r\n                  One can be creative and come up with a lot of theories. F=\r\nor example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis s=\r\nhow agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and some as w=\r\nater rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause contact=\r\n between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of the di=\r\nspositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious danger.\n\n          =\r\n              It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what c=\r\nounts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolations.\n\n=\r\n                        &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n                        =\r\n&gt; Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told =\r\nme two years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it i=\r\ns getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyot=\r\nish is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different =\r\nlevels of their understanding and intelligence. \n\n                        &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n                        [Narasimha] Nothing is perm=\r\nanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be taken away. And one cannot cling on to what =\r\nis not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when it seems like something comes and cry when =\r\nit seems like something leaves. Some impassionately observe as things seem =\r\nto come and go and do what they see as their dharma with the things they se=\r\nem to have.\n\n                        Just a factual correction though\n     =\r\n                   : I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years af=\r\nter my spiritual master entered my life, my interest in other things went d=\r\nown (though I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadha=\r\nna intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However=\r\n, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Para=\r\nsara independently, meditate on them and share my interpretations with the =\r\nworld. He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and =\r\nhe wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and without an attachme=\r\nnt. He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants m=\r\ne to do it as an unattached karma. His word is everything for me.\n\n        =\r\n                What I told you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish =\r\nbut what I said above.\n\n                        However, if your judgment i=\r\ns correct and if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual gur=\r\nu will realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.\n\n          =\r\n              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n                        &gt; I can ca=\r\ntegorically declare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday =\r\nor tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that w=\r\neekday or tithi and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of t=\r\nhe day. You can take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of =\r\ntime (say, a few months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and ke=\r\nep the vrata for the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration=\r\n of the vrata, there is nothing like it!\n                        &gt; \n       =\r\n                 &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you se=\r\nem to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not=\r\n much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually benefici=\r\nal. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and s=\r\nhould choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are th=\r\ne same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few =\r\ndays, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you=\r\n did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you =\r\nare wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n\n                        =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n                        [Narasimha] This is a gros=\r\ns exaggeration.\n\n                        Is all that is being taught and pr=\r\nacticed now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the seers&quot;?\n\n    =\r\n                    I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of cour=\r\nse, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n\n  =\r\n                      To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo mi=\r\nlk or milk of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow doe=\r\ns make some difference. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;seri=\r\nous doshas&quot; (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong=\r\n choice is wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years=\r\n to make is also a gross exaggeration.\n\n                        The main th=\r\ning is that you need milk and sugar.
