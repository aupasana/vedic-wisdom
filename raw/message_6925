I have read all your post some back till 2003 also=\r\n. The evolution of your thoughts is very clearly visible esp in last 4-5mts=\r\n. \n\nThe intensity/regularity of your sadhana is also well documented from 1=\r\n08 names of laxmi every friday to laxmi homam to chandi homam. my sincere r=\r\nespect and gratitude for sharing your experience and thoughts.\n\n\n\n&gt; (1) Ver=\r\ny likely, one is carrying really serious karmas and was destined to experie=\r\nnce the setbacks during that period anyway. Homam (or other sadhana) made i=\r\nt better, though one has no way of confirming it.\n\n\nIn her case i strongly =\r\nsuspect dasha/period related major illness as it seems she had been doing h=\r\nomams for last 1.5yrs. \n\nI will urge priya to send her dob,time,place also =\r\nto you and will appreciate if you can see the dasha/period related situatio=\r\nn.\n\n\nIf this is not the reason then i will have to accept your choice (c) d=\r\niety coming close to test faith. but this doesn&#39;t make sense \n1. narayan/Vi=\r\nshnu creates maya and one tries to approach him he tests him thoroughly, wh=\r\ny? \n2. i have never read any negative experience in your case or manish&#39;s c=\r\nase. so i doubt the option (c) as you guys have done lot of sadhana.\n\n\nI wa=\r\ns under impression that setbacks can happen only in the initial period and =\r\nnot after 1.5yrs. needless to say i am a bit surprised.\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am also waiting PVRs reply. In any case take his word=\r\ns as final \n&gt; &gt; words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, take nobody&#39;s words as &quot;final words&quot;.=\r\n Only god can have the \n&gt; final words.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If one=\r\n is experiencing material setbacks while doing homam, there are a \n&gt; few po=\r\nssibilities:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Very likely, one is carrying really serious karmas an=\r\nd was destined \n&gt; to experience the setbacks during that period anyway. Hom=\r\nam (or other \n&gt; sadhana) made it better, though one has no way of confirmin=\r\ng it.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) One is using some wrong materials, e.g. black pepper, mustar=\r\nd seeds, \n&gt; chillies etc. It could also be correct materials, but with corr=\r\nption, \n&gt; e.g. some sesame seeds or grains with dirt in them, coconut/wood =\r\nwith \n&gt; insects in them, etc. If one is doing a sattwik homam for spiritual=\r\n \n&gt; progress, these things are tolerated. But, if one is doing with some \n&gt;=\r\n desires and expectations (conscious/sub-conscious), then material errors \n=\r\n&gt; can have material consequences. This is why I keep emphasizing on \n&gt; devo=\r\ntion, surrender etc. With surrender and devotion, material errors \n&gt; lose t=\r\nheir significance.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Deity is coming close to a person and testing t=\r\nhe person&#39;s faith \n&gt; thoroughly. If this is the case, there can be serious =\r\nproblems, but the \n&gt; person&#39;s life is transformed after the person succeeds=\r\n in keeping the \n&gt; faith.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one cannot withstand the testing, one can=\r\n consider a different deity. \n&gt; As pointed out earlier and below, Ganapathi=\r\n homam is one ritual that \n&gt; balances the material and spiritual needs. One=\r\n makes spiritual progress \n&gt; without destabilizing the material life. For m=\r\nost people, Ganapathi \n&gt; homam is appropriate for atleast a few months in t=\r\nhe beginning.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortyunately, one cannot tell=\r\n exactly what is going on. Just to be \n&gt; sure, send me a private mail with =\r\nthe list of materials you are \n&gt; offering. Also, if someone can videotape t=\r\nhe homam that you do and you \n&gt; can mail me the video, I can take a look at=\r\n it and see if there is any \n&gt; gross procedural error.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;      =\r\n              http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ---------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Jul=\r\n 19, 2011 at 10:57 AM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hi Priya,\n&gt; \n&gt; Note =\r\n- giving my 2 cents since similar thing happened to me also.

In any case take his words as final words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similar =\r\nkind of unfortunate thing happened to me also after doing 21 \n&gt; vishnu saha=\r\nstranaam homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; I strongly believe that getting inspired by PVR we hav=\r\ne in a way jump \n&gt; started the spiritual side by doing homams. (They are po=\r\nwerful) PVR had \n&gt; already lot of sadhana (i believe for 4-5yrs) before he =\r\nmet his guru and \n&gt; started with homams.\n&gt; \n&gt; Noone knows the exact theory =\r\nand i beleive that such things are not in \n&gt; ones chart also. Even i was wo=\r\nrried like you to get my chart analysed \n&gt; and know the reason but 3-4 astr=\r\nologers couldnt tell me the reason. i \n&gt; came to understand that chart is a=\r\n map not a territory.\n&gt; \n&gt; PVR also has mentioned that its better if people=\r\n do Ganapti homam for \n&gt; first 2-3 months. I will request PVR to add this i=\r\nnformation in each and \n&gt; every manual and also to suggest some non homam s=\r\nadhana of ganapati so \n&gt; that people who are eager to start their journey c=\r\nan have a beautiful \n&gt; start to their sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Priya, you can stop the=\r\n homams and get confortable and confident first. \n&gt; Dont attach any guilt t=\r\no not doing homams. No god is out there to punish \n&gt; you, its just that kar=\r\nmas are extremely complex. Its better to start \n&gt; with ganapati to remove a=\r\nll obstacles first.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can strongly suggest few ganapati sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n1. Ganapati Homam\n&gt; (This is no doubt very powerful and i suggest this one =\r\nfor everyone but \n&gt; for al those who for any reason cant do homam, please s=\r\ntart sincerely \n&gt; with some non-homam sadhana)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

Variations in Ganapti=\r\n tarpan\n&gt; a. Instead of turmeric mound in the sadhana listed above you can =\r\nkeep \n&gt; ganapti yantra also.\n&gt; b. I simply chooze to visualise ganapati and=\r\n either i visualise washing \n&gt; his feet or simple focusing on mantra.\n&gt; c. =\r\nAs PVR has said many times before that sincerity and devotion are the \n&gt; ke=\r\ny and not the technicalities.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4.
