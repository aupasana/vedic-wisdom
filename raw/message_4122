Would the mantra be written in the =\r\nVeda without the intended Sandhi applied?\n\nNarasimha, on your website your =\r\nrendering is in agreement with what I thought was the true mantra. Are the =\r\nSandhi rules to be applied between all words in Sanskrit or are there excep=\r\ntions?\n\nI sincerely hope this is not too off topic.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nAndri Li=\r\nndbergs\n\n\n"}}
