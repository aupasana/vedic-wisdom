Maybe because, in the world of duality there is mu=\r\nch more than what meets the five human senses. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;The mind that we have, may not end when the body ends, similar at the dif=\r\nferent realms there could well be a similar operating software (like our hu=\r\nman mind) through which things are percieved and things appear as diverse o=\r\nr more than what we experience in this realm. The world of duality is indee=\r\nd complex. Often what happens in this plane has a precursor in the astral w=\r\norlds, good or bad, it is said. Aurobindo mentions this in his writings cle=\r\narly. So it is possible that there are ethereal beings in different realms =\r\nwho self identify with different astral aspects of our world.&nbsp;Bottomli=\r\nne, the world of duality is immensely complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I am not sure if it answers your query apty, but I just gave i=\r\nt a honest shot.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Raj=\r\narshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Courier&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;Rama N=\r\naama Satya Hai..&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Tue, 19/1/10, Acharyulu &lt;i&gt;&lt;acharyulug@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255=\r\n);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Acharyulu &lt;acharyulug@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] On the experiences at Varanasi...&lt;br&gt;To: rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&lt;br&gt;C=\r\nc: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, pvr@charter. net&lt;br&gt;Date: Tuesday, 19 Ja=\r\nnuary, 2010, 6:12 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv790855799&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n=\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspac=\r\ning=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv343321393&quot;&gt;Dear R=\r\najarshi,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Namaste.
