All are importan=\r\nt. If you have no time to read all, you may consider \n&gt; reading chapter 11 =\r\nas the summary/pinnacle. But all chapters are equally \n&gt; important and form=\r\n one *complete* narrative.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Will one get more strength by drinking o=\r\nnly milk or eating a \n&gt; multi-course meal?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, it depends. In genera=\r\nl, a multi-course meal is better. But milk \n&gt; may be more appropriate somet=\r\nimes. Whatever you eat, the key is to \n&gt; digest it. If you eat a multi-cour=\r\nse meal and get indigestion, it does \n&gt; no good. Just drinking milk is bett=\r\ner then.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever mantra you do, the key is to do it with as good focs=\r\ns as you \n&gt; can manage, digest it [spiritually] and derive some strength fr=\r\nom it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one is able to do full Chandipath with some focus, it is bet=\r\nter as it \n&gt; is more balanced.
