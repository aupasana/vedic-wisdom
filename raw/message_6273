Strange are the ways of god. Many g=\r\nreat saints went through \n&gt; terrible sufferings as their lives transformed =\r\nto become fruitful and \n&gt; meaningful! What we think is good for us may actu=\r\nally be bad in the long \n&gt; run. If we surrender to god, things we want in t=\r\nhe short term may or may \n&gt; not happen, but our life will be steered in the=\r\n right direction in the \n&gt; long term. God knows better than us, what is bet=\r\nter for us.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is doubt in your mind that Vishnu sahasra naama h=\r\nomam caused \n&gt; problems for you, it may be better to not restart it. Give i=\r\nt some time. \n&gt; When you find inspiration again, possibly at a later time, =\r\nyou can start \n&gt; again. It is sometimes not useful to do a sadhana with suc=\r\nh deep \n&gt; fear/doubt. Instead of homam, just chant Vishnu sahasra naama sto=\r\ntra \n&gt; everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also send me your gotra, name, nakshatra and rasi by =\r\nprivate email (pvr \n&gt; at charter dot net). In the Saamoohika Satya Narayana=\r\n vratam we are \n&gt; conducting in greater Boston on May 7 (Saturday, Rishi Pa=\r\nnchami), I will \n&gt; add you to the sankalpa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                 =\r\n   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Apr 29, 2011 a=\r\nt 2:01 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Hello all\n&gt; \n&gt; After 21 vishnu s=\r\nahastranam i was wrongly detained by immigration and \n&gt; now coz of paperwor=\r\nk the process has got complicated.
