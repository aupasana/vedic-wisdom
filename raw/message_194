Some say He appeared few thousand\n&gt; years before Lord Krishna, Is that true?\n\nAtleast 1.8 million years back.\n\n&gt; -As most of the people believe these days that the Vedas were\n&gt; written/revealed 7-8000 yrs ago, if this is true then what was the\n&gt; source of knowledge before that?\n\nVedas are millions of years old. They are arranged in their current form by \nVyasa about 5,000 years back. But they were revealed to rishis millions of \nyears back. Yogis have been meditating on verses from Vedas and realizing \nuniversal truths represented by them for millions of years.\n\n&gt; -Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, wasnt there\n&gt; any philosophy before that?\n\nThe modern chronology of Hindu scriptures was created by people with heavy \nbiases and agendas. Darshanas are not a few thousand of years old.\n\nWe had Veda(s), vedanta, vedangas, darshanas etc for millions of years.\n\n&gt; -What is the divison of the ages(yugas). Again there is a lot of\n&gt; confusion here as some say they are thousands of years long but others\n&gt; say millions of years long. Can you please explain it.\n\nKrita/Sat yuga is 1,728,000 years long. Treta yuga is 1,296,000 years long. \nDwapara yuga is 864,000 years long. Current Kali yuga started about 5,000 \nyears back and it is 432,000 years long.\n\nYukeshwar maharaj (guru of Paramahamsa Yogananda) took a different view, \nwhere all the above numbers are divided by 360. He is a great yogi and \nbelongs to a great lineage and I have the highest respect. But he is simply \nwrong on this. A yogi can experience all times and spaces. In fact, time is \na very weird concept, even though it seems natural to us when we are \ncompletely bound to this body in this particular space-time continuum. When \na yogi enters nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no space and time for him/her. \nThe space-time continuum experienced by a yogi in different realms of \nconsciousness are different. I submit that Yukteshwar Maharaj made some \nmistake, either intentionally or unintentionally, in drawing conclusions \nfrom his experiences.\n\nTraditionally, we mention the number of years that passed since Kali yuga \nstarted, at the start of every ritual. The number mentioned (about 5,000 \nyears) matches with the astronomical dating of Mahabharata. All the \nastronomical combinations mentioned by Vyasa in Mahabharata occurred in that \nsequence in a consistent manner about 5,000 years back. There were tens of \nthose eventsand they occurred in that sequence only once in the last 7,400 \nyears. For sure, Krishna lived about 5,000 years back and Kali yuga started \nthen.\n\n&gt; -You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation).\n&gt; Can you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real story\n&gt; and is there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation. Also\n&gt; can you please illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.\n\nAll the stories of Puranas are metaphors of some internal happenings and \nalso real stories at the same time.\n\nEach of is a microcosm of the entire universe. Thus, macro events described \nin scriptures happen microcosmically inside us. It is equally valid to see \nthem as real stories and as metaphors. When one&#39;s self-consciousness ascends \nto a particular realm of consciousness, it is actually possible to see one \nof these stories actually happening. In our normal realm of consciousness, \nthese are just stories and we can only understand them intellectually.\n\nThere are Jupiter, his wife Tara, Moon and Mercury externally. Internally, \nthey represent the intelligence, the expression of intelligence, mind and \nlearning ability (respectively). The story of Jupiter&#39;s wife Tara begetting \na child (Mercury) through Moon is real. It is also a metaphor for the fact \nthat internally, mind combines with the expression of intelligence to \ngenerate learning ability.\n\nRegarding Varaha avatara, here is my view. Hiranya means gold and also \ngreat. Aksha has many meanings, but one of them is &quot;sense organs&quot;. The demon \nHiranyaksha symbolizes the mighty sense organs. He stole Mother earth and \nsunk Her in water. Mother earth is symbolized by Kundalini \n(self-consciousness, microcosmic representation of the divine Mother within \neach person) who is normally in the Mooladhara chakra (earth element). When \na sadhaka is caught by the mighty sense organs, Kundalini \n(self-consciousness) is stuck in the samsara saagara (the ocean of material \nlife) and loses balance. Lord Vishnu (sattwa guna in a person) takes the \nform of a boar and comes from the nostril of the creator. He digs in and \nrescues earth from Hiranyaksha. When sattwa guna enters the praana (life \nforce - nostril reference) of a person, dives down to Mooladhara and \ndestroys the attachment to the mighty sense organs there, the Mother is \nfreed and can move up to Merge with the Lord (i.e. self-consciousness \nascending to merge with Brahman). Basically Varaha avatara represents the \nsattwa guna in a person that tries to give detachment from the perceptions \nof the sense organs and then make the calm praana dives down to Mooladhara \nto give balance to Kundalini to move up.\n\n&gt; -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me how is it\n&gt; going to affect my spiritual life. My fiancee&#39;s Birth Details- 02 Oct\n&gt; 1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.\n\nGood luck with your marital life!\n\n&gt; Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces from March 2008\n&gt; to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is from\n&gt; March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if you\n&gt; can explain me which one is correct.\n\nDrigdasa was taught incorrectly by some teachers earlier, based on wrongly \nremembered teachings of tradition. Most softwares (including my own \nJagannatha Hora software) calculate it incorrectly. My personal version of \nthe software (to be released to the public later) calculates it based on \nParasara&#39;s teachings and I believe it to be correct based on my study of the \ncharts of several spiritualists. I taught it in the recent two issues of \n&quot;Jyotish Digest&quot; magazine.\n\n&gt; Next thing is about meditation, can you please advise me any good\n&gt; meditation postures or any book where I can learn some.\n\nDon&#39;t worry about technicalities too much. The most fundamental thing is \nthat your back and neck should be erect, straight and not tense at the same \ntime. You may sit on floor cross-legged preferably or even sit in a chair if \nyou have weak knees. The most important thing is the back and neck being \nerect. Secondly, close the eyes, otherwise a lot of fire is wasted in the \nact of seeing. That agni is better used for other things! Then repeat the \nmantra. If your focus is wandering elsewhere, don&#39;t panic and worry too \nmuch. Just bring back your mind to the mantra. Try your best to focus on the \nmantra. With time, you will succeed.\n\nFinally remember - no effort is wasted. Even an effort that seems to be not \nyielding results is actually working towards a final result. If a straw of \nthe grass makes the scales tilt, it does not mean all the objects placed on \nthe scale previously were unneeded! Just have faith and keep doing sadhana.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, February 17, 2008 4:22 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n\n\n&gt; Hari OM\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all I would like to thank you for the illustrative and quick\n&gt; reply.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Sanjeev ji,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It happens to everybody. People find their path, make some progress\n&gt; and then\n&gt;&gt; feel lost again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to March 2017. Taking\n&gt; Cancer\n&gt;&gt; as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house will be strong with\n&gt;&gt; Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in lagna. The 8th\n&gt; house\n&gt;&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords Saturn and Rahu\n&gt;&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th house axis\n&gt; strongly\n&gt;&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually speaking. Just\n&gt; keep\n&gt;&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and keep doing your\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and vimsamsa. This shows\n&gt; devotion\n&gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is empty and\n&gt; Mercury owns\n&gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests that worship of Lord\n&gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast spiritual progress.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@... (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask\n&gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia. Swami Suresh\n&gt; Battar is a\n&gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are available there,\n&gt; he may be\n&gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or circle shaped\n&gt; vessel\n&gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not iron) can be used.\n&gt; Good\n&gt;&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct experience through\n&gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender to the\n&gt; Lord,\n&gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses\n&gt; perceive in\n&gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and that\n&gt; we are\n&gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we keep\n&gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly attracted to or\n&gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In\n&gt; addition, if\n&gt;&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too helps.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a commentary on\n&gt; BhagavadGita by\n&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a unique saint,\n&gt; who is\n&gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic and adwaitic\n&gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings coming from\n&gt; knowledge\n&gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and writings coming\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than 700 years ago,\n&gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physical body at\n&gt; the age\n&gt;&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT read a more\n&gt; competent or\n&gt;&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is quite an inspired\n&gt; work. A\n&gt;&gt; good English translation of this work is available at\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my\n&gt; opinion.\n&gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to come with him to\n&gt; forest,\n&gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the presence of Maharshi\n&gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned people, Maharshi\n&gt; Vasishtha\n&gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His teachings were\n&gt; captured\n&gt;&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. There is an\n&gt; inspired\n&gt;&gt; English translation available at\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful reading too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Although this is my first writing in this group but i have been\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reading the threads for almost one year now. And you people have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many times but now i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what brought me here( and to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember the thread where\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of Sani and now i have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this thread and from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make any decisions of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are many\n&gt;&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and guide me i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there and doing some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this was random and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of reading more to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from where to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a regular\n&gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the homa kundam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone tell me\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i want to ask but if someone\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would be very thankful to him and i will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n\n\n"}}
