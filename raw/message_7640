Jus=\r\nt stick to the time basis,pick any mantra and recite for  half-an hour or a=\r\nn hour or more than to it as you wish.Forget about the counts like 28,1008 =\r\netc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Your can avail lamps in the market which will not blow off due to=\r\n winds.If that is lingering your mind during homam- even you can leave it a=\r\ns is once you started Agnipratistapana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Learned members please correct=\r\n me if i am wrong.Above ideas are given just to get much focus on mantra or=\r\n God instead hanging around at the stirring up thoughts\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you,\n&gt; S=\r\nrini.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ananda Kishora Dadi &lt;varaha=\r\n_2000@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had experinced the same problem when I do it terra=\r\nce, homam fire gets blown \n&gt; &gt; away by gusty winds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have started=\r\n putting some chairs=C2=A0 in front of fire=C2=A0kund in a row, to reduce \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the intensity of the wind and to minimize the fire blowing away...altho=\r\nugh not \n&gt; &gt; much success.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is it going to reduce the homam benifit=\r\n one would receive=C2=A0if one=C2=A0re-ignites the \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0fire several =\r\ntimes?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Thx,Ananda \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _______=\r\n_________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: miveda91 &lt;miveda91@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sun, December 11, 2011 5:55:46 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Maha Ganapati Homam Questions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Om Ganeshai Namah!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since Navaratri, for last three mont=\r\nhs, I have been doing Maha Ganapati Homam \n&gt; &gt; once a month. Now, from yest=\r\nerday with Lunar Eclipse, my intention is to do the \n&gt; &gt; Homam weekly basis=\r\n each weekend.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would also like to increase the counts of Moola M=\r\nantra and Vedic Mantra, but I \n&gt; &gt; have following questions:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Ho=\r\nw do we keep count of the number of Mantra chanted?\n&gt; &gt; 2) Homam Manual the=\r\n suggested count is 4/8/12/21/28/108/1008, for progressing \n&gt; &gt; the count, =\r\nthere is big gap between 28 and 1008, is this intentional or any \n&gt; &gt; other=\r\n suggestion?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I am doing Homam in terrace, for fire in Kunda, I =\r\nhave only trouble in the \n&gt; &gt; start but once fire is big enough no problem,=\r\n but the lamp get put off, quite \n&gt; &gt; frequently, yesterday, I put the lamp=\r\n inside one Steel vessel, is there any \n&gt; &gt; better way ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks an=\r\nd regards.\n&gt; &gt; Mihir\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
