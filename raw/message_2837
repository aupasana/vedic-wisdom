Whenever i see=\r\n writings from Narasimha or from\n&gt; &gt; others which talks about spiritual vib=\r\nrations, i wonder! If it&#39;s a feel good\n&gt; &gt; factor within or without?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; If we go to the famous temples of India today, it is almost sure that one=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; will find lot of crowd and resultant noise, gossips, business, cheatin=\r\ng,\n&gt; &gt; discrimination etc... etc...\n&gt; &gt; can that be criteria for judging th=\r\ne spiritual energy of the place?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; my two distinct experiences (exter=\r\nnal):\n&gt; &gt; 1) i went to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when i entered to ta=\r\nke Darshan\n&gt; &gt; of all the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the dogmatic beh=\r\navior of the\n&gt; &gt; Pandas standing there near the Idols. they almost commande=\r\nd me to put some\n&gt; &gt; money in front of the Idol. one can imagine my conditi=\r\non. Instead of\n&gt; &gt; focusing on the lord, i was angry at them and refused to=\r\n oblige.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) Once we (group of friends) went to &#39;Mota Ambaji&#39; (in Gu=\r\njarat near Mount\n&gt; &gt; Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just a=\r\nt the entrance of the\n&gt; &gt; famous temple, gave us all the puja material in a=\r\n plate. We made a mistake\n&gt; &gt; by not asking him price. After we came back f=\r\nrom the temple, he asked us to\n&gt; &gt; pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybod=\r\ny imagine such price?. we have to\n&gt; &gt; bargain so much with him that after t=\r\nhat i hardly buy such puja saamgri\n&gt; &gt; whenever i go to any temple. for ins=\r\ntance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temple of\n&gt; &gt; Mumbai, i&#39;ll take 3 lotuses to o=\r\nffer Mahakaali-Mahalakshmi-MahaSaraswati and\n&gt; &gt; that is all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner I must say that the above two bad experiences did not discourage\n&gt; &gt; me.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Such things as well as few other things like General atmosphere, c=\r\nrowd,\n&gt; &gt; noise, beggars, dirt, etc=85 are external things IMHO.

They have helped me a lot on the query.\n&gt; &gt; Actually, I recently vis=\r\nited few (not to name any but also including 1 or 2\n&gt; &gt; from your list) pla=\r\nces with my parents. But, my experience was really bad. I\n&gt; &gt; could see lot=\r\n of commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there\n&gt; &gt; including t=\r\nhose in position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to\n&gt; &gt; find. I =\r\ncould feel spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main\n&gt; &gt; bu=\r\nilding and crows) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; would not have been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if the=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; famous and energised idols have the power to raise the spiritual ene=\r\nrgies,\n&gt; &gt; then why did &quot;locals&quot; who have always been here, are getting cor=\r\nrupted. But,\n&gt; &gt; then probably the tamas energies of people coming day in a=\r\nnd out have\n&gt; &gt; overpowered or as you say visitors have made the incense di=\r\nsappear over the\n&gt; &gt; period of time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have one experience to s=\r\nhare, which is somewhat on similar lines. I was\n&gt; &gt; in Hardiwar with my par=\r\nents on a certain &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking bath, they\n&gt; &gt; started looking f=\r\nor a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately or\n&gt; &gt; unfortunately, we co=\r\nuld found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain place.\n&gt; &gt; But, they were =\r\nsurrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. And\n&gt; &gt; per my esti=\r\nmate a 10000 people would have already fed them per their\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Custom&quot;. Now=\r\n, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already\n&gt; &gt; had her =\r\nquota of 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or food\n&gt; &gt; poiso=\r\nning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed the,\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nut could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In g=\r\neneral, whatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly found it\n&gt; &gt; spir=\r\nitual enough and have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always happen\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that to keep\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these plac=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt; As they are highly filled with Tamas now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sriram\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

At\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same time, =\r\nsome not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful\n&gt; &gt; divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pr=\r\nesence.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the=C2 Krishna temple\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There a=\r\nre several\n&gt; &gt; temples\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where the idol is practically alive. For examp=\r\nle, even 123 years after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol=\r\n at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; I did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not get the same impression a=\r\nt the famous Kalighat temple which is also\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taken to b=\r\ny a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil\n&gt; &gt; Nadu\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name=\r\n of the=C2 form of\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the divine Mother=C2 present there was a Tamil=\r\n language name and I did not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand it. I do not even remember th=\r\ne name now. But, when I closed my\n&gt; &gt; eyes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and started meditating wit=\r\nh my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled\n&gt; &gt; by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vision of a =\r\nvery fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I\n&gt; &gt; felt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthat there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not\n&gt; &gt; remem=\r\nber the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without =\r\nroof over\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess =\r\na few times, but the\n&gt; &gt; roof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; came down in a fire accident each time =\r\nand they finally decided that the\n&gt; &gt; goddess\n&gt; &gt; &gt; likes open air and no r=\r\noof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a\n&gt; &gt; hurry, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was very p=\r\nleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Like this, I am sure the=\r\nre are many temples with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of my =\r\nbest experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditati=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; underground chamber there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even=\r\n the middle of a busy road in India is better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for meditating than a t=\r\nemple in USA. These western countries are so\n&gt; &gt; filled with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rajas an=\r\nd tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; but my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. B=\r\nut some temples\n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one has a cha=\r\nnce to spend a few months doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual sadhana near a temple, I su=\r\nggest the following:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamak=\r\nhya in east\n&gt; &gt; &gt; India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2 a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narayana=C2 vanam (near Tirupati)=C2 in south India, Shirdi, Aalan=\r\ndi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dwaraka=C2 and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanas=\r\ni,\n&gt; &gt; Vrindavan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mant=\r\nralayam=C2 and Ujjain\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; central India.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are=\r\n many other good places, but the above\n&gt; &gt; &gt; come to my mind. Visiting a te=\r\nmple once is one thing and staying there\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; several months while=\r\n maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (li=\r\nke homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; r=\r\negards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://group=\r\ns. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish software (Wind=\r\nows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; writings: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n-- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Astro\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Seeker\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 =\r\n9:11\n&gt; &gt; &gt; AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would like to kn=\r\now your opinion on holy places (famous temples\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc) in today&#39;s time. =\r\nSay, for example, how do you see going to Shirdi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Temple and Shree Tir=\r\nupati temple, as far as spiritual sadhana is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned.
