But first I want to r=\r\necommend a couple of books:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is undoubtedly one=\r\n of the best works \navailable to a spiritually inclined person with interes=\r\nt in vedanta. \nIt is a practical book with many stories (unlike most dry ve=\r\ndanta \nbooks) and teaches profound lessons through stories.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Interesti=\r\nngly, I am typing this on the eve of Sree Rama Navami (by \nthe way, happy S=\r\nree Rama Navami to all of you!). When Maharshi \nVishwamitra came to request=\r\n Dasaratha to send Lord Rama with him to \nprotect his yajna from demons, Da=\r\nsaratha was hesitant and Lord \nRamachandra was confused. At the request of =\r\nMaharshi Vishwamitra and \nothers, Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Ramachandr=\r\na the essence of \nthe knowledge of Self, in front of other maharshis, kings=\r\n and gods. \nThese teachings were captured by Maharshi Valmiki as the book &quot;=\r\nYoga \nVaasishtham&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This work helped even maharshis like Bharadwaja t=\r\no obtain Brahma \njnana. When Valmiki explained Vasishtha&#39;s teachings to Bha=\r\nradwaja, \nhe became realized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is a truly inspired English trans=\r\nlation by Swami \nVenkatesananda, a disciple of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikes=\r\nh (Divine \nLife Society). Swami Sivananda is considered by some to be a re-=\r\n\nincarnation of Maharshi Vasishtha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Y=\r\noga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is the best book I have read in=\r\n my life and I can say this is \nthe book that influenced me the most and ch=\r\nanged my thinking.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Bhagavad Gita is a marvelous compendium on pra=\r\nctical \nspirituality. It covers various paths like jnana yoga, raja yoga, \n=\r\nbhakti yoga, karma yoga, sannyasa yoga etc. While there are many \ncommentar=\r\nies and translations, I prefer the treatment of Sant \nJnaneshwar. He is a r=\r\nare Krishna bhakta who is also associated with \nthe path of aghora and nath=\r\nas! While most Krishna bhaktas follow \ndwaita and vivishtaadwaita, Jnaneshw=\r\nar&#39;s treatment is purely \nadwaitic.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In Yoga Vasishtham, Vasishtha tel=\r\nls Rama that Vishnu would appear \nas Krishna in a later yuga and teach the =\r\nessence of Veda to Arjuna. \nVasishtha goes to great lengths on what Krishna=\r\n teaches. Some modern \ncommentaries on Bhagavad Gita deviate from the adwai=\r\ntic principles \nof vedanta and interpret some teachings of Krishna in a way=\r\n that \ncontradicts Vasishtha&#39;s take. Sant Jnaneshwar&#39;s interpretation is \nc=\r\nonsistent with Vasishtha&#39;s and also consistent with upanishads and \nvedanta=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-\nKripanand=\r\na/dp/0911307648\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But What a real spiritu=\r\nalism is still yet to defined....\n&gt;  \n&gt; Self-realized person is one who has=\r\n realized that all is Brahman \nand not bound by any limited ego, even thoug=\r\nh actions continue to \nspring from a previously existing ego (that continue=\r\ns to wind down \nlike a fan after electricity is turned off).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Spiritua=\r\nl person is one who is making *some progress* towards \nbecoming a self-real=\r\nized person at a point in future.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfrotuna=\r\ntely, scriptures can describe a self-realized person and \nhow he thinks, bu=\r\nt they cannot give any fool-proof steps which, when \nfollowed by one, can e=\r\nnsure self-realization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just thinking &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and understand=\r\ning it \n*intellctually* is not sufficient. Let me drive my point home using=\r\n \nan analogy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose someone goes to a movie and becomes so involved=\r\n in the \nmovie that he behaves as through something is really happening on =\r\n\nthe screen. For example, suppose there is a scene where the heroine \nis in=\r\n a dark room and villain is about to stab her in the back from \nbehind her.=\r\n Suppose there is tense music. One may be shuddering with \nexpectation. One=\r\n may jump with shock and tension.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There may be one person who complet=\r\nely realizes that this is just \nan illusion and nothing is actually happeni=\r\nng and watches it without \nany emotional involvement whatsoever. He is anlo=\r\ngous to a realized \nperson. Suppose someone is so involved and shouts with =\r\nhappiness \nwhen something good happens in the movie and shudders when somet=\r\nhing \nterrible happens in the movie. He is analogous to a person deeply \nst=\r\nuck in maya. Really speaking, this life we live is quite similar \nto a big =\r\nmovie, except that it is interactive. Thus, my analogy is \nquite appropriat=\r\ne.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now, one smart person may very well know that this movie thing is =\r\n\nnot really happening and hence controlling emotions mostly. But an \nodd sc=\r\nene may make him shudder too! Such a person is analogous to \none who intell=\r\nectually understands and appreciates the essence of \nVeda (that all is Brah=\r\nman and the objects we see are all an \nillusion) and yet does not fully com=\r\nprehend it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one fully realizes, then nothing should make one happy=\r\n or sad \ninternally. One may act externally as though one is happy or sad, =\r\n\nbut the heart should be stable always and not excited or depressed \nby *an=\r\nything*. If all is Brahman, why should anything exicte you \ndepress you? In=\r\n our analogy, such a person is like one watching the \nmovie with zero invol=\r\nvement, realizing at all times that it is only \nimaginary and not happening=\r\n for real and not being shaken even once. \nOne who has only an intellectual=\r\n understanding and not a complete \nunderstanding may some times be affected=\r\n by the illusion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If someone praises you, does it excite you? If some=\r\none humiliates, \ndoes it upset you? If something seems nice, do you want to=\r\n have it? \nIf something seems disgusting, do you want to go away?\n&gt;  \n&gt; As =\r\nlong as there is attachment and self-identification with a body \nor a name =\r\nor some other limited object, some ego remains and causes \nall of the above=\r\n. It results in happiness on some events and sadness \non some events. Self-=\r\nrealization cannot come without overcoming ego \n*fully*. It never comes fro=\r\nm an intellectual understanding of the \ndictum &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. It comes f=\r\nrom experiencing it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; How can one go from a =\r\nlimited ego to zero ego? There is no single \npath. As I said already, scrip=\r\ntures only describe how a realized \nperson thinks, but they cannot give a f=\r\nool-proof path to realization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, some scriptures do outline so=\r\nme paths for reference. \nWhile they are not fool-proof and do not guarantee=\r\n realization, they \ncan be helpful.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One person may sit down in seclus=\r\nion in a forest or in Himalayas \nor a remote cave and keep eating enough to=\r\n just survive and actively \ncontemplate all the time &quot;Who am I? Am I this b=\r\nody? Who am I? What \nare all these objects I perceive? What is all this?&quot; a=\r\nnd eventually \nrealize Self. This is jnana yoga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One person may pray =\r\nto a specific deity and slowly force oneself \nto see the entire universe as=\r\n another form of that deity and see \nthat deity in everything. One may even=\r\ntually realize Self through \nthat deity. This is bhakti yoga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One per=\r\nson may consider work and service as god and spend all of \none&#39;s time servi=\r\nng people without prejudices, without any self-pride \nand without any selfi=\r\nsh motives. One may try to see god in all \npeople and all service and may e=\r\nventually realize Self. This is \nkarma yoga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One person may use force=\r\nful methods of raja yoga, control the \nbody, senses and mind through yogic =\r\npractices, forcefully raise self-\nawareness (Kundalini shakti) to higher re=\r\nalms of consciousness. They \ntoo may eventually realize Self.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In each=\r\n of these four broad paths, there are many sub-paths. But \nplease realize t=\r\nhat no path guarantees self-realization. They help, \nbut do not guarantee a=\r\nnything. And the only method of spiritual \nprogress, IMHO, is how much ego =\r\nhas been overcome.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Most people stick to one method. There are excepti=\r\nons like \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa who tried each path and succeeded. In fac=\r\nt, \nI believe the logo of Ramakrishna mutt employs symbols of each of \nthes=\r\ne paths in it! While each saint is great and one cannot compare \nthem, Rama=\r\nkrishna was somebody else. His lila (play) cannot fully be \nunderstood by m=\r\nost people even today, after such a long time. His \nlila may in fact contin=\r\nue to play out long after he left the body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n I just want to share my personal view on the link between the \nabobe paths=\r\n and Jyotish. This is not from any classic and based on \nmy own intuition.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; The path of karma yoga is seen from the element of earth. The path \no=\r\nf bhakti yoga is seen from the element of water. The path of jnaana \nyoga i=\r\ns seen from the element of fire. The path of raja yoga is seen \nfrom the el=\r\nement of air. Of course, ether is in all. Ether or space \nis the basis of a=\r\nll yoga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.ne=\r\nt\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In JyotishGr=\r\noup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Tarun&quot; &lt;tarun.virgo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; a very good mail from your side.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you covered all points, \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; including the Karma which you mentioned as Arjuna and Krishna&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\nample and Raja Janak\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rest sanyas things which you mentioned with e=\r\nxamples of Trilinga \n&gt; &gt; Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa ,Narendranath (Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda)\nand \n&gt; &gt; few others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritualism of Rajnikant.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; But What a real spiritualism is still yet to defined....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; bei=\r\nng a sadhu tatva is spiritualism ?? doing karma is \nspiritualism ??\n&gt; &gt; giv=\r\ning teachings is spiritualism ? doing Social service is \n&gt; &gt; spiritualism ?=\r\n? guiding others is spiritualism.?? being honest \nis \n&gt; &gt; spiritualism ?? o=\r\nr being a warrior and killing because of duties \nis \n&gt; &gt; spiritualism ?? or=\r\n taking sanyas is spiritualism ?? or sitting \nin \n&gt; &gt; temple and worshippin=\r\ng / doing yajna /doing yoga etc...etc...\n&gt; &gt; unlimited things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; or =\r\nnot helping people and letting them face the god&#39;s decision \nis \n&gt; &gt; spirit=\r\nualism.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; as per you ..a self realised person who finally loses=\r\n ego ( any \n&gt; &gt; planet specific ) is lost that time a person is spiritual ?=\r\n? but \n&gt; &gt; what does he do finally .....again long list as above. ...\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; you have read Geeta and all other puranas , if you can share few \n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhings from your vast knowledge , it would be great for those \nwho \n&gt; &gt; dono=\r\nt understands the meaning of spiritualism.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But do you agree to me =\r\nthat there are many people who has made \nit as \n&gt; &gt; moeny earning module in=\r\n western countries..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ////\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior ast=\r\nrologer doesnt make one to \n&gt; &gt; certify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as goo=\r\nd and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; anybody.

One may be sitting =\r\nin \npleasure \n&gt; &gt; world, earning money and engaging externally in various \n=\r\nactivities, \n&gt; &gt; but the mind may be established in peace and bliss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A realized person is NOT identified by the actions he/she \nengages =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in. Just as an electric fan continues to turn for a few minutes \neven =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; after the electricity is turned off, a realized person who is \nstill \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; in a body continues to engage in actions based on the previous \nflow. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; After King Janaka realized Self, he continued as the king of \nMithila \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; and did all royal duties. After Krishna made Arjuna realize \nSelf, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Arjuna fought a war and killed his gurus, brothers, grandfather \netc.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One who has not yet realized Self will distinguish between \nvario=\r\nus \n&gt; &gt; objects of this dual world and view some as good and some as \nbad. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; He/she will try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On the \n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nther hand, a realized person sees all people, objects and \nactions \n&gt; &gt; of =\r\nthis universe as the same Self and sees no reason to either \nbe \n&gt; &gt; attrac=\r\nted to or repelled from anything. His/her actions and \n&gt; &gt; inactions are th=\r\nus not based on the principles of attraction and \n&gt; &gt; repulsion. They are b=\r\nased on the previous flow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Renouncing wife, children, job, mo=\r\nney etc is an attempt to \nfind \n&gt; &gt; true mental renunciation. Renouncing ex=\r\nternal objects can \npromote \n&gt; &gt; mental renunciation, but not guarantee it.=\r\n On the other hand, \none \n&gt; &gt; can remain in the midst of the material world=\r\n and all the \nexternal \n&gt; &gt; objects and yet have a perfectly stable, peacef=\r\nul and blissful \nmind \n&gt; &gt; that is not attracted to or repelled from any of=\r\n the objects one \nis \n&gt; &gt; surrounded by. For all you know, a big film star =\r\nlike \nRajinikanth, \n&gt; &gt; who makes millions of dollars per movie, surrounded=\r\n by glamour, \n&gt; &gt; money and adulation, may be more detached at the mental l=\r\nevel \nthan \n&gt; &gt; many yogis in Himalayas. It is probably true in the case of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Rajinikanth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one stays away from objects that may =\r\nattract one, it is \n&gt; &gt; relatively easy to overcome attraction temporarily.=\r\n Whether one \ncan \n&gt; &gt; retain that renunciation when one comes in contact w=\r\nith the \nobjects \n&gt; &gt; again or not is a questionmark. On the other hand, to=\r\n be in \ncontact \n&gt; &gt; with the objects that may attract one and yet maintain=\r\n mental \n&gt; &gt; detachment and mental renunciation is tougher. It is the true =\r\n\ntest.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is not out of place to mention a small story.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami lived for about 300 years and did unbelievable \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n austerities in Kashi. When Ramakrishna Paramahamsa met him in \nKashi, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n he remarked to his sishyas that Trilinga Swami was Shiva Himself \nand \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n a fully realized being. Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was not \n&gt; &gt; with=\r\n him on that pilgrimage and he made a point to force \n&gt; &gt; Narendranath to g=\r\no to Kashi later to have a darshan of Trilinga \n&gt; &gt; Swami!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; La=\r\nhiri Mahashaya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was \nthe \n&gt; &gt; guru o=\r\nf Paramahamsa Yogananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a \nhouseholder \n&gt; &gt; and had a=\r\n high-paying job. Yet he realized Self. Trilnga Swami \nspoke \n&gt; &gt; little, b=\r\nut he once spoke a few words in Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s \npraise. \n&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;=\r\nThe state of mind I achieved by renouncing everything, \n&gt; &gt; Lahiri achieved=\r\n it while being a householder, being in the \nmiddle of \n&gt; &gt; everything. I b=\r\now to him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *         *         *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my vie=\r\nw, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to \n&gt; &gt; certify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npersons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; an=\r\nybody. However, those who know some \n&gt; &gt; astrology can give their views on =\r\ncharts that are shared and \n&gt; &gt; discussed publicly.

However, \n&gt; &gt; spirituality is tough to define. It will mean different t=\r\nhings \nto \n&gt; &gt; different people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The goal of all spiritual jo=\r\nurneys is to realize Self, at some \n&gt; &gt; time or the other. However, most sp=\r\niritual journeys of this age \ndo \n&gt; &gt; NOT end in Self-realization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is limited ego that binds one to a limited existence like a \n&gt; &gt; b=\r\nody and stops one from realizing the all-pervading true Self. \nWhile \n&gt; &gt; a=\r\n self-realized person&#39;s ego is completely killed, it is \npossible to \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nake partial progress. There are many people, who overcome ego \nto \n&gt; &gt; vari=\r\nous extents and realize to various degrees that body is \n&gt; &gt; temporary and =\r\nit is not the true self. One can do so by \nfollowing \n&gt; &gt; many spiritual pa=\r\nths, like the path of knowledge, the path of \n&gt; &gt; devotion, the path of pra=\r\nnayama, the path of hatha yoga, the \npath of \n&gt; &gt; work and service etc. One=\r\n who overcomes ego to some extent, \nusing \n&gt; &gt; any path, is making some spi=\r\nritual progress. When the ego is \n&gt; &gt; completely subdued, one realizes the =\r\ntrue Self. This realization \nis \n&gt; &gt; the same irrespective of the path foll=\r\nowed. However, \nintermediate \n&gt; &gt; steps look and feel different based on th=\r\ne path.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Enough of my 2 cents for tonight...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: \nhttp://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n---\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Prashant ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a se=\r\nnior astrologer doesnt make one to \n&gt; &gt; certify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persons doing=\r\ns as good and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are many factors which o=\r\nne over looks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and in true sense ....what is the real s=\r\npiritualism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...g=\r\no and do tapasya \nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world and e=\r\narning money \nand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tarun\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
