While the storie=\r\ns in these books are quite interesting, how many of us in the group truly b=\r\nelieve that these are real incidents that have actually happened? It is eas=\r\ny to reject them as a figment of imagination by Robert Svobodha. Or is it t=\r\nhat these stories are supposed have some inner/esoteric meaning and should =\r\nnot be taken literally as real incidents?\n=C2=A0\nI definitely believe Vimal=\r\nananda existed and what is mentioned here are true. But it is a wrong point=\r\n of debate. Irrespective of whether Vimalananda existed or not, are the inf=\r\normation mentioned in here related to sadhana, real or unreal? That you can=\r\n know, only, if you keep trying to do sadhana. Serious sadhana. I=C2=A0did =\r\nmy first homam after reading the first chapter of the second book in 2007. =\r\nDuring that time I had no clue about this forum or the homam manuals. There=\r\n is a wealth of information in those books related to practical and serious=\r\n sadhana. To judge the reality of a book, one must attain a certain level. =\r\nI have not attained any such level where I can pass any realistic comment o=\r\nn a book like this, but I start with the presumption that this (the book)=\r\n=C2=A0is true, and the more I do sadhana and cross check with the book, I f=\r\nind what it mentions is indeed true. \n=C2=A0\nManish, whom=C2=A0I consider a=\r\ns my spiritual mentor, tells me that not only Vimalananda existed but he wa=\r\ns a Rishi who lived his life incongnito. He neither wanted fame, not discip=\r\nles nor anything else. He had a target audience in his mind when he asked S=\r\nvoboda to write that book. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0For instance, on the chapte=\r\nr on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vimalananda says the real Gayatri Mantra=\r\n is hidden and no one knows. And according to him no one can really pronoun=\r\nce a vedic mantra perfectly in these times owing to the influence of Kali. =\r\nAt the same time he goes on narrating how to practise a mantra by doing jap=\r\nam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so that siddhi happens! How to reconcile=\r\n these two? \n=C2=A0\nNot all mantras are Vedic mantras. There are lots of po=\r\nuranik mantras as well. For vedic mantras, pronunciation, intonation etc ha=\r\nve to be perfect. That is not the case with non-vedic mantras. If you can c=\r\nhant a vedic mantra perfectly and follow the rules of purushacharan, then I=\r\n am sure you will get the results.\n=C2=A0\nTo be more specific, I have tried=\r\n in the past a purascharana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred thousan=\r\nd times and was successful in finishing the ritual part (and I intend to do=\r\n a lot more with a lot more discipline), but with the real Gayatri Mantra b=\r\neing hidden and not in our knowledge, is any there any use in continuing in=\r\n this path? \n\nThe savitur mantra is also very potent. Anything that comes f=\r\nrom the Vedas are potent. There must be some reason why the real Gayatri is=\r\n hidden. Maybe most people of this age are unfit to chant and then digest t=\r\nhe effects of the real Gayatri. I feel, if you like the savitur mantra, kee=\r\np chanting it. It is also a great sadhana in itself.\n=C2=A0\nHe warns that w=\r\nithout proper pronounciation and/or disciplines, bad things will happen, li=\r\nke the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of breaking his cel=\r\nibacy! \n=C2=A0\nThat is mainly when you do a sadhana with a sankalpa. If you=\r\n take a sankalpa, for example you say you will do X number of japas daily f=\r\nor N number of days while maintaining celibacy=C2=A0etc etc, then=C2=A0make=\r\n sure you do not break it. In the specific example=C2=A0in the book, Vimala=\r\nnda had himself given a special Ganesha mantra to the person and mentioned =\r\nthe restrictoins to be followed. If one feels, one cannot live upto a sanka=\r\nlpa, then why even take one. Just keep doing japa/homam/puja with devotion =\r\nand leave the rest to the deity. =C2=A0=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nSpecially, I have been=\r\n told, if you are doing a sadhana of a Ugra devata, and you take a sankalpa=\r\n=C2=A0for specific number of days=C2=A0and then do not honour it, you may f=\r\nace some very, very=C2=A0severe consequences.

While the stories in these books are quite interesting, how many of u=\r\ns in the group truly believe that these are real incidents that have actual=\r\nly happened?

While t=\r\nhere is a wealth of information in the second book, and co-incides a lot wi=\r\nth Bhagavatham, there are quite a few places that left me quite confused to=\r\no. Maybe with the help of others from the group, I hope to get a better per=\r\nspective. For instance, on the chapter on Mantra and mantra siddhi, Sri Vim=\r\nalananda says the real Gayatri Mantra is hidden and no one knows. And accor=\r\nding to him no one can really pronounce a vedic mantra perfectly in these t=\r\nimes owing to the influence of Kali. At the same time he goes on narrating =\r\nhow to practise a mantra by doing japam, homam, tarpanam, marjanam etc. so =\r\nthat siddhi happens! How to reconcile these two? To be more specific, I hav=\r\ne tried in the past a purascharana of Savitru Gayatri Mantra for a hundred =\r\nthousand times and was successful in finishing the ritual part (and I inten=\r\nd to do a lot more with a lot more discipline), but with the real Gayatri M=\r\nantra being hidden and not in our knowledge, is any there\n any use in conti=\r\nnuing in this path? \n\n3. Since perfect pronounciation is impossible, he rec=\r\nommends that mantra sadhana should be done mentally, with not even tongue m=\r\noving. I find this very difficult to practise. At least for me, mind wander=\r\ns in a crazy fashion if Mantra sadhana is practised silently. In fact, it w=\r\nanders so much that I start with Ganapati mantra and somewhere along in the=\r\n middle of japa, I realize that my mind is elsewhere and try to come back t=\r\no the japam. What is shocking to me is that at that time my mind is constan=\r\ntly repeating Savitru Gayatri Mantra and not the intended Ganapati mantra. =\r\nAnd the rosary keeps moving regardless, so the counts are lost........ .\n\n4=\r\n. He warns that without proper pronounciation and/or disciplines, bad thing=\r\ns will happen, like the example of Ganapati Mantra Sadhaka dying because of=\r\n breaking his celibacy! This kind of examples could potentially scare many =\r\npeople from taking to any sadhana at all, in the lack of a proper Guru!
