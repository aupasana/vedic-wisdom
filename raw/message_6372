One does not beco=\r\nme complete without the other. Wherever there is real sannyasa there is pra=\r\nctical Vedanta. Wherever there is practical Vedanta there must be sannyasa =\r\nof the highest type. Sannyasa without Vedanta or parabhakti becomes fruitle=\r\nss. Vedanta without sannyasa becomes a mere intellectualism. When sannyasa =\r\nand Vedanta melt into one there crops up a sage of supreme wisdom. Sannyasa=\r\n empties the individual of the ego and the negative phenomena, and Vedanta =\r\nfills it with positive truth. Sannyasa without Vedanta remains empty, and d=\r\noes not serve its purpose. Even so, Vedanta without sannyasa becomes essenc=\r\neless, and loses its meaning. Vedanta cannot be grasped without emptying th=\r\ne ego through sannyasa and sannyasa becomes a waste without getting at the =\r\nsupreme ideal through Vedanta. \n\n\n"}}
