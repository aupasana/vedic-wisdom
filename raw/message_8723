Keeping \n&gt; them focused (even =\r\nto a small extent) on some spiritual activity where \n&gt; mind contemplates go=\r\nd, can be beneficial.\n&gt; \n&gt; Different activities appeal to different minds. =\r\nOne mind may be good at \n&gt; focusing on a small name or mantra and repeating=\r\n it silently. One mind \n&gt; may be good at singing a prayer loud along with o=\r\nther people. One  mind \n&gt; may be good at working as a part of a group at a =\r\ntemple or a community \n&gt; center. One mind may be good at undertaking a chal=\r\nlenge such as writing \n&gt; god&#39;s name certain number of times. One mind may b=\r\ne good at reading \n&gt; god&#39;s stories and thinking about them. One mind may be=\r\n good at focusing \n&gt; on god through an external ritual such as a homam or a=\r\n pooja.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the end, you can take whatever path you want. The key is th=\r\nat it \n&gt; should be somewhat natural and enjoyable to you and take your mind=\r\n off \n&gt; useless pursuits even for a small time and focus it on god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Oct 2, 2012 at 1:29=\r\n AM, Murali wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste !\n&gt; \n&gt; Could you please let us know the imp=\r\nortance of  Rama Koti Likhita japa, \n&gt; why there is a lot of importance for=\r\n this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please I would like to know about this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you!\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
