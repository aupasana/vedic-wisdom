What is your guidance and opinion on =\r\nthe same and which mantra should I choose? I read from your Homam manual th=\r\nat #1 mantra has been mentioned there, but is there anything wrong in the o=\r\nther three?\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have something in my mind. I tend to think that man=\r\ntras which are taken from the scriptures &quot;exactly as it is&quot; are and work th=\r\ne best. As an example from Rudram comes two mantras\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Om Namo Bhagava=\r\nte Rudraya\n&gt; 2. Om Namah Shivaya\n&gt; \n&gt; That is why we say &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot;=\r\n and not &quot;Om Shivaya Namah&quot;... so am I right here that its the best to chan=\r\nt mantras as exactly taken from the scriptures (Without making any changes =\r\nto them) and in that context what Ganesha mantra can I chant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt;=\r\n Tanvir\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
