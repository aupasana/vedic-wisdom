As Krishna says in Bhagad Gita, one must follow one&#39;s=\r\n own dharma and not someone else&#39;s dharma. Each person has a unique &quot;own dh=\r\narma&quot; that is decided by Nature based on what one did in the past, what deb=\r\nts one has from the past and what desires one harbored in the past. For one=\r\n person, serving guru may be the correct dharma. For one person, killing on=\r\ne&#39;s gurus may be the correct dharma (e.g. Arjuna).\n=A0\nThe universal thumbr=\r\nules of dharma shastras are for generic guidance until one knows one&#39;s own =\r\ndharma with some level of confidence. They are neither perfect nor unbreaka=\r\nble.\n=A0\nOne&#39;s conscience keeps telling one what one&#39;s dharma is. It keeps =\r\nmaking a noise from within heart whenever one veers off from one&#39;s own dhar=\r\nma. However, our vision is clouded by our desires, likes, dislikes, conditi=\r\noning and agendas and we fail to see our dharma.\n=A0\nAs we follow our dharm=\r\na more and more and as we become more and more detached to the good and bad=\r\n (!) consequences of following our dharma, the voice of our conscience beco=\r\nmes louder and clearer and we can know our dharma with more and more confid=\r\nence. Doing dharma better makes it easier to be detached. Being detached ma=\r\nkes it easier to know one&#39;s dharma better. Doing one&#39;s dharma (karma) and d=\r\netachment (jnana) feed and enhance each other. One needs to somehow or the =\r\nother increase them beyond some threshold and fall into the groove.\n=A0\nI w=\r\nill write another mail later, on the meaning of Parashu Rama&#39;s story. As I =\r\nsaid before, Parashu Rama is Venus. Venus shows the spirit of happiness wit=\r\nhin us. So Parashu Rama&#39;s life teaches us various things about happiness in=\r\n general.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous =\r\nAvatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like goin=\r\ng back from the linear progression of spirituality that the Avatars manifes=\r\nt one after the other upto Krshna&quot;. =A0 I want to emphatically disagree wit=\r\nh this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upt=\r\no Krshna&quot;. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each ava=\r\ntara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. =A0 Maharshi Para=\r\nsara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Naras=\r\nimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =A0 We also know that Sun, Moon,=\r\n Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications =\r\nof soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discriminat=\r\nion, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,\n spirit of innov=\r\nation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively). =A0 Correspondingly,=\r\n each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected for=\r\nm. Each story is an example of how that aspect operates. =A0 Lord Rama&#39;s st=\r\nory is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a =\r\nperfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected =\r\nexample of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a =\r\nperfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Now, let us remember one basic th=\r\ning. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in=\r\n us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are different m=\r\nanifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these diffe=\r\nrent aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. There i=\r\ns no comparison between them. =A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,\n =\r\nperfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need balance =\r\nbetween all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supre=\r\nme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working together in the Cosm=\r\nos. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 One who is fasc=\r\ninated by the qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how so=\r\nul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the st=\r\nory that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the q=\r\nualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrates how wisdom operates=\r\n. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. =\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Let us focus on Ram=\r\na and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god =\r\nin us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and ha=\r\ns no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=\r\nnce with some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=\r\ness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=\r\nnd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=\r\n energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=\r\nts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =\r\nimpassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so tha=\r\nt Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=\r\n awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =\r\nAs mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=\r\n notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =\r\nthem fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=\r\nely. =A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functional=\r\nity of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interestin=\r\ng enough\n to some. =A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agen=\r\ndas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achieving =\r\nthings. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!! Thoug=\r\nh soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consciousne=\r\nss, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keep=\r\ns the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and even de=\r\ncides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of=\r\n the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who ma=\r\ny be excited by this description! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Ram=\r\na&#39;s life in perspective. =A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At=\r\n a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. =\r\nYet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after ma=\r\nrriage, he was given\n kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him =\r\nto forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given t=\r\nhe throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-br=\r\nother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all=\r\n three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita =\r\nin the forest with Lakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause pr=\r\noblems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped=\r\n by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sit=\r\na for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. =\r\nHe accepted every life situation with no complaints and did the best possib=\r\nle action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger=\r\n, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him =\r\nand respectfully learned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ra=\r\nvana! =A0 Rama\n is a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or =\r\nagendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentu=\r\nm of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 As another example, let us =\r\nlook at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/di=\r\nscrimination operates. =A0 He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the en=\r\ntire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualiti=\r\nes. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is =\r\ndoing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachmen=\r\nt), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. Whe=\r\nn wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are compl=\r\netely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 P=\r\nlease think about the other avataras. The stories can be understood as perf=\r\nect demonstrations of how various aspects of\n our consciousness operate, ba=\r\nsed on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =A0 Let us not compare Dasavataras, bu=\r\nt celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are more attracted t=\r\no one of them, please think about that avatara more and develop devotion. T=\r\nhey are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By the way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those =\r\nwho celebrate it today (there are different schools of thought). =A0 Best r=\r\negards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org --------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\r\n--61789334-961801329-1367096936=:50568\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: arial=\r\n,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3=\r\n333px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transpare=\r\nnt; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;You should learn from this discrepancy that =\r\nthere is no universally correct dharma.

A learned friend wro=\r\nte that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this s=\r\ntage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progressi=\r\non of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshn=\r\na&quot;. &nbsp; I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars=\r\n of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; * &nbsp; Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form=\r\n. &nbsp; Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, R=\r\nama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars,\n respectively. &nbsp; We=\r\n also\n know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and=\r\n Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning=\r\n spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/d=\r\niscipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectiv=\r\nely). &nbsp; Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect =\r\nof Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect=\r\n operates. &nbsp; Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul oper=\r\nates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lor=\r\nd Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operat=\r\nes. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initi=\r\native operates. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Now, let us remember one basic=\r\n thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in\n us,\n learning spirit in us, wisd=\r\nom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these are differ=\r\nent manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifests as these =\r\ndifferent aspects, it has different qualities and plays different roles. Th=\r\nere is no comparison between them. &nbsp; We MAY focus on one aspect of us =\r\nfirst, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But, we need b=\r\nalance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these different aspects o=\r\nf Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working together in t=\r\nhe Cosmos. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; One who is fascinated by the qualit=\r\nies of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who=\r\n is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrate=\r\ns how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom m=\r\nay like the\n story that\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But t=\r\nhis is just a matter of taste and subjective preference. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; * &nbsp; Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is se=\r\nen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it=\r\n. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes. &nbsp; On=\r\nce mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul suppor=\r\nts the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as=\r\n its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individu=\r\nalized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoy=\r\nment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agenda=\r\ns/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of=\r\n one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits\n later\n=\r\n on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those=\r\n karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individu=\r\nalized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and be=\r\ngetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as =\r\nits dharma and does it impassionately. &nbsp; Now, does this sound exciting=\r\n? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness support=\r\ning the play, may not seem interesting enough to some. &nbsp; On the other =\r\nhand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those=\r\n agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what kee=\r\nps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything=\r\n else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dhar=\r\nma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and br=\r\nings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects\n every entity&#39;s dharma=\r\n. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder K=\r\nrishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description! &=\r\nnbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but le=\r\nt me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective. &nbsp; Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how so=\r\nul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and be=\r\ncame realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra=\r\n. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment, his father=\r\n banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his step-broth=\r\ner was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, step-moth=\r\ner and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself supported an=\r\nd consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Though he knew=\r\n leaving Sita in the\n forest\n with Lakshmana and going after the golden dee=\r\nr would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted. When s=\r\nhe was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battle. He n=\r\never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana for lea=\r\nving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints and did=\r\n the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so without=\r\n hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying,=\r\n he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were going to d=\r\nisappear with Ravana! &nbsp; Rama is a perfect example of a liberated man w=\r\nith no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arisin=\r\ng from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically what sou=\r\nl does! &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; As another example, let us look at\n Lo=\r\nrd\n Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discriminat=\r\nion operates. &nbsp; He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire c=\r\nosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities. &n=\r\nbsp; Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doi=\r\nng good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment),=\r\n one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When w=\r\nisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are complete=\r\nly suppressed. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; Please think about the other av=\r\nataras. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how vari=\r\nous aspects of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Para=\r\nsara. &nbsp; Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them sep=\r\narately. Of course, if you are\n more\n attracted to one of them, please thin=\r\nk about that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of rel=\r\nieving us from samsara. &nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &nbsp; By the way, happy Hanu=\r\nmajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools of =\r\nthought). &nbsp; Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology &amp; Spiritual=\r\nity Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org --------&lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n =\r\n    \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n=\r\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;height:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n        \n  \n  \n    &lt;ta=\r\nble style=3D&quot;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;4px&quot;&gt;\n    =\r\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n          &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:ar=\r\nial;font-weight:bold;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F=\r\n2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;\n                          &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n style=3D&quot;text-decoration:none;color:#2D50FD;&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/post;_ylc=3DX3oDMTJxYXYxNnJ1BF9TAz=\r\nk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzE5MDI5MDE1BGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA3NTk5MQRtc2dJZAM5MjE1BHNlY=\r\nwNmdHIEc2xrA3JwbHkEc3RpbWUDMTM2Njk0MjE3NA--?act=3Dreply&amp;messageNum=3D92=\r\n15&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px =\r\n5px 5px;color:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;colo=\r\nr:#FFF;background-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#FFF;backg=\r\nround-color:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\nize:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#2D50FD;background-col=\r\nor:#F2F2F2;border:1px solid #EAEAEA;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bo=\r\ndy&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--61789334-961801329-1367096936=:50568--\r\n\n"}}
