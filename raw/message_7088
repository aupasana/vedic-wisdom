My sincerest apologies if the below link&#39;s message would be diverting fro=\r\nm the topic,strongly feel it is the same topic.\n\nAgain this might be an cre=\r\nation of my mind :) .\n\nhttp://blog.ishafoundation.org/2011/06/20/a-powerful=\r\n-way-to-transform-yourself/\n\n\n&quot;Every human being, either consciously or unc=\r\nonsciously, through the process of what we call life, creates a certain ima=\r\nge, a certain personality of himself. This image that you have created with=\r\nin yourselves has nothing to do with the reality. It has nothing to do with=\r\n the self, your inner nature. It is a certain image that you have built, mo=\r\nst of the time unconsciously. Everybody has some image of what they are. Ve=\r\nry few human beings have built a conscious image of themselves. All others =\r\nhave built images according to whatever kind of patterns or external situat=\r\nions they fell into.\n\nNow, why don&#39;t we create a new self-image consciously=\r\n, the way you really want to be? If you are intelligent enough, if you are =\r\naware enough, you can recast your image, a totally new image, whichever way=\r\n you really want it. It is possible. But you should be willing to leave the=\r\n old one. This is not pretension. Instead of acting unconsciously, you act =\r\nconsciously. You can create that kind of image which supports you best; tha=\r\nt kind of image which creates maximum harmony around you; that kind of imag=\r\ne which has least friction. You create that kind of an image which is close=\r\nst to your inner nature. What kind of an image, do you think, is closest to=\r\n your inner nature? Please see, the inner nature is very silent, not domina=\r\nnt but very forceful. Very subtle but very forceful. Now that is what we ne=\r\ned to do: the grosser elements within you =96 your anger, your limitations =\r\nmust be chopped off. Create a new self-image, which is subtle but tremendou=\r\nsly forceful.\n\nThink about it for the next one or two days and create a pro=\r\nper image for yourself; what should be the fundamental nature of your thoug=\r\nht and emotion. Before we create something, let&#39;s really see, if what we ar=\r\ne creating now is better than what we have. Choose a time when you would no=\r\nt be disturbed. Sit comfortably with your back rested and be relaxed. Now, =\r\nclose your eyes and visualize how other people should experience you. Creat=\r\ne a whole new human being. Look at it with as much detail as possible. See =\r\nif this new image is more human, more efficient, more loving.\n\nVisualize th=\r\nis new image as powerfully as you can. Make it alive within yourself. If yo=\r\nur thought is powerful enough, if your visualization is powerful enough, it=\r\n can even break the bonds of karma. The karmic limitations can be broken by=\r\n creating a powerful visualization of what you want to be. This is the oppo=\r\nrtunity to transcend all your limitations of thought, emotion and action.&quot;\n=\r\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Naras=\r\nimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people like=\r\n me, some dislike me and some hate me. When someone says \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha is a=\r\n great inspiration to people&quot;, I may be tempted to be \n&gt; happy. When someon=\r\ne says &quot;Narasimha is a deluded person&quot;, I may be \n&gt; tempted to be unhappy. =\r\nBut, who is this &quot;Narasimha&quot; they all refer to? \n&gt; Is it &quot;me&quot; or someone el=\r\nse? More importantly, is he the *same* being or \n&gt; *many different* beings?=\r\n Let us look at it very logically and very \n&gt; systematically.\n&gt; \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; These people commenting on Narasimha may have met me physi=\r\ncally or seen \n&gt; my photo and my emails. If you go by objective reality per=\r\nceived by \n&gt; physical senses, they know me only by my face, looks, facial e=\r\nxpressions \n&gt; when I say things, my spoken words and me written words. Do a=\r\nll their \n&gt; notions and statements about me follow objectively from this ob=\r\njective \n&gt; reality about me that is perceived by senses? Can one say object=\r\nively \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha is a great inspiration to people&quot; or &quot;Narasimha is a de=\r\nluded \n&gt; person&quot; from it? Of course, not.\n&gt; \n&gt; People&#39;s minds are condition=\r\ned by all their prior experiences. They take \n&gt; the tangible cues (written/=\r\nspoken words, facial expressions etc) and \n&gt; guess what is going on in the =\r\nother person&#39;s mind, using their life \n&gt; experiences as a database to look =\r\nup. They think based on the \n&gt; experiences, &quot;If one says or does XYZ, this =\r\nis what is in his mind or \n&gt; this is what he wants&quot;. To one person, a few s=\r\nentences written by me \n&gt; suggest that I have experienced god and I can sho=\r\nw him the path to god. \n&gt; To another person, a few sentences written by me =\r\nsuggest that I know \n&gt; nothing and am desperately seeking followers and fam=\r\ne. And so on! \n&gt; Logically speaking, based strictly on objective reality pe=\r\nrceived by \n&gt; physical senses, none of these conclusions is guaranteed to b=\r\ne correct. \n&gt; Though my true personality is intangible to people, people ar=\r\ne looking \n&gt; at the tangible cues from me and constructing notions of who I=\r\n am, \n&gt; within *their* minds.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone sa=\r\nys &quot;Narasimha is a great inspiration to people&quot;, one is \n&gt; NOT talking abou=\r\nt &quot;me&quot;. One is talking about a character called \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha&quot; that was cra=\r\nted and sustained in one&#39;s mind by oneself. \n&gt; Though this character was cr=\r\neated based on a few tangible cues from me, \n&gt; the significant contribution=\r\n to the creation of this character was from \n&gt; that person&#39;s own mental con=\r\nditioning. So this character need not even \n&gt; be similar to me! It is a tot=\r\nally different being compared to me and \n&gt; exists/lives only in the mind of=\r\n that person!\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone says &quot;Narasimha is a deluded person&quot;, one i=\r\ns NOT talking \n&gt; about &quot;me&quot;. One is talking about a character called &quot;Naras=\r\nimha&quot; that was \n&gt; crated and sustained in one&#39;s mind by oneself. Though thi=\r\ns character was \n&gt; created based on a few tangible cues from me, the signif=\r\nicant \n&gt; contribution to the creation of this character was from that perso=\r\nn&#39;s \n&gt; own mental conditioning. So this character need not even be similar =\r\nto \n&gt; me! It is a totally different being compared to me and exists/lives o=\r\nnly \n&gt; in the mind of that person!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If people =\r\nsay &quot;Narasimha is a great inspiration to people&quot; and I am \n&gt; tempted to fee=\r\nl happy, doesn&#39;t it mean I am foolishly identifying with a \n&gt; character cre=\r\nated and maintained in someone else&#39;s mind? If people say \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha is =\r\na deluded person&quot; and I am tempted to feel unhappy, \n&gt; doesn&#39;t it mean I am=\r\n foolishly identifying with a character created and \n&gt; maintained in someon=\r\ne else&#39;s mind? As these characters are created and \n&gt; maintained in their m=\r\ninds, I have nothing to do with those beings and \n&gt; should not identify wit=\r\nh them, right?\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; To make it even more extreme a=\r\nnd interesting, I will give another set of \n&gt; special examples.\n&gt; \n&gt; A few =\r\npeople had dreams in which I met them and told them to do specific \n&gt; types=\r\n of homam. Some actually started doing homam after the dream and \n&gt; some sa=\r\nid their lives were transformed after the dream. One person, for \n&gt; example=\r\n, cleared a tough & important exam after doing badly in the mock \n&gt; exams. =\r\nAs I never thought of these people (and did not even know of some \n&gt; of the=\r\nm!), I obviously had no direct influence on the dreams they had. \n&gt; The dre=\r\nams were creations of their own minds. The character called \n&gt; &quot;Narasimha&quot; =\r\nwho came in their dreams and transformed their lives, is a \n&gt; being built i=\r\nn their own minds. Based on their reading of my writings \n&gt; and based on th=\r\neir own mental conditioning, they created a powerful \n&gt; character called &quot;N=\r\narasimha&quot; in their sub-conscious minds, who is a very \n&gt; good sadhaka and g=\r\nuru and having the ability to transform people. That \n&gt; powerful character =\r\n(and not me!) came in their dreams and transformed \n&gt; their lives!\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam=\r\ne thing applies to someone who takes me as guru and becomes realized. \n&gt; Ba=\r\nsed on my writings and words and their own mental conditioning, if \n&gt; someo=\r\nne succeeds in creating a powerful character called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in \n&gt; their=\r\n own mind and lets him affect them positively, they can make great \n&gt; spiri=\r\ntual progress. But then, that character is not really me! If \n&gt; someone say=\r\ns &quot;you are my guru&quot;, &quot;you gave me so and so&quot;, &quot;you affected \n&gt; me in so and=\r\n so way&quot;, I will understand that a powerful character they \n&gt; constructed i=\r\nn their minds, with a little input from me, did all of \n&gt; that!\n&gt; \n&gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, one specific example stands out. In this case, the =\r\nperson did not \n&gt; know me, never heard of me and did not know of my website=\r\n. This person \n&gt; just had a dream in which someone came and said, &quot;I am Nar=\r\nasimha Rao. \n&gt; You do so and so homam with so and so mantra&quot; and gave a man=\r\ntra. This \n&gt; person remembered the dream and did a google search next morni=\r\nng and \n&gt; landed on my website. The photo in my website apparently matches =\r\nthe \n&gt; person in the dream. This surprised the person and gave faith.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAgain, I had no clue and did not know this person at all. So, rationally \n&gt;=\r\n speaking, I had no role to play in this! In this case, this person did \n&gt; =\r\nnot even read my emails or other writings and hence &quot;I&quot; had no direct or \n&gt;=\r\n indirect role in the dream. The phenomenon that a character called \n&gt; &quot;Nar=\r\nasimha Rao&quot; was constructed in that person&#39;s sub-conscious mind with \n&gt; som=\r\ne similarities with me (looks and spiritual interest) is interesting, \n&gt; bu=\r\nt does not mean that character is me. Either the person did know about \n&gt; m=\r\ne sometime back and forgot (but remembered sub-consciously), or some \n&gt; for=\r\nce up there manipulated that mind. In either case, it is not of my \n&gt; doing=\r\n and the character in the dream is a creation of that force and \n&gt; that min=\r\nd and not me.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that there are no=\r\ntions in the minds of people who met us \n&gt; in some manner (and possibly eve=\r\nn in people who did not meet us), which \n&gt; we may be tempted to identify wi=\r\nth and say &quot;that is I&quot;. Positive and \n&gt; negative comments on those notional=\r\n beings give us pride and shame, \n&gt; happiness and sadness! How weird!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAs you cling on to more and more identities, you are stuck more and \n&gt; more=\r\n. If you think logically and impassionately, you will see that all \n&gt; these=\r\n characters are someone else&#39;s creations and different from you. So \n&gt; they=\r\n are not &quot;I&quot;. As you drop off one identity after another, you become \n&gt; ver=\r\ny light. Your mind becomes very clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, l=\r\net us come to a fundamental question. We saw that the notions of \n&gt; &quot;Narasi=\r\nmha&quot; in the minds of people are not based on objective reality \n&gt; alone and=\r\n based on their own conditioning and created (and grown over \n&gt; time!) in t=\r\nheir own minds! Now, what about the notion of &quot;Narasimha&quot; in \n&gt; my own mind=\r\n? Is that based on objective reality or is it also created \n&gt; (and grown ov=\r\ner time!) in my own mind based on my own conditioning? If \n&gt; so, who is the=\r\n real &quot;I&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; I will let you contemplate on it!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;           =\r\n         http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; --------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
