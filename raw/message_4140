On=\r\n the topic of Amavasya ...is not the full moon also said to represent 16 ka=\r\nlas which is the same as merger of the sun and moon which is again similar =\r\nto Amavasya which is 0 kalas giving rise to the two forms of the mother as =\r\nKali and Durga.\n\nTheoretically was convinced of this however using modern s=\r\ncience cannot convince myself enough ...gravitation should only slightly in=\r\ncrease during a Full moon or New moon. Also it looks like large bodies of w=\r\nater are suspectible to this effect more than enclosed bodies of water like=\r\n a human body...\n\nI feel intuitively that maybe people will run berserk on =\r\nfull moon and new moon however do not find any real world corroboration of =\r\nthe fact.( studies are there for new moon as well which also found no signi=\r\nficant statistical evidence of the same .... ) \n\nI know science is the wron=\r\ng tool to try to find an correlation ...maybe it is not even gravitation an=\r\nd maybe some other force but am puzzled why it cannot be manifested in some=\r\nthing tangible as admission rates in a hospital. \n\n\nMy Core Concern was may=\r\nbe it is true that Kali yuga has corrupted the spiritual sciences , astrolo=\r\ngy , calendar and ritual system so much that it is best to proceed with sin=\r\ncere devotion using any simple spiritual sadhana like homa , tarpana or med=\r\nitative practises rather than elaborate rituals , formulas ,intonations etc=\r\n.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nHemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste:\n&gt; \n&gt; I thought New Moo=\r\nn day is suppose to be good for meditation/sadhana, as new\n&gt; moon phenomeno=\r\nn is taken as the symbol of the merger of the mind (moon) with\n&gt; the soul (=\r\nsun). This state of existence is called amohavasam (a life bereft\n&gt; of all =\r\ndesires), and hence the name Amavasi.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand during Pournam=\r\ni, moon has power to to excite (e.g., tides)\n&gt; and make people run berserk =\r\n!\n&gt; \n&gt; But I do know Guru Pournami is considered as very auspicious.

Theref=\r\nore choosing different\n&gt; &gt; times for meditation may make a difference. I ha=\r\nve not heard that full moon\n&gt; &gt; meditation is particularly useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nUnder western astrology, there are certain planetary aspects that enhance\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; various activities. These vary according to the planets and angles invol=\r\nved.\n&gt; &gt; Meditation may fall into this category. Again, these times may or =\r\nmay not\n&gt; &gt; have to do with full moon cycles.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether the masses ar=\r\ne becoming less spiritual is not something to which I\n&gt; &gt; can attest, yet I=\r\n believe that belief in the religion of science, as\n&gt; &gt; epitomied by Scient=\r\nific American, helps to lessen modern people&#39;s belief in\n&gt; &gt; traditional wa=\r\nys. The publishers of that magazine have an agenda, which is\n&gt; &gt; to diminis=\r\nh people&#39;s belief in traditions and to separate them from living\n&gt; &gt; accord=\r\ning to traditional calendars and schemes of time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards, Jacques\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On *Wed, 7/4/10, vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;*wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Full Moon effect on Meditation\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Received: Wednesday, 7 April, 2010, 4:33 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha ji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have read the advice of many spiritual masters=\r\n and other seers say that\n&gt; &gt; an full moon meditation is very beneficial . =\r\nAlso related to this is the\n&gt; &gt; question of how do planets really affect us=\r\n , Vimalananda in the aghora\n&gt; &gt; books says it is through the rasa or food =\r\nthat is ingested by us.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I know science does not yet possess the rig=\r\nht tools to measure this\n&gt; &gt; phenomena and einstein&#39;s grand search for a un=\r\nified filed theory and the\n&gt; &gt; universal particle is still ongoing and migh=\r\nt take ages for modern science\n&gt; &gt; to understand the workings of even a com=\r\nmonplace phenomena like gravitation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However a simple test like adm=\r\nission rates in a mental aslyum should hold\n&gt; &gt; up to proof if the moon is =\r\ntruly having a effect on humans.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.scientif icamerican. co=\r\nm/article. cfm?id=3Dlunacy- and-the-full-\n&gt; &gt; moon&lt;http://www.scientificame=\r\nrican.com/article.cfm?id=3Dlunacy-and-the-full-moon&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This artic=\r\nle in the scientific american finds no such correlation. ..also\n&gt; &gt; there h=\r\nave been many studies in the past some for and some against this\n&gt; &gt; correl=\r\nation effect but none of them found a strong evidence.... And always\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nere is the risk of mistaking correlation as causation in any experiment.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is just out of curiosity that am asking this question...Does astro=\r\nlogy\n&gt; &gt; matter at all for a serious sadhaka. Can not any day /time or hour=\r\n be picked\n&gt; &gt; for worship. If the relationship with the deity is truly per=\r\nsonal why should\n&gt; &gt; one even consider the nava grahas in the ritual worshi=\r\np. I increasingly find\n&gt; &gt; that astrology is only serving to discourage the=\r\n masses rather than pointing\n&gt; &gt; them in the direction of worship of divini=\r\nty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope you could throw some light on this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Ve=\r\nmparla Ram Kishore\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
