Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n          ï»¿   Namaste,\n   \n  There are really two different things here.\n   \n  Some people are born with an amsa (part) of a rishi&#39;s consciousness. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was one of the seven great rishis. Many people did meet him. Thus, meeting the physical manifestation of an amsa of a rishi is not that difficult (though that also requires some punya).\n   \n  The second thing is to meet the physical manifestation of the entire consciousness of a rishi. *That* is very very very difficult. As Vimalananda said, that may require a terrific amount of tapascharya (unless you are one of that rishi&#39;s people who came to do some work on earth and have already done a terrific amount of tapascharya in past lives).\n   \n  *        *        *\n   \n  One may wonder: If rishis are so great, why do they not get moksha and why do they remain in physical manifestation?\n   \n  Though the following is essentially like a kindergartener explaining Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity to fellow kindergarteners, I will nevertheless try to explain it.\n   \n  All that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is created by the power of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, known variously as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undivided consciousness is known as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality, where there are many different objects, is also actually Brahman only, but Brahman that went through some modification and manifestation. It is known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both are Brahman only.\n   \n  Normally, living in the domain of duality without being deluded by some aspect of duality or the other is near to impossible. Remaining in duality with a perfect understanding of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving all those objects of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion for any single object of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no objectification - and become absorbed in that state forever. That is the advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n   \n  However, maharshis have described higher states. It is possible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain in a state where there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object is possible.\n   \n  Such a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also experienced it.\n   \n  Rishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much do anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, it means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for personal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and implements the wish of nature through one&#39;s actions, which are performed without any attachment or personal identification. One who has a personal ego can do limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. One who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are desired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can change the course of history of nations and planets.\n   \n  A rishi in this state may engage in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is no attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nature.\n   \n  If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmanifested Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal vision of unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated). Thus, he will freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion. Amsa of such a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as a process running in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some focussed task. Even if the computer process has finished all the initialization and early work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initialization etc again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the process of overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a Vivekananda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initially and overcome the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is the amsa of an ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.\n   \n  Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and with the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument of Nature performing actions of tremendous consequences without any personal ego driving those actions.\n   \n    *        *        *\n\n   \n  Worshipping the rishi of one&#39;s gotra and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, getting the blessings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of one&#39;s gotra is relatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connection with a specific rishi (apart from the rishi of one&#39;s gotra), one can worship that rishi. However, it is not easy to know that.\n   \n  Suppose several mantras you find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific Maharshi as the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. You can try praying to him.\n   \n  Best regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, September 25, 2008 1:30 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Anyone knows mantra for Kashyap Rishi?\n            \nDear Narasimhaji\n   \n  I had a question about Rishis. In the Aghora books, it is mentioned that the Rishis of yesteryears are still alive and roam around in this planet.

You can simply pick one rik for which Kashyapa is rishi and keep meditating on that rik. You can close your eyes, keep back straight and repeat the rik mentally with swaram without moving and do that everyday for a certain amount of time. Oneday the rishi may be pleased with you and you may experience something.\n   \n  Best regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n \n  &gt; Dear Respected Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; My gotra is Kashyap.

In the Aghora books, it is mentioned that the Rishis of yesteryears are still alive and roam around in this planet. There are signs on their body.And that only some who has done terrific amount of tapashya is eligible to meet a Rishi. And also that praying to Rishi of ones gotra can help to acclerate ones spirtual progress. Kindly enlighten us with your thoughts on this topic. I am really curious..&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=Arial size=2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;  &lt;DIV class=MsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 25/9/08, Narasimha P.V.R.
