Even so this insentient body-en=\r\ngine cannot move without an\n&gt; intelligent driver, who is God or Ishvar.From=\r\n the existence of the body you\n&gt; can infer the existence of the hidden driv=\r\ner of the body-engine.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is display of intelligence in every inch =\r\nof creation. Who pumps blood\n&gt; into the arteries? Who converts food into ch=\r\nyle and red-coloured blood? Who\n&gt; effects the peristalsis in the bowels and=\r\n stomach and controls the process\n&gt; of assimilation and elimination. Who sh=\r\nuts the eye lids to prevent dust from\n&gt; falling into the delicate eyes? Who=\r\n gave intelligence to the cells and\n&gt; glands to secrete milk, bile, saliva,=\r\n gastric juice, etc., from the blood?\n&gt; Who gave intelligence and power to =\r\nthe spermatozoa to move, unite with the\n&gt; ovum in the womb and develop into=\r\n a foetus? Wherefrom does this minutest,\n&gt; subtlest substance, Jiva, as min=\r\nute as the tiniest grain of sand, derive the\n&gt; capacity to assume gradually=\r\n the features, complexion and shape of its\n&gt; parents? What is the power whi=\r\nch sustains it and helps its growth in the\n&gt; mother=E2=80=99s womb? Who arr=\r\nanges for milk in the mother=E2=80=99s breast before the child\n&gt; is born ?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; How wonderful is the human machine? How harmoniously all the organs wo=\r\nrk in\n&gt; unison in\n&gt; the economy of nature? In Gita this body is known as na=\r\nvadvara-puri or\n&gt; nine-gate city. In summer the skin works energetically to=\r\n throw off all\n&gt; impurities of the blood and to relieve the kidneys which h=\r\nad over-worked in\n&gt; winter. The endocrine, pituitary, pineal, adrenal gland=\r\ns work in perfect\n&gt; harmony in manufacturing the internal secretions, and t=\r\nhe hormones to help\n&gt; the metabolic process of the body, growth and structu=\r\nre.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a great marvel to see the working of the nervous system unde=\r\nr the\n&gt; control of brain and the movement of the impulses through the spina=\r\nl cord.\n&gt; There is a magnificent, electric battery inside with switchboard =\r\nand wires.\n&gt; The operator is Antaryamin (inner ruler, or God) who controls =\r\nand supervises\n&gt; everything. He is Upadrashta (supervisor), Anumanta (permi=\r\ntter) and Maheswar\n&gt; (the great Lord). Look at the heart and lungs which wo=\r\nrk under the direct\n&gt; control of the brain. How wonderful are these three v=\r\nital organs the tripods\n&gt; of life? Can an eminent scientist manufacture any=\r\n of these organs, tissues,\n&gt; fibres, tendons or cells in his laboratory wit=\r\nh his intellects?\n&gt; \n&gt; How harmoniously the different systems such as the d=\r\nigestive system,\n&gt; circulatory system,nervous system, integumentary system,=\r\n work without any\n&gt; rest! How beautifully the different centres in the brai=\r\nn such as the\n&gt; vision-centre, authority-centre, centre of smell, etc., do =\r\ntheir functions.\n&gt; One is struck with awe and wonder when he begins to thin=\r\nk seriously of the\n&gt; structure and working of this delicate human machinery=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; To think that this most wonderful mechanism is the result and produc=\r\nt of a\n&gt; fortuitous\n&gt; combination of matter or atoms is simply absurd and r=\r\nidiculous indeed! It\n&gt; has been, doubtless,moulded and fashioned by some ar=\r\nchitect, who is\n&gt; infinitely more skilful, intelligent and powerful than th=\r\ne ordinary\n&gt; architects who build palaces and bungalows. That architect is =\r\nGod or Ishvar\n&gt; or Creator. Call him by any name. It does not matter much.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: GOD EXISTS By SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82 =\r\n =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=\r\n  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=82\n&gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
