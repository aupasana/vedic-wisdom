Thanks to all (Narasimha ji in particular) for providing a lot of\nillu=\r\nminating thoughts which have refined my understanding.\nHere is my question:=\r\n\nRecently I read this post\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/mess=\r\nage/6718&gt;  . In that\nNarasimha ji wrote, &quot;Dharma, artha, kama and moksha ar=\r\ne associated with\nring, middle, little and index fingers.......When we medi=\r\ntate or hold a\nmala or make offerings in homam, thumb (ahamkara) is associa=\r\nted with one\nor more of purusharthas. The most popular mudra is tips of thu=\r\nmb and\nindex finger touching each other. It increase  knowledge and\ndetachm=\r\nent.&quot;\nI was under the impression that, in Chin mudra (to which he was\nrefer=\r\nring to, I guess) the index finger represents Individual\nConsciousness - Ji=\r\nvatma/ahamkara, while the thumb represents Supreme\nConsciousness - paramatm=\r\na/moksha. The index finger touching the thumb\nmeaning the &#39;Atman&#39; merges in=\r\nto the &#39;Paramatman&#39; leading to the\nculmination of Yoga. This is how I under=\r\nstood the chin mudra as shown by\nGuru Dakshinamurthi and Sri Ayyappa. (of c=\r\nourse, my sources are from the\nnet and other texts which I came across)\nHow=\r\never in the quoted text, index finger and thumb have been assigned\nmoksha a=\r\nnd ahamkara respectively. Then Chin mudra would mean that\nmoksha/paramata b=\r\nending towards ahamkara/jivatma. I could not reconcile\nbetween this apparen=\r\nt contradiction.  I searched in this forum for chin\nmudra and read this pos=\r\nt\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/167&gt;  , but it\nwasn&#39;t=\r\n mentioning this aspect of mudra.
