If you do not know the \nright deity, just doi=\r\nng some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick \nwhatever deity see=\r\nms natural to you and do sadhana.\n\nPlease remember that sadhana for spiritu=\r\nal progress is different from \nsadhana for specific material benefits. No m=\r\natter which deity you worship, \nsadhana performed for spiritual progress ne=\r\nver goes waste. However, \nsometimes it may be necessary to experience the r=\r\nesults of some bad karmas \nbefore some good things happen. Imagine all your=\r\n karmas lying in a pile in a \nbasket. Suppose some of the really good karma=\r\ns that will enable you to do \nserious sadhana and experience great things l=\r\nie at the bottom or middle of \nthe pile. When you start sadhana, suppose go=\r\nd decides to give you the fruits \nof those auspicious karmas. Imagine him r=\r\neaching into the pile and \nretrieving those karmas. In the process, some ot=\r\nher karmas may spill over \nand give their fruits. Some of those may be unde=\r\nsirable. So what? They had \nto be experienced sometime or the other, anyway=\r\n!\n\nA serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly \nundes=\r\nirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.\n\nOne ge=\r\nntleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good \npriest-cum-yogi =\r\nin late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he was \nlaid off and =\r\nlost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sadhana \nand used the =\r\nbreak to go on an extended trip to India and make a pilgrimage \nto some nic=\r\ne places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted \nat the Ka=\r\nalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got \nthe oppo=\r\nrtunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the house \nof a pr=\r\niest during the homam. He could observe and interact with my guru \nvery clo=\r\nsely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision of the Mother on \n2006 Ma=\r\nrch 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start the work on spreading \nhoma=\r\nm in the world, this gentleman was present there. Though he could not \nsee =\r\nthe Mother, he actually smelled something out of the world and was \nbaffled=\r\n. He knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple \nwas cl=\r\nosed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people \non th=\r\ne premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the \nMoth=\r\ner, it was most fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial \nmom=\r\nent. That is enough to mould the rest of his life.\n\nYou never know how, whe=\r\nn and where the grace of god falls on you. \nCalculations and logic are usel=\r\ness when it comes to the grace of god. Just \nsurrender and keep doing whate=\r\nver sadhana you picked. If it needs \nfine-tuning, somebody will appear to t=\r\nell you that. Any bad things that \nhappen when doing a spiritual sadhana sh=\r\nould be viewed as nature settling \nsome debts so that you are prepared to r=\r\neceive the fruits of some really \nauspicious karmas.\n\nAs Shirdi Sai Baba sa=\r\nys, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. Have devotion \nand patience. Ther=\r\ne is no limit to what you can get then.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.=\r\ncom/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. hom=\r\ne.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n-----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n&gt; Namaste Sir\n&gt; what you said makes a lot sense and it was=\r\n marvellous\n&gt; but i have some small doubts\n&gt;\n&gt; Leaving astrology aside and =\r\nthose who do not have a guru\n&gt; how can they chooose a particular form of GO=\r\nD\n&gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity\n&gt; i=\r\ns very important, as the analogy he gave of a person\n&gt; who is greedy and wo=\r\nrships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing more\n&gt; we have so man=\r\ny deities that on diwali i would like to worship\n&gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n&gt; in na=\r\nvaratri (nowadays) we would worship Durga\n&gt; on janmashtami we would fast fo=\r\nr KRISHNA\n&gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA\n&gt; like this\n&gt; with hte change in=\r\n festival the deity changes\n&gt;\n&gt; though everybody knows GOD is ONE but it be=\r\ncomes difficult to get\n&gt; out of this\n&gt; mould and if i didnt worship her may=\r\n be that GOD/GODDESS may become\n&gt; angry\n&gt;\n&gt; I Know,this is my foolishness b=\r\nut stiil this thing hangs in the mind\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose if i c=\r\nhoose a deity and something wrong happens\n&gt; (materiallistically )\n&gt;\n&gt; what =\r\nshould i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my\n&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DE=\r\nEDS\n&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as I am not fit\n&gt; fo=\r\nr that DEITY\n&gt;\n&gt; and sometimes you feel\n&gt; o what am i doing does this reall=\r\ny works\n&gt;\n&gt; and one thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; what if we go on doing our pooja and som=\r\neday\n&gt; something like what happened to Pt.

I will\n&gt; continue in\n&gt;&gt; the same v=\r\nein for a little more time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I had a dream a couple of years ago early=\r\n in the morning. In the\n&gt; dream,\n&gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Ma=\r\nnish Pandit and I were\n&gt; sitting in\n&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching m=\r\ne some pranayama techniques in\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into so=\r\nmebody else that I could not\n&gt; recognize.\n&gt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen =\r\nbefore.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. Fi=\r\nrst\n&gt; he said he\n&gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was and said he would=\r\n&#39;ve\n&gt; probably known if\n&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon after it had happ=\r\nened. I left it\n&gt; there.\n&gt;&gt; However, when we talked in the next weekend, he=\r\n referred to my\n&gt; dream and\n&gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it was. He gave me a=\r\n name and asked me to\n&gt; search on\n&gt;&gt; the internet for his photo and see if =\r\nhe was the person I saw in\n&gt; my dream.\n&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of=\r\n Paramahamsa Yogananda (before\n&gt; him). Though\n&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-know=\r\nn, I was not knowledegable about this\n&gt; lineage and\n&gt;&gt; did not see his pict=\r\nure before. I searched on the internet and\n&gt; found a\n&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingl=\r\ny, the photo was very close to the person I saw\n&gt; in my\n&gt;&gt; dream. The perso=\r\nn that Manish transformed into in my dream looked\n&gt; like a\n&gt;&gt; slightly youn=\r\nger version of that photo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only s=\r\nmiled and\n&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt;&gt; are so many links between various li=\r\nneages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya =\r\nyoga or about the\n&gt; lineage of\n&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of thi=\r\ns life starts from\n&gt; Dattatreya. We\n&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa and his\n&gt; lineage and got\n&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspi=\r\nration and perhaps experience from\n&gt; them. We do\n&gt;&gt; not have any direct lin=\r\nk to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.\n&gt; But,\n&gt;&gt; Manish thought there w=\r\nere some other indirect links. Moreover, he\n&gt; guessed\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even th=\r\nough I myself had no idea who I saw, and he\n&gt; guessed\n&gt;&gt; correctly. That sh=\r\nould count for something!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed=\r\n subtle connections\n&gt; between\n&gt;&gt; several lineages that seem disjoint today.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of\n&gt; =\r\nSri\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)\n&gt;=\r\n and\n&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted\n&gt; me =\r\nwithin a\n&gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa\n&gt; Yog=\r\nananda were\n&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is th=\r\ne\n&gt; keeper of\n&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yu=\r\nkteshwar\n&gt; Maharaj.\n&gt;&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed that knowledg=\r\ne and spent a\n&gt; day at my\n&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small connection was made wi=\r\nth a representative\n&gt; of that\n&gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, s=\r\nome karmik debts may\n&gt; have been\n&gt;&gt; there...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to ma=\r\nke one thing clear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the impr=\r\nession that my\n&gt; guru has\n&gt;&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may in=\r\ndeed be true. But he\n&gt; always\n&gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no imp=\r\nortance whatsoever. He\n&gt; says,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and low=\r\ner than dirt and capable\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the c=\r\nonnection between every\n&gt; entity in\n&gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idi=\r\not like me as an instrument\n&gt; sometimes\n&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I hav=\r\ne no special abilities of any\n&gt; kind. Any\n&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just=\r\n Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I realized in time that this simplicit=\r\ny, humility and lack of ego\n&gt; is not\n&gt;&gt; fake. I also realized that this lac=\r\nk of ego is what enabled him to\n&gt; do things\n&gt;&gt; that sound impossible or dif=\r\nficult. In fact, I realized that many\n&gt; great\n&gt;&gt; saints in the past were li=\r\nke this. Several magical things happened\n&gt; through\n&gt;&gt; them, but they did no=\r\nt find any pride in them and retained their\n&gt; humility\n&gt;&gt; and sense of surr=\r\nender to their chosen form of god and believed\n&gt; that god\n&gt;&gt; was the doer o=\r\nf all things and they were mere instruments.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The day you also start b=\r\nelieving that, not for the sake of\n&gt; lecturing or\n&gt;&gt; posturing, but from th=\r\ne deep cores of your heart, your sadhana\n&gt; will bear\n&gt;&gt; fruit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n/ homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tar=\r\npana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message -----=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;=\r\nNarasimha P.V.R.

If you do not know t=\r\nhe &lt;BR&gt;right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiti=\r\nng. Pick &lt;BR&gt;whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ple=\r\nase remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from &lt;BR&gt;sadh=\r\nana for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nsadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, &lt;BR&gt;som=\r\netimes it may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;before some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in=\r\n a &lt;BR&gt;basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you =\r\nto do &lt;BR&gt;serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or =\r\nmiddle of &lt;BR&gt;the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give=\r\n you the fruits &lt;BR&gt;of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into t=\r\nhe pile and &lt;BR&gt;retrieving those karmas. In the\n process, some other karmas=\r\n may spill over &lt;BR&gt;and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable=\r\n. So what? They had &lt;BR&gt;to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nundesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good &lt;BR&gt;pr=\r\niest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he was =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sadha=\r\nna &lt;BR&gt;and used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pil=\r\ngrimage &lt;BR&gt;to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam =\r\nwe conducted &lt;BR&gt;at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met=\r\n my guru and got &lt;BR&gt;the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we=\r\n stayed at the house &lt;BR&gt;of a priest during the homam. He could observe and=\r\n interact with my guru &lt;BR&gt;very closely.\n Most importantly, when my guru ha=\r\nd a vision of the Mother on &lt;BR&gt;2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told h=\r\nim to start the work on spreading &lt;BR&gt;homam in the world, this gentleman wa=\r\ns present there. Though he could not &lt;BR&gt;see the Mother, he actually smelle=\r\nd something out of the world and was &lt;BR&gt;baffled. He knew something was goi=\r\nng on, but did not know what. The temple &lt;BR&gt;was closed at the time and my =\r\nguru and this gentlemen were the only people &lt;BR&gt;on the premises when the M=\r\nother appeared. Even though he could not see the &lt;BR&gt;Mother, it was most fo=\r\nrtunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial &lt;BR&gt;moment. That is en=\r\nough to mould the rest of his life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You never know how, when and whe=\r\nre the grace of god falls on you. &lt;BR&gt;Calculations and logic are useless wh=\r\nen it comes to the grace of god. Just &lt;BR&gt;surrender and keep doing whatever=\r\n sadhana you picked. If it needs &lt;BR&gt;fine-tuning, somebody will appear to t=\r\nell you that. Any bad things that\n &lt;BR&gt;happen when doing a spiritual sadhan=\r\na should be viewed as nature settling &lt;BR&gt;some debts so that you are prepar=\r\ned to receive the fruits of some really &lt;BR&gt;auspicious karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Sh=\r\nirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. Have devotion &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;and patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best rega=\r\nrds,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/=\r\n group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicas=\r\ntro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJ=\r\nagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Sir&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; what you said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but i have =\r\nsome small doubts&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do =\r\nnot have a guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how can they chooose a particular form of GOD&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; is very important, as the analogy he gave of a person&lt;BR&gt;&gt; who is gr=\r\needy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One thin=\r\ng more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; we have so many deities that on\n diwali i would like to wors=\r\nhip&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lakshmi and Kali&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we would worsh=\r\nip Durga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an on MAH=\r\nASHIVARATRI for SHIVA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with hte change in festival=\r\n the deity changes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; though everybody knows GOD is ONE but it=\r\n becomes difficult to get&lt;BR&gt;&gt; out of this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mould and if i didnt =\r\nworship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become&lt;BR&gt;&gt; angry&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One thing more&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppose if i choose a deity and =\r\nsomething wrong happens&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (materiallistically )&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what =\r\nshould i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; DEBTS/WR=\r\nONG DEEDS&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as I am =\r\nnot fit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for that DEITY&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and sometimes you feel&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; o what am i doing does this really\n works&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and one thing =\r\nmore&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what if we go on doing our pooja and someday&lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\nomething like what happened to Pt.

In the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\nitting in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama =\r\ntechniques in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into some=\r\nbody else that I could not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; recognize.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was not anybod=\r\ny I had seen\n before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my =\r\nguru after a couple of weeks. First&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he said he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not =\r\nknow who the other person was and said he would&#39;ve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; probably known i=\r\nf&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left =\r\nit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when we talked in the next weekend, =\r\nhe referred to my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it =\r\nwas. He gave me a name and asked me to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; search on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the in=\r\nternet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my dream=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (befo=\r\nre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him). Though&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not =\r\nknowledegable about this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not see his pi=\r\ncture before. I searched on the internet and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; found a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ph=\r\noto. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in=\r\n\n my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my dream=\r\n looked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; are so many links between vari=\r\nous lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, I do no=\r\nt know much about kriya yoga or about the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Pa=\r\nramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dattatrey=\r\na. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and =\r\nhis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and got&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration=\r\n and perhaps experience from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. We do&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; not have any d=\r\nirect link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; Manish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who\n I saw=\r\n, and he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for somet=\r\nhing!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed s=\r\nubtle connections&lt;BR&gt;&gt; between&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; several lineages that seem di=\r\nsjoint today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also ap=\r\npeared in the prison cell of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote b=\r\nrilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; impart=\r\ned him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamiji fro=\r\nm Puri contacted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me within a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; few days after I saw that =\r\nphoto. His guru and Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yogananda were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; co-disci=\r\nples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; keeper of&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharaj.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; He visited me after a month,\n discussed that =\r\nknowledge and spent a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; day at my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small=\r\n connection was made with a representative&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; line=\r\nage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have bee=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; there...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; I want to make one thing clear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Some things I men=\r\ntion like this may give the impression that my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guru has&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n always&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whats=\r\noever. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; says,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and l=\r\nower than dirt and capable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her po=\r\nwer. She is the connection between every&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entity in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; this=\r\n universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sometim=\r\nes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no\n special abilities of a=\r\nny&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind. Any&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just Her grace a=\r\nnd not due to me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I realized in time that this sim=\r\nplicity, humility and lack of ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; fake. I also r=\r\nealized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; do things&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; great&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several magical=\r\n things happened&lt;BR&gt;&gt; through&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; them, but they did not find an=\r\ny pride in them and retained their&lt;BR&gt;&gt; humility&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and sense o=\r\nf surrender to their chosen form of god and believed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that god&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake of&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; lecturing or&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of your =\r\nheart, your sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; will\n bear&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; fruit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Y=\r\nourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Do Pit=\r\nri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. h=\r\nome.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath\n Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; ----- Original =\r\nMessage ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Sen=\r\nt: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Y=\r\nogananda (Re: Dharma)&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
