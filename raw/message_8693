The neighbourhood temple to Ganesha is=\r\n where they light a lamp, break\na coconut and hope fervently that the deity=\r\n also known as =E2=80=98Remover of\nObstacles=E2=80=99 will pitch in to help=\r\n. This belief comes with ancient stories of\nhis prowess, even of his mount,=\r\n the rat, which can reach any corner of the\nworld and burrow through a moun=\r\ntain, even.\n\n Ganesha took many forms as visualised in the Mudgala Purana t=\r\no show the\npath to success. Of them, eight are particularly significant. Fi=\r\nrst, in his\nincarnation as Vakratunda or the one with a curved trunk when h=\r\ne vanquished\nthe demon Matsarasura. Matsara means jealousy and the anger bo=\r\nrn thereof.\nHis very birth is ascribed to a remiss by Indra and true to his=\r\n nature the\ndemon desired to rule all the three worlds. His boon of fearles=\r\nsness from\nShiva helped him and soon he was tormenting everyone, heady with=\r\n power.\nVakratunda cut him down to size. He comes riding a lion. He says, h=\r\nowever\nwell endowed you are, wisdom lies in  knowing and understanding your=\r\n limits.\n\n Second, his avatar as Ekdanta or the one-tusked one was taken in=\r\n order to\nsubdue Madasura or the demon of vanity. In this avatar Ganesha st=\r\nresses the\nneed to not let illusions enter your head and intoxicate you wit=\r\nh pride.\nThis is possible only when you understand that you are but a part =\r\nof the\ndivine and that the divine energy is acting through you. So give up =\r\npride\nin the self.\n\n\n\nThird, Ganesha as Mohadara teaches us to get rid of m=\r\noha or attachment by\nkilling the demon Moha. Fourth, as Gajanana he kills t=\r\nhe demon Lobha or\ngreed. Fifth, as Lambodara he overcomes krodha or the dem=\r\non of anger. Lust\nis another demon of undoing and so sixth is Ganesha=E2=80=\r\n=99s incarnation as a\ndeformed Vikata who destroys the demon Kama. Seventh,=\r\n as Vignaraja, he\ndestroys the ogre of self-indulgence.\n\n\n\nIn his eigth inc=\r\narnation as Dhumravarna he cuts at the root of it all,\nahankara or arroganc=\r\ne. Brahma felt the sun, the sustainer of life, deserved\nthe post of the min=\r\nister of life actions and so appointed him as such. With\nthis, the sun beca=\r\nme  so arrogant, that when he suddenly sneezed, the\npersonification of arro=\r\ngance, Ahantasura, was born. The terror he was\nwreaking and the misery he w=\r\nas bringing by his sheer arrogance was\nunimaginable. Eventually the gods pr=\r\nayed to Ganesha, asking him to end\ntheir suffering at the hands of Ahantasu=\r\nra.\n\n\n\nGanesha appeared as a smoke-coloured deity riding a rat. Ahantasura =\r\nwas\novercome. Arrogance is the root of self-destruction, says Dhumravarna. =\r\nEven\nthough the sun is so powerful, his arrogance created havoc in the worl=\r\nd.\n\n\n\nGanesha is elephant-faced, pot bellied and with short legs because he=\r\n has\nno ego. And that is why the attributes which would otherwise be seen a=\r\ns\ndisproportionate and strange now become endearing. We all have eight\nnega=\r\ntive energies in some measure in us and we need to overcome them in\norder t=\r\no control the ego. The ills that derive from these negative emotions\nmanife=\r\nst in a similar manner. It is divine power that makes you powerful,\nbeautif=\r\nul, desired=E2=80=A6 so do not ascribe it all to yourself, says Ganesha and=\r\n\nthat remains the most valuable lesson to success.
