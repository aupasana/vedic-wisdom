No, fulfilling respo=\r\nnsibility to wife, children, parents etc is not a blockage of the spiritual=\r\n path.\n=A0\nIf one&#39;s ego gets inflated as a result of that engagement or if =\r\none&#39;s desires start getting multiplied as a result of that engagement, then=\r\n THAT becomes a blockage in the spiritual path.\n=A0\nSadly, one often does n=\r\not know how to give, without also taking something back while giving. Even =\r\nas one thinks that one is *giving*, one&#39;s mind is more focused on the &quot;taki=\r\nng&quot; part of the engagement.\n=A0\nFor example, suppose one is not interested =\r\nin wealth, but earns good money because one&#39;s spouse wants it and one wants=\r\n to give that happiness to spouse. Yet, one becomes proud of or attached to=\r\n that wealth in the process. Eventually, what started as something done for=\r\n spouse, becomes one&#39;s own pursuit.\n=A0\nAs another example, suppose one is =\r\nnot interested in sex, but engages in it because spouse wants it. As one en=\r\ngages in it, one may start to enjoy it and focus the mind more on one&#39;s own=\r\n pleasure (than focusing the mind fully on the other person&#39;s pleasure and =\r\ntrying one&#39;s best to give pleasure to other person).\n=A0\nOne may start some=\r\n voluntary work at a temple and see it as service at first. But pride and a=\r\nttachment develop and one may expect recognition from others for the &quot;selfl=\r\ness&quot; work. One may even want a good administrative position at the temple i=\r\nn recognition of one&#39;s work. Like that, an engagement started as an act of =\r\ngiving becomes entangled with pride, self-worth, desire and attachment and =\r\nbecomes more about taking than giving. It becomes about oneself than giving=\r\n others.\n=A0\nTHIS in a nutshell is the problem with engaging with the world=\r\n. But the bottomline is this: If you have a lot of rinas to others, you can=\r\nnot make spiritual progress without engaging with others and somehow managi=\r\nng to pay off those rinas. So, somehow you have to learn giving others self=\r\nlessly, without making it about yourself in the end! In all your relationsh=\r\nips, watch out for this tendency to make it about yourself and about what y=\r\nou are getting and consciously and constantly focus on giving and on others=\r\n.\n=A0\n5. If one doesn&#39;t have strong rinas to one&#39;s family members, renounci=\r\nng them may not block one&#39;s spiritual progress. If one has strong rinas, it=\r\n may block.\n=A0\nStaying away from objects of this world that are known sour=\r\nces of attachment, desires, aversion, fears and pride, can be useful for a =\r\nwhile. But, in the long term, desires, aversion, fears and pride may not be=\r\n overcome just by avoidance, if there are strong rinas. If you are not Sidd=\r\nhartha, what worked for Siddhartha need not work for you.\n=A0\nThe key is to=\r\n learn to give without taking, or atleast, without focusing the mind on tak=\r\ning. We are on earth to give.\n=A0\n6. You don&#39;t feed a 5-day old baby with b=\r\nesan laddoo, though it may be very tasty and protein-rich. Until one is not=\r\n ready, one need not be rushed into spirituality. At the same time, don&#39;t l=\r\nook down upon them. Everyone will go through their spiritual evolution phas=\r\nes.\n=A0\nInstead of liberation, talk to them about doing the right thing - d=\r\nharma. Talk to them about love, caring and compassion and doing the right t=\r\nhing fearlessly.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spiritual=\r\nity Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=A0\n=A0\nOn Tue, Sep =\r\n11, 2012 at 10:03 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

A=\r\nlso, when you throw a big and heavy enough ball into the pipe, it may resul=\r\nt in some re-arrangement of balls=A0 already in the pipeline. Similarly, bi=\r\ng karmas (good or bad) done now may result in re-arrangement of the karma p=\r\nipeline. \n=A0 \nIf the pipe has only good balls, only good balls come out. I=\r\nf the pipe has only bad balls, only bad balls come out. If it has both, any=\r\n may come out. If a bad ball comes out as soon as you throw a good ball in,=\r\n it does not mean the ball you threw just now was a bad ball. It means the =\r\ngood ball you threw will take some time to come. Moreover, it was YOU who t=\r\nhrew the bad ball that just came out, in the past. \n=A0 \nA ritual done with=\r\n a negative attitude for bad purposes can be a bad karma. However, even if =\r\none did a good ritual, still that good karma need not give results immediat=\r\nely. It depends on how dense one&#39;s karma pipeline is. If a pipe has very sm=\r\nall balls and a big heavy ball is thrown into it very fast, it may push thr=\r\nough previous existing balls and come out quickly.
