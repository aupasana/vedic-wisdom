However, you are free to a=\r\nddress me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n\nI just =\r\ncame across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has man=\r\ny a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one =\r\nself-identifies with it.\nAlthough, it may seem easy to understand intellect=\r\nually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s=\r\n an extremely important statement to answer our queries.\n\nImportant informa=\r\ntion about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a=\r\n big time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he =\r\ndidn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical bo=\r\ndy. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat.=\r\n I gave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) tha=\r\nt it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Fu=\r\nrther, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very fre=\r\nquently to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he do=\r\nes.\n\nNow whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions yo=\r\nu asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of=\r\n an unrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take e=\r\nxample cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other s=\r\nuch acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all real=\r\nized souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are =\r\nknower of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego i=\r\ns perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* wha=\r\nt they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of dis=\r\ncussion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco o=\r\nr killed animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be su=\r\nrely a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I=\r\n said, they know complete background behind their each action and\n moreover=\r\n their self identification is missing from the action and hence it is like =\r\nNature operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without bindin=\r\ng them in any cause-effect chain.\nRamakrishna used to frequently say to all=\r\n his disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing s=\r\npiritual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything.=\r\n A food restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting =\r\nspiritually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely imp=\r\nortant.\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have =\r\nsome subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend =\r\nunless explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; fr=\r\nom the sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by the=\r\nm as one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eati=\r\nng and such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time =\r\nthat he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose me=\r\nat he ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen bless=\r\nings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there w=\r\nere no apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We=\r\n&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way=\r\n Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still =\r\nin India and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n y=\r\nears actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told h=\r\nim to stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his=\r\n disciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru =\r\nand his guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That m=\r\nan later became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was=\r\n actually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled=\r\n what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was all =\r\nknowing and most of us are NOT.\n\nSo moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s=\r\n unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habi=\r\nts of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Sw=\r\nami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely sel=\r\nf identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpa=\r\nl \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not advisable for =\r\nanyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda =\r\n(Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days =\r\non just eating meat when he was living in USA also relished it.

Human beings cry a lot at funerals of their=\r\n own kind but they have absolutely no thought for the sufferings of the ani=\r\nmals they slaughter. They never hesitate to kill and eat.

Then it will be cleaned, cooked =\r\nand eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone will curse it for not sat=\r\nisfying their palates. How many humans would give beautiful tender lean mea=\r\nt if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?\n&gt; Meat-eaters con=\r\nveniently forget that animal mothers too love their children. Do they ever =\r\nthink of the agony a hen goes through when her chicks are slain in front of=\r\n her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness, do they consider how m=\r\nuch she suffers when she sees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she ha=\r\ns grown in her own body and nourished with her milk, whom she loves more th=\r\nan her own life?\n&gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the terrible pai=\r\nn they cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own children being murd=\r\nered before their own eyes?\n&gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not=\r\n humans, whose intellect is subtle enough to self-identify with another bei=\r\nng of a different species and experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma =\r\nhas no alternative but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have =\r\ntortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all.

However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily a=\r\nccept it hence forth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on K=\r\narma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only =\r\ngenerated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.&lt;BR&gt;Although, i=\r\nt may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times d=\r\nifficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to=\r\n answer our queries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Important information about Vimalananda which I=\r\n came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was=\r\n not a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on th=\r\ne final day of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew T=\r\nobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally\n ate meat. I gave this information, bec=\r\nause as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coinci=\r\ndence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an im=\r\nportant thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience t=\r\no do what he says and not try to do what he does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now whatever I wro=\r\nte above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in =\r\nmy thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person a=\r\nnd the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami V=\r\nivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spirit=\r\nual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved=\r\n very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or=\r\n many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and complet=\r\nely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They =\r\nare `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say t=\r\nhat if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they=\r\n actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpos=\r\ne behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they know compl=\r\nete background behind their each action and moreover their self identificat=\r\nion is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through=\r\n them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-eff=\r\nect chain.&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that =\r\nNaren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burnin=\r\ng within him which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction =\r\ndoes not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled=\r\n but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.&lt;BR&gt;If Viveka=\r\nnanda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpo=\r\nse which is not\n possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained=\r\n by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere s=\r\neekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them=\r\n and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such othe=\r\nr undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nulli=\r\nfying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is=\r\n also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the anim=\r\nal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent =\r\nreasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. On=\r\nly Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda sav=\r\ned a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did=\r\n not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met=\r\n Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away f=\r\nrom water\n and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami=\r\n, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru wil=\r\nl come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became =\r\ndisciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given =\r\na gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vive=\r\nkananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swami Vivekananda was all knowing an=\r\nd most of us are NOT.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unw=\r\nise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits o=\r\nf Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami =\r\nSamarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self id=\r\nentified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compo=\r\nse?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82&nbsp;I was about to ask this q=\r\nuestion today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82&nbsp; It is clear from the below pas=\r\nsage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu),=\r\n he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat when he wa=\r\ns living in USA also relished it.

That is why you find a meat-eater reborn e=\r\nither as a predator or prey or as both in succession. Human beings cry a lo=\r\nt at funerals of their own kind but they have absolutely no thought for the=\r\n sufferings of the animals they slaughter. They never hesitate to kill and =\r\neat. Just think, first they kill the chicken. Often they will cut its throa=\r\nt and let it bleed to death, which\n is a most painful way to die. Then it w=\r\nill be cleaned, cooked and eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone wi=\r\nll curse it for not satisfying their palates. How many humans would give be=\r\nautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and se=\r\nrved?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothers too love =\r\ntheir children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her=\r\n chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherl=\r\niness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the slaughter of=\r\n her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourished with her=\r\n milk, whom she loves more than her own life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do these so called hu=\r\nmans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they e=\r\nndure their own children being murdered before their own eyes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; How =\r\nis Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subtle=\r\n enough to self-identify\n with another being of a different species and exp=\r\nerience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make th=\r\nem suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to torture them in retur=\r\nn. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth you have ever=\r\ny right to cut mine in the next or some succeeding birth.
