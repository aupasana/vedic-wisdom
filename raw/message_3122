The author tells so=\r\nme of Bama&#39;s ideas in his book of interviews with saints: Tantrabhilasir Sa=\r\ndhu-sangha:=C2=A0\nMa (the Mother goddess) is asleep in the muladhara chakra=\r\n and should be awakened- if she is not awake, who is there to give one libe=\r\nration?

The first sign of the awakening of Kundali=\r\nni is that the person does not feel satisfied with the ordinary state of li=\r\nfe- one gets a great urge within to get over this confinement.

But =\r\nwhat is important, as a result of kundalini Shakti&#39;s functions in every cha=\r\nkra, is the kind of bhava it creates, a different bhava in each place, and =\r\nthe feeling of these bhavas brings such a state of bliss that it cannot be =\r\ndescribed.=C2=A0\nHe felt that the soul departs the body through the spinal =\r\nchannel at death, through an aperture in the skull, and it enters a state o=\r\nf emptiness and peace, nirvikalpa samadhi. This is the home of Tara Ma, whi=\r\nch is beyond the material world, the heaven worlds, and the home of Kali. T=\r\nara&#39;s grace is necessary to reach this state.=C2=A0\n\n\nSome incidents in the=\r\n masters life\n\n\nThe Widow&#39;s Marriage\n\nOne day a young, beautiful girl and h=\r\ner father came to see Bama Kshepa. The=C2=A0\nyoung girl bowed down to the M=\r\naster and offered him some Indian sweets which=C2=A0\nshe herself had prepar=\r\ned. Bama was extremely pleased with her and said, &quot;I=C2=A0\nam blessing you.=\r\n You will be blessed in the future with a beautiful son.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nThe girl c=\r\nried out, &quot;Father, Father, look what this sadhu is saying! How=C2=A0\ncan I =\r\nhave a child when I have lost my husband? I am a widow.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nBama said, =\r\n&quot;You are a widow. So what! You will be remarried. My words will=C2=A0\nprove=\r\n true.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nIn three months&#39; time a very rich young man fell in love wit=\r\nh her.=C2=A0\nAlthough in those days it was not at all appreciated if a wido=\r\nw remarried,=C2=A0\nthis girl did get married in a special Hindu Vaishnava m=\r\nanner. Needless to=C2=A0\nsay, in a year&#39;s time after she got married, she w=\r\nas blessed with a beautiful=C2=A0\nson.=C2=A0\n\n\nThe Dying Man\n\nA young man s=\r\nuffering from a serious case of tuberculosis was brought by=C2=A0\nhis relat=\r\nives to Bama. The young man&#39;s days were numbered. Bama said to them,=C2=A0\n=\r\n&quot;Why did you bring him to me? Am I a doctor? You rascals, you will never=C2=\r\n=A0\ngive me peace of mind.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nThen the Master stood up and started str=\r\nangling the patient. Everybody was=C2=A0\nstunned. The man was already so we=\r\nek. The disciples started crying because=C2=A0\nif the young man died, the M=\r\naster and all of them would be in serious trouble.=C2=A0\n\nBut Bama continue=\r\nd to strangle and abuse the man like anything, saying, &quot;When=C2=A0\nyou do b=\r\nad things, unbearable things, don&#39;t you know you will pay the penalty?&quot;\nThe=\r\nn he said, &quot;All right, I have forgiven you,&quot; and he threw the man down\non t=\r\nhe ground. Everybody thought he was dead.=C2=A0\n\nBut in a few minutes, to e=\r\nveryone&#39;s astonishment, the young man stood up=C2=A0\nand said, &quot;I am so hun=\r\ngry. Please give me something to eat. I have never=C2=A0\nfelt this kind of =\r\nhunger in my life.&quot; The dying man was now totally cured.=C2=A0\nThe relative=\r\ns left the Master&#39;s house offering utmost gratitude to Bama,=C2=A0\nwhom the=\r\ny affectionately called the &quot;insane spiritual Master.&quot;=C2=A0\n\n\n\nThe Suicide=\r\n Attempt\n\nOnce in the thick of the night a middle-aged man named Nimai was =\r\ntying a=C2=A0\nrope to the branch of a tree and was about to hang himself. H=\r\ne could not=C2=A0\nsupport his family, and for this reason the members of hi=\r\ns family had tremendous=C2=A0\ndisrespect for him. Therefore he wanted to co=\r\nmmit suicide.=C2=A0\n\nAt that moment Bama appeared in his subtle body and sa=\r\nid, &quot;What are you doing?=C2=A0\nYou rascal, don&#39;t you know that committing s=\r\nuicide is the worst possible=C2=A0\nsin? Don&#39;t you believe it?&quot;=C2=A0\n\nNimai=\r\n said, &quot;All right, I will not commit suicide, but I will never go home=C2=\r\n=A0\nagain.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nBama said, &quot;You don&#39;t have to go home. Come and stay wit=\r\nh me, in your real=C2=A0\nhome. God will take care of your family, I assure =\r\nyou.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nBama&#39;s words proved true. Very soon, two of Nimai&#39;s older sons=\r\n got jobs and=C2=A0\nwere in a position to support the rest of the members o=\r\nf the family.\n\n\n=C2=A0The Leper\nBama had a dear attendant named Nanda, who =\r\nhad developed leprosy. Even then, Bama used to take food from him regularly=\r\n and not from other disciples. Gradually, Nanda&#39;s case became extremely ser=\r\nious. His hands and arms were totally covered with infected wounds and it w=\r\nas a very ugly sight. So he stopped coming to=C2=A0\nhis Master&#39;s place.=C2=\r\n=A0\n\nOne day, Bama&#39;s attendants said to their Master, &quot;Master, you have the=\r\n capacity to cure your dear disciple, Nanda. Why don&#39;t you cure him?&quot;=C2=A0=\r\n\n\nBama said to them, &quot;All right, bring him today.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nWhen Nanda came, =\r\nBama started striking him, saying, &quot;Can you count on your fingertips how ma=\r\nny times you have done unthinkable things? I say you can&#39;t, you rascal. I h=\r\nave forgiven you and I am curing you, but in the future never, never do any=\r\nthing immoral or undivine.&quot;=C2=A0\n\nIn a month&#39;s time Nanda was totally cure=\r\nd. Then he once again started preparing meals for Bama and serving him with=\r\n utmost love and devoted surrender.\n\n\n=C2=A0Calcutta Kalighat temple\n\n\nAt t=\r\nhe Calcutta Kalighat temple, while in a state of bhava, he tried to lift th=\r\ne statue of the Mother and take her on his lap. When stopped by the priests=\r\n, he shouted, &quot;I do not want your black Kali! She looks like a demoness com=\r\ning to devour [someone]. My Tara Ma is beautiful, with small feet. I do not=\r\n want your black Kali- my Akasa Tara is good enough for me.&quot; People would c=\r\nall on him, asking him to pray to their household images, to enliven them w=\r\nith his bhava. He would fall into trance when he visited their statues, and=\r\n often he performed neither worship nor chanting of mantras. He would loudl=\r\ny call into the air for the Mother, and many observers saw the statue appea=\r\nr to take the form of a human being.\n\n\nHis Holiness&#39;s worship of Maa Tara\n\n=\r\n\nHe took a handful of flowers marked with sandal paste and stood before the=\r\n goddess. He cursed her and threw the flowers at the statue. He wet the flo=\r\nwers with his tears. Although the flowers were thrown with an attitude of a=\r\nbuse instead of reverence using mantras, they arranged themselves into a ne=\r\nat and beautiful garland around the goddess&#39; neck, and the observers were a=\r\nmazed at the mantraless form of worship of the madman. He then went into tr=\r\nance which continued all day, and he emerged from it on the following day. =\r\nHe was not a priest who followed schedules- often the time for worship woul=\r\nd have passed and no one could find Bama anywhere. He would later be seen i=\r\nn trance under a Hibiscus tree, on in the jungle, having arguments with the=\r\n goddess.=C2=A0\n\n\nBama,Maa Tara&#39;s dearest son\n\n\nHe would eat food to be off=\r\nered to the goddess before the worship ceremony was finished thus making it=\r\n impure and unsanctified. The caretakers of the temple were angry at this a=\r\nnd beat him severely. He insisted that the goddess Tara asked him to take f=\r\nood in this way. After this, the temple owner, the Rani of Natore, had a dr=\r\neam:=C2=A0\n\nShe dreamt that the stone image of Mother Tara was leaving the =\r\ntemple at Tarapith and going to Kailasa. Tara Ma looked very sad, and tears=\r\n were flowing down her face, and she wore no mark on her forehead. She was =\r\nbewildered and emaciated. Her back was bleeding and full of cuts, and vultu=\r\nres and jackals followed behind her, lapping the blood from her wounds.=C2=\r\n=A0\nIn fear, the Rani asked, &quot;O Ma, why do you show me these terrible thing=\r\ns, and why are you leaving us?&quot;=C2=A0\n\nThe goddess answered, &quot;My child, I h=\r\nave been in this sacred place (mahapitha) for ages. Now your priests have b=\r\neaten my dear mad son, and as a mother, I have taken these blows upon mysel=\r\nf. See how my back is bleeding, I am in great pain ... For four days I have=\r\n been starving, because they have not allowed my mad son to eat my ritual f=\r\nood. So for four days I have refused to take their offerings of food ... My=\r\n child, how can a mother take food before feeding her child? You must arran=\r\nge for food to be offered to my son, before it is offered to me, at the tem=\r\nple. If not, I will leave there permanently.&quot;=C2=A0Bama got his priest job =\r\nback, and people began to visit him, to come as devotees, or simply to see =\r\nhim.\n\n\nShortly before his Mahasamadhi in 1911, he became withdrawn and spen=\r\nt most of his time in trance and meditation. He ceased to talk with his dis=\r\nciples, speaking only rarely about death and Tara Ma. His love-hate relatio=\r\nnship with her continued until his death in 1911.=C2=A0=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      =\r\nThe INTERNET now has a personality. YOURS! See your Yahoo!

He could not&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;support his family, and for this r=\r\neason the members of his family had tremendous&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;disrespect for him.=\r\n Therefore he wanted to commit suicide.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At that moment Bama ap=\r\npeared in his subtle body and said, &quot;What are you doing?&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;You rasca=\r\nl, don&#39;t you know that committing suicide is the worst possible&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;si=\r\nn? Don&#39;t you believe it?&quot;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nimai said, &quot;All right, I will not c=\r\nommit suicide, but I will never go home&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;again.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bama =\r\nsaid, &quot;You don&#39;t have to go home. Come and stay with me, in your real&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;home. God will take care of your family, I\n assure you.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;B=\r\nama&#39;s words proved true. Very soon, two of Nimai&#39;s older sons got jobs and&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;were in a position to support the rest of the members of the famil=\r\ny.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-style-span style=3D&quot;FON=\r\nT-SIZE: 12px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DA=\r\npple-style-span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: normal&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-style-span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12px; FONT-FAMILY: =\r\nArial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN class=3DApple-style-span style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT-WEIGHT: normal&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;B&gt;The Leper&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN clas=\r\ns=3DApple-style-span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12px; FONT-FAMILY: Arial, Helvetic=\r\na, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bama had a dear attendant named Nanda, who had developed=\r\n leprosy. Even then, Bama used to take food from him regularly and not from=\r\n other disciples. Gradually, Nanda&#39;s case became extremely serious. His han=\r\nds and arms were totally covered with infected wounds and it was a very ugl=\r\ny sight. So he stopped coming to&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;his Master&#39;s place.&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nOne day, Bama&#39;s attendants said to their Master, &quot;Master, you have the capa=\r\ncity to cure your dear disciple, Nanda. Why don&#39;t you cure him?&quot;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Bama said to them, &quot;All right, bring him today.&quot;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Nanda=\r\n came, Bama started striking him, saying, &quot;Can you count on your fingertips=\r\n how\n many times you have done unthinkable things? I say you can&#39;t, you ras=\r\ncal.
