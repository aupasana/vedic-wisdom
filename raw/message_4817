External Sun shining brightly and destroying external darkness is akin to the inner light shining brightly and destroying inner darkness. Burning homam fire is meant for stimulating and making the inner light shine brighter. So, normally, homam is performed during the daytime. When Sun is just rising and destroying darkness is a great time for homam.\n \nExternal rituals are meant to cause internal modification through resonance. Rules and conventions followed in rituals are meant for maximizing the internal result of a ritual. They are not meant for scaring one away from the ritual!\n \nDoing homam in the evening or night is not a &quot;wrong deed&quot; at all. Unlike some deities who may manifest in different forms during morning or afternoon or evening, Krishna is Krishna always. He can be worshipped anytime. In fact, he was born around midnight!\n \nMy 2 cents is that you should feel free to do Krishna homam in the evening, after your work. If you like Krishna, go for Krishna homam.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A. Bhatla&quot; &lt;astrologytree@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to ask that can I do Shri Krishna Homam at night.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, I am a doctor and practice in a vilalge of North India. Some times I have to attend emergencies in early morning. \n&gt; \n&gt; I used to perform Homam during winters regularly in early morning. but after summers started we usually get high incidence of Emergencies in early morning due to harvesting season, then paddy sowing season and now a days it is time to pour insecticides and pesticides in fields.\n&gt; \n&gt; Due to all these reasons I had to quit my routine of doing homam in early morning. And sometimes it also cause disturbance in my Japam schedule. \n&gt; \n&gt; I seriously want to resume my routine of Homam. And as Shri Krishna Homam is done in morning I am hesitant to do it in evening with a fear of doing a wrong deed. \n&gt;  In winters I will be able to do the homam in early morning as Emergency turnout it very less at that time. \n&gt; \n&gt; But Till then can I do the Krishna Homam in night? As written in your book &quot;Vedic Wisdom&quot; Maha Ganpati Homam can be done at night. So should I switch to Ganapati homam to be performed at night?\n&gt; \n&gt; Personally, I want to stick to Shri Krishna homam as I feel myself attached to Him. But Doing Maha Ganapati Homam will also have same importance for me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope to find a suitable answer\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; Atul\n\n\n"}}
