We are on the ground (or,\nperhaps underground). And our goal is to =\r\nget onto the roof of one of\nthese very tall buildings, which is above the c=\r\nlouds. How do you get\nto the top?\n\nThere are so many different tall buildin=\r\ngs. Each of these is like a\nreligion. You may be more familiar with some of=\r\n them, and others might\nlook frightening. Inside, there are so many differe=\r\nnt sets of\nelevators (paths of sadhana). Some of the elevators will go slow=\r\n, and\nsome will go fast. Some will go all the way to the top, and some will=\r\n\nonly go to specific floors.\n\nOnce we are inside the elevator, we might enj=\r\noy so many sensations,\nlike the acceleration and deceleration of the elevat=\r\nor. We might like\nit so much that we forget about getting to the top, and s=\r\nimply go up\nand down the elevator. The elevator may stop at so many floors.=\r\n Each\nfloor is a tempation. From the elevator, we may see many sights and\nh=\r\near many sounds. Again, we might forget about our goal and get off\nthe elev=\r\nator.\n\nAt the beginning, we have to be careful. We should stay on the\neleva=\r\ntor all the way to the top. Anything else takes us away from our\ngoal. But,=\r\n at the end, we have to get off the elevator. After all, the\ngoal is to get=\r\n to the top of the building, and not to stay inside.\nPerhaps we have to tak=\r\ne some stairs and open some doors to get out\nonto the roof.\n\nPerhaps you ca=\r\nn think of each of these tall building like a religion.\nYes, they may appea=\r\nr to be an obstacle (after all, when you are inside\nthe building, and insid=\r\ne an elevator, the sky is not at all visible).\nBut, the quickest and safest=\r\n way to get to the roof is to go inside,\nand take an elevator to the top.\n\n=\r\nSome people may advise a more direct path, always keeping the goal in\nsight=\r\n. They may say that you should directly climb the outside of the\nbuilding. =\r\nThey may be technically correct, but this path is not for\neveryone.\n\nFrom a=\r\n practical point of view, the answer is simple -- do sadhana and\nmore sadha=\r\nna. Do it inside of your religious construct if it helps\nyou. Ignore the re=\r\nligious constructs when they become an obstacle.\n\nThere are so many mails o=\r\nn this list. Every mail serves a purpose.\nBut, not all mails are applicable=\r\n or useful to everyone. Read and\nre-read the mails that are useful, and ign=\r\nore the ones that aren&#39;t. At\nthe end of the day, you will learn much more f=\r\nrom sadhana than you\nwill from the mails on this list.\n\nsasneham,\n\n=C2=A0  =\r\najit\n\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 23, 2012 at 6:47 AM, sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@yahoo.=\r\nco.uk&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear Rajarshiji,\n&gt;\n&gt; The story is interesting......but forg=\r\nive me, incomplete!

Lately I realize=\r\nd this is literally true. Heavy psychological constructs are created by rel=\r\nigions to protect an average person from the real experience of God, which =\r\nis so powerful and overwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effecti=\r\nvely cause a hurricane in your average life and pretty much destroy all you=\r\nr well laid plans.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will briefly narrate a true and interesting i=\r\nncident.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay the=\r\nre for some years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying =\r\nthe discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, co=\r\nmes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, sto=\r\npped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. T=\r\nhen he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some word=\r\ns of God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time ta=\r\nlking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So =\r\nplease continue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Eve=\r\nryone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, =\r\nthe man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up a=\r\nnd started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, loo=\r\nked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once i=\r\nn a\n while,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smo=\r\nking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason f=\r\nelt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was goin=\r\ng. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke=\r\n to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot;=\r\n X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English an=\r\nd more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X =\r\nwas dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The man con=\r\ntinued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by=\r\n profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since =\r\nthen.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang?=\r\n Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is =\r\nsource of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not o=\r\nrdinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religious t=\r\nroubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have so=\r\n much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu fo=\r\nr long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it=\r\n possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is =\r\nonly one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely=\r\n different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not ac=\r\ncessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 all this p=\r\nroblem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God =\r\never. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to compreh=\r\nend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman w=\r\nith super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will cr=\r\neate this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire sup=\r\nernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as =\r\na man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the pro=\r\nblem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stres=\r\nsing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped a=\r\nt a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the=\r\n chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly rele=\r\nasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a yo=\r\nung man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 confused by all=\r\n these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I =\r\ndid a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infa=\r\nmous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day=\r\n having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I s=\r\nlowly realized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As =\r\nhe spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl =\r\ncame out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said t=\r\no X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrin=\r\ndavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if you j=\r\noin me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored a=\r\nnd irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for their =\r\nfood while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on=\r\n a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he =\r\nabuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hosp=\r\nitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought =\r\ncrossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 stood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot where M=\r\nr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direct=\r\nion to the cot. He too turned round to see what was going on. What he saw m=\r\nade his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar tha=\r\nt was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early=\r\n twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow=\r\n that lightened\n up the\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 whole room. He had a shaved head, four arm=\r\ns, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked n=\r\not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five =\r\nminutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; X did not kno=\r\nw what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up=\r\n and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the=\r\n cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he w=\r\noke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees and sh=\r\nrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him insi=\r\nde the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an ol=\r\nd man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar =\r\ndid not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X =\r\nout of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You should=\r\n meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an id=\r\nea what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach that d=\r\nesolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was lo=\r\nsing awareness of place/time and lapsed into\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 unconsciousness again=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lying on the f=\r\nloor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous s=\r\nmile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as directed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; -Reg=\r\nards\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82\n&gt;&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE =\r\nmAmabuddhayah |\n&gt;&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.kris=\r\nhnan@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012=\r\n 8:13 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t believe in any religion\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82\n&gt;&gt; Dear Pras=\r\nanth,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To those who say that they don=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t belie=\r\nve in any religion\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In general, many of those who don&#39;t belie=\r\nve in religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, m=\r\nost people who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with=\r\n. All of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our=\r\n Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; W=\r\nhile being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insince=\r\nre prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout=\r\n the day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at al=\r\nl the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God beli=\r\nevers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our =\r\nkarmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while w=\r\ne reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;puny=\r\na&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the=\r\n &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declar=\r\ne our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for =\r\nwhat it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; For=\r\n the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practi=\r\nces, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes.=\r\n When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really fl=\r\nies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore =\r\nour strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, an=\r\nd laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The best way to b=\r\nring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and tr=\r\ny to convert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief=\r\n, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world wi=\r\nll be served.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If we see God as the limitless power that he is, he is =\r\ndifficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religion. Reli=\r\ngion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _e=\r\nventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortuna=\r\ntely, most religions ask us to accept them without question.

We are on the ground (or,&lt;br&gt;perhaps underground). And o=\r\nur goal is to get onto the roof of one of&lt;br&gt;these very tall buildings, whi=\r\nch is above the clouds. How do you get&lt;br&gt;to the top?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are so m=\r\nany different tall buildings. Each of these is like a&lt;br&gt;religion. You may =\r\nbe more familiar with some of them,\n and others might&lt;br&gt;look frightening. =\r\nInside, there are so many different sets of&lt;br&gt;elevators (paths of sadhana)=\r\n. Some of the elevators will go slow, and&lt;br&gt;some will go fast. Some will g=\r\no all the way to the top, and some will&lt;br&gt;only go to specific floors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Once we are inside the elevator, we might enjoy so many sensations,&lt;br&gt;l=\r\nike the acceleration and deceleration of the elevator. We might like&lt;br&gt;it =\r\nso much that we forget about getting to the top, and simply go up&lt;br&gt;and do=\r\nwn the elevator. The elevator may stop at so many floors. Each&lt;br&gt;floor is =\r\na tempation. From the elevator, we may see many sights and&lt;br&gt;hear many sou=\r\nnds. Again, we might forget about our goal and get off&lt;br&gt;the elevator.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;At the beginning, we have to be careful. We should stay on the&lt;br&gt;eleva=\r\ntor all the way to the top. Anything else takes us away from our&lt;br&gt;goal. B=\r\nut, at the end, we have to get off the elevator. After all, the&lt;br&gt;goal is =\r\nto get to the top of the\n building, and not to stay inside.&lt;br&gt;Perhaps we h=\r\nave to take some stairs and open some doors to get out&lt;br&gt;onto the roof.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Perhaps you can think of each of these tall building like a religion.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Yes, they may appear to be an obstacle (after all, when you are inside&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;the building, and inside an elevator, the sky is not at all visible).&lt;br&gt;=\r\nBut, the quickest and safest way to get to the roof is to go inside,&lt;br&gt;and=\r\n take an elevator to the top.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people may advise a more direct p=\r\nath, always keeping the goal in&lt;br&gt;sight. They may say that you should dire=\r\nctly climb the outside of the&lt;br&gt;building. They may be technically correct,=\r\n but this path is not for&lt;br&gt;everyone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a practical point of vie=\r\nw, the answer is simple -- do sadhana and&lt;br&gt;more sadhana. Do it inside of =\r\nyour religious construct if it helps&lt;br&gt;you. Ignore the religious construct=\r\ns when they become an obstacle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are so many mails on this list=\r\n. Every mail\n serves a purpose.&lt;br&gt;But, not all mails are applicable or use=\r\nful to everyone. Read and&lt;br&gt;re-read the mails that are useful, and ignore =\r\nthe ones that aren&#39;t. At&lt;br&gt;the end of the day, you will learn much more fr=\r\nom sadhana than you&lt;br&gt;will from the mails on this list.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;sasneham,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;  ajit&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Mon, Jul 23, 2012 at 6:47 AM, sunr=\r\nise_1080 &lt;&lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:sunrise_1080@...&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nsunrise_1080@...&quot;&gt;sunrise_1080@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; D=\r\near Rajarshiji,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The story is interesting......but forgive m=\r\ne, incomplete!

Lately I realized this is liter=\r\nally true. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to prote=\r\nct an\n average person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful=\r\n and overwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a h=\r\nurricane in your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid pl=\r\nans.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; I will briefly narrate a true and =\r\ninteresting incident.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; An individual - s=\r\nay X - had gone to Vrindavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting a=\r\nt a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged lookin=\r\ng man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sad=\r\nhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring s=\r\nome sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and =\r\nsaid, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, an=\r\nd retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyw=\r\nay. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue with your lectures\n=\r\n as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent =\r\nhearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mout=\r\nh, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walking off. After he w=\r\nent out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He=\r\n is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; but h=\r\ne has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now =\r\nX, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to that ragg=\r\ned man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached the ra=\r\ngged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear English, &quot;H=\r\nello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course taken aba=\r\nck, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had no clue=\r\n how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the garb of=\r\n a sadhu - saffron clothes).&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; The\n man c=\r\nontinued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer =\r\nby profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu sinc=\r\ne then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsan=\r\ng? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself i=\r\ns source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not=\r\n ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religious=\r\n troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have =\r\nso much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu =\r\nfor long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is =\r\nit possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there i=\r\ns only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, mere=\r\nly different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not =\r\naccessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root\n of&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n; all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cann=\r\not know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brai=\r\nn to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magni=\r\nfied woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one da=\r\ny he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even=\r\n acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded b=\r\ny others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the roo=\r\nt of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind an=\r\nd then stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sad=\r\nhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull fini=\r\nshed off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes,=\r\n slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning=\r\n X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your\n head, don&#39;t get&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp; confused by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. W=\r\nhen I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness o=\r\nf youth. I was an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I gre=\r\nw up. But then one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roam=\r\ning for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact=\r\n with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, w=\r\noman and a young girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr=\r\n Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot =\r\nso when I come to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you somethin=\r\ng interesting if you join me.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; After an =\r\nhour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman wa=\r\ns bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl =\r\nwas massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he\n lay down on a cot, enjoying the hosp=\r\nitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but =\r\nhas no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder =\r\nand enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw =\r\nthat the man and the woman and the girl=C3=82&nbsp; stood up and with folde=\r\nd hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X=\r\n was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turn=\r\ned round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in sh=\r\nock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat=\r\n on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin=\r\n was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&nbsp; whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus an=\r\nd weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being an=\r\ny more but a god sitting in place\n of what was even five minutes back only =\r\na frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; X di=\r\nd not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to=\r\n stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked=\r\n upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. =\r\nWhen he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with tre=\r\nes and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took=\r\n him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to=\r\n it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr=\r\n Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and the=\r\nn took X out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. Y=\r\nou should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who =\r\nhas an idea what God really means. After providing directions of how to rea=\r\nch that desolate temple, Mr\n Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt=\r\n he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; un=\r\nconsciousness again.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; When X woke up, he=\r\n was in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the b=\r\ned, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X=\r\n went to the temple as directed.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; -Regar=\r\nds&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; para=\r\nm bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; From: Ajit Krishn=\r\nan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; To: &lt;a ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8:13 AM&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt; Subject: Re:\n [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; Dear Prasanth,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; To thos=\r\ne who say that they don=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t believe in any religion&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; In general, many =\r\nof those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more honest than th=\r\nose who do. After all, most people who believe in God look at him as a limi=\r\nted being to barter with. All of our biases and assumptions are most appare=\r\nnt when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has simply served to formali=\r\nze these biases.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; While being mired in this word of =\r\nduality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the whole weig=\r\nht of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the day. And we lay this bias on=\r\n our God. No wonder that others look at all the suffering in the world and =\r\nlaugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are\n the culprit.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipelin=\r\ne. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both ki=\r\nnds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It =\r\nis us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;=\r\n. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers =\r\nto be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, an=\r\nd laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n For the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual pr=\r\nactices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minu=\r\ntes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time reall=\r\ny flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ign=\r\nore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is=\r\n, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the\n culprit.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt; The best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the=\r\n &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to elimi=\r\nnate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can transform =\r\nourselves, the world will be served.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; If we see God =\r\nas the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is difficu=\r\nlt to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a steppi=\r\nng-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on top o=\r\nf it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to acc=\r\nept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with reve=\r\nrence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farther.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; sasneham,&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbs=\r\np; =C3=82 ajit&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82&lt;br&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n ------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; Yahoo!
