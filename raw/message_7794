I have a large one purchased from I=\r\nndia. The lamp can burn on 24X7 basis, with its oil capacity. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I u=\r\nse Seasome oil and it does not give smell. My wick comes as a roll and has =\r\nbeen purchased from Khadhi Bandar from Chennai. I cut a long length (say ab=\r\nout 10&quot;size) cotton thread from the wick roll and fold it, so that the thre=\r\nad has become thicker and has two heads in once place for brighter and bett=\r\ner lamp burning. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For maintaining akhand jyoti, I have been increa=\r\nsing the wick length once in 8 hours, after removing the burnt ball from wi=\r\nck, which is falling with in the lamp. This is the only practical way I hav=\r\ne experienced so far. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I allow the lamp to be completely over once=\r\n in a week. I clean the lamp thoroughly for removing the burnt black balls =\r\nthat fell in oil/ lamp. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Previously I used to burn flat lamp, wher=\r\ne again the wick has to be protruded to increase the length. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priya=\r\nnk&quot; &lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 days back i =\r\nstarted keeping Akhand deep, (copper deep with central wick hole, Mustard o=\r\nil). After 2-3 hrs of burning the tip of the burning wick gets burned and f=\r\norms small charcoal ball and the flame becomes small.
