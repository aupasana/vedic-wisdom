There seem to be many \nthousands of people doing homam by themselves now (though not all of \nthem are members of this vedic-wisdom yahoogroup). Some of them are \nmaking good spiritual progress and undergoing transformation. Many of \nthem are enjoying the experience and feeling some peace and happiness. \nSeveral of them are also enjoying some material benefits.\n\nThis movement may catch on even more with time and play an important \nrole in the establishment of Sanatana dharma on earth over the next \nseveral decades.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI encourage everyone interested in doing homam to try it and continue if \nthey like it. I also encourage everyone interested in spreading homam to \ntell others about it and show the the free manuals, audio and video. \nThere will be more free resources in future and these will be organized \nbetter.\n\nBut please never make this commercial or forceful. Never charge money \nfor teaching homam, as that would be a very bad idea. Also, never try to \nsell it hard or put pressure. Tell people about it and let them do it \nwhen (and if!) they are ready. Tell people about it passionately, but \ndon&#39;t expect anything. Most importantly, don&#39;t be disappointed or \ndisheartened if some people told by you do not start homam.\n\nAction is a *sacred* duty and do not shy away from right and dharmik \naction (as judged by your conscience). But results are not in your hands \nand hence do not be disappointed if a seemingly perfect action did not \ngive the intended result.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLastly, some people have developed a special attachment, love, respect \nand even fascination for Manish and me. I strongly recommend not doing \nthat.\n\nThis movement will last a long time, but we&#39;ll be gone sooner or later. \nMoreover, we may or may not be what you imagine us to be. We may be \nnormal people with weaknesses and troubled by shadripus. In any case, it \nis irrelevant really. It is not about us, but about Fire!\n\nIf someone sees me as a guru, I cannot stop that. But let me make it \nvery clear that I am not some powerful guru. I am a normal person who \nhappens to be introducing a powerful guru (Fire!) that everybody can \napproach and benefit from!\n\nMy message is not that Manish or I are special, can confer blessings on \nyou and solve your problems. My message is that I can show you a way in \nwhich you yourself can solve your problems IF you are ready to put in \nsome effort. Let us recede into background and let your attention, love, \nrespect, devotion and fascination be directed towards Fire instead of \nus.\n\nFire is the original guru and original priest. He can guide you, remove \nyour weaknesses over time and take you to god. If there are mistakes in \nyour method, he can also help in getting them rectified in time. \nSurrender to Fire and request him to guide you and take you to god. He \nwill not disappoint you.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
