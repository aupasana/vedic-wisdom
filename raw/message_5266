I never knew till few months earlier that =\r\nthere was some divine person called Vimalananda lived in Mumbai. I wasn&#39;t e=\r\nven aware of &quot;Aghora Series&quot;. I just got the recommendation from Manish&#39;s e=\r\nmail. and I am gald that i read all the 3 books of Aghora.\n\nA complete diff=\r\nerent perspective from Vimalananda, about a famous incident in life of Thak=\r\nur and Rani Rasmani is given in Law of Karma (Aghora-III).\n\nRamakrishna&#39;s s=\r\nlapping of Rani Rasmani has been ordinarily understood by people and even h=\r\nis followers, as that He wanted to teach a lesson to Rani for thinking some=\r\n mundane thoughts while sitting in Kali temple. But Vimalananda said that i=\r\nt is not same. According to him, Ramakrishna was in a complete different an=\r\nd in a very high state of mind those days in which he wasn&#39;t aware of even =\r\nhis body and existence. It was Mother Bhavatarini who was residing in his b=\r\nody. Bhavatarini wanted to teach a lesson to Rasmani and she slapped her th=\r\nrough Ramakrishna and in reality Ramakrishna was not aware of what has come=\r\n to pass. &quot;Prakriti Siddhi&quot; was performed on Rani. It is said that after th=\r\nat slap, her mind remain fixed on Kali.\n\nSo that is one of the classic case=\r\ns of creating Vacuum by effacing the ego so completely that the deity comes=\r\n and fills it. Like Kali for Thakur, Tara for Vimalananda and some deity fo=\r\nr Manish.\n\nRegards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi =\r\nnandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me state my understandi=\r\nng of the issue.\n&gt; \n&gt; When a person becomes one with his deity, it is the d=\r\neity who stays and work \n&gt; through him/her at all times. A deity, any deity=\r\n, has a birds eye view of the \n&gt; karmic links in any particular situation a=\r\nnd know what needs to be done, based \n&gt; on the specific karmas of the speci=\r\nfc persons interacting at that time. When the \n&gt; deity is an ugra devata, h=\r\nis/her action may not be gentle, but it always has \n&gt; some higher purpose. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; For example as Vimalananda mentions, the curse of Rishi is always =\r\nbenefitial. \n&gt; Even if it puts a person through some discomfort, it eventua=\r\nlly helps the person \n&gt; to come out spiritually stronger. And added to this=\r\n, if we understand that death \n&gt; is merely a comma, and one keeps continuin=\r\ng his spiritual journey, then there is \n&gt; no confusion at all. In my unders=\r\ntanding, same applies to deities as well. Thus \n&gt; what Vimalananda did and =\r\nits consequences cannot be correctly judged and/or \n&gt; understood by=C2=A0an=\r\n average mind like ours. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Thus is most occasions it not Vimalananda=\r\n the man who operated, but Smashan \n&gt; Taara who did. The marvel of Vimalana=\r\nnda is that he had been able to remove his \n&gt; I-ness and let Smashan Taara =\r\nwork through him. She knows what karmas are pilling \n&gt; up for whom in what =\r\nsituation, and does appropiately. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; To achieve a state where the dei=\r\nty remians with one always, one must remove his \n&gt; sense of I completely th=\r\nrough teevra sadhana.=C2=A0 Then the deity can fill a \n&gt; person&#39;s conscious=\r\nness and remain with him 24/7. In that case anything he/she \n&gt; does is no m=\r\nore done from a sense of I am doing anything, but of he/she - deity \n&gt; -=C2=\r\n=A0doing it. The actions, need not necessarily be as we expect by our norma=\r\nl \n&gt; mind. Neither is it always happy and nice. But it always has a higher =\r\npurpose \n&gt; for the people involved, irrespective of whether they understand=\r\n the same at \n&gt; that moment or not.\n&gt; \n&gt; A child who has a dog bite needs t=\r\no take anti rabies injections. He may not like \n&gt; the pain of the injection=\r\n and wonder why that maybe necessary at all. But the \n&gt; doctor knows the ri=\r\nsks and fatal consequences when not given the injection \n&gt; (immediate pain)=\r\n. Same way a deity knows what and how a person can be made \n&gt; better even i=\r\nf that may require an immediate pain, mental or physical.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: Bh=\r\nupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent=\r\n: Fri, 19 November, 2010 12:06:22 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] On Ego (=\r\nRe: Success with Mantras)\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste Atul Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda =\r\ncertainly seems like a cool person when we read about him but to say \n&gt; tha=\r\nt sometimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not learn we=\r\nll \n&gt; is an understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book when he=\r\n goes to a \n&gt; cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? Aft=\r\ner a brief \n&gt; argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0he dies!=\r\n Similarly when Robert \n&gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a =\r\nTV interview, Vimalananda goes \n&gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain h=\r\nis reasons for not acknowledging him. \n&gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw at=\r\ntention to himself and secondly he was \n&gt; sick,=C2=A0and that was the reaso=\r\nn why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had \n&gt; received from Vimalanan=\r\nda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but \n&gt; Vimalananda could not be =\r\npacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the \n&gt; time the interview =\r\nwas going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking \n&gt; acknowledgement even =\r\nwhen he claims he does not like public attention! Probably \n&gt; transmission =\r\nbreaking down was again part of divine will you think? Robert \n&gt; Sbvoboda h=\r\nimself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda \n&gt; was=\r\n impossible especially when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to h=\r\nis \n&gt; mistake.\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has=\r\n was denied audience by a \n&gt; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insu=\r\nlted by this, he curses this ill \n&gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness an=\r\nd that sadhu finally succumbs to that and \n&gt; dies! Now if I like to meet so=\r\nmebody and am denied audience, do I curse them to \n&gt; death?\n&gt; \n&gt; The exampl=\r\nes I give above does not illustrate a picture of people who were \n&gt; compass=\r\nionate and always willing to forgive and forget. But still, they were \n&gt; hu=\r\ngely successful in their sadhana in their own way. And that is what we are =\r\n\n&gt; talking about here....the pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody he=\r\nre I \n&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosa=\r\nry for a \n&gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required such that o=\r\nur sadhana \n&gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us. I am getti=\r\nng a feeling though \n&gt; that there is really no prerequisite or nobody reall=\r\ny knows those \n&gt; pre-requisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their bes=\r\nt effort and continue \n&gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradu=\r\nally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________=\r\n\n&gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis=\r\n - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if those \n&gt; channels are not clean the=\r\nn that energy flow can create unpleasant experiences \n&gt; like increased ange=\r\nr, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rishis have cl=\r\nean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and \n&gt; blessings =\r\nthey give are just part of divine will. like curse given to lord \n&gt; vishnu =\r\nby sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses given to yadav \n&gt; van=\r\nsh and king prikshit played an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy \n&gt;=\r\n except few times when he was markedly irritated.Like in an incidence where=\r\n one \n&gt; of his female disciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked i=\r\nn front of \n&gt; him to learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated becau=\r\nse he felt that his \n&gt; student did not learnt well what he taught to her. \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On other side people with some impurities like i-ness and pride may=\r\n not be able \n&gt; to handle that energy well. and can experience increased an=\r\nger lust etc. like \n&gt; ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i perso=\r\nnally believe that this is \n&gt; also part of divine will. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please for=\r\ngive me for my mistakes\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Atul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
