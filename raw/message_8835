When he properly places his sense of identi=\r\nty, he leaves behind all compulsive patterns. So long as he remains confuse=\r\nd in his ordinary state of spiritual amnesia, he will know the subtle fette=\r\nrs of environmental law.\n\n&quot;God is harmony; the devotee who attunes himself =\r\nwill never perform any action amiss. His activities will be correctly and n=\r\naturally timed to accord with astrological law. After deep prayer and medit=\r\nation he is in touch with his divine consciousness; there is no greater pow=\r\ner than that inward protection.&quot;\n\n&quot;Then, dear Master, why do you want me to=\r\n wear an astrological bangle?&quot; I ventured this question after a long silenc=\r\ne, during which I had tried to assimilate Sri Yukteswar&#39;s noble exposition.=\r\n\n\n&quot;It is only when a traveler has reached his goal that he is justified in =\r\ndiscarding his maps. During the journey, he takes advantage of any convenie=\r\nnt short cut. The ancient rishis discovered many ways to curtail the period=\r\n of man&#39;s exile in delusion. There are certain mechanical features in the l=\r\naw of karma which can be skillfully adjusted by the fingers of wisdom.\n\n&quot;Al=\r\nl human ills arise from some transgression of universal law. The scriptures=\r\n point out that man must satisfy the laws of nature, while not discrediting=\r\n the divine omnipotence. He should say: &#39;Lord, I trust in Thee, and know Th=\r\nou canst help me, but I too will do my best to undo any wrong I have done.&#39;=\r\n By a number of means;by prayer, by will power, by yoga meditation, by cons=\r\nultation with saints, by use of astrological bangles;the adverse effects of=\r\n past wrongs can be minimized or nullified.\n\n&quot;Just as a house can be fitted=\r\n with a copper rod to absorb the shock of lightning, so the bodily temple c=\r\nan be benefited by various protective measures. Ages ago our yogis discover=\r\ned that pure metals emit an astral light which is powerfully counteractive =\r\nto negative pulls of the planets. Subtle electrical and magnetic radiations=\r\n are constantly circulating in the universe; when a man&#39;s body is being aid=\r\ned, he does not know it; when it is being disintegrated, he is still in ign=\r\norance. Can he do anything about it?\n\n&quot;This problem received attention from=\r\n our rishis; they found helpful not only a combination of metals, but also =\r\nof plants and;most effective of all;faultless jewels of not less than two c=\r\narats. The preventive uses of astrology have seldom been seriously studied =\r\noutside of India. One little;known fact is that the proper jewels, metals, =\r\nor plant preparations are valueless unless the required weight is secured, =\r\nand unless these remedial agents are worn next to the skin.&quot;\n\n*** Extracts =\r\nfrom: Autobiography of a Yogi - by Paramhansa Yogananda, 16th Chapter: Outw=\r\nitting the Stars ***\n\n\n\n"}}
