All one needs to do i=\r\ns to look around at the different &#39;slokas&#39; [vs. Vedic mantras] people chant=\r\n and yet seem to achieve success -whether peace of mind, or material, or bo=\r\nth. However, it is my opinion that there is an unkown quality or power to t=\r\nhe Vedic mantras, probably because of the way they are chanted, or, simply =\r\nbecause they were not handed down to us by mere mortals!\n\nYou get to gauge =\r\na comparison of differences in the chantings of Vedic mantras, when you lis=\r\nten to priests chanting the Rig-Vedas, Krishna Yajur Vedas [KY Vedas], Shuk=\r\nla Yajur [SY] Vedas and the Sama Vedas. Those who follow [or can trace thei=\r\nr lineage to] the KY Rishis and chant mantras the KY way [if I may even inc=\r\norrectly use this phrase], should listen to the fantastic recitations of Ve=\r\ndic Mantras chanted by Shishyas and learned priests [or &#39;Vadhyaars&#39;, as the=\r\ny popularly termed in the South], whose recordings are available for sale o=\r\nn CDs on Pt. S.P. Tata&#39;s website &quot;astrojyoti.com&quot;. Please note that I am NO=\r\nT a salesperson for Pt. SPT, but having personally experienced the unusual =\r\nvibrations of KY Vedas, I can vouch for the &#39;priestly&#39; recitations containe=\r\nd in the CDs, because they are not by laypersons, but traditional, EXPERT P=\r\nANDITs. \n\nUnfortunately, the recordings may NOT be of the best quality, esp=\r\n. the Rig Veda chantings, but when the KYV chantings are heard with rapt at=\r\ntention, the combination of the hoary voices of the Senior Vadhyaars stir u=\r\np the deespest recesses of your soul and help you understand why several ma=\r\nntras have been termed &#39;Veda Mantras&#39; -precisely because they have been ext=\r\nracted from the Vedas! \n\nExamples include the famous &quot;Rudram, Chamakam, Uda=\r\nka Shanthi Mantras including Nakshatra Sukthams, Vishnu Stuthis and Narayan=\r\na Sukthams, Aruna Prasnam, Mahanyasam, Taitreeya Seekshavalli, Bhriguvalli =\r\nand Bhramanandavalli, Mahanarayana&quot;, etc. each of which I was able to trace=\r\n by listening to the 85 different Chapters of KY Vedas!\n\nOne particular KY =\r\nVeda chapter titled &quot;02-KY-AST1-P02&quot; -3 chapters after which the Nakshatram=\r\nalika is recited -is imply hair-raising. It starts with salutations to Devi=\r\n [Shanno-Devi Rabhisthaye -the Shani-devata mantra] and around the 19th min=\r\ntue, beseeches &quot;HEY GAYATHREE&quot;...you&#39;ve got to listen to this, to believe w=\r\nhat I am saying! The experience is simply cosmic, surreal...well, the Engli=\r\nsh language is too poor and fails you, when you need to translate Sanskrit =\r\nand cosmic experiences!!!.\n\nIf Narasimhajee, or anyone else is really inter=\r\nested in listening to the Rudram-Chamakam, Udaka Shanthi Mantras and Mahany=\r\nasa chants of truly astounding quality, please buy the CDs from Giri Stores=\r\n -the Vadhyaars are Sri Swaminatha Ganapadigal and Srinivasa Sastrigal. I d=\r\noubt whether you can find other recitations of comparable quality anywhere =\r\nelse. I am not referring merely to the audio quality, but even to the ABSOL=\r\nUTELY FANTASTIC experience one gets hearing the expert Vadhyaars, transferr=\r\ning as they are their cosmic benefit to the listener.\n\nEnough said, I wante=\r\nd to actually post another request to PVRN to understand why Ketu&#39;s presenc=\r\ne in Meena Rashi in the 8th house should be responsible for mystical experi=\r\nences as mine, but will do so in the other discussion Group, &quot;vedic-astrolo=\r\ngy&quot;.\n\nMay Lord & Guru Brahma&#39;s light shine on us all, through the able pen =\r\nof Shri Narasimhajee. Om Namah Shivaya; Om Namo Narayanaaya!!!\nVenkat \n\n\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to clarify one thing lest I be misunderstood. I a=\r\nm not at all saying \n&gt; that people should not chant veda mantras. They can.=\r\n But I am pointing out \n&gt; that Veda mantras do not work to their potential =\r\nthese days.\n&gt; \n&gt; I can clarify using an analogy. Imagine that mantras are t=\r\nhe weapons used to \n&gt; protect the mind from enemies (weaknesses). After all=\r\n, mantra comes from \n&gt; mana and tra and does mean &quot;that which protects the =\r\nmind&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If regular mantras are like sticks with which you can beat up e=\r\nnemies, veda \n&gt; mantras are like powerful guns with which you can shoot wit=\r\nh precision. \n&gt; However, the correct knowledge related to chanting and expe=\r\nriencing veda \n&gt; mantras is pretty much lost today. Though there are people=\r\n who possess a lot \n&gt; of guns, pretty much nobody knows how to shoot a gun.=\r\n Thus, one who wants to \n&gt; use a gun will have to use it like a stick and b=\r\neat the enemy with the gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; personally, i a=\r\nm in favour of living thru my karmas with consciousness\n&gt; &gt; rather than app=\r\neasing anything/anyone. the grace of consciousness of\n&gt; &gt; savitur is perhap=\r\ns what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not want to make a person=\r\nal comment on you, but want to say something \n&gt; in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; People tal=\r\nk about living thru karmas with consciousness, about surrendering \n&gt; and go=\r\ning through the fruits of karmas with a stable mind etc. But these \n&gt; thing=\r\ns are easier to talk about than to actually do. When the fruit of a \n&gt; real=\r\nly bad karma strikes, then it will be difficult to maintain the same \n&gt; att=\r\nitude and mental stability. One can be shaken. Being able to live through \n=\r\n&gt; the fruits of *any* karma with a stable and unpertubed mind is indeed the=\r\n \n&gt; goal of all. One can get there only after burning/exhausting several \n&gt;=\r\n blocking karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; With some sadhana, some tranquility and stability of=\r\n mind comes. That \n&gt; enables one to do better and more focussed sadhana. Th=\r\nat increases the \n&gt; tranquility and stability of mind. That enables one to =\r\ndo even better \n&gt; sadhana. This slowly picks up and eventually one reaches =\r\nthe state where one \n&gt; can simply live through the fruits of *any* karma wi=\r\nthout any impact on the \n&gt; equanimity and stability of mind. Before that, s=\r\nerious sadhana is needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.co=\r\nmcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 07, 2009 4:00 AM\n&gt; Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Re: gayatri mantra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; namaste narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; thankyou. your words are always very inspiring.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; yes, u are right =\r\nthat what u had recorded was just the humming of ups\n&gt; &gt; and downs of the m=\r\nantra to show the intonation. it stuck in my memory\n&gt; &gt; because it was very=\r\n different from the mantra i have heard recorded by\n&gt; &gt; various people.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; there may not be any perfect rendering of the mantra in the present\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; times...but still one longs for something closer to the real\n&gt; &gt; thing...=\r\nwhatever that may be.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; so the search continues....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; personall=\r\ny, i am in favour of living thru my karmas with consciousness\n&gt; &gt; rather th=\r\nan appeasing anything/anyone. the grace of consciousness of\n&gt; &gt; savitur is =\r\nperhaps what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; however, having a ver=\r\ny very rudimentary &quot;knowledge&quot; of astrology i\n&gt; &gt; sometimes indulge my imag=\r\nination in thinking that with a retro mars,\n&gt; &gt; saturn and mercury my karma=\r\ns must be rather &quot;jatil&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; you mentioned about lord subramanya. carr=\r\nying the imagination a lttle\n&gt; &gt; further, i find an echo of lord subramnaya=\r\n in the krittika nakshatra\n&gt; &gt; which is the lagna nakshatra. there is also =\r\n(imaginatively speaking)\n&gt; &gt; perhaps some connection to have jupiter, sun a=\r\nnd mars on the adra -\n&gt; &gt; mool (rahu-ketu) axis or guru-soul-karma axis?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Personally, i dont have any god i can visualise while meditating\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthough i feel an affinity to shiva sometimes. yesterday while doing\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n gayatri mantra i tried to visualise gayatri and for some reason\n&gt; &gt; that m=\r\nade me think about love and mother.... and that made me cry.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sorry,=\r\n i may be getting carried away...so i will stop here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; many thanks o=\r\nnce again!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; love and best wishes...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

As\n&gt; &gt; I said\n&gt; &gt;&gt; earlier, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed fo=\r\ncus of mind on any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; combination of sounds. When one&#39;s mind repeats the =\r\nsame combination of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sounds over and over again, eventually one&#39;s mind =\r\nmay lose all other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts and become absorbed in that combination of=\r\n sounds. THEN\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences the energy represented by tha=\r\nt combination of sounds.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Different combinations of sounds have di=\r\nfferent energies. But\n&gt; &gt; experiencing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the energy of any combination o=\r\nf sounds is a better experience for\n&gt; &gt; the mind\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than the regular chao=\r\ntic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of\n&gt; &gt; thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The ener=\r\ngy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a\n&gt; &gt; different\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nleague. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras\n&gt; &gt; perfectl=\r\ny in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; today&#39;s times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them, =\r\nveda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other mantras =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt; do not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; really act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a v=\r\neda mantra, one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences the energy of a corrupted version and not =\r\nof the\n&gt; &gt; original veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The expression &quot;Om bhur bhu=\r\nvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the actual\n&gt; &gt; savitru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; gayatri mantra. =\r\nThe actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat savitur&quot; and\n&gt; &gt; ends\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with &quot;pr=\r\nachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatri chantin=\r\ng. I only hummed\n&gt; &gt; the ups\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and downs to show the intonation. I was i=\r\nnstructed to never chant\n&gt; &gt; Savitru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually =\r\nspeaking, that mantra is my food\n&gt; &gt; and I get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever little energy =\r\nI have from it. In order to continue doing my\n&gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the world,=\r\n I will need to be selfish with my food. I can share\n&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; el=\r\nse with the world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Astrology knowledge that we have on earth toda=\r\ny is insufficient to give\n&gt; &gt;&gt; perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to=\r\n do a better job than\n&gt; &gt; astrology\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as we understand it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I h=\r\nave seen my guru make some interesting mantra suggestions. For\n&gt; &gt; example,=\r\n I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; once mentioned to Manish a friend who visits me often and meditates=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; when I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do homam. Manish said, &quot;he will not be interested in doing=\r\n homam by\n&gt; &gt; himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If at all he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi=\r\n homam or Chandi\n&gt; &gt; homam. Teach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He M=\r\nAY be interested in that. He\n&gt; &gt; will like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama stotra=\r\nm.&quot; I had not mentioned much about that\n&gt; &gt; person to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Manish and only =\r\nsaid the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama\n&gt; &gt; stotra is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; indee=\r\nd a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a\n&gt; &gt; person who\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and\n&gt; &gt; interest=\r\ned in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can =\r\ndo\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n needs to do.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 tim=\r\nes for one\n&gt; &gt; whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; year. It will transform his life.&quot; I had not ment=\r\nioned anything\n&gt; &gt; about that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; person to Manish. Interestingly, when th=\r\nis person was young, he was\n&gt; &gt; a sishya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a great spiritual master i=\r\nn the lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (considered to be born with =\r\n Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to me\n&gt; &gt; later that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his guru had also =\r\nadvised him in the past to just stick to Hanuman\n&gt; &gt; chalisa!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Interest=\r\ningly, the same suggestion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, Mani=\r\nsh tells me at other times that he knows nothing and\n&gt; &gt; says\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever=\r\n comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone, =\r\nhe says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guidanc=\r\ne and he is just a nimitta.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe that a sadguru with very li=\r\nmited individual ego and in\n&gt; &gt; tune with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature will be able to give =\r\nfar better guidance in spiritual sadhana\n&gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology as we know=\r\n it today.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahman=\r\nya.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 04, 20=\r\n09 3:45 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dear nar=\r\nasimha ji and friends,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; namaste!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i understand that the =\r\nsyllables / metre of the mantra is very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; important. that is why (prob=\r\nably) mantra was passed on from the guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to ths sishya by word of mo=\r\nuth. somebody even said that in the end\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it is the metre only that re=\r\nmains in the mantra...and not even the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; words. something like the smi=\r\nle of the cheshire cat remaining even\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when the cat itself vanishes i=\r\nn alice in the wonderland.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i too have been looking at / bring=\r\ning to my consciousness the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gayatri mantra of late. for lack of guid=\r\nance, i have been relying on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the internet. the first thing that kind=\r\n of took my breath away was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the layers and layers of meaning attache=\r\nd to each word of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit =\r\nwords are like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that....you peel one layer and another layer lies bel=\r\now..and then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; still another and another....\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but more im=\r\nportantly (perhaps) is the different ways this mantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gets recited. =\r\ni tried to count the syllables to see whether they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; added upto 24. th=\r\ney almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whether om in the=\r\n beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is, but i want t=\r\no be sure.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the =\r\nwords\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; two syllables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rendering &quot;pr=\r\nachodyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables instead of 2.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so i am c=\r\nonfused as to the &quot;right&quot; rendition.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i recall, quite some tim=\r\ne back, narsimha ji had posted his rendition\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of the gayatri mantra i=\r\nn an audio clip. i have not been able to find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it again. but i wish h=\r\ne or someone could guide me about this.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i would also like to =\r\nknow the importance of the number of syllables\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in each mantra and ho=\r\nw this is suitable for different persons\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic =\r\nstructures&quot; which are sometimes / always\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (?) reflected in the astrol=\r\nogical chart. maybe a guru by just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; looking at a person can know intu=\r\nitively what is the &quot;right&quot; mantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for the person. maybe a good astr=\r\nologer can also do the same.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i know this is not an astrology =\r\nforum, but still i am seeking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and =\r\nrahu in 8th house and retro\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna...t=\r\nhroough mantra. These\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; planets aspect all the other planets (jupiter,=\r\n sun and mercury in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third house).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; thankyou!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; love and best wishes,&#39;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vinita\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
