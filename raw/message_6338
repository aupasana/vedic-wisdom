You must come out of your house and wander away be=\r\ngging for alms and fix the mind on the supreme lakshya,6 Brahman. You must =\r\nmeditate without break. Then only you can have the choice either to take or=\r\n not to take orange robe. But never say, =E2=80=9CI have no attachment, I a=\r\nm a mental sannyasin.=E2=80=9D You will weep afterwards. Study the Mundaka =\r\nUpanishad, If sannyasa is not necessary why should there be the four ashram=\r\nas?7 Were the makers of such rules mere fools? How can you understand the g=\r\nlory of sannyasa while remaining in the house and the office, clubs and hot=\r\nels, amidst temptations and attractions, lust and attachment? How can you k=\r\nnow the glory of the destruction of Maya,8 realization of God? You want to =\r\neat, drink and enjoy all the day and night. You are immersed in sensual ple=\r\nasures. There is no dispassion, no vairagya,9 no renunciation. That is why =\r\nyou are afraid to take sannyasa and try to justify your worldliness through=\r\n foolish arguments. You are afraid to bear suffering. You always want to be=\r\n carried away by your sense-craving. How, then, can you know the glory of s=\r\nannyasa? The attachment to men and women, friends and relatives, money and =\r\ngold, has to be ruthlessly burnt down to ashes. All the so-called duties of=\r\n the world have to be kicked away for the sake of that glorious state of se=\r\nlf-realization! The Mahabharata proclaims that for the sake of self-realiza=\r\ntion even the whole world should be renounced without hesitation. \n\n\n"}}
