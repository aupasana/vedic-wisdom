There are plenty of simultaneous things that =\r\ncan happen. Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini =\r\nawakening may not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a person =\r\nsuddenly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very subtl=\r\ne nature. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities of all =\r\nkinds. If by some chance the link to this world opens up, willingly or unwi=\r\nllingly, it can cause quite a bit of problems for both mature as well as im=\r\nmature people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get affec=\r\nted by them easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected by a pl=\r\nethora of false experiences and misplaced priorities. As such a diagnosis l=\r\nike this simply cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of this forum=\r\n (unless I am grossly mistaken).Doing a homa with the desire that someone\n =\r\ngets cured maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences. S=\r\nome part of the person&#39;s karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You must=\r\n have enuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it. It is never advisa=\r\nble to enter into the cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must als=\r\no wear all necessary protections.=C2=A0 The first rule is curing such kind =\r\nof psycho-spiritual maladies is to find out what causes the effect, and if =\r\nthe person is trying to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how much=\r\n of the effect will come to the person and how easily s/he can handle it. A=\r\nll this is complex and not easy at all.

But how is a docto=\r\nr to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of b=\r\noth include similar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things tha=\r\nt others cannot experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinatio=\r\nns&quot;. Are these hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we ha=\r\nve no diagnostic test. However most doctors are pretty good at detecting th=\r\ne attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psyc=\r\nhoses.... their stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the ge=\r\nnuine &quot;I hear voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. About =\r\nvata, most of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. Th=\r\ney are usually unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite v=\r\nata derangement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle ad=\r\nvice. The use of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m s=\r\nure this does no\n good for vata.The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I =\r\nwill do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend thi=\r\ns to any patient. Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the k=\r\nundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and =\r\nwill advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this wil=\r\nl not harm them, though I doubt it will help.Advice and thoughts from all m=\r\nembers would be much appreciated.Om Dum Durgayai NamahaAparna--- In mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Niyama is very essential, ot=\r\nherwise this\n energy could kill you. in actual fact, that is what Kundalini=\r\n wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;However,=C2=A0the ho=\r\nld of the I ness on everything is so tremendous that its difficult to let g=\r\no enough that you can allow this Shakti to complete its job.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\nThe Western educated=C2=A0doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine su=\r\nch a force, because they are conditioned to think in words, most psychiatri=\r\nsts =C2=A0deny the presence of God completely anyway.&gt; This,=C2=A0combined =\r\nwith the fact that for=C2=A0most people, Kundalini is not wanted because th=\r\nese people=C2=A0want the objects which God can give, not God Herself, means=\r\n that the scope for misunderstanding is tremendous.&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happi=\r\nness but most are unable to realise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you =\r\nhappy.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely to=\r\n see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives o=\r\nf misery(when looked at by an external\n observer). However the internal joy=\r\n of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely that some g=\r\nreat ones were completely unaware of their external problems.&gt; &gt;When Kundal=\r\nini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes=\r\n=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by the paren=\r\nt. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is com=\r\nplete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s =\r\nfeeling is that of joy.&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they have to lear=\r\nn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother takes time and i=\r\ns not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&gt; &gt;That results in the pro=\r\nblem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges&quot; of energy may=C2=A0result=C2=A0in mental havoc=\r\n.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought u=\r\np with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air element which is =\r\nunstable anyway can cause serious instability in these\n people.&gt; &gt;Some=C2=\r\n=A0of the=C2=A0people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel=\r\n that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and think =\r\nthat the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the eye=\r\n of the general public.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, =\r\nfor any doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must prece=\r\nde any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama t=\r\no finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping ha=\r\nbits, sexual matters, travel.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all=C2=A0that must be=\r\n regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is essential=\r\n as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totally calm Vata m=\r\nay be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases may be use=\r\nful.&gt; &gt;Then institute small=C2=A0Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas =\r\nto be performed by the patient. That should really improve matters, as\n Gan=\r\nesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out o=\r\nver one-two years.&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be suff=\r\nicient.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, Ma=\r\nrch 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL&gt; STEP in over=\r\ncoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy.=\r\n One\n wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this&gt; body-mind c=\r\nomplex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace ove=\r\nr time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasional=\r\nly goes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out o=\r\nf body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, i=\r\nt comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in i=\r\nt. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without an=\r\ny out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;=\r\ns words to Lord Rama.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something wit=\r\nhout wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deep=\r\nly desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effo=\r\nrt. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and =\r\nironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\nAs you\n do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific&gt; desires. Nature has=\r\n a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what=\r\n Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR&gt; OWN previous actions). S=\r\no Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it=\r\n or want something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s w=\r\nhole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not=\r\n enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, =\r\none may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another &gt; =\r\ncase, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn &gt; as=\r\n a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &gt; exp=\r\nerience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, alw=\r\nays &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming bac=\r\nk to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a\n=\r\n rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in=\r\n THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined=\r\n to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0&gt; *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painfu=\r\nl, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it pan=\r\nicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a cer=\r\ntain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;We are=\r\n like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex =\r\nand scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;If our =\r\nideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect a=\r\nnd if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realiza=\r\ntion of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind\n complex,=\r\n without being scared?&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini=\r\n rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than&gt; =\r\nKundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still le=\r\nft in one&#39;s system.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion=\r\n about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper=\r\n in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcom=\r\nes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mi=\r\nnd complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great =\r\nleader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one =\r\nperson had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, h=\r\ne may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now=\r\n. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such not=\r\nion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some\n signs of progress and ye=\r\nt remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundali=\r\nni in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesse=\r\ns and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual pro=\r\nblems.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recomm=\r\nend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, ov=\r\nercome your&gt; weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I wan=\r\nt to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/p=\r\neople around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a =\r\nnegative attachment.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &gt; whether your Kund=\r\nalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal e=\r\nnemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &gt; not. If your ability =\r\nto resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundali=\r\nni is fast asleep, you are still making\n progress. When you completely over=\r\ncome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &gt; will automatically ascend to t=\r\nhe top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender =\r\nis helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. T=\r\nhough people may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am=\r\n scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all =\r\nthis is just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask god f=\r\nor it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expecta=\r\ntions. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualit=\r\nies of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (wh=\r\nether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting i=\r\nt gratefully. True surrender\n is thinking of Lord with fascination and plea=\r\nsure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without t=\r\nrue surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundali=\r\nni rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It i=\r\ns not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not abou=\r\nt protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse =\r\ntrap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similar=\r\nly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s&gt; protection! God&#39;s p=\r\nrotection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should =\r\nrun away from!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through t=\r\nhe path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize =\r\nthat all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while yo=\r\nu have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime=\r\n. Only detachment\n and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires=\r\n, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self.=\r\n Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kund=\r\nalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Th=\r\ne real key is how light your conditioning is.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;Narasimha&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.ve=\r\ndicastrologer.org/&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;__________________=\r\n______________&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela Sastry &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot; mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Fe=\r\nbruary 28, 2013 6:05 AM&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtad=\r\nevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\nAll the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and\n manthra all=\r\now the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with t=\r\nhe=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a mahadev=\r\natha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .=\r\n But=C2=A0 it can be attained by the righteous behaviour along with manthra=\r\nnushtana .

Consta=\r\nnt efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human m=\r\nind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment, =\r\nmore equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc e=\r\ntc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening\n happens, one has to now =\r\nself identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more in=\r\ntense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good g=\r\nuru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it ca=\r\nn also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some=\r\n of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and giv=\r\nen half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take=\r\n hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the s=\r\name. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more&gt; vital. 4 - While someda=\r\ny or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti aweken=\r\ning and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The =\r\nhuman psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to=\r\n deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of a=\r\nn individual, which protects us from\n various subtle influences and helps u=\r\ns to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reaso=\r\nns, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow f=\r\nree assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of cau=\r\nsing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possibliti=\r\nes are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even =\r\nif such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledg=\r\ne to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing =\r\nnothing more than an intelligent guess work.&gt; Sometimes it will have result=\r\ns, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sou=\r\nnd mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in c=\r\norpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApann=\r\nam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24=\r\n]&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From:\n sunrise_1080 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yaho=\r\nogroups.com &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just want=\r\ned to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a =\r\npatient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been invo=\r\nlved in the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous aw=\r\nakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body e=\r\nxperiences and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin an=\r\nd had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched =\r\nfor an explanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong=\r\n with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged k=\r\nundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a =\r\nspiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has tri=\r\nggered interest and\n research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unf=\r\nortunately these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and =\r\nas we have no treatments for deranged&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them.=\r\n Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this la=\r\ndy confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This=\r\n woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the derang=\r\ned energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she=\r\n cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem=\r\n. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the ku=\r\nndalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or giv=\r\ne her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans amo=\r\nng you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- the=\r\nir suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as=\r\n not to end\n up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti=\r\n marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrumen=\r\nt&quot; and leave the kundalini&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.

There are plenty of simultaneous things that can happen. Kundalini is=\r\n only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini awakening may not even m=\r\nake you see or hear anything, it may make a person suddenly experience some=\r\n other nice things too. The mind is of a very subtle nature. The astral wor=\r\nld is a plethora of endless subtle entities of all kinds. If by some chance=\r\n the link to this world opens up, willingly or unwillingly, it can cause qu=\r\nite a bit of problems for both mature as well as immature people. In the se=\r\nnse, those who are not aware of these can get affected by them easily, even=\r\n those who do sadhana can also get affected by a plethora of false experien=\r\nces and misplaced priorities. As such a\n diagnosis like this simply cannot =\r\nbe done over net, and rarely by people of this forum (unless I am grossly m=\r\nistaken).&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Doing a homa with the desire that someone gets cured may=\r\nbe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences. Some part of th=\r\ne person&#39;s karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You must have enuf spi=\r\nritual backup to know how to deal with it.

But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises fr=\r\nom non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, s=\r\nuch as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in oth=\r\ner words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or t=\r\nhe result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;H=\r\nowever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fak=\r\ne&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories =\r\ntend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in =\r\nmy head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;About vata, most of =\r\nour patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually=\r\n unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangemen=\r\nt. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use =\r\nof Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common-\n I&#39;m sure this does=\r\n no good for vata.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will=\r\n do some on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to=\r\n any patient. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in=\r\n the kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis=\r\n&quot; and will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope th=\r\nis will not harm them, though I doubt it will help.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Advice and tho=\r\nughts from all members would be much appreciated.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Om Dum Durgayai =\r\nNamaha&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Aparna&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this en=\r\nergy could kill you. in actual fact, that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;T=\r\no kill the limited you&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;How=\r\never,&nbsp;the hold of the I ness on everything is so tremendous that its d=\r\nifficult to let go enough that you can allow this Shakti to complete its jo=\r\nb.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp=\r\n;doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because they =\r\nare conditioned to think in words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presen=\r\nce of God completely anyway.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; This,&nbsp;combined with the fact tha=\r\nt for&nbsp;most people, Kundalini is\n not wanted because these people&nbsp;=\r\nwant the objects which God can give, not God Herself, means that the scope =\r\nfor misunderstanding is tremendous.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness =\r\nbut most are unable to realise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy=\r\n.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the=\r\n saints. You are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in=\r\n fact they all lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer=\r\n). However the internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that sain=\r\nt so completely that some great ones were completely unaware of their exter=\r\nnal problems.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the=\r\n external world to sleep.I sometimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby =\r\nbeing thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous=\r\n because the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do =\r\nanything without the mother so\n it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;T=\r\nhe problem with adults is that they have to learn surrender. This surrender=\r\ning of ego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painless process un=\r\nlike that of the baby.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&=\r\nnbsp;surges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;result&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini r=\r\nise are brought up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air =\r\nelement which is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in these peo=\r\nple.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; m=\r\nay be people who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing =\r\nin their lives and think that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them g=\r\net some esteem in the eye of the general public.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Coming =\r\nto the specific problem:In general, for any doctor, the separation of the t=\r\nrue from the false\n claims must precede any attempt at helping the patient.=\r\n A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irre=\r\ngularity, in food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp;that must be regimentalised, then appro=\r\npriate herbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Applic=\r\nation of oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose eve=\r\nn Shiro basti in difficult real cases may be useful.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Then inst=\r\nitute small&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed =\r\nby the patient. That should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord =\r\nof the Muladhara.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over on=\r\ne-two years.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be=\r\n sufficient.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;WBR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from=\r\n\n one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; body-mind complex) to a huge=\r\n palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move i=\r\nnto it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays=\r\n in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of body experience=\r\ns due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risk=\r\ns. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one=\r\n can progress towards complete Self-realization without any out of body exp=\r\neriences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord R=\r\nama.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get so=\r\nmething without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One ma=\r\ny have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put =\r\nenough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unpre=\r\npared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this\n life.&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy=\r\n too many specific&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granti=\r\nng your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right n=\r\now, arising from YOUR&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes g=\r\nives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something e=\r\nlse. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be bor=\r\nn as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth a=\r\nnd pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very heal=\r\nthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; case, one ma=\r\ny deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; as a t=\r\niger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;WBR&gt;&gt;=\r\n experience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives,=\r\n always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an o=\r\nut of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas=\r\n constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life wi=\r\nth this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik for=\r\nce behind it).&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&g=\r\nt; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessa=\r\nrily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and det=\r\nachment.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glu=\r\ned to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started =\r\nto shake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was =\r\nscared that I would kill it!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We ar=\r\ne like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap\n called this body-mind comple=\r\nx and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body=\r\n-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras=\r\n say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping o=\r\nut of this body-mind complex, without being scared?&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;K=\r\nundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far bette=\r\nr than&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditio=\r\nning is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt;When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what one =\r\nneeds, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to=\r\n the surface and torment one. If one\n overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;,=\r\n there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awarenes=\r\ns clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a gre=\r\nat saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desir=\r\ne to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-in=\r\ncarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i=\r\n.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The p=\r\nerson may show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get s=\r\ntuck badly.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini =\r\nin a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses a=\r\nnd wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual proble=\r\nms.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The\n best approach I recommend is to NOT think in=\r\n terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; w=\r\neaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize=\r\n that detachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around y=\r\nou. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attac=\r\nhment.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t wor=\r\nry about &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether=\r\n you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (asht=\r\na pashas) or &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, y=\r\nou are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are stil=\r\nl making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-=\r\nawareness) &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord=\r\n (true Self).&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal=\r\n deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They =\r\nsimply do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, thi=\r\ns is the plain and bare fact.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I w=\r\nant X, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundal=\r\nini rise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a bu=\r\nsiness deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surre=\r\nnder has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surre=\r\nnder is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True=\r\n surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleas=\r\nurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. Tru=\r\ne surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the =\r\nface of (and\n during) Death.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If on=\r\ne without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experience=\r\ns a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a persona=\r\nl god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It =\r\nis not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glue=\r\nd to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scar=\r\ned. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; =\r\nprotection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave dang=\r\ner that one should run away from!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the=\r\n path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize th=\r\nat all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you =\r\nhave\n and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime.=\r\n Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, =\r\ndislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self.

Constant efforts of purificat=\r\nion of the various elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In =\r\nsimpler words this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more n=\r\non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a g=\r\nenuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the D=\r\nevata with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The =\r\nDevata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As =\r\nShakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind =\r\nand body to various other things and entities, some of which are not postiv=\r\ne in nature while some of them are useless, and given half a chance can mak=\r\ne use of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakn=\r\ness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhut=\r\na-suddhi becomes even more&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; vital. 4 - While\n someday or other ever=\r\ny sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising =\r\nup, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The human psycholog=\r\ny as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with vari=\r\nous things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, w=\r\nhich protects us from various subtle influences and helps us to remain as f=\r\nunctional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress,=\r\n or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of va=\r\nrious entities inside the mind and they have chances of causing serious hav=\r\noc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblities are there, it=\r\n is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagno=\r\nsis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the=\r\n situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more tha=\r\nn an intelligent guess work.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n Sometimes it will have results, some=\r\ntimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind=\r\n in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore =\r\nsano. -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddha=\r\nyah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080=\r\n &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot;&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to wa=\r\nrn people of kundalini syndrome based\n on my recent experience of a patient=\r\n of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in=\r\n the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening=\r\n of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experien=\r\nces and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had n=\r\never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an =\r\nexplanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with h=\r\ner (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalin=\r\ni. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritu=\r\nal crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered =\r\ninterest and research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunate=\r\nly these patients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we ha=\r\nve no treatments for deranged&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them.=\r\n Many yogis try to forcibly\n waken the kundalini. My experience with this l=\r\nady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. Thi=\r\ns woman wants to kill herself at times because the suffering from the deran=\r\nged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, and it is something sh=\r\ne cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there could be to her proble=\r\nm. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the k=\r\nundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or gi=\r\nve her the strength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans am=\r\nong you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- th=\r\neir suffering really is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so a=\r\ns not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti=\r\n marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrumen=\r\nt&quot; and leave the kundalini&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; rising bit to God&#39;s will.
