People now-a-days have an extremely toned down under=\r\nstanding of what it means to be a rishi!\n \nAt World Association of Vedic St=\r\nudies (WAVES) 2010 conference at Port of Spain, where I taught homam as a s=\r\npiritual sadhana, there were atleast 3 people who were called by others or =\r\nby themselves as &quot;rishis&quot;. People think rishi just means a brilliant person=\r\n or a nice person or a spiritual person. To be a rishi requires much much m=\r\nuch more.\n \nRish means to flow smoothly and quickly. Rishi is one who swift=\r\nly flows with the divine will. Let me elaborate what that means spiritually=\r\n.\n \nMost beings with an individualized consciousness (like human beings, de=\r\nmons or even deities) are weighed down by the conditioning and will of indi=\r\nvidual egosense (I-ness) and cannot flow smoothly and quickly with divine w=\r\nill due to the weight of the conditioning. Just as a very light leaf flows =\r\nin air more freely while a heavier rock falls due to its gravity, similarly=\r\n one with lighter conditioning flows more freely with divine will, while on=\r\ne with denser conditioning is pulled by the gravity of that conditioning an=\r\nd cannot flow freely with the divine will.\n \nThe director of a drama may gi=\r\nve important roles to an actor without ego and strong views, who is in sync=\r\n with the director and who will simply read one&#39;s lines (even very complex =\r\nones or ones that make no sense initially) without complaining, as opposed =\r\nto someone who has a problem with one&#39;s lines and with what others say to/a=\r\nbout him in the drama and keeps complaining and tries to change the script.=\r\n Similarly, the Supreme Power that runs this universe gives important roles=\r\n to beings who overcame individual egosense, have no individual agendas and=\r\n conditioning, completely in sync with the Supreme Power and flow with divi=\r\nne will.\n \nOne pulled by the gravity of dense conditioning can get some thi=\r\nngs done. In comparison, one pulled by the gravity of *light* conditioning =\r\ncan get *big* things done in this universe. One with *extremely light* cond=\r\nitioning is almost free and can get *really huge* things done in this unive=\r\nrse. One with *zero* (or almost zero) conditioning can get *anything* (or a=\r\nlmost anything) done in this universe.\n \nVarious categories of rishis are i=\r\nn that last zone of zero or near-zero conditioning! They have overcome thei=\r\nr conditioning completely and have no desires, no agendas, no likes and no =\r\ndislikes. They may behave like they have desires, agendas, dislikes, anger =\r\netc, but that is just like a drama actor reading out the lines as asked by =\r\nthe director. As one&#39;s conditioning drops off, individual I-ness and indivi=\r\ndual will wither away and one is in communion with the divine always. One h=\r\nas no will and no desires and one flows with the divine and can do ANY acti=\r\non willed by the divine. One becomes an instrument to implement divine will=\r\n in the world. Such a being is infinitely powerful and can really do anythi=\r\nng. Nature uses such beings for very very important work. Rishi means such =\r\na free-flowing and non-resistant entity.\n \nEven yogis who have directly exp=\r\nerienced oneness with the divine at times can be deluded by the polarities =\r\nof the field of duality from time to time (&quot;GYaaninaamapi chetaaMsi devI bh=\r\nagavatI hi saa balaadaakR^iShya mohaaya mahaamaayaa prayachchhati&quot; - Saptas=\r\nhati). As long as one remains in an individual body (physical or ethereal),=\r\n *some* conditioning will normally remain. Removing the conditioning comple=\r\ntely and being in oneness with the Supreme at all times, is a herculean tas=\r\nk and perhaps not possible in today&#39;s times. Just as only one who has climb=\r\ned the first 7,000 miles of a mountain knows how difficult it is to climb t=\r\nhe next 100 miles, similarly a sadhaka who overcame a lot of one&#39;s conditio=\r\nning alone will know how difficult it is to overcome the last bit of condit=\r\nioning.\n \nRishi is a very serious and sacred word describing really evolved=\r\n beings. It is almost impossible for one to become a rishi in this age. Eve=\r\nn those saints in the last century or two whom their followers called rishi=\r\ns are most probably not rishis. Even if amsha of a rishi comes down to eart=\r\nh in these times, such an amsha may do some great deeds without reaching th=\r\ne level of a rishi again and then merge back (like a thread spawned from a =\r\nmain process in a computer program).\n \nIt is good to take rishis as our rol=\r\ne models and follow them, but let us understand what a rishi means and why =\r\nthey are kept on such a high pedestal in tradition. There is no need to low=\r\ner that pedestal to allow more people to get onto it.\n \nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedi=\r\nc-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prakashkandpal&quot; &lt;prakashkandpal@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; It is very well described by you.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I dont agree with the st=\r\natement that it is not possible to become a &quot;Rajarshi&quot; during the current t=\r\nimes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhagawat Gita itself tells that whenever evil will be at its pea=\r\nk I will come to the rescue of people.

It is foolish to think =\r\nof such a Yoga in Kaliyuga. This was real Raja-Yoga (=3DCommunion with God,=\r\n ie Samaadhi) of divine kings of Iksvaaku dynasty, which enabled them to be=\r\n in samaadhi during war, while brahmin sages needed seclusion for samaadhi.=\r\n During Rajayoga , King was Lord Vishnu. Lord Rama was always in such a sta=\r\nte, the last divine king. Arjuna was not a king, he was granted Rajayoga to=\r\n fulfil some specific purpose of God. Hence, he was a temporary Rajayogi or=\r\n a Rajarshis. Today we find rajayogis in every street, who fear tapasyaa, h=\r\nate yama-niyama, and preach samaadhi to their likes. Shri Mad-Bhaagavata sa=\r\nys in its last skandha : an ignorant shishya prefers an ignorant Guru. Ther=\r\ne can be no Rajayogi or Rajarshi in Kaliyuga.
