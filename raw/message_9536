We are always pu=\r\nlled in different directions by\n&gt; different rinas and dharmas. One needs to=\r\n JUDGE which dharma is higher and\n&gt; which rina is more important.\n&gt;\n&gt; Depen=\r\nding on one&#39;s individual circumstances, one of the following may be\n&gt; the b=\r\nest option:\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) Ignore the complaining wife/husband. Don&#39;t fight or arg=\r\nue, but keep\n&gt; doing your sadhana. As time progresses, (a) she may see the =\r\npositive change\n&gt; in your attitude and stop complaining, (b) she may just g=\r\net used to it and\n&gt; accept her fate, (c) she may keep complaining and YOU m=\r\nay get used to that\n&gt; complaints and accept your fate.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) Talk to her/=\r\nhim and find some compromise that is acceptable. Instead\n&gt; of doing 1 hour =\r\nsadhana, may be do half hour and spend more time doing\n&gt; something she like=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) Give up your idea of sadhana and take whatever you are able to d=\r\no, as\n&gt; sanctioned by your wife/husband, as your sadhana. For example, cook=\r\ning,\n&gt; cleaning dishes, washing clothes, taking her to a movie, massaging h=\r\ner\n&gt; feet, taking kids to activities etc can also be sadhanas.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any acti=\r\nvity can be done with a protesting/dissenting attitude or an\n&gt; agitated min=\r\nd, or with love and caring and a calm and composed mind. Every\n&gt; activity i=\r\nnvolves interacting with some objects. Just as god is in idol and\n&gt; fire, h=\r\ne is in vegetables you cut, food you cook, feet you massage etc. If\n&gt; you s=\r\nee an action as a chore or look at it or its object(s) with an impure\n&gt; min=\r\nd (e.g. with lust or with anger or with frustration) or focus more of\n&gt; you=\r\nr attention on yourself, then it becomes impure. If you approach the\n&gt; acti=\r\non with a calm and devoted mind, see the action and its object(s) with\n&gt; lo=\r\nve, devotion and caring and focus the more of your attention on the\n&gt; actio=\r\nn and its objects (rather than youself and your own happiness), then\n&gt; it b=\r\necomes a ritual or sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, in some actions one hates, it is=\r\n very difficult to bring that\n&gt; calmness and caring. In some other actions =\r\n(e.g. sex), one may become too\n&gt; selfish or self-absorbed and think too muc=\r\nh about one&#39;s own sensations, to\n&gt; look at the action and other persons/obj=\r\nects with love, caring, devotion.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, we normally don&#39;t talk about co=\r\nnverting all actions into sadhana and\n&gt; talk about japam, homam etc. It is =\r\neasier in those to look at the action\n&gt; and its objects with a sense of pur=\r\nity and devotion. However, if that is\n&gt; not possible and one has to do some=\r\n other actions, why note TRY to convert\n&gt; them into sadhana? Try to perform=\r\n the action with a calm, stable, selfless\n&gt; mind, focus attention on the ac=\r\ntion and its objects and imbibe love and\n&gt; caring into your thinking.\n&gt;\n&gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, at some stage, (3) has to become part of one&#39;s sadhana. O=\r\nne has\n&gt; to convert every action into a sadhana. Just doing japam or homam =\r\nfor an\n&gt; hour or two may not cut it.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you live in a really cold count=\r\nry, your room can get very cold. If you\n&gt; turn the heater on for an hour ev=\r\neryday and keep it off rest of the time,\n&gt; the room will overall be very co=\r\nld. Similarly, if you do sadhana for an\n&gt; hour, you may feel better, but th=\r\ne normal attitude returns. To make\n&gt; permanent progress, the heater has to =\r\nbe on most of the day! Of course, as\n&gt; you cannot do japam or homam for 12 =\r\nhours a day, you have to convert\n&gt; whatever you do (eating, driving to work=\r\n, your work, driving back, cooking,\n&gt; eating, talking to people, etc) into =\r\nsadhana. At some stage, every seeker\n&gt; will have to start doing it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;\n&gt; http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------=\r\n--\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Durgesh Mishra &lt;d=\r\nurgesh.mishra@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday=\r\n, July 30, 2013 11:43 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] most difficult question\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are interested in spiritual sadhana, dhyaan, h=\r\nomam, fasting etc and\n&gt; your spouse doesn&#39;t like you doing it ? then what s=\r\nhould you do ?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Durgesh O Mishra\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; &quot;If you only have =\r\na hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\n\n\n-- \n&quot;If you =\r\nonly have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&quot;\n\r\n--f46d043bdece08e6b304e2c94102\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you Guruji for this enlightening approach.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Durgesh O Mishra=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gm=\r\nail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On 31 July 2013 12:22, HRGMAI=\r\nL &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:hramalingam@...&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot;&gt;hramalingam@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=\r\n=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padd=\r\ning-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Namaste to all&lt;br&gt;\nThese kind of Up=\r\nadesa can not come ordinarily.
