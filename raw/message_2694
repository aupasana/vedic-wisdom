You have to think like a=\r\nn atheistic scientist to anticipate how the correlation between physics and=\r\n mahabhutas will manifest itself to him! First, let&#39;s take the core axiom o=\r\nf all science. Science takes it as an axiom that since all perception is th=\r\nrough the senses, the universe is composed *solely* of that which can be se=\r\nnsed (and nothing else). We sense space, we sense time, we see, we feel, we=\r\n taste, we smell, we hear. So all these percepts are real, nothing else is.=\r\n If the grand superset of all percepts can be shown to follow a strict set =\r\nof laws, then science can actually rest pretty easy, no? If everything fits=\r\n, then why adopt any new-fangled more complex theories of reality when ever=\r\nything is fully explainable using a simpler theory.\n\nSo the question before=\r\n all physicists has long been - Can they actually explain everything about =\r\nthe grand superset of all percepts? First there was Newton who showed the v=\r\nery clear laws of motion (so no magic there, he showed). Then there were a =\r\nwhole bunch of chemistry types who saw that no matter how much you divide m=\r\natter, it&#39;s still there. It combines with other matter and makes different =\r\ncompounds, but atoms are not being messed with. Are atoms perceivable - no =\r\nthey&#39;re not, but collect them in a huge bunch and you&#39;ll see them, divide t=\r\nhem into individual atoms and you cant see them, but they&#39;re still there be=\r\ncause you can collect them all over again. And then Einstein came along and=\r\n showed the equivalence of energy and matter, thereby leading even more cre=\r\ndence to the fact that the sum total of energy and matter is always conserv=\r\ned, and that too according to strict laws. Where is the need to construct a=\r\nn imaginary God or listen to the outdated Vedas which clearly say - there i=\r\ns more to it than the senses can perceive?\n\n(Still in the atheistic scienti=\r\nst frame of mind) The remaining frontiers to complete the understanding of =\r\nall nature were the big bang (how did it come about?), black holes (what la=\r\nws are active inside them?), and a theory of particles that unifies gravity=\r\n with the rest of matter. Regarding this third part, try as they might, the=\r\ny just have not been able to come up with some common denominator that allo=\r\nws gravity and the rest of matter to follow the *same* set of strict laws. =\r\nThen, along come these string theorists and show that if the underlying thi=\r\nng is assumed to be this teensy weensy string, then maybe we can make thing=\r\ns work (i.e. have a uniform set of laws for gravity and matter). But the ho=\r\nw of that is what makes this discussion interesting to this forum. They nee=\r\nded to give this string no less than 11-dimensions(!) to make things work.\n=\r\n\n\nNow lets zoom in and carefully analyze this point. 11 dimensions? What is=\r\n a dimension that is not part of the 4 perceivable ones? If you listen care=\r\nfully to some of these scientists, the reason they created the remaining 7 =\r\nis that that they needed to &quot;give&quot; these strings 7 extra degrees of freedom=\r\n. They didnt actually see any dimension, but they needed to postulate these=\r\n &quot;degrees of freedom&quot;. A degree of freedom is simply a *non-perceivable* di=\r\nmension i.e. where their string, or parts of it, can exist without followin=\r\ng laws of these 4 dimensions, yet obey some higher laws (e.g. conservation =\r\nof matter/energy). The interesting and most crucial part is right here - th=\r\ney have finally been forced to give these matter-subdivisions (strings) non=\r\n-sensory reality. In other words, they have been forced to admit to the exi=\r\nstence of a non-sensory reality, which is precisely what the Vedas have bee=\r\nn harping about all along - that Prakriti gets perceivable by the jnanendri=\r\nyas only after panchikarana of the tattwas into the mahabhutas but neverthe=\r\nless, it maintains non-sensory existence even at the tattwa level!\n\nSo in e=\r\nxactly this sense, I am saying that physics is being led the way of the ved=\r\nic text, if only through their equations!!\n\nHope this makes sense,\n\nRegards=\r\n,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; D=\r\near Sundeep,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamac=\r\nharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some=\r\n help to you. He did mention in details about the process of creation as he=\r\n saw it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos=\r\n. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted =\r\nwith the chaos, it produced some universal energies which are more commonly=\r\n known as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;=\r\nVidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the actual physical elements as we see =\r\nit, but more the essence of the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot;=\r\n and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more ene=\r\nrgy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulti=\r\nng from the previous and each one resulting in some energy states, which in=\r\n the end resulted in 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nThere is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. =\r\nI feel there may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional ph=\r\nysics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As much as I=\r\n could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the ability to penetrat=\r\ne the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is quite half form=\r\ned. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by mult=\r\niple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many which=\r\n &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a =\r\ncorrelation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble op=\r\ninion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between basi=\r\nc Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation), non-locality=\r\n etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of pan=\r\nch-mahabhuta?!..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would=\r\n like to know more about how exactly you can link these two, because I myse=\r\nlf with my limited understand fail to see any viable correlation at all as =\r\nof now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n The other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical ph=\r\nysics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality=\r\n? These two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reali=\r\nty. It need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; Which is why Richard Feynman o=\r\nnce famously quoted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no=\r\n one know what it really is!\n&gt;  \n&gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creat=\r\nion is almost the essence of everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, th=\r\nere would be really nothing  more left to do.
