In Ramana=E2=80=99s words, =E2=80=9CA big vessel us=\r\ned to be put on\nthe fire. Whatever vegetables were received till noon used =\r\nto be cut and put\ninto it, boiled and sambar made. There was no ladle even =\r\nto stir and mix\nthem. We used to take a piece of firewood, chisel it and us=\r\ne it for stirring\nthose vegetables in the vessel. That preparation was the =\r\nonly side dish.\nWhen we mixed it with rice and ate, it used to be very tast=\r\ny. The labour\nalso was comparatively less.=E2=80=9D\n\nAs the Ashram grew and=\r\n the number of visitors increased, the cooking also\nbecame more complicated=\r\n and time-consuming. Up until the late 1920s\nChinnaswami acted as the main =\r\ncook, with the assistance of Dandapani Swami\nand others. When he became the=\r\n Ashram manager, he was replaced in the\nkitchen by a number of Brahmin wido=\r\nws - Santammal, Lokammal, Subbalakshmi\nAmmal,Sampurnamma and others. Only m=\r\nembers of the Brahmin caste were allowed\nto do the cooking.\n\nWork with Sri =\r\nRamana had both its difficult moments and its pleasant\nmoments. Although he=\r\n was full of kindness he was also a strict\ndisciplinarian and would not tol=\r\nerate the slightest negligence.Everything\nhad to be done perfectly and with=\r\n full awareness. He demanded that his\ninstructions be followed to the lette=\r\nr.\n\nOne evening a disciple who was a solicitor, insisted on helping with th=\r\ne\nwork. He was asked to move a vessel containing sambar.As he moved it some=\r\n\ndrops spilled over the sides. At once Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CYou are fit =\r\nonly for\narguing before the Court. This work is not for you.=E2=80=9D\n\nKunj=\r\nu Swami narrates, =E2=80=9CSri Bhagavan used to go into the kitchen by 4 a.=\r\nm.\nand start cutting vegetables; one or two of us would also join and help.=\r\n\nSometimes the amount of vegetables used to startle us. Bhagavan managed to=\r\n\ncut much more and more quickly than the rest of us. At such times we would=\r\n\nlook up at the clock in our impatience to finish the job and try and have\n=\r\nanother nap. Bhagavan would sense our impatience and say: =E2=80=98Why do y=\r\nou look\nat the clock?=E2=80=99 We tried to bluff Bhagavan saying: =E2=80=98=\r\nIf only we could complete\nthe work before 5, we could meditate for an hour.=\r\n=E2=80=99 Bhagavan would mildly\nretort: =E2=80=98The allotted work has to b=\r\ne completed in time. Other thoughts are\nobstacles, not the amount of work. =\r\nDoing the allotted work in time is itself\nmeditation. Go ahead and do the j=\r\nob with full attention.=E2=80=9D\n\nAn unwritten rule demanded that the kitch=\r\nen helpers had to continue working\nuntil the last meal had been served and =\r\ncleared away.Chinnaswami did not\nallow any of them to stay in the Hall to m=\r\neditate or to listen to the talks\nwhen they were supposed to be working. Su=\r\nndaram reports, =E2=80=9CWhen we would\nsneak in and hide ourselves behind p=\r\neople=E2=80=99s backs, Bhagavan would look at us\nsignificantly,as if saying=\r\n, =E2=80=98Better go to your work. Don=E2=80=99t ask for\ntrouble.=E2=80=99=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nWhen the cook Subbalakshmi Ammal wanted to meditate more and com=\r\nplained that\nthe kitchen work would take up all of her time, Ramana answere=\r\nd, =E2=80=9CIf you\nidentify yourself with the body,you are bound to dualiti=\r\nes. Work would\nappear difficult. Even if we free ourselves from work will t=\r\nhe mind cease to\nwander? It does not let us even sleep in peace. It keeps w=\r\nandering as in\ndreams.=E2=80=9D\n\n\nFor each vegetable Ramana knew a special =\r\nkind of preparation.Nothing was\nthrown away. If he cut spinach, he separate=\r\nd the leaves, the stalks and the\nroots. With the leaves he made the curry,t=\r\nhe stalks were bound together,\ncooked and put into the sambar and the roots=\r\n were washed carefully, squeezed\nand their juice put into the rasam. Any or=\r\nange peel or apple peel was put\ninto the chutney. The leftovers from the pr=\r\nevious day were warmed up and\nserved at the following breakfast, along with=\r\n the iddlies. If there was any\nsoup or vegetables left, they were put into =\r\nthe sambar. This was against the\ncaste rules of the Brahmins, according to =\r\nwhich leftovers may not be used\nthe following day. But Ramana insisted that=\r\n the avoidance of waste was more\nimportant than anything else.\n\nSampurnamma=\r\n recounted another story along the same lines,=E2=80=9COnce a feast was\nbei=\r\nng prepared for his birthday. Devotees sent food in large quantities:\nsome =\r\nsent rice, some sugar, some fruits.Someone sent a huge load of brinjals\nand=\r\n we ate brinjals day after day. The stalks alone made a big heap which\nwas =\r\nlying in a corner.Bhagavan asked us to cook them as a curry! I was\nstunned,=\r\n for even cattle would refuse to eat such useless stalks. Bhagavan\ninsisted=\r\n that the stalks were edible, and we put them in a pot to boil along\nwith d=\r\nry peas. After six hours of boiling they were as hard as\never. We were at a=\r\n loss what to do, yet we did not dare to disturb Bhagavan.\nBut he always kn=\r\new when he was needed in the kitchen and he would leave the\nHall even in th=\r\ne middle of a discussion. A casual visitor would think that\nhis mind was al=\r\nl on cooking. =E2=80=98How is the curry getting on?=E2=80=99 he asked. =E2=\r\n=80=98Is it\na curry we are cooking?\nWe are boiling steel nails!=E2=80=99 I =\r\nexclaimed, laughing. He stirred the stalks\nwith the ladle and went away wit=\r\nhout saying anything.Soon after we found\nthem quite tender. The dish was si=\r\nmply delicious and everybody was asking\nfor a second helping. Bhagavan\nchal=\r\nlenged the diners to guess what vegetable they were eating.Everybody\npraise=\r\nd the curry and the cook, except Bhagavan. He swallowed the little he\nwas s=\r\nerved in one mouth-full like a medicine and refused a second helping. I\nwas=\r\n very disappointed, for I had taken so much trouble to cook his stalks\nand =\r\nhe would not even taste them properly.\n\nThe next day he was telling somebod=\r\ny, Sampurnamma was distressed that I did\nnot eat her wonderful curry. Can s=\r\nhe not see that everyone who eats is\nmyself? And what does it matter who ea=\r\nts the food? It is the cooking that\nmatters, not the cook or the eater. A t=\r\nhing done well, with love and\ndevotion, is its own reward. What happens to =\r\nit later matters little, for it\nis out of our hands.\n\nOn another occasion h=\r\ne said, =E2=80=9CWhat is taste? It is what our tongue tells us.\nWe think th=\r\nat taste is in the food itself, but it is not so. The food itself\nis neithe=\r\nr tasty nor not tasty; it is the tongue that makes it so. To me no\ntaste is=\r\n pleasant or unpleasant, it is just as it is.=E2=80=9D Although Sri Ramana\n=\r\nwas an excellent cook, took great care in the preparation of the meals and\n=\r\ndid not tolerate any carelessness on the part of the cooks, the pleasure of=\r\n\neating seemed to mean nothing to him.\n\nAt the end of the 1930s he stopped =\r\ncooking, as the stream of visitors was\ngrowing ever larger and building pro=\r\njects increasingly demanded his\nattention. But even so he still remained in=\r\n constant contact with the\nkitchen.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A bi=\r\nography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=\r\n=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd147f8990893047fc7385a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In the early years at Ramanashram the food=\r\n was quite simple&lt;/span&gt;, it was only in later years that there were large =\r\nnumbers of visitors, so it did not take long to cook the meals.=C2=A0&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In Ramana=E2=80=99s words, =E2=80=9CA big vessel=\r\n used to be put on the fire.
