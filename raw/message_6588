The atman is entirely opposed to action=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, note one fact. Long after becoming a sannyasin, Swami \n=\r\n&gt; Sivananda travelled the world, wrote books, gave lectures and founded \n&gt; =\r\nDivine Life Society, among other &quot;actions&quot;! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; If he established DLS with the expectation that it becomes a success or =\r\n\n&gt; 10,000 people join it or some such thing, then it would become an \n&gt; ign=\r\norant action, i.e. action with attachment. If he did the action \n&gt; complete=\r\nly ready for any outcome and without a sense of ownership, and \n&gt; as an ins=\r\ntrument of the divine will, then it is neither &quot;worldly&quot; nor \n&gt; binding nor=\r\n ignorant. The problem is not &quot;actions&quot;, but actions with \n&gt; attachment and=\r\n a sense of ownership, i.e. actions driven by the will and \n&gt; agenda of a l=\r\nimited ego.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actions should not be spoken ill of like this. Detached ac=\r\ntion is a \n&gt; *sacred duty* of every being. Gods and rishis came back again =\r\nand again \n&gt; to earth to engage in detached action.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; If &quot;the atman is entirely opposed to action&quot;, then why is atman (Sel=\r\nf) \n&gt; even allowing action? Why doesn&#39;t it simply halt everything? Or, is a=\r\nll \n&gt; the action happening outside of atman? Is there anything outside of \n=\r\n&gt; atman at all?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some buddhist philosophies coined the term anatman (no=\r\nn-Self) to \n&gt; describe transient things. But, in Vedic philosophy, there is=\r\n no \n&gt; anatman. All that is is atman (Self). Ocean is permanent and still, =\r\nbut \n&gt; ripples that arise in it are transient and moving. But ripples are p=\r\nart \n&gt; of ocean only and you do not start labeling ripples as &quot;non-ocean&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman or Purusha or Shiva is the potential energy of this cosmos, whil=\r\ne \n&gt; Maya or Prakriti or Shakti is the kinetic energy of this cosmos. Shiva=\r\n \n&gt; and Shakti are seen as different entities by some people, but rishis \n&gt;=\r\n have declared their oneness. Potential energy becomes kinetic energy and \n=\r\n&gt; vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; Atman is the still ocean and Maya is the force (kinetic)=\r\n that gives rise \n&gt; to moving ripples on the surface. A ripple that exerts =\r\nitself to move in \n&gt; a particular way keeps colliding with the force and ke=\r\neps moving hither \n&gt; and tither in a chaotic way for a very long time. A ri=\r\npple that does not \n&gt; exert itself and moves smoothly as dictated by the fo=\r\nrce will eventually \n&gt; grind to a halt and cease to exist as a ripple on th=\r\ne surface. It then \n&gt; becomes part of the still ocean. If a ripple exerts i=\r\ntself to become \n&gt; still, it may even take longer to become still. What pro=\r\nlongs a ripple \n&gt; is not movement but resisting the direction given by the =\r\nforce and \n&gt; exerting to move in a particular way (or even exerting to beco=\r\nme still). \n&gt; A ripple that surrenders to the force will ride the course an=\r\nd die down \n&gt; faster.\n&gt; \n&gt; Contemplate the imagery I presented above regard=\r\ning Atman and Maya, \n&gt; ignorant/egoistic action and detached action! It is =\r\nvery apt.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In not-so-distant past, sannyasins =\r\nremained in ashrams and isolated \n&gt; themselves from society and did their s=\r\nadhana. Swami Vivekananda started \n&gt; a new trend.\n&gt; \n&gt; A sannyasin renounce=\r\ns expectation of things from people stuck in \n&gt; transient material world an=\r\nd does not depend on anyone. But he may still \n&gt; *give* basic material thin=\r\ngs to those hapless people stuck in transient \n&gt; material world! For exampl=\r\ne, Swami Vivekananda and his brother monks \n&gt; went to places struck by plag=\r\nue, floods, droughts, cyclones etc and \n&gt; served people. They provided food=\r\n, medicines etc (instead of lecturing \n&gt; that body is a transient illusion =\r\nand one should stop worrying about its \n&gt; welfare!) and also did constructi=\r\non work. They ignored the welfare of \n&gt; their own bodies, put themselves at=\r\n risk and overcame maya personally. \n&gt; But they served those still stuck in=\r\n maya without looking down upon them \n&gt; or their needs or maya that trapped=\r\n them! Those who wanted food got \n&gt; food, those who wanted medicines got me=\r\ndicines and those who wanted \n&gt; books got books. Renunciation means you do =\r\nnot expect anything from \n&gt; anyone and accept whatever comes to you natural=\r\nly. It does not \n&gt; necessarily mean rejecting or ignoring others. Overcomin=\r\ng maya does not \n&gt; require belittling maya or belittling those still stuck =\r\nin maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; The trend started by Swami Vivekananda was continued by Swami=\r\n Sivananda. \n&gt; For that reason, it is a bit weird to see him talking so ill=\r\n of action! \n&gt; He was obviously trying to inspire a specific group of peopl=\r\ne for a \n&gt; specific body of work. These words are neither universal nor do =\r\nthey \n&gt; reflect his tremendous wisdom I have seen elsewhere!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        =\r\n*        *\n&gt; \n&gt; All this intellectual discussion may be satisfying to some,=\r\n but the \n&gt; quote from Swami Brahmanananda in the other mail is very apt: &quot;=\r\nYou have \n&gt; been only hearing of all these spiritual things. Now realise th=\r\nem. You \n&gt; have done enough study and reasoning. Now do some spiritual prac=\r\ntice. \n&gt; First take up that aspect of God which appeals to you most. Follow=\r\n your \n&gt; own path of Sadhana. When you realise God through it, you will fee=\r\nl the \n&gt; joy of realising Him also in other aspects and through other paths=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; According to Ramakrishna, Swami Brahmananda was a gopala who accomp=\r\nanied \n&gt; Lord Krishna in a previous life. His words are simple, pragmatic a=\r\nnd \n&gt; powerful.\n&gt; \n&gt; I want this forum to facilitate exchange of Vedic know=\r\nledge (and I will \n&gt; also be contributing, though in spurts). But I want mo=\r\nre that this forum \n&gt; should inspire people to do sadhana and find God.
