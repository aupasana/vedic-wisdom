Anybody will be in awe of you looking a=\r\nt yr  accomplishments. Rare n unachievable. Yr Poem &#39;Blissful Ignorance&#39;is =\r\nvery thought provoking - the last verse applies to people like me. \n\nYou al=\r\nl seem highly blessed by The Almighty. He has also created people like us w=\r\nho are not so blessed and right now are going through a real rough patch in=\r\n our life.\n\nMy husband who is also an IIT-IAN Delhi(B. Tech civil) was deal=\r\nt a real hard blow by fate in 2009 when he lost a very well paid job n was =\r\nlaid off for almost a  yr. Actually since then we are only on a terrible fi=\r\nnancial n emotional downslide. He is 59yrs old n still not in a position to=\r\n build a house. He supported his father all his life n still Father sold hi=\r\ns own house and did not choose to give him, may be because Bala married me.=\r\n Our stories of monetary losses are too many. Got terribly cheated in a lan=\r\nd deal etc. etc...................\n\nSince you seem so able n a perfect Astr=\r\nologer I hope you will provide us with some guidance whether we will be abl=\r\ne to sail thru&#39; life without troubling our kith n kin and w/o  losing our s=\r\nelf esteem.\n\nOur problems are compounded by my failing health due to Osteoa=\r\nrthiritis. We live in Bahrain. Owing to his frequent changing of jobs we ar=\r\ne made to pack unpack many times and in the process have lost a lot of mone=\r\ny n mental peace. I am a housewife. Also we are chidless. Ours is an inter-=\r\ncaste marriage. My husband&#39;s name is Bala. He is a Brahmin from Palaghat(Iy=\r\ner), whereas I am from Delhi (Both my parents expired within last one n a h=\r\nalf yrs.)after that family n relations have all fallen apart. Whenever we g=\r\no to India we have to now stay in some lodge or hotel. All this is only inc=\r\nreasing our tensions, with not sufficient money to get by. He is not able t=\r\no get a well-paid job without which we shudder to think what might happen t=\r\no us in future n at older age, who will take care of us, things like that. =\r\nWe would consider ourselves very fortunate if we could get yr expert advice=\r\n. \n\nI have also studied Astrology on my own sitting at home. But when compa=\r\nred to you I am nothing. Bala does have faith in my analysis of his chart b=\r\nut lately I am not able to see a few things clearly for him. So I thought o=\r\nf finding some help n I felt I found one of the best, all by God&#39;s Grace! W=\r\ne hope thru you we will get HIS help which we need very badly and soon.\n   =\r\n\nI am providing his n my birth details :\n\nBALA 17 Oct 1953 - Time-7.05 am,-=\r\n Place- Manama, Bahrain. \n\nWIFE 8 JUNE 1958 -  Time-10.00 pm - Jodhpur Raja=\r\nsthan India\n\n\nPlease let us know if there is any fees to be paid and how.\n\n=\r\n\nPlease accept our obeisance unto your feet. And may The Almighty Lord cont=\r\ninue to shower His blessings upon yr very dedicated family.\n\n\nBest Regards\n=\r\n\nBalas\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Here is a small verse on Lord Ganesha =\r\n(sent earlier without Devanagari \n&gt; text).
