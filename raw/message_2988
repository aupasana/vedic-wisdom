I wanted to see where she was really going, and so when =\r\nshe\nleft, I waited silently under the tree outside.\n\nShe thought I did not =\r\nknow anything. She went to several houses, collected\nall the required thing=\r\ns in a big vessel and returned. I closed my eyes and\npretended\ncomplete ign=\r\norance.
