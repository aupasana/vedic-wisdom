Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be only re=\r\nquired in the initial \nstages when you are still struggling to acquire a st=\r\neady mind needed for mantra \nsadhana success. Once you have achieved some l=\r\nevel of success, discipline that \nmay have been required in the initial sta=\r\nges is no longer necessary.\n\nI have read a few of Sivanandas books....most =\r\nof them are available on their \nwebsite for free downloads as pdf. And what=\r\n he has stated is that to develop a \nsteady mind, strict discipline is nece=\r\nssary on food and detachment from sexual \nactivity as would be=C2=A0in celi=\r\nbacy. Once you have been able to steady you mind, \nyou may give up this dis=\r\ncipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he did a lot \nof penance while =\r\nhe was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that people thing \nof him today=\r\n is essentially part of his adult life.....once he had already \nperfected h=\r\nis ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana alone. You read any \nmyth=\r\nology, purana or granth and you will come across Rishi&#39;s who are supposed t=\r\no \nbe pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be ever ready to curse anybod=\r\ny even with a \nslightest disappointment, most of them seemed to have big eg=\r\nos.\n\nI do not know if you have read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,=C2=A0 =\r\nbut if you read \nthat, even when Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or =\r\nhis gurus did not like \nbeing challenged on any matter and this is time and=\r\n again=C2=A0seen in his books.\n\nOfcourse above all, you need to keep your e=\r\ngo in control before the Lord even \nthough you may be reckless to other hum=\r\nans. There is someone I know....I do not \nknow him personally but only thro=\r\nugh message exchanges over groups like this. He \nseems to have knowledge of=\r\n a lot of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite a lot of \nthem. Success seems t=\r\no illude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana \nfor others, it=\r\n succeeds immediately but not when he does this for himself. And \nhe was on=\r\nce=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I =\r\n\nreally do not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific =\r\nneeds. \nSo I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of differe=\r\nnt sadhana \nfrom everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his praye=\r\nr one day that \nthe effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear =\r\nand if the Lord could \nprovide him the success he is looking for in his lif=\r\ne. He retorted and shot back \nat me that he did not spend time and energy i=\r\nn learning these various tantric \nsadhanas just to beg before god, he only =\r\nknows how to demand from god.! I \nreminded him that all this while, he was =\r\nnot having any problems begging for \nhelp and suggestion from other group m=\r\nembers and yet, he is not willing to beg \nfrom god when really god is the o=\r\nne and only who can really do anything the \nproblems he is facing. I do not=\r\n think even Ravana had that attitude that this \nperson did,=C2=A0when he wo=\r\nuld sit down for his sadhana.\n\nCheers,\nBhupendra\n\n\n\n\n______________________=\r\n__________\nFrom: silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Mon, November 15, 2010 11:44:16 AM\nSubject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Re: Success with Mantras\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaskar,\nHow did Ravana got s=\r\nuccess with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with \nloss of Ahamka=\r\nra and purity of mind ?\nWhere is the liberation without shakti, even the sl=\r\naves were humble, devoted and \nwith complete surrender to their masters, wh=\r\nat results did they ever get ?\nThere is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobh=\r\nti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal \nho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vine=\r\net saral ho&quot;.

How can we purify the five eleme=\r\nnts?\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is attachment to something which we think of as our poss=\r\nession, can \n&gt;the earth element inside us be considered to be pure? If ther=\r\ne is attachment to \n&gt;something which we want to control, can the fire eleme=\r\nnt inside us be considered \n&gt;to be pure? And so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we are vulnerab=\r\nle to the six internal enemies - lust, anger, greed, \n&gt;delusion, wantonness=\r\n and jealosy - then aren&#39;t there still impurities?\n&gt; \n&gt; Complete surrender =\r\nand humility that I mentioned are not some hollow virtues. \n&gt;They are the r=\r\neal signs of purity.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Whatever mantra you are given by your =\r\nguru, whatever mantra you picked out of \n&gt;attraction, or whatever mantra yo=\r\nu otherwise do, please do not think too much \n&gt;whether it is the right mant=\r\nra. That is secondary. IF there is a mantra you use, \n&gt;use it sincerely and=\r\n with devotion. Use it as a tool to increase your surrender \n&gt;and devotion.=\r\n At that end, THAT is what matters and brings results.\n&gt; \n&gt; A person with a=\r\n broken leg needs to use a walking stick until the leg cures and \n&gt;becomes =\r\nfit. How big or heavy the stick is, what wood it is made of, what is the \n&gt;=\r\ncarving on it, etc, is not that important. The main purpose of the stick to=\r\n give \n&gt;complete rest to the leg and help it cure fast. If one worries too =\r\nmuch about \n&gt;the beauty and technical details of the stick and ends up putt=\r\ning stress on the \n&gt;leg, the stick does not serve its purpose. The stick is=\r\n helpful only if you \n&gt;consciously spare the leg from effort. Once the leg =\r\ncures, you can then not only \n&gt;walk but also run. Similarly, a lot of techn=\r\nical details of the mantra do not \n&gt;matter much. Use mantra to focus the mi=\r\nnd and cure it of its conditioning (i.e. \n&gt;impurity!).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Chandan Sabharwal &lt;chandan.sabharwal@&gt; \n&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; then what about=\r\n tantras which proclaim that unless the 5 elements are \n&gt; &gt; not purified fi=\r\nrst , every puja / ritual is simply abhichara ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards,\n&gt; &gt; Chand=\r\nan Sabharwal.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan-da,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nice words!

Cess=\r\nation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be only required in the initial stage=\r\ns when you are still struggling to acquire a steady mind needed for mantra =\r\nsadhana success. Once you have achieved some level of success, discipline t=\r\nhat may have been required in the initial stages is no longer necessary.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have read a few of Sivanandas books....most of=\r\n them are available on their website for free downloads as pdf. And what he=\r\n has stated is that to develop a steady mind, strict discipline is necessar=\r\ny on food and detachment from sexual activity as would be&nbsp;in celibacy.=\r\n Once you have been able to steady you mind, you may give up this disciplin=\r\ne. If you look at the case of Ravana, he did a lot of penance while he was =\r\nyoung. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that people thing of him today is esse=\r\nntially part of his adult life.....once he had already perfected his abilit=\r\ny to concentrate. But why look at Ravana alone. You read any mythology, pur=\r\nana or granth and you will come across Rishi&#39;s who are supposed to be pious=\r\n and humble, but they&nbsp;seem to be ever ready to curse anybody even with=\r\n a slightest disappointment, most of them seemed to have big egos.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do not know if you have read the Aghora books on Vim=\r\nalananda,&nbsp; but if you read that, even when Vimalananda talks of giving=\r\n up ego, he or his gurus did not like being challenged on any matter and th=\r\nis is time and again&nbsp;seen in his books.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;O=\r\nfcourse above all, you need to keep your ego in control before the Lord eve=\r\nn though you may be reckless to other humans. There is someone I know....I =\r\ndo not know him personally but only through message exchanges over groups l=\r\nike this. He seems to have knowledge of a lot of sadhana&#39;s and has practice=\r\nd quite a lot of them. Success seems to illude him though. According to him=\r\n, when he does sadhana for others, it succeeds immediately but not when he =\r\ndoes this for himself. And he was once&nbsp;asking everybody and anybody to=\r\n help him out with the situation. I really do not know much about the vario=\r\nus sadhanas for achieving specific needs. So I suggested that instead of of=\r\n asking for suggestions of different sadhana from everybody, why does he no=\r\nt just tell the lord in his prayer one day that the effects of his bad karm=\r\nas are getting too much to bear and if the Lord could provide him the succe=\r\nss he is looking for in his life. He retorted and shot back at\n me that he =\r\ndid not spend time and energy in learning these various tantric sadhanas ju=\r\nst to beg before god, he only knows how to demand from god.! I reminded him=\r\n that all this while, he was not having any problems begging for help and s=\r\nuggestion from other group members and yet, he is not willing to beg from g=\r\nod when really god is the one and only who can really do anything the probl=\r\nems he is facing. I do not think even Ravana had that attitude that this pe=\r\nrson did,&nbsp;when he would sit down for his sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Cheers,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bhupendra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: =\r\ntimes new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; MARGIN: 5px 0px 5px 5px; PADDING-LEFT: =\r\n5px; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:=\r\n bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Mon, Nov=\r\nember 15, 2010 11:44:16 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Success with Mantras&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Namaskar,&lt;BR&gt;Ho=\r\nw did Ravana got success with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only wi=\r\nth loss of Ahamkara and purity of mind ?&lt;BR&gt;Where is the liberation without=\r\n shakti, even the slaves were humble, devoted and with complete surrender t=\r\no their masters, what results did they ever get ?&lt;BR&gt;There is a saying in s=\r\nanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dan=\r\nt heen vishrahit vineet saral ho&quot;.

The main purpose of the stick to give complete rest to the=\r\n leg and help it cure fast. If one worries too much about the beauty and te=\r\nchnical details of the stick and ends up putting stress on the leg, the sti=\r\nck does not serve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if you consciously=\r\n spare the leg from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not only walk =\r\nbut also run. Similarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra do not ma=\r\ntter much. Use mantra to focus the mind and cure it of its conditioning (i.=\r\ne. impurity!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n --=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astro=\r\nlogy%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:v=\r\nedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Chan=\r\ndan Sabharwal &lt;chandan.sabharwal@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhen what about tantras which proclaim that unless the 5 elements are &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; not purified first , every puja / ritual is simply abhichara ?&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandan Sabharwal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Ranjan-da,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nic=\r\ne words!

Mr. PVRji has listed some, but wo=\r\nuld be good to develop such list and make them available in one place. I tr=\r\nuly believe that\n would be more useful and powerful than prescribing remedi=\r\nes which may or may not work(with possible high degree of error possibiliti=\r\nes in the charts). Bhakti and meditation always would work!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other gur=\r\nujis are reading this, I would appreciate it if they take the leadership to=\r\n develop such mantras and circulate for the benefit of the members.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very =\r\nmuch!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wi=\r\nth deep regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blan=\r\nk ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant th=\r\ne below mantra at least 108 times everyday with deep belief and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopala Mantram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krish=\r\nna Mah=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82yogin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhak=\r\nt=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82n=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82m Abhayam Kara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82nanda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82na Ya !!&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nranslation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi, you give shelter to your devotees.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, You are the giver of Supreme=\r\n Bliss.
