These paths get =\r\none started in the walk towards the same end point - Self-realization.\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; To be free is to be awakened.\n=C2=A0\nNot exactly. Awakening is just a=\r\n step towards freedom. Freedom comes in the end after walking a path for en=\r\nough time after awakening.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing jnana yo=\r\nga reads books and talks eloquently about how everything is god, but looks =\r\nat different people, objects and experiences with a different attitude. He =\r\nbecomes happy (if not externally, atleast internally) when people praise hi=\r\nm and becomes upset when people criticize him, and so on. An awakened sadha=\r\nka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly contemplate one&#39;s actions, word=\r\ns, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and slowly weeds out conditioning =\r\nthat makes one look at different transient things differently. As his equan=\r\nimity increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As h=\r\ne employs contemplation and self-correction more and more, such episodes wi=\r\nll become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga passionately engages in =\r\ndharmik actions for the benefit of others. He gets elated and feels proud w=\r\nhen good results come and becomes upset when bad results come. An awakened =\r\nsadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have detachment to results. When so=\r\nmething happens which makes him elated, proud, ashamed or upset, he will no=\r\nt think much about it, take it as god&#39;s prasad and think about what is the =\r\nright action for him right now. As his detachment increases, still there wi=\r\nll be episodes of getting carried away. As one becomes more and more detach=\r\ned (to results of actions), such episodes will become less and less frequen=\r\nt and one will become liberated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka pr=\r\nacticing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana e=\r\ntc. His psychic life force may even arise and ascend. He may have various e=\r\nxperiences and may feel proud or become attached to them. An awakened sadha=\r\nka practicing raja yoga will not not lose self-control in the face of anyth=\r\ning and will keep the focus on samadhi. He will not be distracted by anythi=\r\nng that comes on the way and keep perfecting concentration and self-control=\r\n so that samadhi (deep concentration on the unconditioned Self) comes. In t=\r\nhe beginning, one may be in samadhi state now and then. As practice is perf=\r\nected, one can be in it all the time and become liberated.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawke=\r\nned sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devoted to god and worships him/her a=\r\ns much as one can, but will project his ego, conditioning and desires onto =\r\nhis worship and hence onto the god he worships. For example, he may think &quot;=\r\nI worship the highest god while that person worships a lower god. I am bett=\r\ner&quot; or &quot;I am worshipping god everyday. I will get so and so result&quot; or &quot;I w=\r\norship god more than that person. I am better&quot;. An awkened sadhaka practici=\r\nng bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride etc. Worship becomes not about=\r\n him but about god! He worships god and marvels at the power that holds thi=\r\ns cosmos together - the power that runs things infinitismally smaller than =\r\na boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy. He will look at himself as a f=\r\nully insignificant particle in front a supreme power. His desires, likes, d=\r\nislikes, conditioning and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front =\r\nof contemplating about that supreme power. Even as that\n devotional spirit =\r\nincreases, there will be episodes when one becomes self-centered in one&#39;s w=\r\norship. But with practice, one loses oneself completely and surrenders comp=\r\nletely to the supreme power and become liberated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nIn each=\r\n path, one may walk the path without making any significant progress for a =\r\nlong time. As one starts to imbibe the inherent qualities of the path, some=\r\n internal transformation will kick in. Yet, the force of prior conditioning=\r\n, coming from many lives, is too strong to overcome. One keeps walking..\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;_______________________=\r\n_________\n&gt; From: Prasad Pavitram &lt;vimal992000@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, August =\r\n24, 2013 10:04 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: which path to choose?-a =\r\ndialog\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Narasimha=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I agree with your explanation of all four=\r\n different types of yoga and also bhakti yoga being the safest of all kinds=\r\n. Dont you think all these yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare th=\r\ne mind for awakening?? The purpose behind all this should be to free onesel=\r\nf from karmic bindings and be free of the =C2=A0bondage. That has to be the=\r\n core purpose of any type of yoga. To be free is to be awakened.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;No matter what path you follow ultimately there should be a perception whe=\r\nre one sees the thought for what it is and there is a cleansing of the acti=\r\non. And there will be no karma when you are NOT bound to the action. Now do=\r\nes these four types of yogas prepare one for this perception or at least cr=\r\neate more probability or mental states where such a thing is possible. I am=\r\n not sure.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your movie analogy is brilliant because currently lif=\r\ne is a movie which we take for real.

I am not sure if it is=\r\n a matter of time or practice. It is an error in perception where we identi=\r\nfy with our thoughts and act out. Does these yogas help see this and come o=\r\nut of this error?? Can all karma be ended in an instant with the help of a =\r\nperception and how that can be brought about...are I think are the most fun=\r\ndamental questions.

It is very much\n&gt;&gt; possible and in f=\r\nact is a measure of self realized people.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Indeed, one can carve on=\r\ne&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutuall=\r\ny exclusive.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga=\r\n&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&quot;Each soul is potential=\r\nly divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity\n within by controlling\n na=\r\nture: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic c=\r\nontrol, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophiza=\r\ntion and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga em=\r\nphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devoti=\r\non and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and tr=\r\ny to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control a=\r\nnd surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qua=\r\nlities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Final=\r\nly, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these q=\r\nualities fully blossomed.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsams=\r\na, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raj=\r\na yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlli=\r\nng body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend re=\r\nquires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air,=\r\n water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yo=\r\nga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explici=\r\ntly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts =\r\nIMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He ta=\r\nught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling int=\r\no the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/=\r\nhonest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am=\r\n Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion a=\r\nnyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces dua=\r\nlity in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a mo=\r\nvie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scary =\r\nscene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely a=\r\nnd earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant =\r\ncontemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump=\r\n to the end.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Ka=\r\nrma yoga are the most suitable and safest.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimh=\r\na\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org \n&gt;--------\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;=\r\njvishnu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Now differen=\r\nt type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yog=\r\na- lagna and its trines\n&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and it=\r\ns trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha =\r\nayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are =\r\nlisted in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of =\r\nthem.

For example, he may think &quot;I worship t=\r\nhe highest god while that person worships a lower god. I am better&quot; or &quot;I a=\r\nm worshipping god everyday. I will get so and so result&quot; or &quot;I worship god =\r\nmore than that person. I am better&quot;. An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti y=\r\noga has little expectation, pride etc. Worship becomes not about him but ab=\r\nout god! He worships god and marvels at the power that holds this cosmos to=\r\ngether - the power that runs things infinitismally smaller than a boson and=\r\n infinitely larger than a galaxy. He will look at himself as a fully insign=\r\nificant particle in\n front a supreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, c=\r\nonditioning and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front of contemp=\r\nlating about that supreme power. Even as that devotional spirit increases, =\r\nthere will be episodes when one becomes self-centered in one&#39;s worship. But=\r\n with practice, one loses oneself completely and surrenders completely to t=\r\nhe supreme power and become liberated in the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In each path=\r\n, one may walk the path without making any significant progress for a long =\r\ntime. As one starts to imbibe the inherent qualities of the path, some inte=\r\nrnal transformation will kick in. Yet, the force of prior conditioning, com=\r\ning from many lives, is too strong to overcome.

It is very much&lt;br&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self =\r\nrealized people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by comb=\r\nining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes =\r\na comment on the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. Th=\r\ne goal is to manifest this divinity\n within by controlling\n nature: externa=\r\nl and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or ph=\r\nilosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;He=\r\nre are my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization a=\r\nnd wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasiz=\r\nes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and=\r\n surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to d=\r\nevelop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and sur=\r\nrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities=\r\n develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a =\r\nrealized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qualiti=\r\nes fully blossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa,=\r\n nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja =\r\nyoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlling=\r\n body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requ=\r\nires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, w=\r\nater and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga=\r\n can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitl=\r\ny taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts IM=\r\nHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taug=\r\nht it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling i=\r\nnto the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincer=\r\ne/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I =\r\nam Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion=\r\n anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces d=\r\nuality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a =\r\nmovie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scar=\r\ny scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely=\r\n and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constan=\r\nt contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional ju=\r\nmp to the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga =\r\nand Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In sohamsa@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n Dear Ms. Maja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now different typ=\r\ne of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana =\r\n- Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -=\r\n\n 10th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava =\r\nand its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its =\r\ntrines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita,=\r\n you can check it, I assure&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
