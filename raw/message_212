He was a yogi who lived his life freely \nand shunned publicity. Even people close to him did not know about his \nabilities and very few knew what he was capable of. He gave a lot of \nfreewheeling talks to Robert Svoboda on many aspects of spirituality and \nmade the latter take down notes. He asked him to publish them after he left \nthe body. Thus, the books were published after Vimalananda left the world. \nHe did not want any attention while living.\n\nIn my humble opinion, these books are a divinely inspired work and \nVimalananda was someone who experienced the highest states of consciousness. \nHe must be a reborn rishi. However, I must warn you that these books may \nshock some of you and put you off.\n\nMost religious practices maintain some level of external purity. Even though \nwe say that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;, we treat different objects differently and \nconsider some objects as &quot;pure&quot; and some as &quot;impure&quot;.\n\nIn aghora, the faith in the internal purity of everything is so high that \nexternal purity is de-emphasized and seemingly gross and disgusting things \nare practiced, just so that one overcomes aversion and attraction for things \nand sees all as one (Brahman). The path of aghora is not for everyone. A \nvery high level of internal purity is required for success in it. Without \nit, one should not attempt it, because one is guaranteed to fall.\n\nThere is no doubt that these are fantastic books that are directly inspired \nby Mother Smashaana Taaraa. I recommend them to every spiritual seeker who \nis curious about tantric practices, with the cautionary word  that you \nshould be prepared to be shocked.\n\nHere are the links in Amazon:\n\n(1) &quot;Aghora, At the Left Hand of God&quot; by Robert E Svoboda\nhttp://www.amazon.com/AGHORA-Left-Hand-God-Aghora/dp/0914732218\n\n(2) &quot;Aghora II: Kundalini&quot; by Robert E Svoboda\nhttp://www.amazon.com/AGHORA-II-Kundalini-Aghora/dp/0914732315\n\n(3) &quot;Aghora III: The Law of Karma&quot; by Robert E Svoboda\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Aghora-III-Karma-Robert-Svoboda/dp/0914732374\n\nThe first book is awe-inspiring and tends to catch the imagination with its \nmagical tales. It is a popular book. The second book is even more insightful \nand full of genuine knowledge. There is a lot of nonsense on Kundalini out \nthere and this is the most genuine book. The third book is the least popular \nof the series, but perhaps the best. Overall, these books have a lot of deep \nknowledge in coded form, provided one overcomes the initial shock and gets a \nsense of what aghora is all about.\n\nVimalananda had a darshan of Smashaana Taaraa when he was 20 or 21 and kept \nseeing Her almost every night. He basically learnt about everything from Her \ndirectly.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kumar_gh_2000&quot; &lt;kumar_gh_2000@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, March 02, 2008 10:43 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] On Akbar (Re: Boycott &#39;Jodhaa Akbar&#39; | Participate \nin awareness drive)\n\n\n&gt; Narasimhaji,\n&gt; Thanks for informative post.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaskaram anna,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I saw this movie and I cannot help responding.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is true that Hindus and sanatana dharma suffered badly at the\n&gt; hands of Muslim invaders (and other invaders), but it is wrong to\n&gt; take out that anger on Akbar. Some people cannot see beyond a man&#39;s\n&gt; name and religion and hence cannot recognize when a great celestial\n&gt; being is born in a different religion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in the &quot;Aghora&quot; series\n&gt; books, is somebody who achieved the highest states of consciousness.\n&gt; He received a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara.\n&gt; Accordinging to him, Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of\n&gt; Samyukta and Rajput King Prithviraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he\n&gt; repelled so many Muslim invaders at the border of India. When Muslims\n&gt; finally conquered India, he was reborn as one of them and put breaks\n&gt; on their aggression and changed their ways.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In that age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed\n&gt; temples, libraries and other relics of native religion and culture.\n&gt; They beheaded Hindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu women\n&gt; and they beheaded defeated kings. They just tried to wipe out the\n&gt; native religion and culture and replace with theirs. Akbar slowed\n&gt; down the barbarism and aggression and promoted tolerance and\n&gt; integration. He stopped the forced conversions, rapes and beheadings\n&gt; of Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples and libraries. He\n&gt; talked about respecting other religions while following one&#39;s own\n&gt; religion. He even took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished\n&gt; a special tax on Hindus based on religion. He was a man of great\n&gt; character, conviction and principles and was utterly fearless. He had\n&gt; affinity for Rajputs and was even born in a Rajput family and spent\n&gt; early years there. He displayed the samskaras and instincts of a\n&gt; refined and cultured Rajput more than those a of Mughal king - he was\n&gt; so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Humayun and step-brother\n&gt; Adham.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morning and then participate\n&gt; in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to our homam) and\n&gt; then do a namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unheard of\n&gt; from any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!).\n&gt; Towards the end of his life, he even started his own religion, which\n&gt; was based on his realization and is quite noble. He was a spiritually\n&gt; elevated soul. Irrespective of the religion one follows, one deserves\n&gt; our respect and admiration if one embodies the spirit of sanatana\n&gt; dharma in one&#39;s thoughts and actions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Akbar was a true hero - a being who came down from a higher loka to\n&gt; fulfil a certain mission with the blessings of rishis. His\n&gt; contribution to the safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be\n&gt; judged from what harm his fellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana\n&gt; dharma. His contribution is to be judged from what *more* harm to\n&gt; sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not come, I have no\n&gt; doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered much much more than it\n&gt; did. That was not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent\n&gt; somebody to alter the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate\n&gt; that those who see the goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji\n&gt; cannot see the goodness of Akbar simply because he was a Muslim.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is unfortunate that some Hindus are equating Akbar with the\n&gt; other cruel and barbaric Muslim kings. Who should be (was) a friend\n&gt; of Hindus is being portrayed as an enemy and being shot down.\n&gt; Instead, we should promote his story and inspire more people to be\n&gt; like him. He was a great inspirational figure then and should be now\n&gt; too.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The epic movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is a very good movie about one of the\n&gt; greatest and most dharmik emperors of India. The director and actor\n&gt; did justice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad\n&gt; about the mud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in.\n&gt; Please do not assassinate the character of Akbar.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want, please make movies of the same caliber and cinematic\n&gt; excellence on great Hindu heroes such as Chatrapati Shivaji,\n&gt; Prithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka, Salivahana,\n&gt; Ashoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya,\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there\n&gt; is no need to denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; These are my 2 cents on the fire over Jodha Akbar.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Namaskar\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   This is an awareness drive to awake people to boycott\n&gt; movie &#39;Jodhaa Akbar&#39;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   The movie Jodhaa Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt by\n&gt; a mischievous producer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick\n&gt; bucks by denigrating and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people.
