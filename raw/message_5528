They have done a bunch of research=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; comparing and contrasting the Tolkappiyam & Paniniyam grammar. I do\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nnot know anything about this, but it is certainly an interesting area\n&gt;&gt; of=\r\n study.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dedicated to the Adi sha~gkara ... with is comment on vyAka=\r\nrNa\n&gt;&gt; &gt; his &quot;ai giri...&quot; cannot be understand if you don&#39;t know what &quot;ai&quot; =\r\nis\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Firstly, on this tangent -- to be best of my knowledge, the\n&gt;&gt; mah=\r\nishAsura-mardini stotram is not a composition of Adi shankara. I do\n&gt;&gt; not =\r\nsee it in the Vani Vilas edition of his woks. It is possible that\n&gt;&gt; the co=\r\nmposer was someone named Ramakrishna Kavi.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Secondly, on point. In my =\r\nopinion, Adi shankara made no comment\n&gt;&gt; towards you, or towards any vaiyAk=\r\naraNa regarding vyAkaraNa. A little\n&gt;&gt; bit of logic shows a lot of myth sur=\r\nrounding his moha-mudgara-stotra\n&gt;&gt; (later rebranded as bhaja-govinda). The=\r\n rumour-mill account, which is\n&gt;&gt; taken as the absolute truth says that Adi=\r\n shankara saw an old man\n&gt;&gt; trying to start learning grammar by memorizing =\r\nthe dhAtu-pAtha, and\n&gt;&gt; out of pity, he instructed him by spontaneously com=\r\nposing 12 verses.\n&gt;&gt; The remaining verses are said to be later additions.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (a) It is difficult to justify the composition of the 2nd verse\n&gt;&gt; (mu=\r\nuDha jahiihi) and especially difficult to justify the composition\n&gt;&gt; of the=\r\n 3rd verse (nArii-stana) as an upadesha to an old man. If we\n&gt;&gt; assume that=\r\n aspects of the traditional account are true, it is much\n&gt;&gt; more likely tha=\r\nt he recited these verses to his own sannyAsii students\n&gt;&gt; to cultivate vai=\r\nrAgya in them. Assuming that you are a non-sannyAsii,\n&gt;&gt; there&#39;s no reason =\r\nto get riled up about advice that is not primarily\n&gt;&gt; directed at you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; (b) Adi shankara is said to have composed the first 12 stanzas,\n&gt;&gt; follow=\r\ning which, many of his students composed single verses that have\n&gt;&gt; been no=\r\nw been compiled together. It is pretty unlikely that Adi\n&gt;&gt; shankara would =\r\nhave had his disciples (young and old) gang up on an\n&gt;&gt; old man. It also se=\r\nems unlikely that his students would have added\n&gt;&gt; onto a work that was com=\r\nposed for someone else&#39;s benefit. In a\n&gt;&gt; satsanga of rishis, everyone wait=\r\ns for the main rishi to speak. On the\n&gt;&gt; other hand, assume that this advic=\r\ne was composed and imparted to his\n&gt;&gt; own students. It is more likely that =\r\nhis students might add onto this\n&gt;&gt; kind of work. Again, there is no reason=\r\n for you to get riled up about\n&gt;&gt; advice that is not primarily directed at =\r\nyou.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (c) In the best case, the first verse (bhaja govindam) merely pr=\r\novides\n&gt;&gt; the context. At worst, it is a later addition. The moha-mudgara\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; consists of verses 1-12. Let us take the first verse as a\n&gt;&gt; mangala-shlo=\r\nka, rather than excluding it altogether. This stotram is a\n&gt;&gt; work of conte=\r\nmplation. Though Adi shankara is a master bhakta, this\n&gt;&gt; work is not a goo=\r\nd example of bhakti. The older name of the stotram\n&gt;&gt; (moha mudgara =3D ham=\r\nmering delusion), is much more reflective of the\n&gt;&gt; work that the popular n=\r\name (bhaja govindam). Across his works, Adi\n&gt;&gt; shankara is clear about peop=\r\nle needing different solutions at\n&gt;&gt; different points in their spiritual li=\r\nfe. First, they need karma +\n&gt;&gt; upAsana, and only later should they pursue =\r\nviveka. Thus, the advice in\n&gt;&gt; his stotra is intended primarily for a diffe=\r\nrent crowd. It is unlikely\n&gt;&gt; that he would have given this advice to some =\r\nrandom stranger. There is\n&gt;&gt; no reason for you to get riled up about advice=\r\n that is not primarily\n&gt;&gt; directed at you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (d) Now, let us assume tha=\r\nt the rumour-mill account is true. As you\n&gt;&gt; have noted, Adi shankara&#39;s com=\r\npositions are composed in sanskrit.\n&gt;&gt; Further, it is clear that he is extr=\r\nemely well-versed in grammar. So,\n&gt;&gt; any conclusion that he is anti-grammar=\r\n seems strange, and is wrong.\n&gt;&gt; There is no reason to get riled up over th=\r\nis.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (e) His sampradAya safeguards grammar. Just as one example, vyAka=\r\nraNa\n&gt;&gt; is a regular topic of discourse in the yearly vAkyArtha-sabhA at\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n sringeri. It is the same institution that is publishing, and\n&gt;&gt; re-publish=\r\ning various grammatical works. His own disciples, who adorn\n&gt;&gt; this peeTha,=\r\n are great scholars of vyAkaraNa. Adi shankara, and his\n&gt;&gt; sampradAya are c=\r\nlearly not anti-grammar. In fact, they are clearly\n&gt;&gt; pro-grammar. So, ther=\r\ne is nothing to get riled up about.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, let us take the &quot;bhaja govin=\r\ndam&quot; verse at face value. I still\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t see the problem --\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That th=\r\nere is no point in studying the dhAtu-pATha on the death-bed.\n&gt;&gt; This makes=\r\n sense. &quot;dvAdasha-varShaiH shruuyate vyAkaraNam&quot;. Grammar is\n&gt;&gt; learned in =\r\n12 years. What point is there in starting the study on the\n&gt;&gt; death-bed? Th=\r\nis doesn&#39;t mean that vyAkaraNam shouldn&#39;t be studied at\n&gt;&gt; all. All it mean=\r\ns is that desha-kAla-pAtra should be taken into\n&gt;&gt; account. And, if you wan=\r\nt to take things literally, Adi shankara said\n&gt;&gt; nothing about grammar in g=\r\neneral. In this verse, all he talked about\n&gt;&gt; was the dhAtu-pATha in partic=\r\nular.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; People who truly study the dhAtu pATha these days are rare, and=\r\n I\n&gt;&gt; would expect a disproportionate number of them to consider Adi\n&gt;&gt; sha=\r\nnkara as their guru.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =EF=BF=BD =EF=BF=BDajit\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Sh=\r\naantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
