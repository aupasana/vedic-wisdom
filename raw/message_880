Some of the rishis also reco=\r\nmmended \nworshipping the\n&gt; idols =96 of these forms of the devata =96 in sa=\r\ncred environment before\n&gt; commencing the japa of the mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bija=\r\n represents the origin of the mantra. It may be understood \nas a\n&gt; group of=\r\n those syllables that contain, in compact coded form, the \ngist\n&gt; (tatva) o=\r\nf the mantra and thereby imply the latent existence of \nthe specific\n&gt; powe=\r\nr of shabda  in that mantra. The japa of the bija generates \nthe &#39;energy&#39;\n&gt;=\r\n essential for initiating the activation of the shakti (sonic \npower) of th=\r\ne\n&gt; associated mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; *Possibilities of Scientific Studies:*\n&gt; \n&gt; It =\r\nmay not be feasible to verify or analyze the role of the subtle\n&gt; component=\r\ns like &#39;devata&#39; in the structure of a mantra by \nscientific methods.\n&gt; Neve=\r\nrtheless, scientific investigations =96 along the lines of that \nin the\n&gt; f=\r\nield of musical ragas =96 could begin with the other components, \nnamely th=\r\ne\n&gt; bija and tatva and the chanda, as these directly pertain \nrespectively =\r\nto the\n&gt; symbolic patterns, sonic configurations and phonological \ncharacte=\r\nristics.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is a well known scientific principle that continuous movem=\r\nent \nof any kind\n&gt; ultimately results in a circular motion. The orbits and =\r\nshapes of \nall the\n&gt; planets in the universe are almost round (or elliptica=\r\nl closed \ncontours) due\n&gt; to this simple principle. It is by the same princ=\r\niple that \ncontinuous\n&gt; (non-stop) japa of a mantra creates a circular doma=\r\nin. The &#39;Taila \nDharavat\n&gt; Sutra&#39; describes that =96 &#39;If oil is dropped at =\r\nconstant speed for \nsome time\n&gt; continuously, its flow forms a steady strea=\r\nm. Similarly, the \nrepeated\n&gt; rhythmic enunciation of the same word (or a s=\r\ntring of words) forms \na\n&gt; continuous (without an end or boundary) segment =\r\nof words&#39;. A \npopular story\n&gt; in the Ramayana also gives a simple supportiv=\r\ne example here. It \ndescribes\n&gt; that rishis Valmiki&#39;s non-stop chanting of =\r\nthe word mara mara... \nbestowed\n&gt; upon him the sanctifying effect of the ja=\r\npa of the name of the \nGod =96=96 &quot;rama\n&gt; rama&quot;....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ....
