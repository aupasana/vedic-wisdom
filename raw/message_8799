Thought of sharing it here.\n\n=C2=A0\nREMINISCENCES OF SWAMI VIVE=\r\nKANANDA \n\nBEFORE I knew Swamiji personally, I had heard much about\nhis grea=\r\ntness from persons who had moved and lived with him\non the closest terms of=\r\n intimacy. Therefore, when it was\nannounced in the year 1893 that he had go=\r\nne over to America\nto represent our religion at the Chicago Parliament of\nR=\r\neligions, I started following his movements with the closest\nattention and =\r\nthe greatest interest. I was anxiously waiting to\nsee if his achievements w=\r\nould not confirm me in my very high\nestimate of him. I need not tell you, p=\r\neople of Madras, that\nevery bit of my expectation was much more than satisf=\r\nied. But\ntill I saw him with my own eyes, the perfect satisfaction of\nknowi=\r\nng the man could not come. Till then I could not be\nquite free from the sec=\r\nret misgivings that I might be after all\nlabouring under a delusion. So you=\r\n see, gentlemen, that I did\nnot meet Swamiji as one in any way biased again=\r\nst him. The\nthrobbing interest and convincingness which attach to the\nglowi=\r\nng description of the conquest of opponents of a great\nman of overmastering=\r\n personality does not belong to my\nsubject. I may say, I was already a grea=\r\nt admirer of his. But I\nmust say at the same time that it was not too late =\r\nin the day to\nretrace my steps and give Swamiji up as one unworthy of my\nlo=\r\nve and esteem if facts were found to give the lie. Perhaps,\nthe shock which=\r\n such a disclosure would have given to my\nmind would be too painful; perhap=\r\ns it would have cost a great\ndrenching of the heart. But I can assure you t=\r\nhat the instinct of\nmoral self-preservation was yet stronger than my admira=\r\ntion\nof Swamiji, and cost how much it would, the heart could not\nlong cling=\r\n round him if reason and moral sense condemned\nhim with one voice.\nAnd what=\r\n was the nature of the greatness I was expecting to\nsee in Swamiji? It was =\r\nnot the dashing and daring spirit\ndisplayed by a heroic warrior on the batt=\r\nlefield, nor the fine ethereal vision and ecstasy of the poet, nor the vast=\r\n erudition\nof a scholar, nor the dazzling intellectual flourish of the mast=\r\ner\ncontroversialist, nor the quick penetration and the wide\ncomprehension o=\r\nf the philosopher, nor the weeping heart of a true\nlover of humanity. It wa=\r\ns not that I had not had enough\ntestimony as to these qualities of head and=\r\n heart being\nabundantly present in him, but because my conception of religi=\r\non\nwas not wide enough to include all these under it. His\nmarvellous achiev=\r\nements in the West were bringing us\noverwhelming evidences of his wonderful=\r\n intellectual powers. But\neither from some constitutional necessity or my e=\r\nxtreme\npoverty in that direction I was always attributing the brightness of=\r\n\nhis intellect to his highly elevated religious life, and it was this\nrelig=\r\nious life that I expected to see in him. My idea of religion\nwas then confi=\r\nned to purity and meditation. Sitting at the feet\nof the holy and good disc=\r\niples of Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna,\nI had learnt that these two were the in=\r\ndispensable conditions\nof acquiring spirituality and are the sure marks by =\r\nwhich a\nreligious man can always be known. My debt of gratitude to\nthe bles=\r\nsed Swamis, at whose feet I had learnt these great\nlessons, is too large to=\r\n be repaid. Personal contact with\nSwamiji instead of diminishing the value =\r\nof purity and\nmeditation in my eyes, has only enhanced it. At the same time=\r\n it has\nheightened and intensified my conception of religion by\nadding new =\r\nelements to it. Till I came in personal contact with\nSwamiji my temperament=\r\n had led me to expect to see in him a\nman of intense purity and meditative =\r\ninwardness. And I need\nnot tell you that I was not disappointed. The First =\r\nsight of\nSwamiji, the peculiar brightness of his face, his lustrous yet\nsof=\r\nt and sweet eyes, at once carried into my heart an\noverwhelming sense of sa=\r\ntisfaction that I had come to a man that\nlike of whom I had never seen befo=\r\nre. Then when he began to\ntalk to us making personal inquiries and giving u=\r\ns words of\nhope and encouragement with the cordiality of one truly\ninterest=\r\ned in our welfare, we felt that our hearts were being\ndrawn closer to him. =\r\nTo us who were very insignificant\ncompared with his friends and visitors wh=\r\no were standing or sitting ground him in large numbers, this kindness on hi=\r\ns part filed us\nwith great joy and gratitude. Then the wonderfully free and=\r\n\nfrank way in which he was talking to his visitors revealed to us\na heart t=\r\nhat knew nothing of guile or fear nor cared a bit for\nsocial conventionalit=\r\ny. The transparently clear and pointed\nwords that were shooting out of his =\r\nlips like meteors gave us a\npeep into the keen penetration of his intellect=\r\n and the breadth\nand profundity of his mental vision. We felt ourselves in =\r\nthe\npresence of an overpowering personality whose immensity it\nwas not poss=\r\nible for us to gauge, but which was drawing us to\nitself as by a tie of clo=\r\nse personal relationship. There arose on\nthe first day of our meeting an ex=\r\ncellent opportunity of\nknowing something of his real humility. I say real h=\r\numility because\nit had nothing to do with that sense of self-abasement with=\r\n its\nexternal manifestation of facial contortions which so often\npass for h=\r\numility. It was self-effacement and was not therefore\nwithout the charming =\r\ndignity of self-respect. A question from\none of the visitors as to why Swam=\r\niji&#39;s lecture on his Master\ndelivered in America had not seen the light of =\r\nday, brought\nthe bold confession: &quot;I did not allow it to be published as I =\r\nhad\ndone injustice to my Master. My Master never condemned\nanything or anyb=\r\nody. But while I was speaking of him I\ncriticized the people of America for=\r\n their dollar-worshipping\nspirit. That day I learnt the lesson that I am no=\r\nt yet fit to talk of\nhim.&quot; These words were really startling to us for more=\r\n than\none reason. Here was a man who was being idolized, nay\nactually worsh=\r\nipped by so many, and this man in their very\npresence confessing his inabil=\r\nity to represent his guru! &quot;What\nan unpretentious man is before us&quot;, said w=\r\ne to ourselves.\n&quot;What a wonderful man must his guru have been to occupy\nsuc=\r\nh a high place in the heart of this great man!&quot;\nThis, in short, was my impr=\r\nession of Swamiji on the first day\nof our meeting. As days went and I knew =\r\nmore and more of\nhim, it gained greater and greater strength. I only saw on=\r\n the\nfirst day the few sparks that shot forth into our range of vision\nfrom=\r\n a soul aglow with the fire of divine love and wisdom. It\nwas yet in store =\r\nfor me to see many more sparks from the same source that drew me near to it=\r\n, gave me a closer view of it, and\nenabled even my icy cold heart to posses=\r\ns a little of its warmth.\nI have already told you that I had always thought=\r\n that\nSwamiji&#39;s gigantic intellect was the result of his highly elevated li=\r\nfe of\npurity. Greater acquaintance with him was making my belief\nstronger t=\r\nill one day his own words made it a settled conviction\nwith me. It was a me=\r\nmorable evening in my life, which shall\nnever be effaced from my mind, when=\r\n a question from one of\nhis would-be disciples brought forth an exhaustive =\r\nand stirring\ndiscourse on brahmacharya or sexual purity. In the course of\nt=\r\nhe discourse he was explaining to us the incalculable value of\npurity in re=\r\nligious life, how to practise it, how religious\nfervour, suddenly aroused b=\r\ny working on the emotional side of\nman to the utter neglect of the moral an=\r\nd intellectual, is apt to\nproduce great reaction on the sexual desires and =\r\nso forth.\nThen at last when he came to talk of the infinite powers of\nstric=\r\nt sexual purity and how the animal propensity is converted\ninto spiritual m=\r\night, he warmed up to such a high pitch of\nearnestness that it seemed as if=\r\n the transparent soul within was\nflowing out in torrents through his lips, =\r\nbathing its hearers\nwith its heavenly waters. The picture that was being dr=\r\nawn by\nhis words in our minds saw its own prototype in the figure that\nstoo=\r\nd before us. And I leave it to you, gentlemen, to imagine\nthe effect of the=\r\nse concluding words of the discourse upon us:\n&quot;My Master had told me that i=\r\nf I could attain to the perfect\nstate of purity I had just described. I wil=\r\nl have spiritual insight.\nI ventured to stand before the world only when I =\r\nhad been\nsatisfied that I had attained to it. I earnestly appeal to you, my=\r\n\nboys, to keep to this ideal with adamantine firmness. Pray, do\nnot be unwo=\r\nrthy of me. &quot;On another occasion too I heard him\nspeak of his spiritual ins=\r\night which could at once see the end of\na thing hidden in the womb of futur=\r\nity, of which the beginning\nis only made. I must not be understood to mean =\r\nthat\nintellectual brightness is always a sign of spirituality. A man may ha=\r\nve\na great intellect without being in the least spiritual. On the\nother han=\r\nd a man may be spiritual without having his mind\nstored with informations, =\r\nvast and varied, or without the power to put his words in a logical form. B=\r\nut truth will always\nbe his and will flash upon his mind of itself. My pres=\r\nent idea of\nSwamiji&#39;s intellect has undergone some modification from\nwhat i=\r\nt was before I knew him personally. He combined in him\nspiritual insight wi=\r\nth an intellect of the highest order. Truth\ncame to him by intuition. But h=\r\ne would press his intellect into\nits service by giving it a logical form an=\r\nd making it convincing\nby a rich supply of facts and analogies stored in hi=\r\ns brain.\nAnd the purity which gave Swamiji this spiritual insight was\nsomet=\r\nhing extraordinary. It was not the fragile purity that can\nprotect itself b=\r\ny keeping itself away from all corrupting\ninfluences. It had long outgrown =\r\nthe need of the citadel of\nisolation. But that was not all. It became aggre=\r\nssive, taking a sort\nof delight in encountering its enemies on their own gr=\r\nounds\nand winning them over to its side. In other words, it could not\nonly =\r\nkeep itself untouched amidst corrupting influences, but\ncould turn them int=\r\no positive powers for good. Gentlemen, I\ncannot go into personal details on=\r\n a subject like this. But my\nknowledge of Swamiji&#39;s marvellous achievements=\r\n in this\ndirection compels me to lay at his feet my deepest reverence;\nthis=\r\n one element of perfection in Swamiji would have been\nquite enough to compe=\r\nl me to give him the highest place in my\nheart.\n...There was one more promi=\r\nnent feature of Swamiji&#39;s life\nwhich speaks to me volumes about his renunci=\r\nation. I mean\nhis dealing with rich men. Many of you are aware that among\nh=\r\nis foreign disciples some are very wealthy and a few of them\ncame out to In=\r\ndia to help Swamiji in his work. The treatment\nwhich he used to give them d=\r\nid not in the least differ from that\ngiven to his most insignificant Indian=\r\n disciples. He was kind\nand loving by nature to all, but his love did not m=\r\nake him blind\nto their flaws and defects which needed mending.\nGentle speec=\r\nh would not always serve the purpose, and\nSwamiji would have to be at times=\r\n hard. And in this\napparently unpleasant treatment, his wealthy disciples w=\r\nould have\nexactly the same fate as his begging sannyasins. At times, this\nw=\r\nould be too much for persons born and brought up in the lap of luxury and a=\r\nccustomed to hear words of praise and flattery\nFrom a worldly point of view=\r\n, Swamiji paid dear for it. But did\nhe ever regret? Far from it. The perfec=\r\nt unconcern which he\nshowed whether rich people would stick to him or give =\r\nhim up\nis truly unprecedented.\n...Of the few pregnant proverbs and epigramm=\r\natical\nexpressions which Swamiji would never be tired of repeating,\none was=\r\n &quot;  =E2=80=94 The giver of the head is alone the\nleader&quot;, that is, he atone=\r\n can be a leader who is ready to die for\nothers. And Swamiji&#39;s own life det=\r\nermines his place among his\nfellow beings. I have already told you that Swa=\r\nmiji was not\nonly kind and soft but was very hard also at times. He could\nn=\r\not only lay down his life for others, but could take arms\nagainst others if=\r\n needed. Whatever he would think or feel he\nwould do so with wonderful vehe=\r\nmence and intensity. And\nthis whole-souledness was another marked feature o=\r\nf\nSwamiji&#39;s life. One evening in the course of a talk that Swamiji was\ngivi=\r\nng to one of his disciples, opening his eyes to the fact that\nthe disciple&#39;=\r\ns inability to manage the servants of the Math\n(which was one of his duties=\r\n then) and make them do their\nrespective duties was a weakness and did not =\r\nproceed from\nlove, he said, &quot;Don&#39;t think that your heart is full of love,\nb=\r\necause you cannot give them a little scolding now and then.\nCan you give yo=\r\nur life for them? I know, you can&#39;t, because\nyou do not love them. This min=\r\nute I can die for them; but also\nI can hang them on this tree this minute i=\r\nf need be. Can you do\nthat? No, my boy, namby-pamby is not love. Remember t=\r\nhe\nwords of the poet,  =E2=80=94&#39;Harder than the thunderbolt and softer tha=\r\nn the flower&#39;, this is the ideal,\nNo, love is not weak sentimentality.&quot;\nI h=\r\nave seen no man who could be so soft as Swamiji. The\ndeath of a gurubhai or=\r\n a disciple would rob him of rest and\nconsolation for days and days togethe=\r\nr. Some time in the year\n1898, it pleased the Lord to take away one of his =\r\ngurubhais.\nThe pang of bereavement was so intense in Swamiji that for\nweek =\r\nhe remained exceedingly heavy and absent-minded\nkeeping as much away from o=\r\nthers as possible. On the evening of the seventh or eighth day he came to t=\r\nhe temple-room of the\nMath, and began to talk to those that were present th=\r\nere, like\na simple child: &quot;I did not come to the temple these days\nbecause =\r\nI was very angry with my Master for having deprived\nme of my dear brother. =\r\nI love them so much because I have\nlived longer and more intimately with th=\r\nem than even with my\nown brothers.... But why should I be angry with my Mas=\r\nter?\nWhy should I expect that all things will be ordained according\nto my w=\r\nishes? And why should I be sad at all? Am I not a\nhero? My Master used to s=\r\nay laying his arm upon my shoulder:\nNaren, you are a hero; the very sight o=\r\nf you inspires me with\ncourage.&#39; Yes, I am a hero. Why should I then give w=\r\nay to\ngrief?&quot;\n...Ask each one of his disciples, American or English,\nBengal=\r\ni or Madrasi, and you will hear the same thing from all\nthat their hearts w=\r\nere won by Swamiji&#39;s wonderful love and\nsympathy. Swamiji&#39;s marvellous inte=\r\nllectual powers, no\ndoubt, evoked the awe of all. But this awe would have k=\r\nept at\na distance all unintellectual people like myself and would have\nprov=\r\ned more a barrier than a help to them to come in direct\ntouch with him and =\r\ndrink from the fountain of his soul. Heaps\nof instances could be cited to s=\r\nhow Swamiji&#39;s wonderful heart.\n...And how can universal love be without the=\r\n ever present\nconsciousness of the closest kinship with the universe, witho=\r\nut\nthe realization that whatever is is mine, nay, whatever is is\nme? And th=\r\nis is brahmajnana (knowledge of Self) as our holy\nbooks describe it. This i=\r\ns the very core of Swamiji&#39;s teaching =E2=80=94\nThe Selfhood of all =E2=80=\r\n=94 the Divinity of man. And this is, I am\nfully convinced, the key to his =\r\nwonderfully versatile nature.\nHe was a lover of all, because he was a jnani=\r\n. And here I must\ntell you that the fatal illusion under which I had long l=\r\naboured\nthat jnana and bhakti are destructive of each other, dispersed\nin t=\r\nhe presence of Swamiji as darkness before the sun. Swamiji\nwas a tremendous=\r\n worker because he was a bhakta and jnani.\nThe tremendous energy that shook=\r\n the whole world and is still\nat work awakening many a slumbering soul to i=\r\nts innate Divinity,\ninstilling life into dead bones, bringing sunshine in t=\r\nhe darkness of despair and love in dry, arid souls =E2=80=93, this\ntremendo=\r\nus energy owes its origin to his realization of brahman in all.\nHere too, I=\r\n must tell you that the fatally-erroneous idea that karma is antagonistic t=\r\no jnana and bhakti is dispelled at once\nby the life of Swamiji.\nI told you =\r\nat the outset that before I met Swamiji I did not,\non account of my limited=\r\n religious views, expect to see in him\nanything of the warrior, the poet, t=\r\nhe philosopher, or the\nphilanthropist. But I found that he was all these an=\r\nd more than\nthese. He was as much a poet as a philosopher; as much a\nsentim=\r\nental visionary as a man of action. And he was all these,\nnot in spite of h=\r\nis religion but on account of it.\nI have learnt that a religion which does =\r\nnot call forth into\nvigorous activity and chasten and elevate the moral,\nin=\r\ntellectual, and aesthetic faculties of man, make him humane and\nself-sacrif=\r\nicing and at the same lime self-absorbed and\nmeditative is an imperfect rel=\r\nigion. But I have also learnt that even\nsuch imperfect religions have their=\r\n great purpose to serve in\nhelping the growth of persons less evolved and t=\r\nhat our\nattitude towards them all should he one of extreme sympathy and\nlov=\r\ne. I have learnt that I should hesitate thrice before I\ncondemn any form of=\r\n religious faith, however repellent it may\nappear to me. For I have seen fo=\r\nrms of worship, generally\ncondemned as superstitious, yield treasurers of i=\r\nnfinite beauty\nand holiness touched by the magic wand of Swamiji. I have\nle=\r\narnt that every individual, however degraded he may appear\nin my eyes, is G=\r\nod involved, and therefore cannot be lost for\never. We should look upon him=\r\n with respect and if possible\ngive him a lift Godward, not by condemning hi=\r\ns perverted\nideal and by cruelly tearing it away from his heart but by gent=\r\nly\nreplacing it by a true one suited to his temperament and\nculture. I have=\r\n learnt that under peculiar circumstances even\nhardness and cruelty become =\r\na virtue, stubborn resistance.\nand excellence, and that activity is as much=\r\n a help to spiritual\ngrowth as contemplative calmness. I have learnt that G=\r\nod can\nbe enjoyed both within ourselves and outside of ourselves;\nwithin ou=\r\nrselves by effacing completely from our consciousness all impression of the=\r\n world of senses and making me\nSpirit touch Spirit. Outside ourselves by se=\r\neing God in\neverything and pouring out our hearts unto His feel in the shap=\r\ne of\nloving service. I have learnt the incalculable value of great\npersonal=\r\nities in the scheme of individual, national, and\nuniversal redemption. I ha=\r\nve also learnt that I have learnt all these\nonly intellectually and am yet =\r\nfar from getting them woven\ninto my nature. And all these I have learnt fro=\r\nm the life of\nSwamiji. One thing more: My conviction that Swamiji&#39;s\nspiritu=\r\nal realization was of the highest order came to me not only\nfrom his intens=\r\ne purity, fearlessness, love of truth, and\nuniversal sympathy, but also fro=\r\nm those subtler personal\nmanifestations described in our shastras. I have s=\r\neen him weep like a\nchild and becoming disconsolate at the name of God. I h=\r\nave\nseen him go into such deep meditation that even the function\nof the lun=\r\ngs stopped. Last of all came his own words to give the\nfinishing touch to m=\r\ny conception of his spiritual greatness....\n(Vedanta Kesari, January-Februa=\r\nry 1923)\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabud=\r\ndhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\r\n--1004636618-1809560096-1351192162=:24432\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:Co=\r\nurier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;Namaste,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; =\r\nfont-family: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-co=\r\nlor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: Courier New,courier,mon=\r\naco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read a nice article on Swami Vivekananda by someone who knew him p=\r\nersonally. Thought of sharing it here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;h2&gt;REMIN=\r\nISCENCES OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDA &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;BEFORE I knew Swamiji persona=\r\nlly, I had heard much about\nhis greatness from persons who had moved and li=\r\nved with him\non the closest terms of intimacy. Therefore, when it was\nannou=\r\nnced in the year 1893 that he had gone over to America\nto represent our rel=\r\nigion at the Chicago Parliament of\nReligions, I started following his movem=\r\nents with the closest\nattention and the greatest interest. I was anxiously =\r\nwaiting to\nsee if his achievements would not confirm me in my very high\nest=\r\nimate of him. I need not tell you, people of Madras, that\nevery bit of my e=\r\nxpectation was much more than satisfied. But\ntill I saw him with my own eye=\r\ns, the perfect satisfaction of\nknowing the man could not come. Till then I =\r\ncould not be\nquite free from the secret misgivings that I might be after al=\r\nl\nlabouring under a delusion. So you see, gentlemen, that I did\nnot meet Sw=\r\namiji as one in any way biased against him. The\nthrobbing interest and conv=\r\nincingness which attach to the\nglowing description of the conquest of oppon=\r\nents of a great\nman of overmastering personality does not belong to my\nsubj=\r\nect. I may say, I was already a great admirer of his. But I\nmust say at the=\r\n same time that it was not too late in the day to\nretrace my steps and give=\r\n Swamiji up as one unworthy of my\nlove and esteem if facts were found to gi=\r\nve the lie. Perhaps,\nthe shock which such a disclosure would have given to =\r\nmy\nmind would be too painful; perhaps it would have cost a great\ndrenching =\r\nof the heart. But I can assure you that the instinct of\nmoral self-preserva=\r\ntion was yet stronger than my admiration\nof Swamiji, and cost how much it w=\r\nould, the heart could not\nlong cling round him if reason and moral sense co=\r\nndemned\nhim with one voice.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;And what was the nature of the grea=\r\ntness I was expecting to\nsee in Swamiji? It was not the dashing and daring =\r\nspirit\ndisplayed by a heroic warrior on the battlefield, nor the fine\n\nethe=\r\nreal vision and ecstasy of the poet, nor the vast erudition\nof a scholar, n=\r\nor the dazzling intellectual flourish of the master\ncontroversialist, nor t=\r\nhe quick penetration and the wide\ncomprehension of the philosopher, nor the=\r\n weeping heart of a true\nlover of humanity. It was not that I had not had e=\r\nnough\ntestimony as to these qualities of head and heart being\nabundantly pr=\r\nesent in him, but because my conception of religion\nwas not wide enough to =\r\ninclude all these under it. His\nmarvellous achievements in the West were br=\r\ninging us\noverwhelming evidences of his wonderful intellectual powers. But\n=\r\neither from some constitutional necessity or my extreme\npoverty in that dir=\r\nection I was always attributing the brightness of\nhis intellect to his high=\r\nly elevated religious life, and it was this\nreligious life that I expected =\r\nto see in him. My idea of religion\nwas then confined to purity and meditati=\r\non. Sitting at the feet\nof the holy and good disciples of Bhagavan Shri Ram=\r\nakrishna,\nI had learnt that these two were the indispensable conditions\nof =\r\nacquiring spirituality and are the sure marks by which a\nreligious man can =\r\nalways be known. My debt of gratitude to\nthe blessed Swamis, at whose feet =\r\nI had learnt these great\nlessons, is too large to be repaid. Personal conta=\r\nct with\nSwamiji instead of diminishing the value of purity and\nmeditation i=\r\nn my eyes, has only enhanced it. At the same time it has\nheightened and int=\r\nensified my conception of religion by\nadding new elements to it. Till I cam=\r\ne in personal contact with\nSwamiji my temperament had led me to expect to s=\r\nee in him a\nman of intense purity and meditative inwardness. And I need\nnot=\r\n tell you that I was not disappointed. The First sight of\nSwamiji, the pecu=\r\nliar brightness of his face, his lustrous yet\nsoft and sweet eyes, at once =\r\ncarried into my heart an\noverwhelming sense of satisfaction that I had come=\r\n to a man that\nlike of whom I had never seen before. Then when he began to\n=\r\ntalk to us making personal inquiries and giving us words of\nhope and encour=\r\nagement with the cordiality of one truly\ninterested in our welfare, we felt=\r\n that our hearts were being\ndrawn closer to him. To us who were very insign=\r\nificant\ncompared with his friends and visitors who were standing or sitting=\r\n\n\nground him in large numbers, this kindness on his part filed us\nwith grea=\r\nt joy and gratitude. Then the wonderfully free and\nfrank way in which he wa=\r\ns talking to his visitors revealed to us\na heart that knew nothing of guile=\r\n or fear nor cared a bit for\nsocial conventionality. The transparently clea=\r\nr and pointed\nwords that were shooting out of his lips like meteors gave us=\r\n a\npeep into the keen penetration of his intellect and the breadth\nand prof=\r\nundity of his mental vision. We felt ourselves in the\npresence of an overpo=\r\nwering personality whose immensity it\nwas not possible for us to gauge, but=\r\n which was drawing us to\nitself as by a tie of close personal relationship.=\r\n There arose on\nthe first day of our meeting an excellent opportunity of\nkn=\r\nowing something of his real humility. I say real humility because\nit had no=\r\nthing to do with that sense of self-abasement with its\nexternal manifestati=\r\non of facial contortions which so often\npass for humility. It was self-effa=\r\ncement and was not therefore\nwithout the charming dignity of self-respect. =\r\nA question from\none of the visitors as to why Swamiji&#39;s lecture on his Mast=\r\ner\ndelivered in America had not seen the light of day, brought\nthe bold con=\r\nfession: &quot;I did not allow it to be published as I had\ndone injustice to my =\r\nMaster. My Master never condemned\nanything or anybody. But while I was spea=\r\nking of him I\ncriticized the people of America for their dollar-worshipping=\r\n\nspirit. That day I learnt the lesson that I am not yet fit to talk of\nhim.=\r\n&quot; These words were really startling to us for more than\none reason. Here wa=\r\ns a man who was being idolized, nay\nactually worshipped by so many, and thi=\r\ns man in their very\npresence confessing his inability to represent his &lt;i&gt;g=\r\nuru&lt;/i&gt;! &quot;What\nan unpretentious man is before us&quot;, said we to ourselves.\n&quot;W=\r\nhat a wonderful man must his &lt;i&gt;guru&lt;/i&gt; have been to occupy\nsuch a high pl=\r\nace in the heart of this great man!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;This, in short, was my imp=\r\nression of Swamiji on the first day\nof our meeting. As days went and I knew=\r\n more and more of\nhim, it gained greater and greater strength. I only saw o=\r\nn the\nfirst day the few sparks that shot forth into our range of vision\nfro=\r\nm a soul aglow with the fire of divine love and wisdom. It\nwas yet in store=\r\n for me to see many more sparks from the same\n\nsource that drew me near to =\r\nit, gave me a closer view of it, and\nenabled even my icy cold heart to poss=\r\ness a little of its warmth.\nI have already told you that I had always thoug=\r\nht that\nSwamiji&#39;s gigantic intellect was the result of his highly elevated =\r\nlife of\npurity. Greater acquaintance with him was making my belief\nstronger=\r\n till one day his own words made it a settled conviction\nwith me. It was a =\r\nmemorable evening in my life, which shall\nnever be effaced from my mind, wh=\r\nen a question from one of\nhis would-be disciples brought forth an exhaustiv=\r\ne and stirring\ndiscourse on &lt;i&gt;brahmacharya&lt;/i&gt; or sexual purity. In the co=\r\nurse of\nthe discourse he was explaining to us the incalculable value of\npur=\r\nity in religious life, how to practise it, how religious\nfervour, suddenly =\r\naroused by working on the emotional side of\nman to the utter neglect of the=\r\n moral and intellectual, is apt to\nproduce great reaction on the sexual des=\r\nires and so forth.\nThen at last when he came to talk of the infinite powers=\r\n of\nstrict sexual purity and how the animal propensity is converted\ninto sp=\r\niritual might, he warmed up to such a high pitch of\nearnestness that it see=\r\nmed as if the transparent soul within was\nflowing out in torrents through h=\r\nis lips, bathing its hearers\nwith its heavenly waters. The picture that was=\r\n being drawn by\nhis words in our minds saw its own prototype in the figure =\r\nthat\nstood before us. And I leave it to you, gentlemen, to imagine\nthe effe=\r\nct of these concluding words of the discourse upon us:\n&quot;My Master had told =\r\nme that if I could attain to the perfect\nstate of purity I had just describ=\r\ned. I will have spiritual insight.\nI ventured to stand before the world onl=\r\ny when I had been\nsatisfied that I had attained to it. I earnestly appeal t=\r\no you, my\nboys, to keep to this ideal with adamantine firmness. Pray, do\nno=\r\nt be unworthy of me. &quot;On another occasion too I heard him\nspeak of his spir=\r\nitual insight which could at once see the end of\na thing hidden in the womb=\r\n of futurity, of which the beginning\nis only made. I must not be understood=\r\n to mean that\nintellectual brightness is always a sign of spirituality. A m=\r\nan may have\na great intellect without being in the least spiritual. On the\n=\r\nother hand a man may be spiritual without having his mind\nstored with infor=\r\nmations, vast and varied, or without the\n\npower to put his words in a logic=\r\nal form. But truth will always\nbe his and will flash upon his mind of itsel=\r\nf. My present idea of\nSwamiji&#39;s intellect has undergone some modification f=\r\nrom\nwhat it was before I knew him personally. He combined in him\nspiritual =\r\ninsight with an intellect of the highest order. Truth\ncame to him by intuit=\r\nion. But he would press his intellect into\nits service by giving it a logic=\r\nal form and making it convincing\nby a rich supply of facts and analogies st=\r\nored in his brain.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;And the purity which gave Swamiji this spiri=\r\ntual insight was\nsomething extraordinary. It was not the fragile purity tha=\r\nt can\nprotect itself by keeping itself away from all corrupting\ninfluences.=\r\n It had long outgrown the need of the citadel of\nisolation. But that was no=\r\nt all. It became aggressive, taking a sort\nof delight in encountering its e=\r\nnemies on their own grounds\nand winning them over to its side. In other wor=\r\nds, it could not\nonly keep itself untouched amidst corrupting influences, b=\r\nut\ncould turn them into positive powers for good. Gentlemen, I\ncannot go in=\r\nto personal details on a subject like this. But my\nknowledge of Swamiji&#39;s m=\r\narvellous achievements in this\ndirection compels me to lay at his feet my d=\r\neepest reverence;\nthis one element of perfection in Swamiji would have been=\r\n\nquite enough to compel me to give him the highest place in my\nheart.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;...There was one more prominent feature of Swamiji&#39;s life\nwhich spea=\r\nks to me volumes about his renunciation. I mean\nhis dealing with rich men. =\r\nMany of you are aware that among\nhis foreign disciples some are very wealth=\r\ny and a few of them\ncame out to India to help Swamiji in his work. The trea=\r\ntment\nwhich he used to give them did not in the least differ from that\ngive=\r\nn to his most insignificant Indian disciples. He was kind\nand loving by nat=\r\nure to all, but his love did not make him blind\nto their flaws and defects =\r\nwhich needed mending.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;Gentle speech would not always serve the =\r\npurpose, and\nSwamiji would have to be at times hard. And in this\napparently=\r\n unpleasant treatment, his wealthy disciples would have\nexactly the same fa=\r\nte as his begging &lt;i&gt;sannyasins&lt;/i&gt;. At times, this\nwould be too much for p=\r\nersons born and brought up in the lap\n\nof luxury and accustomed to hear wor=\r\nds of praise and flattery\nFrom a worldly point of view, Swamiji paid dear f=\r\nor it. But did\nhe ever regret? Far from it. The perfect unconcern which he\n=\r\nshowed whether rich people would stick to him or give him up\nis truly unpre=\r\ncedented.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;...Of the few pregnant proverbs and epigrammatical\nex=\r\npressions which Swamiji would never be tired of repeating,\none was &quot;\n\n&lt;img =\r\nsrc=3D&quot;http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/reminiscences/307_sv_1.jpg&quot; a=\r\nlign=3D&quot;ABSMIDDLE&quot; height=3D&quot;16&quot; width=3D&quot;67&quot;&gt;\n\n=E2=80=94 The giver of the =\r\nhead is alone the\nleader&quot;, that is, he atone can be a leader who is ready t=\r\no die for\nothers. And Swamiji&#39;s own life determines his place among his\nfel=\r\nlow beings. I have already told you that Swamiji was not\nonly kind and soft=\r\n but was very hard also at times. He could\nnot only lay down his life for o=\r\nthers, but could take arms\nagainst others if needed. Whatever he would thin=\r\nk or feel he\nwould do so with wonderful vehemence and intensity. And\nthis w=\r\nhole-souledness was another marked feature of\nSwamiji&#39;s life. One evening i=\r\nn the course of a talk that Swamiji was\ngiving to one of his disciples, ope=\r\nning his eyes to the fact that\nthe disciple&#39;s inability to manage the serva=\r\nnts of the Math\n(which was one of his duties then) and make them do their\nr=\r\nespective duties was a weakness and did not proceed from\nlove, he said, &quot;Do=\r\nn&#39;t think that your heart is full of love,\nbecause you cannot give them a l=\r\nittle scolding now and then.\nCan you give your life for them? I know, you c=\r\nan&#39;t, because\nyou do not love them. This minute I can die for them; but als=\r\no\nI can hang them on this tree this minute if need be. Can you do\nthat? No,=\r\n my boy, namby-pamby is not love. Remember the\nwords of the poet,\n\n&lt;img src=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/reminiscences/307_sv_2.jpg&quot; alig=\r\nn=3D&quot;ABSBOTTOM&quot; height=3D&quot;17&quot; width=3D&quot;156&quot;&gt;\n\n=E2=80=94&#39;Harder than the thu=\r\nnderbolt and softer than the flower&#39;, this is the ideal,\nNo, love is not we=\r\nak sentimentality.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;I have seen no man who could be so soft as =\r\nSwamiji. The\ndeath of a &lt;i&gt;gurubhai&lt;/i&gt; or a disciple would rob him of rest=\r\n and\nconsolation for days and days together. Some time in the year\n1898, it=\r\n pleased the Lord to take away one of his &lt;i&gt;gurubhais&lt;/i&gt;.\nThe pang of ber=\r\neavement was so intense in Swamiji that for\nweek he remained exceedingly he=\r\navy and absent-minded\nkeeping as much away from others as possible. On the =\r\nevening\n\nof the seventh or eighth day he came to the temple-room of the\nMat=\r\nh, and began to talk to those that were present there, like\na simple child:=\r\n &quot;I did not come to the temple these days\nbecause I was very angry with my =\r\nMaster for having deprived\nme of my dear brother. I love them so much becau=\r\nse I have\nlived longer and more intimately with them than even with my\nown =\r\nbrothers.... But why should I be angry with my Master?\nWhy should I expect =\r\nthat all things will be ordained according\nto my wishes? And why should I b=\r\ne sad at all? Am I not a\nhero? My Master used to say laying his arm upon my=\r\n shoulder:\nNaren, you are a hero; the very sight of you inspires me with\nco=\r\nurage.&#39; Yes, I am a hero. Why should I then give way to\ngrief?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;...Ask each one of his disciples, American or English,\nBengali or Madrasi,=\r\n and you will hear the same thing from all\nthat their hearts were won by Sw=\r\namiji&#39;s wonderful love and\nsympathy. Swamiji&#39;s marvellous intellectual powe=\r\nrs, no\ndoubt, evoked the awe of all. But this awe would have kept at\na dist=\r\nance all unintellectual people like myself and would have\nproved more a bar=\r\nrier than a help to them to come in direct\ntouch with him and drink from th=\r\ne fountain of his soul. Heaps\nof instances could be cited to show Swamiji&#39;s=\r\n wonderful heart.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;...And how can universal love be without the =\r\never present\nconsciousness of the closest kinship with the universe, withou=\r\nt\nthe realization that whatever is is mine, nay, whatever is is\nme? And thi=\r\ns is &lt;i&gt;brahmajnana&lt;/i&gt; (knowledge of Self) as our holy\nbooks describe it. =\r\nThis is the very core of Swamiji&#39;s teaching =E2=80=94\nThe Selfhood of all =\r\n=E2=80=94 the Divinity of man. And this is, I am\nfully convinced, the key t=\r\no his wonderfully versatile nature.\nHe was a lover of all, because he was a=\r\n &lt;i&gt;jnani&lt;/i&gt;. And here I must\ntell you that the fatal illusion under which=\r\n I had long laboured\nthat &lt;i&gt;jnana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;bhakti&lt;/i&gt; are destructive of=\r\n each other, dispersed\nin the presence of Swamiji as darkness before the su=\r\nn. Swamiji\nwas a tremendous worker because he was a &lt;i&gt;bhakta&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;jn=\r\nani&lt;/i&gt;.\nThe tremendous energy that shook the whole world and is still\nat w=\r\nork awakening many a slumbering soul to its innate Divinity,\ninstilling lif=\r\ne into dead bones, bringing sunshine in the\n\ndarkness of despair and love i=\r\nn dry, arid souls =E2=80=93, this\ntremendous energy owes its origin to his =\r\nrealization of &lt;i&gt;brahman&lt;/i&gt; in all.\nHere too, I must tell you that the fa=\r\ntally-erroneous idea that\n&lt;i&gt;karma&lt;/i&gt; is antagonistic to &lt;i&gt;jnana&lt;/i&gt; and =\r\n&lt;i&gt;bhakti&lt;/i&gt; is dispelled at once\nby the life of Swamiji.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;I to=\r\nld you at the outset that before I met Swamiji I did not,\non account of my =\r\nlimited religious views, expect to see in him\nanything of the warrior, the =\r\npoet, the philosopher, or the\nphilanthropist. But I found that he was all t=\r\nhese and more than\nthese. He was as much a poet as a philosopher; as much a=\r\n\nsentimental visionary as a man of action. And he was all these,\nnot in spi=\r\nte of his religion but on account of it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have lear=\r\nnt that a religion which does not call forth into\nvigorous activity and cha=\r\nsten and elevate the moral,\nintellectual, and aesthetic faculties of man, m=\r\nake him humane and\nself-sacrificing and at the same lime self-absorbed and\n=\r\nmeditative is an imperfect religion. But I have also learnt that even\nsuch =\r\nimperfect religions have their great purpose to serve in\nhelping the growth=\r\n of persons less evolved and that our\nattitude towards them all should he o=\r\nne of extreme sympathy and\nlove. I have learnt that I should hesitate thric=\r\ne before I\ncondemn any form of religious faith, however repellent it may\nap=\r\npear to me. For I have seen forms of worship, generally\ncondemned as supers=\r\ntitious, yield treasurers of infinite beauty\nand holiness touched by the ma=\r\ngic wand of Swamiji. I have\nlearnt that every individual, however degraded =\r\nhe may appear\nin my eyes, is God involved, and therefore cannot be lost for=\r\n\never. We should look upon him with respect and if possible\ngive him a lift=\r\n Godward, not by condemning his perverted\nideal and by cruelly tearing it a=\r\nway from his heart but by gently\nreplacing it by a true one suited to his t=\r\nemperament and\nculture. I have learnt that under peculiar circumstances eve=\r\nn\nhardness and cruelty become a virtue, stubborn resistance.\nand excellence=\r\n, and that activity is as much a help to spiritual\ngrowth as contemplative =\r\ncalmness. I have learnt that God can\nbe enjoyed both within ourselves and o=\r\nutside of ourselves;\nwithin ourselves by effacing completely from our consc=\r\niousness\n\nall impression of the world of senses and making me\nSpirit touch =\r\nSpirit. Outside ourselves by seeing God in\neverything and pouring out our h=\r\nearts unto His feel in the shape of\nloving service. I have learnt the incal=\r\nculable value of great\npersonalities in the scheme of individual, national,=\r\n and\nuniversal redemption. I have also learnt that I have learnt all these\n=\r\nonly intellectually and am yet far from getting them woven\ninto my nature. =\r\nAnd all these I have learnt from the life of\nSwamiji. One thing more: My co=\r\nnviction that Swamiji&#39;s\nspiritual realization was of the highest order came=\r\n to me not only\nfrom his intense purity, fearlessness, love of truth, and\nu=\r\nniversal sympathy, but also from those subtler personal\nmanifestations desc=\r\nribed in our &lt;i&gt;shastras&lt;/i&gt;. I have seen him weep like a\nchild and becomin=\r\ng disconsolate at the name of God. I have\nseen him go into such deep medita=\r\ntion that even the function\nof the lungs stopped. Last of all came his own =\r\nwords to give the\nfinishing touch to my conception of his spiritual greatne=\r\nss....&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;(&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.chennaimath.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Vedanta Kesa=\r\nri&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, January-February 1923)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;App=\r\nle-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span=\r\n&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;=\r\nyui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york=\r\n, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 y=\r\nui_3_7_2_34_1351170942930_60&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMIL=\r\nY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; par=\r\nam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1004636618-1809560096-1351192162=:24432--\r\n\n"}}
