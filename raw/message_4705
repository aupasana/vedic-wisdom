There is knowledge in Realisation.But\nthis knowledge differs from=\r\n the ordinary one of the relation of subject and\nobject. It is absolute kno=\r\nwledge. Knowledge has two meanings:\n\n(1) vachyartha =3D vritti =3D Literal =\r\nmeaning.\n(2) lakshyartha =3D Jnana =3D Self =3D Swarupa =3D Secondary signi=\r\nficance.\n\nD.: With vritti one sees knowledge.\n\nM.: Quite so, he also confou=\r\nnds vritti with knowledge. Vritti is a mode of\nmind. You are not the mind. =\r\nYou are beyond it.\n\nLater Sri Bhagavan explained: Vritti is often mistaken =\r\nfor consciousness. It\nis only a phenomenon(Any state or process known throu=\r\ngh the senses) and\noperates in the region of abhasa (reflected consciousnes=\r\ns).\n\nThe knowledge lies beyond relative knowledge and ignorance. It is not =\r\nin the\nshape of vritti.There are no subject and object in it.\n\nVritti belon=\r\ngs to the rajasic (active) mind. The satvic mind (mind is repose\ni.e The ab=\r\nsence of mental stress or anxiety) is free from it. The satvic is\nthe witne=\r\nss of the rajasic. It is no doubt true consciousness.\n\nStill it is called s=\r\natvic mind because the knowledge of being witness is the\nfunction of abhasa=\r\n (reflected consciousness) only. Mind is the abhasa. Such\nknowledge implies=\r\n\nmind. But the mind is by itself inoperative. Therefore it is called satvic=\r\n\nmind.\n\nThe satvic mind is in fact the Absolute consciousness. The object t=\r\no be\nwitnessed and the witness finally merge together and Absolute consciou=\r\nsness\nalone reigns supreme. It is not a state of sunya (blank) or ignorance=\r\n.\n\nIt is the swarupa (Real Self).Some say that mind arises from consciousne=\r\nss\nfollowed by reflection (abhasa);others say that the abhasa (reflection)\n=\r\narises first followed by the mind.
