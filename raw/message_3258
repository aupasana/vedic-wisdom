That is why=\r\n most\npeople know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and\n=\r\nuncorruptable=C2 human being.=C2 =C2 They have no clue about his\nmeditation=\r\ns or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and\ngenerally would n=\r\not discuss God in public.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Therefore our discussion was also on thos=\r\ne aspects which can be proved\nor disproved theologically=C2 - 1) Is Rama a =\r\nGod as per Valmiki\nRamayana=C2  2) Is it wrong if people consider him as Go=\r\nd=C2 .. 3) The\nmerits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 1) To =\r\nthe first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 2) To the secon=\r\nd question he says it cannot be debated from a\nspiritual point if it is rig=\r\nht or wrong=C2 - but his personal opinion\nis that one should try to follow =\r\nthe way of life shown by Sri Rama\nrather than worshipping him. He said, Sri=\r\n Rama had mastery of all divine\nweapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and=\r\n his whole army in a blink of\nan eye, right from the place where he was=C2 =\r\nlocated when he first\nheard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not =\r\ndo so and instead\nchose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. =\r\nSo as per my\nfriend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to w=\r\norship\nRama.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary a=\r\nngle, a\nhodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa=\r\n. An\nauthor&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) b=\r\nut\na critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women\n=\r\nwith animals or something similar. He believes that was introduces in\nthe t=\r\next because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust.\nTherefore, he=\r\n ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women.\nFurther, he argues that=\r\n if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the\npurpose of his Avatarhood goes =\r\nwaste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea\nway of life. Krishna was there to=\r\n be worshipped because Krishna was\nmaximum ability of God on this plane. No=\r\nthing can be more God than\nKrishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n The above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; De=\r\nar Utpal,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his thought on=\r\n Food habits,\nit&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I have been out of touch with him sin=\r\nce August, been busy myself.

He is\nmarried, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; Before I tell you anything more=C2 about his spiritual life=C2 that\n=\r\nI know, let me say=C2 line or two about the nature of this friend of\nmine. =\r\nI met him about two years back. What first attracted me to=C2 \ntowards him =\r\nwas his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2 when\nit comes to=C2 =\r\nhonestly.=C2 If someone were to put a gun to his head\nand ask him to just s=\r\nay a simple, harmless=C2 lie, like sun rises in\nthe west, he would not say =\r\nit. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too!\nHe has actually never ever=C2=\r\n spoken even a single lie in his whole\nlife, big or small. When he was in h=\r\nis school, once his teacher told him\nthat Indian languages are richer than =\r\nEnglish, he believed his teacher.\nLater someone else told him English is mo=\r\nre comprehensive language and\nthe world cannot do with it. He got confused.=\r\n Since that day, he bought\nhimself two thick fat dictionaries, one English,=\r\n one Hindi and for ten\nyears every day he spend one hour reading the Englis=\r\nh dictionary and\n&gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=\r\n=C2 up\nvolumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2 When I asked him why, he=\r\n\njust said it is because he wanted to be=C2 equally adept at both the\nlangu=\r\nages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge\nthe truth =\r\nabout=C2 which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he\nhas an uncompr=\r\nomising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth\nabout anything. By =\r\neducation, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked\nin different fields, f=\r\nrom banking to education to journalism. He did not\nlast for long in most pl=\r\naces. He speaks and writes fluently, English,\nBengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskri=\r\nt, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is\nlearning Tamil. He composes poetry in=\r\n all the above languages. When he\nwas in college, he considered himself an =\r\natheist. While applying for a\njob he had kept the place makered for religio=\r\nn as blank. When the clerk\nwho was supposed to take the forms saw that blan=\r\nk space, he asked\n&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote=\r\n &quot;Hindu&quot;.\nSeeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore =\r\nit up\nright there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hi=\r\nndu\nin the form would have been a lie.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; So this gives a basic idea o=\r\nf the man I am speaking of. All his\nfriends, whoever knows him, calls him R=\r\nama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for som=\r\ne urgent meeting.\nHis way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was p=\r\nassing by\nin=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the=\r\n\ntemple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple,\nbut =\r\nhe did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his\nwatch i=\r\nt is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time\nwent. Whe=\r\nn he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the\ntemple sat dow=\r\nn and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any\nmovement. The pr=\r\niest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend\nhad no idea why this=\r\n happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in\ndeep sleep.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Then =\r\nhe started meditating at home, and it was there=C2 that he got\nvisions etc =\r\nof Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most\npeople who know h=\r\nim also do not know these things. But once he was in\nsamadhi for 72 hours, =\r\nnot moving from his meditation seat, in the exact\nsame place and same posit=\r\nion for 3 days continuously.=C2  Only his wife\nand close relatives know abo=\r\nut this incident. I believe nowadays when\never he sits for meditation he of=\r\nten enters the state of Samadhi. When\nsomeone asked him how he felt during =\r\nsamadhi, he just said it feels as\nif the whole universe orginates from me. =\r\nI am the sun, the moon, the\nstars, the planets, the animals, men, women, ch=\r\nildren, the wind, the\nwater, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger th=\r\nan everything. It\ncannot be accurately desribed.=C2 He considers Sri Krishn=\r\na to be God\nand=C2 Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he does not li=\r\nke the\nRamacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2 Rama to the\n&gt; =\r\nlevel of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to\nshow =\r\nSri Rama as an ideal man,=C2 not a God.The difference he says is\nthat, an i=\r\ndeal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can\nand should aim=\r\n to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by\nordinary men. On=\r\ne cannot become Krishna, but one=C2 can try to lead his\nlife like Rama. I h=\r\nave argued with him over this, but I am merely\nstating his idea. Also he do=\r\nes not have a Guru - a human guru at least,\nand advises people to not trust=\r\n most Gurus these days. Needless to say,\nhe is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; Later he had once=C2 mentioned he knew the relation he had with all\nt=\r\nhe people around him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his\ndaughte=\r\nr in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on\ndifferent inter=\r\nnet forums interacting with people, specially=C2 with\nthose in=C2 the age g=\r\nroup of 18 to 30, discussing anything and\neverything with them, from Indian=\r\n politics to Indian history, religion,\netc etc. His idea is to impart right=\r\n knowledge to young people who will\nbe the future of this country.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\nHe is am omnivorous person.

He will discuss and debate scriptures =\r\nusing exact quotations etc, (theology)=C2&nbsp;but not about mysticism or s=\r\nadhana or anything which=C2&nbsp;needs a belief system. That is why most pe=\r\nople know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorrup=\r\ntable=C2&nbsp;human being.=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;They have no clue about his med=\r\nitations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and generally =\r\nwould not discuss God in public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Therefore our di=\r\nscussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved theolog=\r\nically=C2&nbsp;- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C2&nbsp; 2) Is it=\r\n wrong if people consider him as God=C2&nbsp;.. 3) The merits of the Ramcha=\r\nrit Manas of Tulasidasji.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) To the first questio=\r\nn, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) To the sec=\r\nond question he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is r=\r\night or wrong=C2&nbsp;- but his personal opinion is that one should try to =\r\nfollow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He sa=\r\nid, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Rav=\r\nana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he =\r\nwas=C2&nbsp;located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but R=\r\nama did not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the=\r\n human way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ide=\r\nas than to worship Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) He considers the Ramc=\r\nharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ra=\r\nnging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of c=\r\nomposition has been flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line=\r\n in there which equates women with animals or something similar. He believe=\r\ns that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlli=\r\nng his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to =\r\nwomen. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the p=\r\nurpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way=\r\n of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ab=\r\nility of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on thi=\r\ns plane, so he thinks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The above are merely his o=\r\npinions, feel free to disagree. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One request, if you can speak to hi=\r\nm about his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy myself. But wi=\r\nll ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because as I expl=\r\nained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything from a purely spiritual a=\r\nngle. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It was only by chance that I found out one=\r\n day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed them when asked.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from a s=\r\ncientific point of view - about why there is no harm in having regulated am=\r\nounts of meat (not red meat). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But I say, as Nara=\r\nsimha said, this person should not be taken as an ideal regarding food=C2&n=\r\nbsp; habits. Sachin can bat and score century even with a sore back, we wil=\r\nl not be able to do it. His strength is his control of mind and his dedicat=\r\nion to truth. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;Rajarshi=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; --- On Tue, 15/12/09, Kishore Chitrapu chitrapu@... wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Kishore Chitrapu chitrapu@...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

He is married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before I tell you anything more=C2&nbsp;about his spiritual li=\r\nfe=C2&nbsp;that I know, let me say=C2&nbsp;line or two about the nature of =\r\nthis friend of mine. I met him about two years back. What first attracted m=\r\ne to=C2&nbsp; towards him was his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a mani=\r\nac=C2&nbsp;when it comes to=C2&nbsp;honestly.=C2&nbsp;If someone were to pu=\r\nt a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C2&nbsp;lie,=\r\n like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes =\r\nwith anyone too! He has actually never ever=C2&nbsp;spoken even a single li=\r\ne in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teac=\r\nher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his=\r\n teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive languag=\r\ne and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he boug=\r\nht himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten y=\r\nears every day he spend one hour reading the English dictionary and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C2&nbsp;up volume=\r\ns of Hindi and English literature.=C2&nbsp;When I asked him why, he just sa=\r\nid it is because he wanted to be=C2&nbsp;equally adept at both the language=\r\ns so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth abo=\r\nut=C2&nbsp;which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncom=\r\npromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anything. B=\r\ny education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields,=\r\n from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in most =\r\nplaces. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sansk=\r\nrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry =\r\nin all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered himself a=\r\nn atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for relig=\r\nion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that bl=\r\nank space, he asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the cle=\r\nrk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk a=\r\nnd tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and wr=\r\niting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; S=\r\no this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, who=\r\never knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One d=\r\nay, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His way to o=\r\nffice passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in=C2&nbsp;his scoot=\r\ner, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still=\r\n does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o c=\r\nlock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening!=\r\n And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, th=\r\ne priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as he w=\r\nas for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt scared =\r\nto disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He remembered =\r\nnothing, as if he was in deep sleep.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then he star=\r\nted meditating at home, and it was there=C2&nbsp;that he got visions etc of=\r\n Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know him=\r\n also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, no=\r\nt moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same positio=\r\nn for 3 days continuously.=C2&nbsp; Only his wife and close relatives know =\r\nabout this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he=\r\n often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt duri=\r\nng samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from m=\r\ne. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women,=\r\n children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger=\r\n than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2&nbsp;He considers Sr=\r\ni Krishna to be God and=C2&nbsp;Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why h=\r\ne does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated Sri=C2&n=\r\nbsp;Rama to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmi=\r\nki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2&nbsp;not a God.The dif=\r\nference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an or=\r\ndinary man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be=\r\n emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2&nbsp;can t=\r\nry to lead his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am m=\r\nerely stating his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at leas=\r\nt, and advises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, =\r\nhe is not an atheist any more.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Later he had once=\r\n=C2&nbsp;mentioned he knew the relation he had with all the people around h=\r\nim in his past lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past life=\r\n etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on different internet forums interac=\r\nting with people, specially=C2&nbsp;with those in=C2&nbsp;the age group of =\r\n18 to 30, discussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politic=\r\ns to Indian history, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowled=\r\nge to young people who will be the future of this country.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, me=\r\nat etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I shall refrain from mentioning his name =\r\nbecause I had not asked his permission before mentioning him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; P=\r\nS: I would not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.
