I rememb=\r\ner \ndifferent fears i was having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying=\r\n guest \nwith a family. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if they =\r\nwould allow \nme to do something related to fire. that was the main worry. t=\r\nhen there was self \ndoubt concerning my ability to perform Homam but I deci=\r\nded to perform and did \nthe first Homam which was Maha Ganapati homam on 1s=\r\nt day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I \nremember that i took me around 2.5 hours tot=\r\nal including all the preparation \nafter that rest of the 8 days, i performe=\r\nd Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam took \naround 4 hours. I remember that on=\r\n the Ashtami day, some of My colleagues with \nfamily came to see my chandi =\r\nHomam and they told me that the smoke was even \nvisible in the ground floor=\r\n (The Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and there \nwere nice smell every =\r\nwhere. The interesting thing is that Old lady of the \nfamily actually co-op=\r\nerated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray coconut \nin to small pe=\r\nices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions while \ncutting coconu=\r\nts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained coconut \npeices in C=\r\nhandi Homas.\n\nMy all previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. Fr=\r\nom the very first \nHomam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navar=\r\natri and could not \ncontinue and there was a break of a week or so. Then ag=\r\nain i started daily Maha \nGanapti Homam while learnt the technic of breakin=\r\ng Dry coconut halves by \ncrushing it with both palms.\n\nAfter few months, I =\r\nhad to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried to search \nfor it. few f=\r\namilies rejected when i put the condition of doing Homam everyday. \nat last=\r\n One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount but they \nallow=\r\ned me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 months. during that \nt=\r\nime i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path everyday for 1 year.\n\nafter=\r\n 3 months, i started searching for my own separate Rental Apartment because=\r\n \nmy family was joining me. Again the same concern (Prime) is to search for=\r\n \nApartment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new apart=\r\nment. I \nobserved the flat and finalised the dealing. continued Homam every=\r\n day for 1 \nyear. The whole flat became black. even the Home applicances li=\r\nem refrigerator \netc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes =\r\nin the wardrobe, \nOpenings of Central A/c etc... were all filled with black=\r\n dust. My whole brand \nnew apartment became dark due to the Homam. Smoke pa=\r\nrticles travelled to my \nlungs and throat and i started coughing badly. I s=\r\nuffered with severe Cough for \nmany months and there was pressure from near=\r\n ones to stop Homam or atleast \nperform it once every week. But there was l=\r\not of determination provided by *some \npower* which i like to call as &quot;Moth=\r\ner&quot;.\n\nAfter 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching different place. I=\r\n searched \nwhole area and was looking for a apartment which also has Balcon=\r\ny so that My \nhomam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look bl=\r\nack and there are \nno more complaints from my wife .\nI could not get one su=\r\nch perfect place which gives me a Blacony and at the same \ntime there are n=\r\no buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in balcony \nand make =\r\na instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very \ncomfir=\r\ntable and required option so that i can do it there and smoke handling \nbec=\r\nomes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky because any =\r\n\nroad-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.\nFinally i got one =\r\naprtment without balcony but with a special location. When i \nvacated the p=\r\nrevious apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was shell-shocked \nlooking at=\r\n the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone - &quot;Aaap Kya \nkarat=\r\na tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the \ncompens=\r\nation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal instaed \nof=\r\n going to police station.\n\nIn new Apartment (current one), security is very=\r\n tight. But I decided to make an \narrangement so that i do not *spoil* cond=\r\nition of the  Apartment. hence i came \nout with the Idea of Chimney. (Pleas=\r\ne see the more pictures in photo section) \nand started doing Homam. Though =\r\nthe chimney is visible to neighbours and other \nflat owners, no body has co=\r\nmplained till now. neither to police nor to security \npersonnel. Only once =\r\nSecurity person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and \nstarted as usu=\r\nal. It is going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i \ndo not w=\r\norry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to me \nt=\r\nhat It is not I who is arranging all these but there is Mother behind all \n=\r\nthese. SHE is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.\n\n=\r\n***\nThe moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform Homam=\r\n/Havan, \nthen It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.\nDo not f=\r\near. All the fears will break like Papads once you start walking over \nthem=\r\n to do homam. i can swear for it!\n\nNo owner will kick you out, No neighbour=\r\n will call 9-1-1 and even if that \nhappens, there will open a way!\n\nBest Re=\r\ngards,\n\nUtpal\nPS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar! \n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal J=\r\ni,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks very much for the photo.

SHE is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n***&lt;br&gt;\nThe moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire t=\r\no perform Homam/Havan, then It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your=\r\n way.&lt;br&gt;\nDo not fear. All the fears will break like Papads once you start =\r\nwalking over them to do homam. i can swear for it!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNo owner will k=\r\nick you out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1 and even if that happens, there w=\r\nill open a way!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;br&gt;\nPS: Forgive me fo=\r\nr spellings and Grammar! &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic=\r\n-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;astro_student=\r\n75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Thanks very much for the photo.
