There is no fourth duty for a sannyasin. Meditation is his duty, meditati=\r\non is his food, meditation is his life. He lives meditation, breathes medit=\r\nation. He is ever intent upon the realization of the Supreme Brahman.\n\nBy r=\r\nestraining the senses, by annihilating desire and aversion, by extending co=\r\nmpassion to all creatures, by seeing the Eternal Being alone existing every=\r\nwhere, a sannyasin attains immortality.\n\nBy means of yoga, a sannyasin shou=\r\nld comprehend the disembodied Self or the Supreme Brahman which runs throug=\r\nh all creatures, good or bad, high or low. The all-pervasiveness of this in=\r\nner Self which spreads among all living and dead beings alike, is unintelli=\r\ngible to the untrained and uncultured intellects; let the sannyasin witness=\r\n the majesty of this Existence-Knowledge-Bliss by means of profound meditat=\r\nion. \n\n\n"}}
