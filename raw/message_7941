Ever=\r\nything is consumed by various beings\n&gt; &gt; and finally merges back in the fiv=\r\ne elements. Even if you throw food in\n&gt; &gt; trash, it gets consumed by variou=\r\ns microbodies and eventually the five\n&gt; &gt; elements in the food return to th=\r\ne elements in Nature.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But, when food is in our hands (as per our pe=\r\nrception), we should use it\n&gt; &gt; to fulfil our higher rinas than lower rinas=\r\n. We have so many rinas and\n&gt; &gt; should use the resources at our disposal wi=\r\nsely.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rinas to various deities and associates who run the universe =\r\nare the\n&gt; &gt; highest rinas we have. Fulfilling those rinas makes those being=\r\ns within us\n&gt; &gt; (the microcosm) pleased, places us in a nice and balanced s=\r\ntate and that is\n&gt; &gt; good for our entire consciousness. It enables us to pi=\r\nck the optimal\n&gt; &gt; actions at every kaarmik crossroads. In comparison, givi=\r\nng food to a few\n&gt; &gt; individuals balances only a few aspects of our conscio=\r\nusness. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; offering ghee and other food in fire to celestial beings =\r\nis not inferior,\n&gt; &gt; but much superior, to feeding food to other people.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sin is a heavy word.

They are not\n&gt; &gt; a book of good ethical li=\r\nving. Apart from the core-veda samhitas, all\n&gt; &gt; dharmic rulebooks are neve=\r\nr ment for eternity. In changed scenarios, they\n&gt; &gt; too must undergo change=\r\n. But based on what? A natural sense of right and\n&gt; &gt; wrong, proportion and=\r\n disproportion, arising out of a clear heart. There is\n&gt; &gt; no greater rule =\r\nbook for ethical living than ones own heart. Follow it, and\n&gt; &gt; you won&#39;t b=\r\ne disappointed.

Use common\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\nense and do *real* good to others and the world, than engaging in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nfake *symbols* that in reality harm the world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sorry for the stron=\r\ng language, but I do see many people abusing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mother Annapoorna and=\r\n I think this is terrible for the world. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; needs to change.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------- Free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; *http://www.VedicAstrologer.org* &lt;http://www.=\r\nvedicastrologer.org/&gt;&lt; *\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org* &lt;http://www.ve=\r\ndicastrologer.org/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: *http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFilms.org*&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt; *http://SaraswatiFilms.=\r\norg* &lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; *http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom*&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt; *http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom*&lt;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; *http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings*&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &lt; *http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings*&lt;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;  ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; *http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings*&lt;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt; *http://docs.yahoo.com/info/ter=\r\nms/*&lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://docs.yah=\r\noo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/inf=\r\no/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
