Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Choosing the right deity for sadhana is important. If you do not \nknow t=\r\nhe \n&gt; right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than \nwaiti=\r\nng. Pick \n&gt; whatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please=\r\n remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is different \nfrom \n&gt; sadhana=\r\n for specific material benefits. No matter which deity you \nworship, \n&gt; sad=\r\nhana performed for spiritual progress never goes waste. \nHowever, \n&gt; someti=\r\nmes it may be necessary to experience the results of some \nbad karmas \n&gt; be=\r\nfore some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a \npile in a=\r\n \n&gt; basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable \nyou to=\r\n do \n&gt; serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or \nmi=\r\nddle of \n&gt; the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give yo=\r\nu \nthe fruits \n&gt; of those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the =\r\npile and \n&gt; retrieving those karmas. In the process, some other karmas may =\r\n\nspill over \n&gt; and give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So =\r\nwhat? \nThey had \n&gt; to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!\n&gt; \n&gt; A =\r\nserious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly \n&gt; undesira=\r\nble results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep \ngoing.\n&gt; \n&gt; One =\r\ngentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good \n&gt; priest-cum-y=\r\nogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few \ndays, he was \n&gt; laid o=\r\nff and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his \nsadhana \n&gt; and=\r\n used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a \npilgrimage \n=\r\n&gt; to some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we \nconduc=\r\nted \n&gt; at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru \n=\r\nand got \n&gt; the opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at=\r\n \nthe house \n&gt; of a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact =\r\nwith \nmy guru \n&gt; very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision =\r\nof the \nMother on \n&gt; 2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start=\r\n the work on \nspreading \n&gt; homam in the world, this gentleman was present t=\r\nhere. Though he \ncould not \n&gt; see the Mother, he actually smelled something=\r\n out of the world and \nwas \n&gt; baffled. He knew something was going on, but =\r\ndid not know what. \nThe temple \n&gt; was closed at the time and my guru and th=\r\nis gentlemen were the \nonly people \n&gt; on the premises when the Mother appea=\r\nred. Even though he could not \nsee the \n&gt; Mother, it was most fortunate of =\r\nhim to be present there at *that* \ncrucial \n&gt; moment. That is enough to mou=\r\nld the rest of his life.\n&gt; \n&gt; You never know how, when and where the grace =\r\nof god falls on you. \n&gt; Calculations and logic are useless when it comes to=\r\n the grace of \ngod. Just \n&gt; surrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you p=\r\nicked. If it needs \n&gt; fine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. A=\r\nny bad things \nthat \n&gt; happen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be view=\r\ned as nature \nsettling \n&gt; some debts so that you are prepared to receive th=\r\ne fruits of some \nreally \n&gt; auspicious karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; As Shirdi Sai Baba says=\r\n, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. \nHave devotion \n&gt; and patience. The=\r\nre is no limit to what you can get then.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sir\n&gt; &gt; what you said make=\r\ns a lot sense and it was marvellous\n&gt; &gt; but i have some small doubts\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have a guru\n&gt; &gt; how can they=\r\n chooose a particular form of GOD\n&gt; &gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimala=\r\nnda, said choosing right \ndeity\n&gt; &gt; is very important, as the analogy he ga=\r\nve of a person\n&gt; &gt; who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his gr=\r\need\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One thing more\n&gt; &gt; we have so many deities  that on diwali i wo=\r\nuld like to worship\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n&gt; &gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we wou=\r\nld worship Durga\n&gt; &gt; on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA\n&gt; &gt; an on MAH=\r\nASHIVARATRI for SHIVA\n&gt; &gt; like this\n&gt; &gt; with hte change in festival the dei=\r\nty changes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; though everybody knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficu=\r\nlt to get\n&gt; &gt; out of this\n&gt; &gt; mould and if i didnt worship her may be that =\r\nGOD/GODDESS may \nbecome\n&gt; &gt; angry\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I Know,this is my foolishness but=\r\n stiil this thing hangs in the \nmind\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One thing more\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Suppose=\r\n if i choose a deity and something wrong happens\n&gt; &gt; (materiallistically)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nDEBTS/WRONG DEEDS\n&gt; &gt; or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as I=\r\n  am not fit\n&gt; &gt; for that DEITY\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and sometimes you feel\n&gt; &gt; o what a=\r\nm i doing does this really works\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and one thing more\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; what if=\r\n we go on doing our pooja and someday\n&gt; &gt; something like what happened to P=\r\nt.

I will\n&gt; &gt; continue in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same vein for a litt=\r\nle more time.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I had a dream a couple of years ago early in the mo=\r\nrning. In the\n&gt; &gt; dream,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish P=\r\nandit and I were\n&gt; &gt; sitting in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teaching me =\r\nsome pranayama techniques \nin\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, he changed into=\r\n somebody else that I could not\n&gt; &gt; recognize.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It was not anybody I ha=\r\nd seen before.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru after a couple o=\r\nf weeks. First\n&gt; &gt; he said he\n&gt; &gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was an=\r\nd said he would&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; probably known if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soo=\r\nn after it had happened. I left it\n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However, when we talked =\r\nin the next weekend, he referred to my\n&gt; &gt; dream and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; said he had an id=\r\nea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me \nto\n&gt; &gt; search on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the in=\r\nternet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n&gt; &gt; my dream.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before\n&gt; &gt; him)=\r\n. Though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about th=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; lineage and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the i=\r\nnternet and\n&gt; &gt; found a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close=\r\n to the person I \nsaw\n&gt; &gt; in my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transfor=\r\nmed into in my dream \nlooked\n&gt; &gt; like a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; slightly younger version of th=\r\nat photo.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. L=\r\neave it for now.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya yoga =\r\nor about the\n&gt; &gt; lineage of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this=\r\n life starts from\n&gt; &gt; Dattatreya. We\n&gt; &gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Rama=\r\nkrishna Paramahamsa and his\n&gt; &gt; lineage and got\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge=\r\n, inspiration and perhaps experience from\n&gt; &gt; them. We do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not have any=\r\n direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa \nYogananda.\n&gt; &gt; But,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Manish=\r\n thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, \nhe\n&gt; &gt; guessed\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he\n&gt; &gt; guesse=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I will not be =\r\nsurprised if there are indeed subtle connections\n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt;&gt; several l=\r\nineages that seem disjoint today.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda a=\r\nlso appeared in the prison cell \nof\n&gt; &gt; Sri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brill=\r\niant commentaries on Veda and \nUpanishad)\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; imparted him some Ad=\r\nwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; A=\r\nn interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted\n&gt; &gt; me with=\r\nin a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; Yog=\r\nananda were\n&gt; &gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; keeper of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru received f=\r\nrom \nYukteshwar\n&gt; &gt; Maharaj.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed th=\r\nat knowledge and spent \na\n&gt; &gt; day at my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small connec=\r\ntion was made with a \nrepresentative\n&gt; &gt; of that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lineage soon after th=\r\ne dream. After all, some karmik debts may\n&gt; &gt; have been\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there...\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the impression that my\n&gt; &gt; guru =\r\nhas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But \nh=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; always\n&gt; &gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoe=\r\nver. He\n&gt; &gt; says,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dir=\r\nt and \ncapable\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connect=\r\nion between \nevery\n&gt; &gt; entity in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idio=\r\nt like me as an instrument\n&gt; &gt; sometimes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and do something using me. I =\r\nhave no special abilities of any\n&gt; &gt; kind. Any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coincidences you find a=\r\nre just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I realized in time that thi=\r\ns simplicity, humility and lack of \nego\n&gt; &gt; is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fake. I also realiz=\r\ned that this lack of ego is what enabled him \nto\n&gt; &gt; do things\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that so=\r\nund impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that \nmany\n&gt; &gt; great\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nsaints in the past were like this. Several magical things \nhappened\n&gt; &gt; thr=\r\nough\n&gt; &gt;&gt; them, but they did not find any pride in them and retained their\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; humility\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and be=\r\nlieved\n&gt; &gt; that god\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere inst=\r\nruments.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; lecturing or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, =\r\nyour sadhana\n&gt; &gt; will bear\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fruit.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n--=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n-- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I do not\n&gt; &gt; know\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much about him.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For what it is worth, you can read=\r\n more about Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; Yogananda in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his free+online autobiography=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; here http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n There were interesting links between Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Para=\r\nmahamsa Yogananda:-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; For example, one of the top disciples of Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahendranath Gupta (not sure if he was one of t=\r\nhe 16 monastic\n&gt; &gt;&gt; disciples that Narasimhaji refers to) aka Master Mahasa=\r\nya, who\n&gt; &gt; wrote\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;The Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (http://en.wikipedi=\r\na.org/wiki/Mahendranath_Gupta), and was the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sanskrit tutor to Paramaha=\r\nmsa Yogananda as well; the latter\n&gt; &gt; devoted an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; entire chapter to him=\r\n in his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; book :\n&gt; &gt; http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yo=\r\ngi/Chapter_9\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Elsewhere in his autobiography Paramhamsa Yogananda =\r\nalso \nmentions\n&gt; &gt; an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anecdote of a disciple to whom he gifted a silve=\r\nr cup, who as a\n&gt; &gt; young\n&gt; &gt;&gt; man was told by Swami Vivekandana that the G=\r\nuru in his life \nwould\n&gt; &gt;&gt; present him with a silver cup in the future.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Autobiography_of_a_Yogi/Chapter_47\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Makes you wonder about the Divine connection between all these\n&gt; &gt;&gt; supr=\r\nemely elevated souls!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
