Yes, agni in homa amplifies the effects. \nBut others may also note that these things depend on the individual and \nthere are two main factors at play here.\n\nWe perform karmas and we receive the fruits of those karmas. The order in \nwhich the fruits are received is in the hands of nature (god). Depending on \nthe karma-fruit pipeline of a person, one may or may not see the fruit of \ncertain action immediately. One with a deep pipeline may not see the result \nof performing homam in an iron homa kundam immediately. By the time the \nresult comes, it may not be obvious why. On the other hand, one with a \nshallow pipeline may see the results relatively sooner and realize the \ncorrelation between action and result!\n\nSecondly, the deity being worshipped also matters. Suppose you offer spoiled \nmilk to a friend. If he is a soft-natured person, he will drink a little, \nleave the rest and go away calmly. If he is blunt on the other hand, he will \ndrink a little, tell you that the milk is spoiled and perhaps yell a little \nat you, give you a piece of his/her mind and then leave. Which kind of \nfriends are better for you depends on your nature!\n\nSimilarly, if you worship soumya devatas (Sadashiva, Lakshmi, Vishnu etc) \nand your worship has flaws, the deity ignores it and waits till you correct \nthe flaws. If you worship ugra devatas (e.g. Bhairava, Rudra, Kaali, \nNarasimha etc) and your worship has flaws, the deity will ensure that you \nget the message sooner.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen you buy wood logs from some stores, they stick a big iron staple in a \nlog or two so that the logs and the plastic wrapper stay together. We \nnormally use the unstapled logs first and use the stapled logs after \nremoving the iron staple.\n\nOneday I ran out of logs and the only log I had had an iron staple. I \ndecided to use it without removing the iron staple in it. I thought, &quot;well, \nthis is a Saturday and Saturn likes iron. Let me just offer it like this.&quot; I \ndid it and forgot about it later.\n\nThat day, I had a really bad sprain in a muscle at the back of my lungs and \nsuffered for two days. When doing the daily Chandi homam on Sunday, a \nthought suddenly came to me. I suddenly remembered that I put a log with a \nfat iron staple in it in fire the previous day. The thought that came to me \nwas that I did a mistake and nature pointed it out to me in this way.\n\nWhen we make mistakes and nature shows our mistakes to us, we need not worry \nor panick. We should just learn the lesson and move on.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI still say that a homam in an iron or aluminum tray is still better than \nnothing. The gain is higher than loss due to mistake. But, one can try to \navoid the mistake when it is possible.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, December 23, 2008 11:59 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa Kunda effects\n\n\n&gt; Dear All\n&gt;\n&gt; I wanted to share an experince I had with everyone. Since the time I\n&gt; had been doing homa on a regular basis I had first started off with\n&gt; an iron kunda, then an aluminium and finally shifted to a copper\n&gt; homa kunda. And in each cases, I could feel some very papable\n&gt; effects.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I was doing it in an iron kunda for some days I would often get\n&gt; singed in the flames. Once it was to quite an extent, such taht I\n&gt; had problems in walking for a few days. This was after I had used\n&gt; the iron kunda for consequetive homas for some days.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then I changed it and started using an Aluminuim kunda which became\n&gt; dark and black with use. I had been using this aluminum kunda for\n&gt; about a month and half regularly when some strange things started\n&gt; happening. There used to be some sort of infestation of incests in\n&gt; my pooja room. One day I found a scorpion in my room! This was quite\n&gt; strange since I had been living there for many months and now and\n&gt; never have I seen any before. Then came spiders. Now I am generally\n&gt; scared of spiders. This had a strange psychological effect on my\n&gt; mind, such that one day when I closed my eyes to meditate infront of\n&gt; the fire, I could just see spiders all around. And strangest of all,\n&gt; within a few days I got bitten by one! Never had I or anyone else I\n&gt; knew, had known that spiders can bite. But this is a fact, cause I\n&gt; went through it and it is quite painful. It sort of left a small\n&gt; gaping wound on my neck.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then finally I shifted to a copper kunda and all such incidents\n&gt; stopped. Infact after using a copper kunda for sometime it created a\n&gt; marked feeling of lightness and joy. Very distinct and papable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course if someone takes a hard rational stance, all this can be\n&gt; put down to coincidence. But I personally do not think so. Infact\n&gt; these just proved the truth of Narasimhajis advice. Copper kundas\n&gt; are the best. Iron can increase effects of Shani in a person&#39;s life\n&gt; and sadhana. And Aluminium I believe is Rahu. The homa agni just\n&gt; amplified the effects.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
