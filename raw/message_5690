Based on different panchanga styles it seems\ndakshinayanam starts either on June 22nd\nor July 14th and I think it is recommended to do the thread ceremony\nonly in Uttarayanam.\nCan you please guide me if I can use the July 14th date as it gives me\nmore choices to find\na date for the ceremony.  I felt it is ok to ask you on this topic on\nthis forum as it relates to\nbrahmopadesham.\n\nthank you.\n\n"}}
