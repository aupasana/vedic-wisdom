Uttraang=\r\nam, Tarpana, Suddhaana Bali (common for Parshads of both the deities), Vaso=\r\nrdhaaraa, Poornaahuti (with Root Mantra of Ganapati and Navaarna mantra), M=\r\neditation, Udvaasana and conclusion.\n\nIt was a very useful procedure especi=\r\nally during the Navaratri or such ocassions.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Yes. Take a combined sankalpa to do the two homas, do one=\r\n and move on to \n&gt; the other without doing uttarangam and poorvaangam.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 2) When you are done with pradhana homam of one deity, offer naivedyam and=\r\n \n&gt; neeraajanam and move on to invoke the next deity in fire. After finishi=\r\nng \n&gt; all deities, you can do uttaraangam once and finally one poornaahuti =\r\nfor all \n&gt; of them together.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people offer a small poornaahuti to =\r\neach deity (without doing \n&gt; uttaraangam) before moving on to the next deit=\r\ny. At the very end, after \n&gt; uttaraangam, they do a combined final poornaah=\r\nuti. But that is not needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) The dry havan samagri powder is also g=\r\nood for Saturn. Saturn likes dry \n&gt; powdery things. Parasara maharshi recom=\r\nmends havischoornam.\n&gt; \n&gt; The wood of Sami tree (Prosopis Cineraria), also =\r\nknown in Hindi as Jand \n&gt; tree, was particularly recommended by Maharshi Pa=\r\nrasara for Sani. \n&gt; Unfortunately, it may not be easy to get in US and UK. =\r\nSo do with whatever \n&gt; wood or dry coconut pieces you normally use.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nough this is not mentioned in any book I have read, my intuition tells me \n=\r\n&gt; (and I have tried it with a positive experience) that ashwagandha (withan=\r\nia \n&gt; somnifera root) powder can be offered to Saturn in moderation. Ashwag=\r\nandha \n&gt; is a saattwik and rejuvenating herb that relieves one of vaata and=\r\n weakness.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) Various auspicious materials like various sugandha dravy=\r\nas can be used. \n&gt; Various materials that are offered in homam, like sesame=\r\n seeds, puffed rice, \n&gt; parched rice, juwar dhani (pelaalu in Telugu), jagg=\r\nery, turmeric, sandalwood \n&gt; powder, pomegranate seeds, havan samagri powde=\r\nr, cashews, almonds, raisins, \n&gt; dates etc can placed along with a dry coco=\r\nnut (full or half) in a cloth, the \n&gt; cloth can be wrapped into one bundle =\r\nand that can be offered as poornaahuti. \n&gt; Do whatever makes you feel good.=\r\n But one dry coconut full/half is enough. \n&gt; Instead of a coconut, a fruit =\r\nlike an apple or a peach can also be offered \n&gt; as poornaahuti (symbol of h=\r\nead, i.e. ego). But it may need some wood and \n&gt; ghee to burn fully and als=\r\no create a lot of smoke. Dry coconut burns easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; The most important =\r\nthing is to imagine that you have surrendered your ego to \n&gt; the Lord and n=\r\nothing exists except the Lord. Focus your mind on the deity \n&gt; with as few =\r\nthoughts as you can and meditate for 10-20 minutes. I see a lot \n&gt; of learn=\r\ned priests getting up and leaving as soon as poornaahuti is done. \n&gt; That i=\r\ns a mistake. Design your homam in such a way that you are able to \n&gt; spend =\r\n10-20 minutes meditating after poornaahuti. Sit in front of the \n&gt; burning =\r\npoornaahuti, try to fotget everything including your body and \n&gt; meditate a=\r\ns deeply as you can.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisundar@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, September 18, 2009 9:09 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Query on Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaskaram Narasimha ji,\n&gt; &gt; I had a query =\r\nin general about homam. Kindly answer them for me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Can I perform=\r\n mutiple homams in the same homam kund one after the other \n&gt; &gt; ?  I mean o=\r\nnce lets say Ganapathi homam is done and after the completion \n&gt; &gt; can I pe=\r\nrform Sani Homam in the same fire by following the steps from the \n&gt; &gt; begi=\r\nnning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) If yes are there any separate procedure to be done before=\r\n switching \n&gt; &gt; from one homam to another?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) For Sani homam I know=\r\n you have mentioned white snd black sesame seeds . \n&gt; &gt; But is there any ot=\r\nher special items that can be offered in the homam \n&gt; &gt; spdecially for Sani=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 4) For poornahuti are there any additional special materials that=\r\n can be \n&gt; &gt; used.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Girish Sundaram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
