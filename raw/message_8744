Is this intermediate zone as you\n&gt; &gt; say is created by Her =\r\nand part of Her creation or by somebody else.\n&gt; &gt; ... there is Grace of Div=\r\nine Mother on all Her children.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, everything is created, sust=\r\nained and eventually destroyed, by \n&gt; Her. And, yes, all are Her children. =\r\nBut, my friend, her Grace flows to \n&gt; different people in different ways, d=\r\nepending on their readiness and, \n&gt; more importantly, what they desire and =\r\nhow they are conditioned. After \n&gt; all, a mother who gives laddus to a grow=\r\nn up kid does not give the same \n&gt; to a baby - she gives milk instead. To a=\r\nnother unruly kid beating other \n&gt; kids, she may deny food and give him a g=\r\nood beating. Similarly, how \n&gt; divine Mother&#39;s grace flows to one depends o=\r\nn one&#39;s readiness, \n&gt; conditioning, attitude and actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us take more down to earth and repugnant example. Let us t=\r\nake a \n&gt; criminal such as a rapist or a mass murderer. The rapist, his mind=\r\n and \n&gt; mindset are also &quot;created by Her&quot;. He too is &quot;Her child&quot; and recipi=\r\nent \n&gt; of &quot;Her Grace&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone tells the rapist or mass murderer th=\r\nat it is bad karma with \n&gt; bad consequences and one should try to change, w=\r\nill we then also say \n&gt; &quot;nobody should feel any sort of fear or pressure ev=\r\nen for one second \n&gt; because there is no such hocus pocus bad karma and con=\r\nsequences ... \n&gt; there is Grace of Divine Mother on all Her children&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So nobody should feel any sort of fear or press=\r\nure even for one\n&gt; &gt; second because there is no such hocus pocus zone to cr=\r\noss\n&gt; \n&gt; If a sadhaka experiencing a higher realm entertains notions of bei=\r\nng \n&gt; special or accomplishing something great, one can get stuck in that \n=\r\n&gt; delusion and look at everything around one from that delusional and \n&gt; eg=\r\noistic point of view. There is nothing hocus pocus about it. This is \n&gt; ver=\r\ny real and happens to many excellent sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is not that She does=\r\n not love such a person. She loves even the \n&gt; rapist, so why not that sadh=\r\naka? But She gives results *compatible* with \n&gt; one&#39;s actions and one&#39;s con=\r\nditioning and of course opportunities to \n&gt; overcome one&#39;s conditioning and=\r\n engage in better actions. If one uses \n&gt; those opportunities, Her Grace fl=\r\nows even more.\n&gt; \n&gt; What Sri Aurobindo said amounts to asking people to use=\r\n those \n&gt; opporunities. This is not a matter of fear or pressure. This is a=\r\n matter \n&gt; of being responsible for one&#39;s actions and attitude and developi=\r\nng \n&gt; perfect surrender.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; It is easy to hide b=\r\nehind mis-conceived understanding of high concepts \n&gt; such as &quot;divine Grace=\r\n&quot; and &quot;divine Mother&#39;s Love&quot;. If misunderstood, it \n&gt; can simply descend in=\r\nto being another flavor of pseudo-Vedanta and \n&gt; fatalism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, divine=\r\n Mother loves all and Her grace flows towards all, but our \n&gt; conditioning,=\r\n attitude and actions do matter. She does not give one \n&gt; which is not good=\r\n for one (and for the world), based on one&#39;s current \n&gt; attitude. She gives=\r\n only when one is ready. Asking one to be better \n&gt; prepared for Her grace =\r\ndoes not tantamount to &quot;fear or pressure&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nese notions are not easy to discuss in written words. Even if we are \n&gt; sit=\r\nting in the same room and talking (i.e. tone and emotion are \n&gt; visible!), =\r\nit may be tough. In written words, so much more is lost.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, certain=\r\n words, concepts and styles of expression trigger some \n&gt; baggage and condi=\r\ntoning and may make one love or hate something.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no solution, ex=\r\ncept for asking people to be more cautious and \n&gt; patient in trying to unde=\r\nrstand what the other person is saying.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding your story of Aurobi=\r\nndo saying that Krishna forgot, I am \n&gt; afraid you misunderstood him. In an=\r\ny case, Sri Aurobindo is definitely a \n&gt; really elevated soul.

About 200 hundred years ago, a man made a theory of \n&gt; =\r\ncreation in France. When Napolean asked where is God in it, the guy \n&gt; said=\r\n, do not talk about God. It makes things complicated.\n&gt; So is there a place=\r\n for Divine Mother and Her Love or Grace or \n&gt; Protection in your theory. I=\r\ns this intermediate zone as you say is \n&gt; created by Her and part of Her cr=\r\neation or by somebody else.  Does She \n&gt; needs some visa to go there if she=\r\n is not the Creater. As you say all \n&gt; higher deity are there but less in a=\r\nbility. Does the deities have even \n&gt; less  ability on earth plane.\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\nam sure this is not your theory. You have taken it from yogi \n&gt; Aurobindo. =\r\nMany times when certain person reach a stage in their \n&gt; spiritual path, ot=\r\nhers think whatever this guy is uttering is complete \n&gt; truth, when in fact=\r\n it is far from truth. Once I saw in a article that \n&gt; Aurobindo said that =\r\nDivine Lord who spoke Gita completely forgot it \n&gt; after few minutes or so.=\r\n I could not believe what I was reading. Then my \n&gt; respect for this yogi w=\r\nent down the drain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Divine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Protection =\r\nand other Eternal \n&gt; Divine Beings are outside of our human perception. The=\r\ny only allow us to \n&gt; know about Themselves what They wish to. For me there=\r\n is a difference \n&gt; between a yogi and devotee.  A devotee rises due to Gra=\r\nce of Divine \n&gt; Mother or their Ishtdav. where as a yogi rises after a lot =\r\nof huff and \n&gt; fuff, and they get stuck everywhere. I am sure there are onl=\r\ny devotee in \n&gt; this group. They may be doing haven or japa or other devoti=\r\nonal work.\n&gt; So nobody should feel any sort of fear or pressure even for on=\r\ne second \n&gt; because there is no such hocus pocus zone to cross and there is=\r\n Grace of \n&gt; Divine Mother on all Her children.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Disclaimer---- My thinking is very different due to Darshan and =\r\nGrace of \n&gt; Divine Mother & Divine Lord.

Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters o=\r\nf \n&gt; judgement is to objectively see what changes are happening in our \n&gt; s=\r\nurface, day-to-day consciousness.That is are we less angry, more \n&gt; equanim=\r\nous, etc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc e=\r\ntc - is VAST. \n&gt; Some of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a =\r\ncomplex study \n&gt; in itself. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth =\r\ntrying to \n&gt; analyse and understand these things properly, but some pattern=\r\n is \n&gt; observable.  Not all experiences are what they seem to be. Many yogi=\r\ns \n&gt; have lost themselves in this jungle of experiences, not being able to =\r\n\n&gt; adequately determine which is genuine and which is non-genuine. This is =\r\n\n&gt; the world of astral  plane, driven by the overlapping shealths of \n&gt; pra=\r\nnamayakosha and parts of manomayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik \n&gt; term=\r\ninology, the areas rules by the overlapping influence (overlapping \n&gt; and n=\r\not discreet) of swadhisthana to anahata. Everything  is possible \n&gt; here. E=\r\nvery higher deity has a corresponding lesser manifestation in \n&gt; this realm=\r\n, but limited in ability. Similarly there are endless beings \n&gt; of varies c=\r\nharacter and hue who can very easily create an expereince for \n&gt; a sadhaka =\r\nto delude him/her off the path. They can even fake an \n&gt; experience/aura of=\r\n a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take hold of a \n&gt; seeker and use him=\r\n/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide world, \n&gt; the lower extreme =\r\nof which causes, in a normal human being, a cementing \n&gt; of a surface ego d=\r\nriven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal \n&gt; sub-conscious ambitions,=\r\n jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but \n&gt; lust suppressed) etc etc an=\r\nd at the other extreme this layer can, if \n&gt; properly  channalized as is do=\r\nne in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make \n&gt; one experience Divine Ananda =\r\nand manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an \n&gt; unfailing guide to the path.\n&gt; \n&gt; In=\r\n a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only to the \n&gt; ex=\r\ntent that it helps to modify and transform your waking surface \n&gt; personali=\r\nty. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of \n&gt; experiences that c=\r\nome from this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get \n&gt; experiences ONLY from t=\r\nhis realm, are just sound and fury without \n&gt; substance.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the writin=\r\ngs of Sri Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, \n&gt; which has destro=\r\nyed innumerable yogis who have got swept away by the \n&gt; light and sound of =\r\nthis realm. One sure-shot way to cross this realm, \n&gt; and all sadhakas will=\r\n have to cross this some day, is to hang on tightly \n&gt; to the fundamentals.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;   Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddha=\r\nyah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: ved=\r\nic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Tue=\r\nsday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: A thought\n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n  Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!
