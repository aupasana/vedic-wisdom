T=\r\nhey are `moustache ladies&#39;.There are some\nsanyasins (monks) who repeat: &quot;SH=\r\nIVOHAM SHIVOHAM&quot; (&quot;I am Siva&quot;) - but they\ntremble with fear when they are p=\r\nut to a little test. They perspire and\nquiver when there is any impending d=\r\nanger!\n\nThey are poor, miserable specimens. I always say that a dacoit can =\r\nbecome a\ngood Vedantin if his energy is turned in a spiritual direction, be=\r\ncause he\nis absolutely fearless and has no deha adhyasa, (feeling &quot;I am the=\r\n body&quot;);\nbut not a timid man.\n\nFearlessness is the greatest qualification f=\r\nor a spiritual aspirant.
