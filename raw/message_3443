I see that\n&gt; &gt; your signature changed after the t=\r\nrip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We had a remarkable time at Varanasi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The mome=\r\nnt our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actually quite\n&gt; &gt; outsi=\r\nde the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something in here which\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After checking in at the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watching the eveni=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By 9 PM Manish decided on doin=\r\ng a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika\n&gt; &gt; samshan, on a funeral pyre. =\r\nSadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that\n&gt; &gt; many great sadhakas in Hi=\r\nnduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; used to perform variou=\r\ns sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great\n&gt; &gt; siddha - spent mos=\r\nt of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing\n&gt; &gt; sadhana. The effect tha=\r\nt a Samshan has on the human consciousness can be\n&gt; &gt; apty used, for those =\r\nwho have such inclination, to further ones spiritual\n&gt; &gt; growth. The fire o=\r\nf a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form\n&gt; &gt; of fire unlike=\r\n the fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been\n&gt; &gt; sadhakas, a=\r\nnd many in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform\n&gt; &gt; homas. They=\r\n chose not to make a distinction between pure and impure.If\n&gt; &gt; someone fee=\r\nls that a funeral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off\n&gt; &gt; not t=\r\nrying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Mahakala and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahakali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  We went to buy some samagri - ti=\r\nl (black and white), couple of full\n&gt; &gt; coconuts, flowers, incense stick (a=\r\ngabatti),  kismis, havan samagri. While\n&gt; &gt; buying the samagri from a shop =\r\ninside a lane near the Vishwanath temple,\n&gt; &gt; suddenly a small begger child=\r\n came and kept asking for food. There was a\n&gt; &gt; sweet shop on the other sid=\r\ne of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for\n&gt; &gt; food. Manish turned ar=\r\nound, bought some food and gave it to the child. The\n&gt; &gt; child was eating w=\r\nhen we turned back towards the shop from where we were\n&gt; &gt; buying the samag=\r\nri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I\n&gt; &gt; turned round =\r\nand found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no\n&gt; &gt; child any=\r\nwhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very\n&gt; &gt; clearly. Ma=\r\nnish smiled and said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see\n&gt; &gt; whether w=\r\ne had become so big sadhakas that we are unable to feed a hungry\n&gt; &gt; child =\r\n. That is how God comes to test people. Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha\n&gt; &gt; aur =\r\nkis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, d=\r\nressed in a combination of red and\n&gt; &gt; black. Walking along the ghats we re=\r\nached the samshan at around eleven\n&gt; &gt; thirty. It was quite crowded, with d=\r\nomes (people who work there to help the\n&gt; &gt; bodies burn) and the relatives.=\r\n There were at least 8 to 10 pyres burning\n&gt; &gt; simultaneously. Right next t=\r\no it was the Ganges, pitch black at night. We\n&gt; &gt; sat on a stairs, waiting =\r\nfor the crowd to ease out a bit, not sure when that\n&gt; &gt; will happen, not su=\r\nre how people are going to react. As we sat observing,\n&gt; &gt; the people too w=\r\nere observing us with a mix of curiosity and\n&gt; &gt; possible apprehension. Sud=\r\ndenly Manish closed his eyes and meditated some\n&gt; &gt; time, then remarked tha=\r\nt this place has a tremendous energy. Something of\n&gt; &gt; almost infinite abil=\r\nities resides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While\n&gt; &gt; sayingf so he turn=\r\ned behind to look at something, I too turned. I could see\n&gt; &gt; nothing but b=\r\nlank space. But that very instant the dogs in the samshan went\n&gt; &gt; running =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; After waiting like this for about an h=\r\nour, we found a pyre where the\n&gt; &gt; relatives had left.The major portion had=\r\n been burnt already, but there was\n&gt; &gt; enough left to last for some time st=\r\nill. We went and sat next to it. Manish\n&gt; &gt; started the homa. The offering =\r\nwas of til. I sat next to him doing the\n&gt; &gt; Chandi path, trying to be in sy=\r\nnc with his recital. A part of my mind was\n&gt; &gt; also trying to adjust itself=\r\n to the ambience. There were quite a few people\n&gt; &gt; around watching what we=\r\n were upto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to\n&gt; &gt; come and take wood fr=\r\nom the pyre to light other pyres. He did it in the most\n&gt; &gt; cautious manner=\r\n possible, taking pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After\n&gt; &gt; some time M=\r\nanish indicated to him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded\n&gt; &gt; his h=\r\nead and did not disturb that pyre again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very soon, within half=\r\n an hour I noticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had come\n&gt; &gt; and were sitting ar=\r\nound the pyre on which the homa was being done. As I read\n&gt; &gt; the Chandi I =\r\nfelt a great pressure on my head, from all sides. As if a\n&gt; &gt; something was=\r\n pressing hard on my skull, gripping it tight. The\n&gt; &gt; concentration become=\r\n excellent. I soon forgot who was watching us or\n&gt; &gt; anything else around m=\r\ne, except for the sound of the Chandi Path. Very nice\n&gt; &gt; meditation happen=\r\ned. The mind felt like as if it was a piece of iron and\n&gt; &gt; there was a huu=\r\nuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the mind away to\n&gt; &gt; some distan=\r\nt place, far, far away from the reality I am normally accustomed\n&gt; &gt; to. Wh=\r\nile the homa was on, suddenly one black dog from the pack which was\n&gt; &gt; sit=\r\nting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at Manish. For I think\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in an angular fashio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not an animal but =\r\na human\n&gt; &gt; being\n&gt; &gt; &gt; watching. Just staring and observing every action. =\r\nManish said Kala\n&gt; &gt; Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as =\r\nwell\n&gt; &gt; as in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled =\r\na few\n&gt; &gt; notches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Simply being in a samshan and observing the human body burning up has a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones o=\r\nf a\n&gt; &gt; female human body burning. Both the femurs were visible and spread =\r\napart. In\n&gt; &gt; an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman =\r\nwith &quot;legs\n&gt; &gt; spread apart&quot; which has a very sexual connotation. In Manika=\r\nrnik, on that\n&gt; &gt; night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually the bod=\r\ny is merely a\n&gt; &gt; covering for something far more real and powerful that re=\r\nsides inside. The\n&gt; &gt; skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are ment t=\r\no perish. Only Rama\n&gt; &gt; naam satya hai.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manish said if your int=\r\nentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely to\n&gt; &gt; please God through sa=\r\ndhanas - i.e you are not planning something negative\n&gt; &gt; nor desirous of pe=\r\ntty mundane gains - there is very little chance that you\n&gt; &gt; will ever come=\r\n to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no ethereal\n&gt; &gt; beings will d=\r\nisturb you because no one wants to mess with someone who is\n&gt; &gt; worshipping=\r\n Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be\n&gt; &gt; unnecessarily sca=\r\nred of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will\n&gt; &gt; you bother the=\r\nm nor will they bother you.  Surrendering to the deity is very\n&gt; &gt; good att=\r\nitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning py=\r\nre.That\n&gt; &gt; night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did hom=\r\nas at\n&gt; &gt; Manikarnik.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...t=\r\no be continued...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nINTERNET now has a personality.
