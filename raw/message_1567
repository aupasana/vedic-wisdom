You c=\r\nan take any mantra of Rama and keep chanting it as many times as you can ev=\r\neryday. Some people read Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana or Tulsidas&#39;s Ram Charit Manas.=\r\n If you know no mantra of Rama, his amrita mantra (&quot;Sree Raama Raama Raama&quot;=\r\n) can be tried. It is a powerful mantra. His dwadasakshari is &quot;Om namo bhag=\r\navate Raamachandraaya&quot;. Actually, just repeating &quot;Sree Raama&quot; or even just =\r\n&quot;Raama&quot; is powerful.\n \nThe key is to do it with as much focus of mind as po=\r\nssible, keep the body steady and free from motion (as much as possible), ke=\r\nep the eyes closed, do the chanting mentally, keep the back and neck straig=\r\nht and maintain brahmacharya if possible.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n \n---- utpal patha=\r\nk &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Hiral,\n&gt; \n&gt; Suggetions are\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Chandi Homa / MahaLakshmi Homa\n&gt; or\n&gt; Chandi Paath\n&gt; \n&gt; -Fasting depends =\r\nupon your own liking/capacity but may not be that important. importantly to=\r\n eat home food and saatwik food (Lighter, Fresh, without much oil, spice)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; -No Non Veg, Avoid or moderate Onion, Garlic, No Alcohole and such stuf=\r\nf\n&gt; \n&gt; -Brahmacharya\n&gt; \n&gt; Jay Mataji\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, Hiral Desai &lt;hdesai_wakhlu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar to all =\r\nmembers,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Please advise on the type of Sadhanas that one can =\r\nduring Chaitra Navratri beginning from tomorrow.
