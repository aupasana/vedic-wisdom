It is also said  that creation is undertaken by Brahma with the help of the vibrations of the Veda Mantras or primordial sound.  Sound vibrations are capable of creation, preservation and destruction.  This has been proved  in such ordinary matters as growth of plants. \n \nNow, how does it happen that a saintly person is able to cure a disease of a person by chanting any particular mantra which we all can also chant but we find it ineffective when chanted by us?  Obviously because he has greater power of concentration and invoking the vibrations  in the proper manner.  That is why any Veda   mantra should be chanted in its purity without change of words and tone.   Only then can result be obtained  . Mantras are revelation to the Rishis who performed Tapas. They are  the Rishis to whom the mantras are said to belong. The Rishis brought forth the mantras for the benefit of the world and they did not create them.  Rishis are the MANTRA DRASHTAS ie., the MANTRA SEERS and not Mantra composers.   Even so, they have rendered a great service to mankind by bringing to its ken   what was already in existence but not known.  No praise is too high for the Rishis who have vouchsafed to us the mantras which were beyond our grasp. Thus\n the Mantras belong to the Maharishis who first came to know the Vedas. \n \nWe hear as well as utter different sounds. By the vibration of each nerve centre, a certain emotion is created in the mind. Some create passions , some laziness, and some others unhappiness.  Putting it differently,when one is in passion certain nerve  vibrations occurs and similarly when one is in anger. Yoga uses breath control (Pranayama) as the chief instrument in the control of  the mind.  Similarly, Mantra Yoga is another path. When we utter a word,the life breath is allowed to pass through the gaps in the throat, tongue,lips etc. Only then the sound of the word emantes and becomes audible. Vibrations are caused to the nerve centres situated in these areas through which breath passes to produce the sound of the word.   Veda Mantras properly recited with the proper discipline produce the necessary emotions in the mind which ensure well-being to the person reciting as well as to the world.   Other baser emotions are also kept out in the process.\n Samasta Jivah Sukhino Bhavantu.Samasta Lokah Sukhino Bhavantu.
