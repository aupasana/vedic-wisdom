Refreshing phr=\r\nase.  Too good. It seems a season of debating.\nBranches of threads are comi=\r\nng out.\n\n&#39;Kamini and `Kanchan&#39; was the exact words which Ramakrishna used\nf=\r\nreely during his life time. Now Kamini means a woman and its possible\nthat =\r\nseveral sections would have taken reservation at this. That seems\nvery obvi=\r\nous otherwise why Swami Sardananda required to defend Thakur in\nhis book ca=\r\nlled Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga. It seemed to me that\nParamahansa Yogananda a=\r\nlso have referred to this issue without\nmentioning Thakur&#39;s name directly (=\r\nI may be wrong but i strongly felt\nlike that when i read the &#39;Autobiography=\r\n of a yogi&#39; some 4/5 years\nback). Sardanada in a sense did &#39;Back engineerin=\r\ng job to bail out :)&#39; .\nIf we go by &#39;Kamini&#39; word literaly, then Thakur cou=\r\nld be portrayed as\nWomen basher.  but we all know that Thakur refffered to =\r\nLust and Desire\nof worldly objects whenever he spoke those two words. Jumpi=\r\nng on\nconclusion without properly studying/thinking about Thakur&#39;s life, ju=\r\nst\non literal meaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.\n\nSame way=\r\n, I also thought about Sant Tulasi das ji. I was telling myself\nthat can a =\r\nsaint of his devotion and poetic skills and add to that\nsteadfastly devoted=\r\n to Lord Rama (Who never shown slightest dis-resepct\nto  women) , utter suc=\r\nh words and saggrigate &#39;Nari&#39; for nothing. I was\nnot convinced.  One of the=\r\n &#39;Dohas&#39; of Tulasi Das goes like this -\n\n[Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur P=\r\nar-stri Matusamaan|\n\nInase agar prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||\n\n(I=\r\n have given this doha out of memory and its quite possible that first\ntwo w=\r\nrods are wrong in the doha)\n\nIf a poet is asking to look at a woman as a Mo=\r\nther, how could he mean\n&#39;Nari&#39; to be &#39;Tadan Adhikari&#39;? As you pointed out, =\r\n on a look at surface\n(at the levelof text), it means which many belives bu=\r\nt you and me need\nto look at little deeper. A person who did the world of G=\r\nood to Indias\nordinary masses by rewriting the whole Ramayana in a language=\r\n which\npeople (from north) could easily understand, The man who gave immort=\r\nal\n&#39;Hanumaan Chalisa&#39; can not be lebeled so casually as &#39;Nari basher&#39; or\n&#39;S=\r\nhudra Hater&#39; (As Mayaavati brand poticians would capitalise).\n\nRegarding yo=\r\nur questions of why Pashu are only Nari and not Nara....\n\nI think he was re=\r\nffering to  Men with the words Ganvaar and Shudra and\nPashu Nari must be a =\r\njoint statement. Again as you already know, Shudra\nwas not B.C., OBC, KBC, =\r\nHSBC etc.. :-). but a fallen man, a mean\nthinking man. I have to agree if y=\r\nou say that Ganvaar and Shudra can\nalso be said about Woaman however lookin=\r\ng at the Doha and general\nprevailing conditions of society, it seems that h=\r\ne used those words for\nMen.\n\nGrammar...Hmmmm. i don&#39;t know if he has really=\r\n used proper grammer in\nsuch Dohas.\n\nThere are verse in Bhagvad Gita which =\r\ncan be criticised by people from\nother faiths if they are taken literaly an=\r\nd without understanding\npersonality of Krishna.\n\n***\n\nRegarding Ramachandra=\r\n, Thank you for making clear, your notable friend&#39;s\nview and your detailed =\r\nexplanation by giving examples.  But again i\ndon&#39;t think that to consider R=\r\nama as God will actually be blockage\nin leading life like him and that too =\r\nwhen almost everybody in Sanatan\nDharma knows him as God. Tthat is not reve=\r\nrsible in any case. And above\nall, Incarnation of Lord Vishnu - He is a GOD=\r\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nYou and I&#39;ve notably common Astrological factors in our chart.\nAst=\r\nrologer in me found out just few days back but I&#39;ll not give it\nhear for th=\r\ne obvious reason lest our own Mr. Narasimha should get mad at\nme.\n\nWarm Reg=\r\nards,\n\nUtpal\n\nPS: I am writing every reference from my memory so please cor=\r\nrect me\nwhen I am wrong in giving any reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; I do not think that Saint like &#39;Tulasi Das&#39; would ever be so hard on\n=\r\nwomen.\n&gt; The actual poem is like this:\n&gt; || Dhol Ganwaar Shudra Pashu Naari=\r\n, Yah sab Taadan ke adhikari ||\n&gt; Some years back, i read an explanation th=\r\nat Tulasi Das ji meant &quot;Pashu\nNaari&quot; and NOT pashu and Naari.

The highlighting\nis done by you, not in the actual tex=\r\nt. If he ment pashu-nari he should\nhave used some basic grammer to remove c=\r\nonfusion. He did not. At the\nlevel of text, it is indefensible. Also, if I =\r\ngo by your explanation,\nwhy only Naari who are pashu, why not Naras who are=\r\n like pashus? There\nare more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the worl=\r\nd.=C2 This\nexplanation=C2  that you found looks more like a back engineerin=\r\ng job\nto bail out.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Regarding Rama self realization, I think I=\r\n was unable to express the\nideas of my friend clearly. Let me try again. He=\r\n is not really saying\nthat Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he =\r\nquite agrees that\nSri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his=\r\n opinion)=C2\nGod did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He =\r\ndescended\nin order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+=\r\nayana.\nA path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of\nprinciples=\r\n.=C2  Compare this to the name of the other great epic,\nMahabharata, which =\r\nwas not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot;. One cannot follow\nKrishna&#39;s path.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Wh=\r\nenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our\nsubcsious m=\r\nind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper\nand the worship=\r\nped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama\ndid. BUt if we try=\r\n to look at it like the story of a great king, a nobel\nman, a devoted husba=\r\nnd etc, we have a better chance of following such a\nlife.\n&gt; An ordinary man=\r\n cannot lead the life of a God but he can follow the\nlife of a great man.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; Similarly, even today lot of people advise that one should try to\nbe=\r\ncome like Vivekananda, or that this country needs its youth to be like\nVive=\r\nkanadas in teh future. It does not mean Vivekanada was not a self\nrealized=\r\n=C2 saint of highest calibre, but his life&#39;s image is like=C2\none who=C2 li=\r\nved like a lion among sheep of ordinary=C2 men, fearless\nand uncompromising=\r\n and principled. If every=C2 person would constantly\nthink that Vivekanada =\r\nwas a saint=C2 who worked by the pwoer of a deity\nor due to his extreme spi=\r\nrituality or the blessing of a great guru,=C2\nno one will ever make an atte=\r\nmpt to be inspired by him or=C2 emulate\nhis way of living.Vivekanada was a =\r\nspiritual giant, but=C2 the image he\nprojected was one of a tireless, fearl=\r\ness KarmaYogi. THAT can inspire\npeople.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2 On the other hand=C2 yo=\r\nu will never hear anyone advising that\none should try to lead a life like R=\r\namarkishna.=C2 =C2 That is\nimpossible. He=C2  was God incarnate leading a c=\r\nharmed life.=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Similar is the case with the Avatar called Sri=C2 R=\r\namachandra\nincomparison to Sri Krishna. One can become Rama in actions but =\r\none can\nnever=C2 become Krishna. Therefore, my friend believes, one should =\r\nnot\nconsider Rama as a God to be worshipped, but as a model to be followed.=\r\n\nLike Vivekanada.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Hope I have put forth=C2 his idea clear.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\n-Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Tu=\r\ne, 15/12/09, vedic_pathak vedic_pathak@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: vedic_pathak =\r\nvedic_pathak@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Veg Vs.

It is understandable\nif he says Rama is an ideal=\r\n man but hard to believe that such a great\nperson claims Rama is not God. T=\r\nempted to ask him what really is the\ndefinition of God which differentiates=\r\n Rama from Krishna?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some months back I had a very lengthy, verbose =\r\nand charged/heated\ndebate with him on whether Sri Rama is God or not. Mind =\r\nyou, these are\nall theoritical/ theological debates - nothing to do with ac=\r\ntual\nspirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I was getting\nagit=\r\nated and it would have affected our friendship.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; Whenever =\r\nhis opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that\nwhat he can sup=\r\nport using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses\nspirituality with =\r\nanyone per se. He will discuss and debate scriptures\nusing exact quotations=\r\n etc, (theology)=C3=82=C2 but not about mysticism or\nsadhana or anything wh=\r\nich=C3=82=C2 needs a belief system. That is why most\npeople know him only a=\r\ns a very rational, massively knowledgeable and\nuncorruptable=C3=82=C2 human=\r\n being.=C3=82=C2 =C3=82=C2 They have no clue about\nhis meditations or anyth=\r\ning. He never projects himself as spiritual and\ngenerally would not discuss=\r\n God in public.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; Therefore our discussion was also on thos=\r\ne aspects which can be\nproved or disproved theologically=C3=82=C2 - 1) Is R=\r\nama a God as per\nValmiki Ramayana=C3=82=C2  2) Is it wrong if people consid=\r\ner him as\nGod=C3=82=C2 .. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidas=\r\nji.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; 1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;=\r\nno&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; 2) To the second question he says it cannot be debat=\r\ned from a\nspiritual point if it is right or wrong=C3=82=C2 - but his person=\r\nal\nopinion is that one should try to follow the way of life shown by Sri\nRa=\r\nma rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all\ndivine=\r\n weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a\nblink of a=\r\nn eye, right from the place where he was=C3=82=C2 located when\nhe first hea=\r\nrd the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and\ninstead chose t=\r\nhe hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as\nper my friend, it i=\r\ns more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to\nworship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a\nhodge=\r\npodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An\nauthor&#39;s=\r\n paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but\na critics =\r\nnightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women\nwith animals =\r\nor something similar. He believes that was introduces in\nthe text because T=\r\nulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust.\nTherefore, he ended up com=\r\nposing a sentence derogatory to women.\nFurther, he argues that if Sri Rama =\r\nis worshipped as God, then the\npurpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Ra=\r\nma was there to explain idea\nway of life. Krishna was there to be worshippe=\r\nd because Krishna was\nmaximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be =\r\nmore God than\nKrishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; One request, if you can speak t=\r\no him about his thought on Food\nhabits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n have been out of touch with him since August, been busy myself.\nBut will a=\r\nsk him.

Since that day, he bought\nhimself two thick fat dictiona=\r\nries, one English, one Hindi and for ten\nyears every day he spend one hour =\r\nreading the\n&gt; English dictionary and\n&gt; &gt; one hour reading the Hindi diction=\r\nary apart from reading=C3=82=C2 up\nvolumes of Hindi and English literature.=\r\n=C3=82=C2 When I asked him why, he\njust said it is because he wanted to be=\r\n=C3=82=C2 equally adept at both the\nlanguages so that one day he can take a=\r\n really detached view to judge\nthe truth about=C3=82=C2 which is more compr=\r\nehensive language! As I said,\nhe has an uncompromising attitude when it com=\r\nes to finding out the truth\nabout anything. By education, he is a Phd is ma=\r\nthematics. He has worked\nin different fields, from banking to education to =\r\njournalism. He did not\nlast for long in most places. He speaks and writes f=\r\nluently, English,\nBengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. =\r\nNow he is\nlearning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above languages. Wh=\r\nen he\nwas in college, he considered himself an atheist. While applying for =\r\na\njob he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When the clerk\nw=\r\nho was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space,\n&gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; my f=\r\nriend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;.\nSeeing this, m=\r\ny friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore it up\nright there. Becau=\r\nse, he considered himself an atheist and writing Hindu\nin the form would ha=\r\nve been a lie.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am=\r\n speaking of. All his\nfriends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyug=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some ur=\r\ngent meeting.\nHis way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passi=\r\nng by\nin=C3=82=C2 his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into t=\r\nhe\ntemple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple,\nbu=\r\nt he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his\nwatch=\r\n it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time\nwent. W=\r\nhen he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the\ntemple sat d=\r\nown and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any\nmovement. The =\r\npriest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend\nhad no idea why th=\r\nis happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in\ndeep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; Then he started meditating at home, and it was there=C3=82=C2 that =\r\nhe\ngot visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact\nmos=\r\nt people who know him also do not know these things. But once he was\nin sam=\r\nadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the\nexact same p=\r\nlace and same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=82=C2  Only\nhis wife and=\r\n close relatives know about this incident. I believe\nnowadays when ever he =\r\nsits for meditation he often enters the state of\nSamadhi. When someone aske=\r\nd him how he felt during samadhi, he just said\nit feels as if the whole uni=\r\nverse orginates from me. I am the sun, the\nmoon, the stars, the planets, th=\r\ne animals, men, women, children, the\nwind, the water, the space, smaller th=\r\nan the atom and bigger than\neverything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=\r\n=C3=82=C2 He considers Sri\nKrishna to be God and=C3=82=C2 Lord Rama to be t=\r\nhe ideal man.That is why\nhe does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he t=\r\nhinks it elevated\n&gt; Sri=C3=82=C2 Rama to the\n&gt; &gt; level of a God whereas the=\r\n aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was\nto show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=\r\n=C3=82=C2 not a God.The difference he\nsays is that, an ideal man is someone=\r\n who can be emulated, an ordinary\nman can and should aim to become like the=\r\n ideal. But a God cannot be\nemulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Kri=\r\nshna, but one=C3=82=C2 can\ntry to lead his life like Rama. I have argued wi=\r\nth him over this, but I\nam merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a=\r\n Guru - a human guru\nat least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus t=\r\nhese days.\nNeedless to say, he is not an atheist any more.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Later he had once=C3=82=C2 mentioned he knew the relation he had with\nall=\r\n the people around him in his past lives. His mother he says, was his\ndaugh=\r\nter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot of time on\ndifferent int=\r\nernet forums interacting with people, specially=C3=82=C2 with\nthose in=C3=\r\n=82=C2 the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and\neverything with t=\r\nhem, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion,\netc etc. His idea is=\r\n to impart right knowledge to young people who will\nbe the future of this c=\r\nountry.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; He is am omnivorous person. Like any other Bengal=\r\ni, eats fish, meat\netc.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; I shall refrain from mentioning h=\r\nis name because I had not asked his\npermission before mentioning him.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PS: I would not l=\r\nike this mail to be considered as a part of the\ndebate.

Let me try again. He is not reall=\r\ny saying that Sri Rama was not a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees =\r\nthat Sri Rama was an Avatar of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C2&=\r\nnbsp;God did not descend as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descende=\r\nd in order to lead by example. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A=\r\n path that an ordinary man can and should follow. One of principles.=C2&nbs=\r\np; Compare this to the name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was=\r\n not named &quot;Krishna+ayana&quot;. One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whenever, according to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama,=\r\n our subcsious mind will create a blockage, a divide between the worshipper=\r\n and the worshipped and thus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama di=\r\nd.

Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of God which di=\r\nfferentiates Rama from Krishna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some months back=\r\n I had a very lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whethe=\r\nr Sri Rama is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theological =\r\ndebates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the de=\r\nbate because I was getting agitated and it would have affected our friendsh=\r\nip. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Whenever his opinion is aske=\r\nd on anything, he will only mention that what he can support using logic. T=\r\nherefore he never generally discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He w=\r\nill discuss and debate scriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)=C3=\r\n=82=C2&nbsp;but not about mysticism or sadhana or anything which=C3=82=C2&n=\r\nbsp;needs a belief system.

He never projects himself as spiritual and generally would not d=\r\niscuss God in public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Therefore o=\r\nur discussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved th=\r\neologically=C3=82=C2&nbsp;- 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana=C3=82=\r\n=C2&nbsp; 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C3=82=C2&nbsp;.. 3) =\r\nThe merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1) To the first question, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) To the second question he say=\r\ns it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is right or wrong=C3=82=\r\n=C2&nbsp;- but his personal opinion is that one should try to follow the wa=\r\ny of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama =\r\nhad mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his w=\r\nhole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he was=C3=82=C2&=\r\nnbsp;located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did=\r\n not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human =\r\nway. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than=\r\n to worship Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3) He considers=\r\n the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and =\r\nstyles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many r=\r\nules of composition has been flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there =\r\nis a line in there which equates women with animals or something similar. H=\r\ne believes that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem =\r\ncontrolling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derog=\r\natory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, t=\r\nhen the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain=\r\n idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was m=\r\naximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna w=\r\nas on this plane, so he thinks.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe above are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One request, if you can speak to him abou=\r\nt his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be great.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have been out of touch with him since August, been busy myse=\r\nlf. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will respond.

What first attracted me to=C3=82=C2&nbsp; t=\r\nowards him was his impeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C3=82=C2&nbs=\r\np;when it comes to=C3=82=C2&nbsp;honestly.=C3=82=C2&nbsp;If someone were to=\r\n put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a simple, harmless=C3=82=C2&=\r\nnbsp;lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it. Therefore he nev=\r\ner jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C3=82=C2&nbsp;spoken e=\r\nven a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school=\r\n, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, =\r\nhe believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is more compre=\r\nhensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since th=\r\nat day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hind=\r\ni and for ten years every day he spend one hour reading the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; English=\r\n dictionary and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart fr=\r\nom reading=C3=82=C2&nbsp;up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=82=\r\n=C2&nbsp;When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to be=\r\n=C3=82=C2&nbsp;equally adept at both the languages so that one day he can t=\r\nake a really detached view to judge the truth about=C3=82=C2&nbsp;which is =\r\nmore comprehensive language! As I said, he has an uncompromising attitude w=\r\nhen it comes to finding out the truth about anything. By education, he is a=\r\n Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different fields, from banking to edu=\r\ncation to journalism. He did not last for long in most places. He speaks an=\r\nd writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian=\r\n, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes poetry in all the above lan=\r\nguages. When he was in college, he considered himself an atheist. While app=\r\nlying for a job he had kept the place makered for religion as blank. When t=\r\nhe clerk who was supposed to take the forms saw that blank space,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; h=\r\ne asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the clerk wrot=\r\ne &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk and tore=\r\n it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and writing H=\r\nindu in the form would have been a lie. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his fri=\r\nends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to office for some urg=\r\nent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passin=\r\ng by in=C3=82=C2&nbsp;his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go in=\r\nto the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the temple=\r\n, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees his w=\r\natch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time wen=\r\nt. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temple s=\r\nat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any movement. =\r\nThe priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no idea wh=\r\ny this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Then he started meditating at home, and =\r\nit was there=C3=82=C2&nbsp;that he got visions etc of Krishna. He does not =\r\nsay much about these, infact most people who know him also do not know thes=\r\ne things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours, not moving from his medi=\r\ntation seat, in the exact same place and same position for 3 days continuou=\r\nsly.=C3=82=C2&nbsp; Only his wife and close relatives know about this incid=\r\nent. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation he often enters th=\r\ne state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he j=\r\nust said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun,=\r\n the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women, children, the w=\r\nind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigger than everything=\r\n. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C3=82=C2&nbsp;He considers Sri Krishna =\r\nto be God and=C3=82=C2&nbsp;Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he do=\r\nes not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it elevated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri=\r\n=C3=82=C2&nbsp;Rama to the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; level of a God whereas the aim of t=\r\nhe orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=82=C2&=\r\nnbsp;not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man is someone who =\r\ncan be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to become like the idea=\r\nl. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna,=\r\n but one=C3=82=C2&nbsp;can try to lead his life like Rama. I have argued wi=\r\nth him over this, but I am merely stating his idea. Also he does not have a=\r\n Guru - a human guru at least, and advises people to not trust most Gurus t=\r\nhese days. Needless to say, he is not an atheist any more.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Later he had once=C3=82=C2&nbsp;mentioned he knew=\r\n the relation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His =\r\nmother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a=\r\n lot of time on different internet forums interacting with people, speciall=\r\ny=C3=82=C2&nbsp;with those in=C3=82=C2&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, disc=\r\nussing anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian hi=\r\nstory, religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young pe=\r\nople who will be the future of this country.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; He is am omnivorous person.

Somebody is inflicting gruesome=C3=82=C2&nbsp; pain and misery on animals=\r\n and birds on his behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is experiencin=\r\ng all these exotic=C3=82=C2&nbsp; visions, But no feeling of kindness towar=\r\nds birds and animals.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Where did I go wrong? Simp=\r\nle dal/roti and do not even touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi?=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When we get burnt, we need to be careful.Many =\r\nyears ago I saw in a book/article=C3=82=C2&nbsp; about Dayamata who succede=\r\nd=C3=82=C2&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she went to India and told a Spi=\r\nritual Master that her progress has stopped. Master said, you are eating eg=\r\ngs which she admitted that she was doing=C3=82=C2&nbsp; secretly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This is very complex world. No outright solutions for so =\r\nmany difficult questions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originated in mid=\r\ndle east are fighting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, from whic=\r\nh part of Spiritual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also enemies the=\r\nre?? Their Gods said in their holy books that animals are their food. So th=\r\ney cannot even think about souls in animals or their pain and emotions.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Then I have read stories about several people, who =\r\nfollow these faiths and are non-veg and how they exexperience=C3=82=C2&nbsp=\r\n; spiritual highs and other such phenomena. It is so difficult to comprehen=\r\nd.=C3=82=C2&nbsp; Would they remain in the cycle of b/d=C3=82=C2&nbsp; till=\r\n they learn about kindness???&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; LaxmiNarayan&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Sat, 12/12/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in=\r\n&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.
