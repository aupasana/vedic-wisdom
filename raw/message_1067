I can pronou=\r\nnce Va with &#39;a&#39; as a trailing \nsound. what i didn&#39;t understand is that why =\r\ni&#39;ll need to pronaunce as \nVaa (&#39;aa&#39; as trailing sound). I mean i can prono=\r\nunce &#39;Shava&#39; \ncomfortably. i don&#39;t end up pronouncing it &#39;v&#39;. in that case =\r\nwhy i \nshould make it Vaa sound?\n\nWhen is say Raam (Raama), i pronounce &#39;M&#39;=\r\n with trailing sound of &#39;a&#39; \nso the sound of &#39;M&#39; is not abruptly ending but=\r\n it is completeing with \nsound of &#39;a&#39;.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; The mispronunciation of consonants with &quot;a&quot; occurring at=\r\n the end of \nwords is \n&gt; so ingrained in your common sense that your unders=\r\ntanding of \nDevanagari \n&gt; script itself is filled with mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Look =\r\nat the enclosed picture (devanagari.jpg). It has six words - \nshava, \n&gt; vas=\r\nha, shav, vash, shiva and shiv. Each word is written in \nDevanagari script =\r\n\n&gt; and then in English.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though the first word in that picture is &quot;shav=\r\na&quot;, YOU will \npronounce it as \n&gt; &quot;shav&quot;. Please note that the second symbol=\r\n in &quot;shava&quot; is identical \nto the \n&gt; first symbol in &quot;vasha&quot;. However, YOU e=\r\nnd up pronouncing that \nsymbol as &quot;v&quot; \n&gt; in the first word and as &quot;va&quot; in t=\r\nhe second word. You pronounce the \nsame \n&gt; symbol as &quot;va&quot; in some cases and=\r\n as &quot;v&quot; in some cases. But please \nnote that \n&gt; Sanskrit is not like Englis=\r\nh and each symbol has a unique \npronunciation. If \n&gt; you pronounce correctl=\r\ny, that symbol is pronounced identically \n(as &quot;va&quot;) in \n&gt; both words. If yo=\r\nu really want it to be &quot;v&quot; (without a), it should \nbe \n&gt; written differentl=\r\ny (as at the end of 3rd and 6th words in the \npicture).\n&gt; \n&gt; Please go thro=\r\nugh the six examples carefully to know how to write \nthings in \n&gt; Devanagar=\r\ni correctly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline: Things like &quot;Raam&quot; or &quot;Shiv Uvaach&quot; are wrong=\r\n and mean \nnothing \n&gt; in Sanskrit. The Arabic influence on some modern Indi=\r\nan languages \n(e.g. \n&gt; Hindi) that use the same script as Sanskrit corrupte=\r\nd people &#39;s \n&gt; pronunciation of Sanskrit. What are pronounced by people as =\r\n&quot;Raam&quot; \nand &quot;Shiv \n&gt; Uvaach&quot; should actually be &quot;Raama&quot; and &quot;Shiva Uvaacha&quot;=\r\n. South \nIndians have \n&gt; their own corruptions, but this is a place where s=\r\nouth Indians are \ncorrect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 29, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt; Sub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kuja (Mars) homam manual available now\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; R=\r\nao Garu!!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was always thinking that it is due to South Indian Acc=\r\nent, \npeople\n&gt; &gt; of that part of india say Raama instead of Raam.

So you may do either.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However, some combinations tried by=\r\n others successfully in the \npast\n&gt; &gt; are better and faster.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rega=\r\nrding the specific mantra below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (or &quot;jai&quot;) =\r\nhave no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be &quot;raama&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;jaya&quot; respecti=\r\nvely. Arabic has words mostly ending in \nconsonants\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; =\r\nat the end of the word). That Arabic influence\n&gt; &gt; made Indians change Sans=\r\nkrit words to remove &quot;a&quot; at the end of\n&gt; &gt; words. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay=\r\n Raam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, ple=\r\nase\n&gt; &gt; restore &quot;a&quot; at the end of words. The correct version of the mantra\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; is &quot;Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at \nthe\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; beginning.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On our India trip in t=\r\nhe summer of 2008, I and my guru went to \nmany\n&gt; &gt; temples. There was one r=\r\nemote temple in BriahdDwaraka that had a \nnice\n&gt; &gt; level of spiritual vibra=\r\ntions. It is a temple of Hanuman and\n&gt; &gt; Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) toget=\r\nher. Apparently some yogi did\n&gt; &gt; intense sadhana there for a few decades i=\r\nn the past (with the \nmantra\n&gt; &gt; you mentioned). The mantra above is writte=\r\nn all over the walls of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; temple.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Though that yogi is not =\r\nthere now, the vibrations created by his\n&gt; &gt; sadhana are still there. We we=\r\nre quite impressed when we spent \nsome\n&gt; &gt; time there. You have to take a b=\r\noat to go from Dwaarakaa to\n&gt; &gt; BrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the vill=\r\nage (a few km from the\n&gt; &gt; main Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a=\r\n very small temple\n&gt; &gt; without any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy=\r\n than many \nfamous\n&gt; &gt; temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in g=\r\neneral, I\n&gt; &gt; recommend visiting that temple and spending a couple of hours=\r\n \nthere.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The mantra you gave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   =\r\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available \nnow\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om|\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Al=\r\nl this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve \nhad\n&gt; &gt; for qu=\r\nite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to\n&gt; &gt; any Hanuma=\r\nn temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in \nmy\n&gt; &gt; natal chart =\r\nwhich suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and \nneecha\n&gt; &gt; in navamsa). W=\r\nhen I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha\n&gt; &gt; Perumal temple, Thir=\r\numazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest \nabout\n&gt; &gt; a mantra, he advised=\r\n me to chant the mantra inscribed on the \nwalls of\n&gt; &gt; the temple |sri ram =\r\njaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be \na 7\n&gt; &gt; word, 10 aksharas ma=\r\nntra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th \nhouse\n&gt; &gt; with the mantra deva=\r\nta sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing th=\r\nis every evening since.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Later I came to know this is the R=\r\nama taraka mantra. My \nquestion\n&gt; &gt; is how does this mantra help to counter=\r\n the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Secondly what is the correct fo=\r\nrm of the Rama taraka mantra? \nIs it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram =\r\njaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   or\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   =\r\n|om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;   Some say it should be 13 aksharas....\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Sorry for astro=\r\nlogical content in this mail.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   best regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Hari\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
