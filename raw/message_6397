THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FIVE SHEATHS\n\n3. The body which is produce=\r\nd from the seed and blood of the parents, which\nare in turn formed out of t=\r\nhe food eaten by them, grows by food only. It is\nnot the Self, for it does =\r\nnot exist either before birth or after death.\n\n5. The vital airs which perv=\r\nade the body and give power and motion to the\neyes and\nother senses constit=\r\nute the vital sheath. It is not the Self because it is\ndevoid of\nconsciousn=\r\ness.\n\n6. That which gives rise to the ideas of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=\r\n=80=98mine=E2=80=99 with regard to one=E2=80=99s\nbody,house and so forth, i=\r\ns the mind sheath. It is not the Self because it\nhas desires and is moved b=\r\ny pleasure and pain, is subject to delusion and is\nfickle.\n\n7. The intellec=\r\nt which has the reflection of pure consciousness, and which\npervades the wh=\r\nole body up to the tips of the fingers in the waking state\nbut disappears i=\r\nn deep sleep, is known as the intellect sheath. It also is\nnot the Self bec=\r\nause it too is changeable.\n\n8. The inner organ functions as the agent and a=\r\nlso the instrument. Hence\nthough\none, it is treated as two, viz., the intel=\r\nlect sheath and the mind sheath.\nTheir fields of operation are the inner wo=\r\nrld and the outer world\nrespectively.\n\n9. There is a position or function (=\r\nof the intellect) which, at the time of\nenjoying the fruits of good actions=\r\n, goes a little farther inward and\ncatches the reflection of the bliss and =\r\nat the end of this enjoyment, merges\nin deep sleep. (This is what is known =\r\nas the sheath of bliss).\n\n10. This bliss sheath also cannot be the Self bec=\r\nause it is temporal and\nimpermanent. That bliss which is the source of this=\r\n reflection is the Self;\nfor it is\neternal and immutable.\n\n11. (Objection):=\r\n By granting that the sheaths beginning with that of food\n(body) and\nending=\r\n in that of bliss (joy or sleep) are not the Self, yet (when they are\nnegat=\r\ned),\nno further object remains to be experienced.\n\n12. (Reply): True, bliss=\r\n sheath etc., are experienced and not anything else.\nYet who\ncan deny that =\r\nby which these are experienced ?\n\n13. As the Self is Itself of the nature o=\r\nf experience only. It cannot be an\nobject of experience. Since there is no =\r\nexperiencer nor any experience other\nthan It, the Self is unknowable =E2=80=\r\n=93 not because It does not exist but because\nIt cannot be an object of exp=\r\nerience.\n\nIV. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF DUALITY\n\n2. The Svetasvatara Upanishad=\r\n says: =E2=80=98Know Maya as Prakriti and Brahman\nassociated with Maya as t=\r\nhe great Ishvara=E2=80=99 (who imparts existence and\nconsciousness to it an=\r\nd guides it). It is He who creates the world.\n\n3. The Aitareya Upanishad sa=\r\nys that before creation there was Atman only,\nand He thought, =E2=80=98Let =\r\nme create the world=E2=80=99, and then He created the world by\nHis will (to=\r\n create).\n\n4. The Taittiriya Upanishad says that from the Self or Brahman a=\r\nlone arose\nin succession the whole creation including Akasa, (ether), air, =\r\nfire, water,\nearth,vegetation, food and bodies.\n\n5. The Taittiriya Upanisha=\r\nd says that desiring =E2=80=98I shall be many, so I shall\ncreate=E2=80=99, =\r\nthe Lord meditated; and thus created the world.\n\n20. Objects created by Ish=\r\nvara (e.g., gems) do not alter; they remain the\nsame. But\ngems may affect d=\r\nifferent people differently according to their mental\nstates.\n\n21. One man =\r\nmay feel happy on obtaining a gem, whereas another may feel\ndisappointed at=\r\n failing to obtain it. And a man uninterested in it, may only\nlook on and f=\r\neel neither happy nor disappointed.\n\n22. The Jiva creates these three feeli=\r\nngs of happiness, disappointment or\nindifference with regard to the gem, bu=\r\nt the nature of the gem as created by\nIshvara\nremains the same throughout.\n=\r\n\n23. Through personal relationships, one and the same woman appears\ndiffere=\r\nntly as\na wife, a daughter-in-law, a sister-in-law, a cousin and a mother; =\r\nbut she\nherself\nremains unchanged.\n\n24. (Objection): These different relati=\r\nonships may be seen, but no changes\nin the\nwoman=E2=80=99s appearance are s=\r\neen to result from other people=E2=80=99s ideas about her.\n\n25. (Reply): No=\r\nt so. The woman has a subtle body as well as a physical body\ncomposed of fl=\r\nesh etc. Although other people=E2=80=99s ideas about her may not\naffect her=\r\n\nphysical body, yet they can change her mental state.\n\n27. (Reply): True, A=\r\ncharya Shankara, Sureshvara and others acknowledge the\nfact that the mind a=\r\nssumes the form of the external object with which it\ncomes into contact and=\r\n modifies that form to suit its purposes.\n\n29. Or just as sunlight assumes =\r\nthe forms of the objects which it illumines,\nso the\nmind assumes the forms =\r\nof the objects which it perceives.\n\n33. In dream, when external (material) =\r\nobjects are absent, man is bound by\nthe intellect to pleasure and pain, alt=\r\nhough outer objects are not\nperceived. In deep sleep, in a faint and in the=\r\n lower Samadhi (when the\nmental functions are temporarily suspended), no pl=\r\neasure or pain is felt\ninspite of the proximity of outer objects.\n\n34. A li=\r\nar told a man whose son had gone to a far-off country that the boy\nwas dead=\r\n,although he was still alive. The father believed him and was\naggrieved.\n\n3=\r\n5. If, on the other hand, his son had really died abroad but no news had\nre=\r\nached\nhim, he would have felt no grief. This shows that the real cause of a=\r\n man=E2=80=99s\nbondage\nis his own mental world.\n\n38. (Objection): If the mi=\r\nnd causes bondage by giving rise to the phenomenal\nworld,\nthe world could b=\r\ne made to disappear by controlling the mind. So only Yoga\nneeds to\nbe pract=\r\nised; what is the necessity of knowledge of Brahman ?\n\n39. (Reply): Though =\r\nby controlling the mind duality can be made to disappear\ntemporarily the co=\r\nmplete and final destruction of the mental creation is not\npossible\nwithout=\r\n a direct knowledge of Brahman. This is proclaimed by the Vedanta.\n\n45. =E2=\r\n=80=98An intelligent person, who has studied the scriptures and has\nrepeate=\r\ndly\npractised what they enjoin should renounce them after knowing the supre=\r\nme\nBrahman, just as a man throws aside a flaming torch at the end of his\njo=\r\nurney=E2=80=99.\n[Amritanada Upanishad]\n\n46. =E2=80=98An intelligent person,=\r\n who has studied the scriptures and has practised\nwhat\nthey enjoin should d=\r\niscard them after experiencing Brahman as his Self, just\nas a\nman discards =\r\nthe husk when he has found the grain=E2=80=99. [Amrita-Bindu Upanishad]\n\n47=\r\n. =E2=80=98A wise man, having experienced Brahman as his Self, should keep =\r\nhis\nhigher intuitive faculty (prajna) united with Brahman. He should not op=\r\npress\nhis mind with many words, for they are a mere waste of energy=E2=80=\r\n=99.\n[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]\n\n48. It has been clearly told in the Shruti=\r\n: =E2=80=98Know that One and give up other\ntalks=E2=80=99 [Mundaka Upanisha=\r\nd] and =E2=80=98A wise man should restrain his speech and\nkeep it within th=\r\ne mind=E2=80=99. [Katha Upanishad]\n\n52. You may say: Let there be no libera=\r\ntion in life; I am satisfied if there\nis no birth anymore. We reply: Then (=\r\nif the desires remain), you will have\nbirths also. So be satisfied with hea=\r\nven only.\n\n53. If you say that the pleasures of heaven are defective, havin=\r\ng waning and\ngradation, and so are to be renounced, then why don=E2=80=99t =\r\nyou give up this\nsource of all\nevils, the passions ?\n\n55. Sri Sureshvara sa=\r\nys that one who pretends to be a knower of Brahman and\nyet lives without mo=\r\nral restraint is like a dog that eats unclean\nthings.[Naiskarmyasiddhi-IV-6=\r\n2]\n\n66. If sometimes owing to actions performed in previous births the mind=\r\n of a\nreflective man is distracted by desire, then it may be brought back t=\r\no a\npeaceful\nstate by the constant practice of spiritual meditations.\n\nV. F=\r\nIXING THE MEANING OF THE GREAT SAYINGS\n\n2. The one consciousness which is i=\r\nn Brahma, Indra and other gods, as well\nas in\nhuman beings, horses, cows, e=\r\ntc., is Brahman. So the consciousness in me\nalso is\nBrahman.\n\nVI. THE LAMP =\r\nOF THE PICTURE\n\n7. On consciousness are superimposed various forms. In each=\r\n of them there is\na reflection, i.e., a special function of consciousness. =\r\nThey are known as\nthe Jivas and are subject to the process of birth and dea=\r\nth.\n\n12. Therefore one should always enquire into the nature of the world, =\r\nthe\nindividual Self and the supreme Self. When the ideas of Jiva and Jagat\n=\r\n(world) are negated, the pure Atman alone remains.\n\n13. By negation it does=\r\n not mean that the world and Jiva cease to be\nperceptible to\nthe senses, it=\r\n means the conviction of their illusory character. Otherwise\npeople\nwould b=\r\ne automatically liberated in deep sleep or in a faint.\n\n14. =E2=80=98The su=\r\npreme Self alone remains=E2=80=99 also means a conviction about Its\nreality=\r\n and\nnot non-perceiving of the world. Otherwise there would be no such thin=\r\ng as\nliberation\nin life.\n\n69. The Buddhists believe that the Atman consists=\r\n of the momentary states of\nthe intellect, because the intellect, endowed w=\r\nith the faculty of\nunderstanding, is the basis of the mind and through it t=\r\nhe mind grasps\nmatter.\n\n70. The internal organ (Antahkarana) has two kinds =\r\nof vrittis, viz., the\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-\nconsciousness, and =E2=80=98this=\r\n=E2=80=99 consciousness. The first constitutes the\nintellect, the\nsubject-c=\r\nonsciousness and the second the mind, the object-consciousness.\n\n75. Quotin=\r\ng the Shruti, =E2=80=98In the beginning all this was non-existent (Asat)=E2=\r\n=80=99,\nthe Buddhists say that perception and the objects of perception are=\r\n the\ncreations of illusion.\n\n76. The Vedantins refute them by saying that t=\r\nhere can be no illusion\nwithout a\nsubstratum which is not an illusion. The =\r\nexistence of the Atman must be\nadmitted.\nEven the void has a witness; if no=\r\nt, it would be impossible to say, =E2=80=98There\nis a void=E2=80=99.\n\n94. T=\r\nhe first of the sheaths, the bliss-sheath which persists in the state\nof de=\r\nep sleep and which does not manifest consciousness fully, is taken as\nAtman=\r\n by the followers of Prabhakara and some logicians. What they state to\nbe t=\r\nhe nature of the Self, is in fact, characteristic of the bliss-sheath.\n\n95.=\r\n The followers of Bhatta hold that consciousness is hidden in Atman and\ntha=\r\nt its\nnature is both consciousness and unconsciousness. This is inferred fr=\r\nom the\nfact of\nthe remembrance of sound sleep by the awakened man.\n\n96. =E2=\r\n=80=98I became unconscious and slept=E2=80=99, such feeling expresses the m=\r\nemory of\nthat inert state which he actually experienced. But this remembran=\r\nce of\nunconsciousness in deep sleep would not be possible unless there were=\r\n at the\nsame time a conscious element.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.org/oth=\r\nervedantabooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016368340f8a49ec904a43a9533\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nTranslated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math=\r\n, Chennai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;III. THE DIFFERENTIATION =\r\nOF THE FIVE SHEATHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;3. The b=\r\nody which is produced from the seed and blood of the parents, which are in =\r\nturn formed out of the food eaten by them, grows by food only. It is not th=\r\ne Self, for it does not exist either before birth or after death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;5. The vital airs which pervade the body and give power and motion t=\r\no the eyes and&lt;br&gt;other senses constitute the vital sheath. It is not the S=\r\nelf because it is devoid of&lt;br&gt;consciousness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;6. That which gives rise to the ideas of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and=\r\n =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 with regard to one=E2=80=99s body,house and so fort=\r\nh, is the mind sheath. It is not the Self because it has desires and is mov=\r\ned by pleasure and pain, is subject to delusion and is fickle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;7. The intellect which has the reflect=\r\nion of pure consciousness, and which pervades the whole body up to the tips=\r\n of the fingers in the waking state but disappears in deep sleep, is known =\r\nas the intellect sheath. It also is not the Self because it too is changeab=\r\nle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;8. The inner organ functions as the agent and also the =\r\ninstrument. Hence though&lt;br&gt;one, it is treated as two, viz., the intellect =\r\nsheath and the mind sheath. Their fields of operation are the inner world a=\r\nnd the outer world respectively.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\n9. There is a position or function (of the intellect) which, at the time of=\r\n enjoying the fruits of good actions, goes a little farther inward and catc=\r\nhes the reflection of the bliss and at the end of this enjoyment, merges in=\r\n deep sleep. (This is what is known as the sheath of bliss).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;10. This bliss sheath also cannot be the Self because it is temporal and&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;impermanent. That bliss which is the source of this reflection is the Se=\r\nlf; for it is&lt;br&gt;eternal and immutable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;11. (Objection): By granting=\r\n that the sheaths beginning with that of food (body) and&lt;br&gt;\n\nending in tha=\r\nt of bliss (joy or sleep) are not the Self, yet (when they are negated),&lt;br=\r\n&gt;no further object remains to be experienced.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;12. (Reply): True, bli=\r\nss sheath etc., are experienced and not anything else. Yet who&lt;br&gt;\n\ncan den=\r\ny that by which these are experienced ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;13. As the Self is Itself of the nature of experience only. It cannot =\r\nbe an object of experience. Since there is no experiencer nor any experienc=\r\ne other than It, the Self is unknowable =E2=80=93 not because It does not e=\r\nxist but because It cannot be an object of experience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;IV. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF DUALITY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;2. The Svetasvatara Upanishad says: =E2=\r\n=80=98Know Maya as Prakriti and Brahman associated with Maya as the great I=\r\nshvara=E2=80=99 (who imparts existence and consciousness to it and guides i=\r\nt). It is He who creates the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold&quot;&gt;3. The Aitareya Upanishad says that before creation there was Atm=\r\nan only, and He thought, =E2=80=98Let me create the world=E2=80=99, and the=\r\nn He created the world by His will (to create).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;4. The Taittiriya Upanishad says that from the Self o=\r\nr Brahman alone arose in succession the whole creation including Akasa, (et=\r\nher), air, fire, water, earth,vegetation, food and bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;5. The Taittiriya Upanishad says that desi=\r\nring =E2=80=98I shall be many, so I shall create=E2=80=99, the Lord meditat=\r\ned; and thus created the world.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;20. Objects created by Ishvar=\r\na (e.g., gems) do not alter; they remain the same. But&lt;br&gt;\n\ngems may affect=\r\n different people differently according to their mental states.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;21. One man may feel happy on obtaining a gem,=\r\n whereas another may feel disappointed at failing to obtain it. And a man u=\r\nninterested in it, may only look on and feel neither happy nor disappointed=\r\n.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;22. The Jiva creates these three feelings of happiness, d=\r\nisappointment or&lt;br&gt;indifference with regard to the gem, but the nature of =\r\nthe gem as created by Ishvara&lt;br&gt;remains the same throughout.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;23. Th=\r\nrough personal relationships, one and the same woman appears differently as=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\na wife, a daughter-in-law, a sister-in-law, a cousin and a mother; bu=\r\nt she herself&lt;br&gt;remains unchanged.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;24. (Objection): These different=\r\n relationships may be seen, but no changes in the&lt;br&gt;woman=E2=80=99s appear=\r\nance are seen to result from other people=E2=80=99s ideas about her.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;25. (Reply): Not so. The woman has a subtle body as well as a physical b=\r\nody&lt;br&gt;composed of flesh etc. Although other people=E2=80=99s ideas about h=\r\ner may not affect her&lt;br&gt;physical body, yet they can change her mental stat=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;27. (Reply): True, Acharya Sha=\r\nnkara, Sureshvara and others acknowledge the fact that the mind assumes the=\r\n form of the external object with which it comes into contact and modifies =\r\nthat form to suit its purposes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;29. Or just as sunlight ass=\r\numes the forms of the objects which it illumines, so the&lt;br&gt;mind assumes th=\r\ne forms of the objects which it perceives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;33. In dream, when external (material) objects are absent, man is b=\r\nound by the intellect to pleasure and pain, although outer objects are not =\r\nperceived. In deep sleep, in a faint and in the lower Samadhi (when the men=\r\ntal functions are temporarily suspended), no pleasure or pain is felt inspi=\r\nte of the proximity of outer objects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;34. A liar told a man whose son had gone to a far-off country t=\r\nhat the boy was dead,although he was still alive. The father believed him a=\r\nnd was aggrieved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;35. If, on the other hand, his son had really died=\r\n abroad but no news had reached&lt;br&gt;\n\nhim, he would have felt no grief. This=\r\n shows that the real cause of a man=E2=80=99s bondage&lt;br&gt;is his own mental =\r\nworld.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;38. (Objection): If the mind causes bondage by giving =\r\nrise to the phenomenal world,&lt;br&gt;the world could be made to disappear by co=\r\nntrolling the mind. So only Yoga needs to&lt;br&gt;\n\nbe practised; what is the ne=\r\ncessity of knowledge of Brahman ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;39. (Reply): Though by controlling=\r\n the mind duality can be made to disappear&lt;br&gt;temporarily the complete and =\r\nfinal destruction of the mental creation is not possible&lt;br&gt;\n\nwithout a dir=\r\nect knowledge of Brahman. This is proclaimed by the Vedanta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;45. =E2=\r\n=80=98An intelligent person, who has studied the scriptures and has repeate=\r\ndly&lt;br&gt;practised what they enjoin should renounce them after knowing the su=\r\npreme&lt;br&gt;\n\nBrahman, just as a man throws aside a flaming torch at the end o=\r\nf his journey=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;[Amritanada Upanishad]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;46. =E2=80=98An in=\r\ntelligent person, who has studied the scriptures and has practised what&lt;br&gt;=\r\nthey enjoin should discard them after experiencing Brahman as his Self, jus=\r\nt as a&lt;br&gt;\n\nman discards the husk when he has found the grain=E2=80=99. [Am=\r\nrita-Bindu Upanishad]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;47. =E2=80=98=\r\nA wise man, having experienced Brahman as his Self, should keep his higher =\r\nintuitive faculty (prajna) united with Brahman. He should not oppress his m=\r\nind with many words, for they are a mere waste of energy=E2=80=99. [Brihada=\r\nranyaka Upanishad]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;48. It =\r\nhas been clearly told in the Shruti: =E2=80=98Know that One and give up oth=\r\ner talks=E2=80=99 [Mundaka Upanishad] and =E2=80=98A wise man should restra=\r\nin his speech and keep it within the mind=E2=80=99. [Katha Upanishad]&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;52. You may say: Let there be no liberation in life; I am satisf=\r\nied if there is no birth anymore. We reply: Then (if the desires remain), y=\r\nou will have births also. So be satisfied with heaven only.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;53. If y=\r\nou say that the pleasures of heaven are defective, having waning and&lt;br&gt;\n\ng=\r\nradation, and so are to be renounced, then why don=E2=80=99t you give up th=\r\nis source of all&lt;br&gt;evils, the passions ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold&quot;&gt;55. Sri Sureshvara says that one who pretends to be a knower of Brah=\r\nman and yet lives without moral restraint is like a dog that eats unclean t=\r\nhings.[Naiskarmyasiddhi-IV-62]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;66. If sometimes owing to ac=\r\ntions performed in previous births the mind of a&lt;br&gt;reflective man is distr=\r\nacted by desire, then it may be brought back to a peaceful&lt;br&gt;state by the =\r\nconstant practice of spiritual meditations.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;V. FIXING THE MEANING OF THE GREAT SAYINGS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. The =\r\none consciousness which is in Brahma, Indra and other gods, as well as in&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;human beings, horses, cows, etc., is Brahman. So the consciousness in me =\r\nalso is&lt;br&gt;\n\nBrahman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;VI. THE LAMP =\r\nOF THE PICTURE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;7. On conscio=\r\nusness are superimposed various forms. In each of them there is a reflectio=\r\nn, i.e., a special function of consciousness. They are known as the Jivas a=\r\nnd are subject to the process of birth and death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;12. Therefore one should always enquire into the na=\r\nture of the world, the individual Self and the supreme Self. When the ideas=\r\n of Jiva and Jagat (world) are negated, the pure Atman alone remains.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;13. By negation it does not mean that the world and Jiva cease to be pe=\r\nrceptible to&lt;br&gt;the senses, it means the conviction of their illusory chara=\r\ncter. Otherwise people&lt;br&gt;would be automatically liberated in deep sleep or=\r\n in a faint.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;14. =E2=80=98The supreme Self alone remains=E2=\r\n=80=99 also means a conviction about Its reality and&lt;br&gt;not non-perceiving =\r\nof the world. Otherwise there would be no such thing as liberation&lt;br&gt;in li=\r\nfe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;69. The Buddhists believe that =\r\nthe Atman consists of the momentary states of the intellect, because the in=\r\ntellect, endowed with the faculty of understanding, is the basis of the min=\r\nd and through it the mind grasps matter.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;70. The internal organ (A=\r\nntahkarana) has two kinds of vrittis, viz., the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-&lt;br&gt;con=\r\nsciousness, and =E2=80=98this=E2=80=99 consciousness. The first constitutes=\r\n the intellect, the&lt;br&gt;subject-consciousness and the second the mind, the o=\r\nbject-consciousness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;75. Q=\r\nuoting the Shruti, =E2=80=98In the beginning all this was non-existent (Asa=\r\nt)=E2=80=99, the Buddhists say that perception and the objects of perceptio=\r\nn are the creations of illusion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;76. The Vedantins refute them by sa=\r\nying that there can be no illusion without a&lt;br&gt;\n\nsubstratum which is not a=\r\nn illusion. The existence of the Atman must be admitted.&lt;br&gt;Even the void h=\r\nas a witness; if not, it would be impossible to say, =E2=80=98There is a vo=\r\nid=E2=80=99.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;94. The first of the sheaths, the bliss-sheath w=\r\nhich persists in the state of deep sleep and which does not manifest consci=\r\nousness fully, is taken as Atman by the followers of Prabhakara and some lo=\r\ngicians. What they state to be the nature of the Self, is in fact, characte=\r\nristic of the bliss-sheath.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;95. The followers of Bhatta hold that =\r\nconsciousness is hidden in Atman and that its&lt;br&gt;nature is both consciousne=\r\nss and unconsciousness. This is inferred from the fact of&lt;br&gt;the remembranc=\r\ne of sound sleep by the awakened man.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;96. =E2=80=98I became unconscious and slept=E2=80=99, such feeling exp=\r\nresses the memory of that inert state which he actually experienced. But th=\r\nis remembrance of unconsciousness in deep sleep would not be possible unles=\r\ns there were at the same time a conscious element.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.celextel.org/=\r\nothervedantabooks/panchadasi.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.celextel.or=\r\ng/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:=\r\n0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-to=\r\np:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3=\r\nem&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016368340f8a49ec904a43a9533--\r\n\n"}}
