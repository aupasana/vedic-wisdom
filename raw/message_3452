What is known to have transpired between these two events can be\ns=\r\nummed up briefly:\n\nAt an early age he began working in the service of a kin=\r\ng. When the king\ndied he left this work because of the amorous advances of =\r\nthe king&#39;s widow.\nHe then travelled in search of a Guru. At Tiruchilapalli =\r\nhe met Mouna Guru\nArulananda Sivachari. He asked to be taken as a disciple,=\r\n but the saint\nanswered &#39;chumma iru&#39;, meaning &#39;be still&#39; or &#39;be quiet&#39; or &#39;=\r\njust be&#39; (a\nphrase which Ramana Maharshi also used on a number of occasions=\r\n). However,\nthe saint said that when the time was ripe he would initiate hi=\r\nm.\n\nThayumanavar then returned home and married. Soon after his wife delive=\r\nred\ntheir first child, a boy, she died. That again prompted Thayumanavar to=\r\n\nleave home in answer to his spiritual calling. He once more approached\nAru=\r\nlananda Sivachari and, true to his word, the guru fulfilled his promise\nand=\r\n initiated Thayumanavar into sannyas.\n\nThayumanavar followed the discipline=\r\n of silence (mouna), which he describes\nas: &quot;that state which spontaneously=\r\n manifests after the annihilation of the\nego.&quot; He says: &quot;It is a state beyo=\r\nnd light and darkness, but it is called\nlight, since language is inadequate=\r\n to express it. The ego disappears and\n&#39;I&#39; spontaneously manifests in full =\r\nglory.&quot; The Maharshi particularly\nsingled out this verse of his for admirat=\r\nion.\n\nThayumanavar was equally great as a saint and a poet. Often he would =\r\nretire\nto the forest or public gardens and remained for days absorbed in th=\r\ne bliss\nof the Self. Legend has it that he was sitting thus, immobile in sa=\r\nmadhi in\na public garden in Ramnad when the gardeners, not noticing him, pi=\r\nled a heap\nof dry leaves and twigs about him and set fire to it, and thus h=\r\nis body was\nconsumed and he merged in the Supreme.\n\nThayumanavar&#39;s key teac=\r\nhing is to discipline the mind, control desires and\nmeditate peacefully. He=\r\n went on to say that &quot;it is easy to control an\nelephant, catch hold of the =\r\ntiger&#39;s tail, grab the snake and dance, dictate\nthe angels, transmigrate in=\r\nto another body, walk on water or sit on the sea;\nbut it is more difficult =\r\nto control the mind and remain quiet&quot;.\n\nRamana Maharshi was often heard quo=\r\nting from his exquisite verses. The\nfollowing are ten verses especially sel=\r\nected by the Maharshi:\n\n1 & 2. The individual ego known as &quot;I&quot; having manif=\r\nested and troubled\neveryone, the universal Maya, the diversifying agency, s=\r\npontaneously follows\nin its wake. Who can possibly describe the vast ocean =\r\nof misery consequent\nupon it? It appears as the flesh, the body, the senses=\r\n, interior and\nexterior, as the all pervading ether, air, fire, water and e=\r\narth, as\nmountain, forest, huge visions like hills physical and subtle, as\n=\r\nforgetfulness and memory, and so on, rising up wave after wave and beating\n=\r\nagainst man, bringing pleasure and pain, which are the result of his past\na=\r\nctions, and also their remedies known as creeds, religions, God-Seeker, and=\r\n\nthe testimonies and sanctions found in various sciences, and explained by\n=\r\nlogic. All these are more numerous than even the fine grains of sand on the=\r\n\nseashore.\n\n3. Unaccountable troubles crop up spontaneously, sheaf upon she=\r\naf. How to\nroot them out wholesale, even as burning up a hill of camphor wi=\r\nthout\nresidue in a vast blaze of fire? In order to achieve this miracle, an=\r\nd to\nenlighten me, Grace took shape. In every respect, like my self, eating=\r\n and\nsleeping, suffering and enjoying, bearing a name and born somewhere, i=\r\nt\nappeared as the Silent Guru, like a deer used to decoy another of its\nspe=\r\ncies.\n\n4. And claimed my body, possessions and life itself and consistently=\r\n with\nthe process of elimination, signified &quot;you are not the five senses no=\r\nr the\nfive elements, nor the limbs, nor the mind, nor their attributes, nor=\r\n all\nthese collectively, nor the body nor knowledge nor ignorance. You are =\r\npure\nconsciousness, unassociated like a crystal, but reflecting the backgro=\r\nund to\nlookers-on; whereas we (guru) are only the inherent nature revealing=\r\n the\ntruth on finding you ripe for it.&quot;\n\n5. &quot;If eager to reach Consciousnes=\r\ns-Bliss-Eternity innermost in all, which\nis also the inner abode of refresh=\r\ning Grace, listen to the course I\nindicate. May you reach the Pure Heart an=\r\nd abide there forever! May dense\nignorance vanish for you! May you attain t=\r\no Bliss-Consciousness! May bondage\ncease for you!&quot; Communicating thus,\n\n6. =\r\n&quot;And dispensing the true knowledge of the Natural and Unique Silence\nwhich =\r\ndestroys all bondage and where there is no meditation nor the ego, no\nspace=\r\n, no time, no direction, no association, no elimination, no\ndifferentiation=\r\n, no expression, no phenomena of night and day, no end, no\nbeginning, no mi=\r\nddle, no interior or exterior, nor an aggregate of all\nthese.&quot;\n\n7. (The Gur=\r\nu indicated further) that, though all these are eliminated, &quot;It&quot;\nis not voi=\r\nd, but is Natural, Eternal Be-ing inexpressible by words, not\nmanifesting a=\r\ns ego, but is the Reality engulfing all, having swallowed all\nignorance lik=\r\ne day covering night, and absorbing unhindered all knowledge,\nmetamorphosin=\r\ng the person into Itself, It shines in Silence, Self-effulgent;\n\n8. With it=\r\ns emergence, It prevents any other from appearing; and all else is\nput out =\r\nsuddenly like burning camphor blown away without residual flicker or\nglow; =\r\nand in its place It shines beyond the senses, and apart from the\nknower, kn=\r\nown and knowledge; and yet It is there, though who can speak of it\nand to w=\r\nhom? For if It arises, the individual is metamorphosed; It will\nassert Itse=\r\nlf (Literally: It Speaks Itself),\n\n9. (And further on), if it is said to be=\r\n &quot;It,&quot; the question arises &quot;which,&quot;\nthough such doubt about the non-dual On=\r\ne is illogical; so transcending it\nalso, King Janaka or Suka and others rem=\r\nained like the bee intoxicated with\nhoney in that state. (The same Guru&#39;s) =\r\nblessing helped me to reach it. Grace\nis needed in order to reach the Nirvi=\r\nkalpa Samadhi and attain absolute\nBliss. I will not rest nor attend to my w=\r\nants until I attain it.\n\n10. On the &quot;I&quot; idea of the individual ego vanishin=\r\ng, there springs up within\nme a current of &quot;I-I&quot; endless indeed. This confe=\r\nrs bliss engulfing all my\nknowledge, unique and transcendental, ending in S=\r\nilence! How then can\nSilence be expressed?\n\nSources:\n1) http://www.arunacha=\r\nla.org/newsletters/1995/?pg=3Djul-aug\n2) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thayu=\r\nmanavar\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd182848c1a1d047d435e41\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nALTHOUGH Thayumanavar lived less than 300 years ago and remains the most po=\r\npular Tamil poet-saint, there is no authentic record of his date of birth o=\r\nr death.
