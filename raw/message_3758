One thing=\r\n that I thought might be of great use in your journey is a powerful narrati=\r\nve from Narasimha on the deeper meaning of the Chandi Saptashati in his ina=\r\nugural post to this group. I reproduce it here so that it may help you and =\r\nthe legions of devotees who are performing\nor getting ready to perform Chan=\r\ndi Homam.\n\nOn the surface it seems like a simple story of Mother Goddesses&#39;=\r\n valour and battlefield exploits over fierce and seemingly unvanquishable d=\r\nemons. When I first read the Chandi (and I&#39;m not ready yet to perform the h=\r\nomam) I was stricken by self-doubt by what seemed a simplistic narrative - =\r\ndemons arise and Mother kills them, some more demons arise and Mother conqu=\r\ners them and so on it went...but Narasimhaji&#39;s powerful synthesis of the de=\r\neper meaning and some other material that I read on Shreema&#39;s website dispe=\r\nlled all doubts as to what this extremely potent and powerful text is all a=\r\nbout. I faithfully reproduce it below (later on I will reproduce some of th=\r\ne comments of Satyananda Saraswati from Shreema&#39;s ashram on the great Sapta=\r\nshati).\n\nHerewith:\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - =\r\n- - - - - -\n\nSome people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati is merely =\r\nan account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mahisha, Cha=\r\nnda, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a collectio=\r\nn of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmyam is muc=\r\nh more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swaroopam! Ri=\r\ngveda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/a different =\r\nmanifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpose of Veda=\r\ns is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopam be about=\r\n something other than self-knowledge? \n \n*        *        *\n \nThough Devi =\r\nMahatmyam looks like stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her nature=\r\n in it. The deeper you go, the more you can understand and appreciate the l=\r\nessons in the stories. Let me give a couple of examples.\n \n(1) When various=\r\n Mothers are going to war with demons, this is how it is described (8-14): =\r\n&quot;Whatever form, decoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, his shakti (e=\r\nnergy) came in the same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle.&quot; The next 9 =\r\nverses describe how Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani came on a sw=\r\nan with aksha sutra and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari came on a gr=\r\neat bull with a Trishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. And so on.\n \nW=\r\nhat is the message hidden in the above description? The normal imagery pain=\r\nted elsewhere is of female deities with a separate form. Here, they are dep=\r\nicted differently.\n \nThe fact that these female deities are identical to th=\r\ne male counterparts in form, decoration, weapons and vehicles suggests, to =\r\nme, that they are not really separate from the male counterparts. Brahma an=\r\nd Brahmaani are not separate. Maheswara and Maaheswari are not separate. Vi=\r\nshnu and Vaishnavi are not separate. And so on. Brahmaani is simply the sha=\r\nkti (vitality/energy) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simply the shakti (vitality/=\r\nenergy) of Maheswara. And so on.\n \nIf Vaishnavi went on Garuda vehicle and =\r\nkilled a demon, it actually means that Vishnu went on a Garuda vehicle and =\r\nkilled the demon. Vaishanvi is the personification of Vishnu&#39;s energy, whic=\r\nh makes Vishnu be, think, desire, move and act. Vaishnavi is not separate f=\r\nrom Vishnu.\n \nOf course, if you imagine Vaishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate p=\r\nerson with certain attributes, She may manifest limited by your imagination=\r\n and even give you a darshan in that form. However, that is a limited form =\r\nand Her true nature is beyond that. Her true and highest nature is that She=\r\n is an inseparable part of Vishnu and represents the energy of Vishnu. She =\r\nis the part of Vishnu that makes Vishnu think, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi i=\r\ns basically Chetana (animated consciousness) of Vishnu.\n \nThus, contemplati=\r\non on these verses will make you understand the true nature of male devatas=\r\n and female devatas and their relationship better. It will enable you to ap=\r\npreciate the highest nature of Shakti.\n \nPuranas personify everything to ma=\r\nke things interesting and understandable by laymen. However, it is more fun=\r\n to explore the deeper meanings.\n \n(2) Take Raktabeeja&#39;s slaying. Raktabeej=\r\na is a demon with a special ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body=\r\n on the ground, another demon will be born from it and will be of the same =\r\nsize, age and strength as the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishna=\r\nvi, Maaheswari, Aindri etc were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and m=\r\nore demons were being born and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa tol=\r\nd Kaali to expand her face and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandik=\r\na goes around the war ground eating all the demons as they are born and eve=\r\nntually Raktabeeja runs out of blood.\n \nThis looks like a nice story. But, =\r\nis there is a deeper meaning in it that helps you in self-realization? Why =\r\nwas Kaali the chosen one and not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?\n \nThe w=\r\nord rakta means blood. Another meaning is &quot;desire/passion&quot;. The word comes =\r\nfrom the root ranj/rang, which means &quot;to color&quot;. Desire/passion/attachment =\r\ncolors and conditions the mind. Beeja means seed.\n \nRaktabeeja means &quot;the s=\r\need of desire&quot;. Raktabeeja fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the=\r\n better of our good judgment and good qualities. Each human being is a micr=\r\nocosm of the macrocosm that the universe is. All devatas reside in us as va=\r\nrious good qualities and all demons reside in us as various undesirable qua=\r\nlities. When we are overcome by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja wi=\r\nthin us is defeating the gods within us.\n \nThe thing is that desires are di=\r\nfficult to get rid of. You get rid of one desire and another desire is born=\r\n. That is what Raktabeeja&#39;s special ability means. The &quot;seed of desires&quot; (i=\r\n.e. basic attachment that is the nature of mind) within us will keep produc=\r\ning more and more desires. It is very resourceful.\n \nThen, why Kaali to des=\r\ntroy Him?\n \nIn astrology, we associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali with Satur=\r\nn. Kaali shows detachment and vairaagyam. She wears a garland of skulls, sy=\r\nmbolizing that there is an endless cycle (garland) of births a material for=\r\nm (skull) goes thru. The way Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is vairaagya=\r\nm and detachment. She shows meaningful and highest level of vairaagyam that=\r\n comes with a deep understanding of the cycle of material forms.\n \nTo fully=\r\n cut off the &quot;seed of desires&quot; so that one does not get any more desires, o=\r\nne needs to develop vairaagyam and detachment and keep on destroying desire=\r\ns as they are born and persist like that. After persisting for a long time,=\r\n the &quot;seed of desires&quot; will run out of desires and the basic attachment of =\r\nmind will vanish.\n \nThus, simple stories have deep meanings. This particula=\r\nr story celebrates the value of detachment, vairaagyam and persistence - Sa=\r\nturnine qualities.\n \n*        *        *\n \nMerely chanting Chandi saptashat=\r\ni without understanding the meaning is also excellent and produces results.=\r\n Understanding the meaning and marvelling at the power of the Mother makes =\r\none fearless and energetic and also give material benefits. Understanding t=\r\nhe deeper meanings and appreciating the True Nature of the Mother makes one=\r\n realize one&#39;s own true nature. It has various benefits at various levels o=\r\nf sadhana. It is tough to exactly say what benefit it gives, as that depend=\r\ns on the evolution level of sadhaka and his attitude. But, there is somethi=\r\nng in Chandipath for everyone!\n \nHowever, the highest purpose is self-knowl=\r\nedge and that is why Vedas are its swaroopam.\n \n*        *        *\n \nTowar=\r\nds the end, the 11th chapter (titled &quot;Naaraayani Stuti&quot;) describes gods pra=\r\nying to the Divine Mother after slaying all the demons. They address Her as=\r\n &quot;Naaraayani&quot;. Trimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of the three gunas. =\r\nVishnu is one of them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains the creation. Howe=\r\nver, Narayana is different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Narayana sooktam wit=\r\nh Vishnu sooktam!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attributes). He is the Sa=\r\nhasraseersha and Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). Some people may val=\r\nidly describe the same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let us not argue about=\r\n names. When we are essentially speaking about an entity that is beyond att=\r\nributes, it is foolish to argue about the name. After all, name too is an a=\r\nttribute that intends to describe other attributes! Though great people gav=\r\ne different names to Parama Purusha, the names essentially capture the natu=\r\nre of the *path* those people took to experience the Parama Purusha rather =\r\nthan the nature of Parama Purusha, which is beyond names and attributes.\n \n=\r\nThe bottomline is that there is a Parama Purusha above the Trimurthis (Brah=\r\nma, Vishnu and Shiva). IF we call him Narayana, then Narayani is His energy=\r\n and She is the root cause of all manifested creation.\n \nSaptashati is abou=\r\nt Narayani. It is about the inseparable root energy of the Supreme Cosmic B=\r\neing who is the source of this entire universe. A small part of that root e=\r\nnergy lies within us too. Because I said &quot;small part&quot;, don&#39;t think it is sm=\r\nall. Even a small percentage of infinity is still infinity. Though each of =\r\nus is a microcosm of the macrocosm that the entire universe is, each of us =\r\nis a complete and accurate replica of the entire universe. Think &quot;poornamad=\r\nah poornamidam&quot; in Vedic spirit! The purpose of all spiritual sadhana is re=\r\nalizing the true nature of self. Chandipath can also be viewed from that pe=\r\nrspective.\n \n-----------------------------------------------------\n \n\nSomeo=\r\nne queried a while back on the meaning behind the story of Madhu Kaitabha. =\r\nHere is a quick reply based on my limited understanding.\n \n*        *      =\r\n  *\n \nMadhu means honey. &quot;Madhu keeta&quot; means an insect of honey, i.e. honey=\r\n bee. Madhu kaita means belonging to honey bees. It can be the qualities or=\r\n nature of honey bees. One of the meanings of &quot;bha&quot; is &quot;having a similarity=\r\n to&quot;. Thus, in my judgment, &quot;Madhu Kaitabha&quot; means &quot;having a semblance to t=\r\nhe nature of honey bees&quot;.\n \n*        *        *\n \nLike I keep saying, Sansk=\r\nrit is a fantastic language. Sanskrit names selected by Rishis for expressi=\r\nng various concepts and stories are very thoughtful. Depending on how deep =\r\none goes, there are many meanings of the same word. Thus, Rishis expressed =\r\nconcepts that may have one meaning to a layman and a different meaning to o=\r\nne who is ready to understand the deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of=\r\n our Rishis!\n \nI was saying the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last we=\r\nekend. When somebody said at an open discussion that the idea is important =\r\nand not the name, as there are many names of the same thing in many languag=\r\nes, I made a quick point about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that San=\r\nskrit names have not one meaning, but layers of meanings that can be unders=\r\ntood based on the capability of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some s=\r\npecial meanings and to keep some higher knowledge as secret, even though it=\r\n is very much out there! The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara=\r\n described bhavas (houses) and how to find their respective padas (arudha p=\r\nadas of houses) and said that a bhava and its pada should be judged to see =\r\nthe matters of a house. Though he did not explain the difference between a =\r\nbhava and its pada further and did not elucidate when to use which one, I s=\r\naid that the very choice of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually t=\r\nranslated as a house, also means &quot;a thought/concept/feeling&quot; and pada means=\r\n &quot;a symbol/word&quot; used to express a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to the=\r\nir arudha padas what thoughts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attemp=\r\nt to express them. For example, if the 4th house shows one&#39;s happiness from=\r\n vehicles, the pada of 4th house shows the tangible articles that attempt t=\r\no throw light on one&#39;s happiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle o=\r\nwned by one). Houses (bhavas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter =\r\n(just like thoughts inside one&#39;s head), while their arudha padas show tangi=\r\nble/external aspects of a matter (just like the external words spoken that =\r\nattempt to express the thoughts in the head). If you use the English words =\r\nto translate Parasara, this hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that S=\r\nanskrit names used by Rishis are not like words in any language.\n \n*       =\r\n *        *\n \nAnyway, let us come back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I sa=\r\nid, Madhu Kaitabha means &quot;having a semblance to the quality of honeybees&quot;. =\r\nWhat is the quality of honey bees? Well, they keep working hard to accumula=\r\nte the sweet honey! They are not intelligent enough to think about any high=\r\ner things in life. Thus, Madhu Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality with=\r\nin us which makes us work hard, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus =\r\non accumulating material comforts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accu=\r\nmulate material objects and spend whole life working hard doing just that.\n=\r\n \nVishnu is a personification of the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Uni=\r\nversal/Absolute Being). Within us, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna=\r\n within us. Madhu Kaitabha were born from Vishnu&#39;s earwax when He was alsee=\r\np. The ability to work hard like a bee is not really a terrible thing. This=\r\n ability is essentially born from the sattwa guna within us, when it is in =\r\ndeep slumber (i.e. sattwa guna covered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna =\r\nthat &quot;manifests&quot; in a taamasik way).\n \nThere are so many good people in thi=\r\ns world, who just spend their entire lives in honest labor like the honeybe=\r\nes and accumulate things for themselves and others around them. Their sattw=\r\na is in deep sleep and Madhu Kaitabha born from that asleep sattva are very=\r\n much active.\n \nThe problem with this focus on hard work and accumulation o=\r\nf material objects is that it keeps us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaita=\r\nbha&#39;s attack on Brahma and Vedas is symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the s=\r\nupreme and liberating knowledge of self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, s=\r\nymbolizes the sadhana to achieve the supreme knowledge. The focus on workin=\r\ng like honeybees and accumulating material objects tries to kills one&#39;s abi=\r\nlity to do sadhana and obtain supreme knowledge of self.\n \nVishnu battles M=\r\nadhu Kaitabha for 5,000 years. Devi Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu w=\r\nondered in the middle how to defeat Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite =\r\nformidable! Even when the sattva in us awakens, it is difficult for it to o=\r\nvercome the formidable instinct to lead the life of a honeybee and to accum=\r\nulate the material objects for oneself and others.\n \nAccording to Parasara,=\r\n thighs are seen from the 9th house of dharma. The earthy element symbolize=\r\ns the commitment and stability. The fact that earthy element came from the =\r\nthighs of Vishnu shows that it is the dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this=\r\n universe that ensures that there is commitment and stability in this creat=\r\nion.\n \nMoreover, it is apt that someone born in the ears (3rd house) of Vis=\r\nhnu found end in the thighs (9th house, i.e. 7th house of death from the 3r=\r\nd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, Brahma, who is born from the navel (6th hous=\r\ne) of Vishnu should naturally find His end in the 12th house of Vishnu (fee=\r\nt/sleep), which is the 7th house of death from the 6th house! That may be w=\r\nhy Vishnu goes to sleep, when there is a change of Brahma.\n \nAnyway, the in=\r\nstinct within us to keep accumulating material objects like honey bees accu=\r\nmulate honey finds its end in the dharma of the sattwa guna, i.e. when the =\r\nsattwa guna within us follows its dharma. Then we are fully awake spiritual=\r\nly. Naturally, the path to self-knowledge becomes open then and Brahma beco=\r\nmes elated.\n \nThus, the story of Madhu-Kaitabha refers, allegorically, to t=\r\nhe instinct most of us have towards leading a &quot;regular&quot; life, working hard =\r\nlike honeybees and accumulating objects for self and others and how that in=\r\nstinct needs to be defeated by waking up the sattwa guna and allowing it to=\r\n perform its dharma.\n \n*        *        *\n \nLest I am misunderstood, I nee=\r\nd to clarify one thing. I am not saying that these stories are not real. Th=\r\nese stories ARE very much real. In fact, when a Yogi is able to transport c=\r\nonsciousness (Kundalini) to a particular plane (chakra), He/She can vividly=\r\n see these stories actually happening. The stories are as real as our own e=\r\nxistence as beings made of flesh and blood is, in the normal plane of consc=\r\niousness.\n \nWhat I am saying is that there is an allegorical link between v=\r\narious planes of consciousness. What is real in one plane of consciousness =\r\nis an allegory in another plane of consciousness. If one is atleast capable=\r\n of understanding a story as an allegory, that will serve a valuable purpos=\r\ne!\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimhagaru,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thank you for your reply. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n I understand that Chandi and Lalita are two different forms of the Univers=\r\nal Mother.=C2=A0But what I am trying to understand=C2=A0is that how to wors=\r\nhip both forms simultaneously.

Both are valid paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglo=\r\nbal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;na=\r\ngraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; =\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 =\r\nPM\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am very much in awe after I lear=\r\nnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.=\r\n25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that =\r\nfeat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyava=\r\nndanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 mi=\r\nnutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-1=\r\n0 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometime=\r\ns do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours =\r\nin all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana differe=\r\nnt from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it=\r\n is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is =\r\nall about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musici=\r\nan also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshi=\r\ntar recently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
