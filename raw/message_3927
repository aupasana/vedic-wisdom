It\nrelates to secu=\r\nrity, protection and stability in the personal events of\neveryday life.\n\nSo=\r\ncial Needs - These are needs for love, affection and belongingness and\nsoci=\r\nal acceptance.People are social beings and try to satisfy their needs\nfor a=\r\ncceptance and friendship.\n\nEsteem - Once people&#39;s social needs are satisfie=\r\nd, they look for esteem\n(reputation). This need produces such satisfaction =\r\nas power, prestige status\nand self confidence. It includes both internal es=\r\nteem factors like\nself-respect, autonomy, achievements and external esteem =\r\nfactors such as\nrecognition and attention as well as personal sense of comp=\r\netence. (Source)\n\nSelf actualization - This need is the drive to become wha=\r\nt one is capable of\nbecoming. It&#39;s the need to grow and use abilities to th=\r\ne fullest potential.\nIt includes growth and self-fulfillment by achieving o=\r\nne&#39;s potential to\naccomplish something\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThe Pancha Koshas can b=\r\ne roughly understood as the 5 Needs of Humans, The\n&#39;Sheath&#39; or &#39;Koshas&#39; are=\r\n actually called &#39;cells&#39; in Human Body,\nPsychologically we can take it as o=\r\nur Physiological needs. The Sheath or the\ninvisible layers of our body need=\r\ns to be nourished systematically.\n\nThe Pancha Koshas or the 5 Sheath&#39;s are:=\r\n\n\nAnnamaya Kosha - Physiological needs (Food Nourishment)\nPraanamaya Kosha =\r\n- Safety or Security needs - (Energy)\nManomaya Kosha - Social Needs - (Emot=\r\nions)\nVijnanamaya Kosha - Esteem (Ego)\nAnandamaya Kosha - Self actualizatio=\r\nn (Brahman)\n\n\nBeing born as a Human being, the most primordial and basic ne=\r\ned to to keep\nit going is to fuel it. therefore every human begins his jour=\r\nney into\neternity from the Anna Maya Kosha or the Food Sheath. Here the Hum=\r\nan\nprimarily needs Food and Water for survival. His needs are limited to\nwo=\r\nrking out his way for his Food.\n\nThe Second need is energy. Praana simply m=\r\neans Energy. From the need for\nFood originates the energy. They are interre=\r\nlated to each other. This is\nprimarily signified by our breath. Our breath =\r\nis our basic energy. The Nadis\nor the Nerves carry out the energy to all pa=\r\nrts of the body to different\norgans to keep the body going. Here the Humans=\r\n need is to develop the\nEnergies in his Body.\n\nThirdly, Every human develop=\r\ns emotion. Emotional bonding with others and\nhimself. Here Human tries to u=\r\nnderstand whatever is happening to him. He\ndevelops an Emotive ability in d=\r\netermining and fulfilling all his emotions. The\nLove and understanding the =\r\nother, the need for a company, to Co\nexist.According to Scriptures there ar=\r\ne supposed to be Nava Rasas of 9 types\nof emotions.Here Human evolves himse=\r\nlf in the Nava Rasas.\n\nFourthly, Vijnanamaya Kosha is Mental level, It clea=\r\nrly signifies the\nIntellectual abilities, discrimination, here the Human is=\r\n really able to\nunderstand and appreciate the Truth! He begins to face the =\r\nreality face to\nface. Here the Ego &#39;I&#39; is more dominant than ever. In all t=\r\nhe previous\nstages above, the HUman is not aware of even His Ego. It is onl=\r\ny when he is\ntraveling in Vijnanamaya Kosha that he is able to learn about =\r\nhimself the\nEgo in Him. Most of us reside in Vijnanamaya Kosha fluctuating =\r\nbetween other\nKoshas. Here in when the Discriminative ability is Prominent.=\r\n\n\nAnanda Maya Kosha is the Sheath of Bliss or Sat Chit Ananda Here Perfecti=\r\non\nis achieved or what is called the Self Actualization by Maslow. This is =\r\nthe\nmost Natural State of the Human or the Soul. There is no more needs to =\r\nbe\nfulfilled. ABsolute Completeness. Brahman.\n\nThese are the invisible Shea=\r\nth or layers or cloths that cover the Soul or\nAtman or Brahman. When differ=\r\nent needs are met, it discards its layers one\nby one and finally in Vijnana=\r\nmaya Kosha or Self Esteem when the Ego Drops\nthe Brahman is only to be foun=\r\nd and is COMPLETE. and it has no more layers\nor Sheath to itself and it onl=\r\ny IS.\n\nBhagavan Ramana has explained that these are all inter oven,like a h=\r\nand\nkerchief.The hand kerchief has got a thickness, a colour, a texture, a =\r\nsize,\nand then the smell, depending upon the perfume one uses.All the five =\r\nsheaths\nare interoven as all the above things are interoven in the handkerc=\r\nhief.\n\nMarshall McLuhan, a Canadean Philosopher coined in the Term &quot;The wor=\r\nld is a\nGlobal Village&quot;\n\nIn the Vedas we have this idea from time immemoria=\r\nl &quot;Vasdeiva Kutumbakam&quot;\nThe world world in one family\n\n&quot;Ekam Sat Vipraha ba=\r\nhudha vadanti&quot; from The Rig Veda\nThere is but one God, learned scholars cal=\r\nl this God by different names\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e65c888610c12d048145a475\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Hierarchy of needs By Abraham M=\r\naslow, American Psychologist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abraham Maslow, American Psychol=\r\nogist, the Propounder of &quot;Self Actualization&quot; in his paper &quot;=\r\nHierarchy of needs&quot; on Human Motivation has included his observation o=\r\nn Humans innate curiosity and needs.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Maslow puts it this way, ever=\r\ny human has this Hierarchy of needs in the process where one is Self Actual=\r\nized or in our terms Self Realisation:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;Physiological needs=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;- These are the most basic human needs =\r\nwhich are important for sustenance like food, water, warmth, shelter, sleep=\r\n etc. Maslow argued that unless physiological needs are satisfied to a degr=\r\nee, no other motivating factor can work.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;Safety or Security needs&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0- These are needs to be free o=\r\nf physical danger and emotional harm like the fear of losing a job, propert=\r\ny, food or shelter.
