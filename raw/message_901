I understand the=\r\n MahaGanapathy homam is\nspecifically suitable as a remedy for people with K=\r\netu dosha.  \n\n2) I have an inexplainable affinity to the Sun God. I try to =\r\ndo a\nsimple Agnihotra Homam - although not religiously. \nMy apologies in ad=\r\nvance for inter-mixing Astrology in this forum. My\nAtmakaraka Budh is in it=\r\ns Moolatrikona rasi conjoined with Rahu in the\n12th house in Navamsa. There=\r\nfore, Leo is the sign which is 12th from\nAK&#39;s placement. There are no plane=\r\nnts in Leo, but its lordSun is\nexalted in Mesha(but alongwith Moon and Satu=\r\nrn) in 7th house in my\nchart. So is Sun worship (Agnihotra Homam) advisable=\r\n? Is a different\nHomam advisable given the planetary combination in my char=\r\nt (and a bad\nphase wrt marital life that I am current going through) ?? \n\nF=\r\nYI - My DoB particulars are 27th May 1975, Hyderabad, 00:05 (5\nminutes afte=\r\nr midnight). I have Gandanta Moola dosham/yoga. \nI am happy to donate a sma=\r\nll sum towards education of poor children\n(instead of offering some money a=\r\nt a temple) in your name, for any\nhelp/advice that you offer me with my cha=\r\nrt. \n \n\nKind regards\nSharad\n\n\n\n\n"}}
