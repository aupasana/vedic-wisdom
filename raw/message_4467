When I was only five years old I\nalready had visions of Sri Kris=\r\nhna. At first I thought every one could see\nthem. I once said to my mother:=\r\n =E2=80=9CLook! He&#39;s standing there!=E2=80=9D but she\nexplained to me that =\r\nonly I saw him.\n\nWhen I grew up I joined the army. However my desire for Go=\r\nd-experience grew\nso strong that after some years I resigned and decided to=\r\n devote my life to\nsadhana. I wanted to become a sannyasin but could not be=\r\ncause I had a wife\nand children to look after.\n\nOne day my wife was just se=\r\nrving my midday meal when a sadhu came and stood\nin the doorway. I invited =\r\nhim in and told her to serve him food too and then\nasked him whether he cou=\r\nld direct me to a Swami who could show me God. He\ntold me that I could find=\r\n what I was looking for from Ramana Maharshi of\nTiruvannamalai.\n\nThe next d=\r\nay I saw an advertisement in the paper for an ex-army man to run a\ncanteen =\r\nin Madras. I applied and was at once given the post and my fare\npaid.\n\nWhen=\r\n I got to Madras I said that I must first pay a visit to Tiruvannamalai\nbef=\r\nore taking up my duties.\n\nAs soon as I had an opportunity to see Bhagavan a=\r\nlone I asked him my usual\nquestion. I added: =E2=80=9CIt&#39;s a bargain. I am =\r\nwilling to pay any price, even my\nlife,but your part of the bargain is to e=\r\nnable me to see God.=E2=80=9D\n\nThen he said: =E2=80=9CI can enable you rath=\r\ner to be God than to see God.=E2=80=9D\n\nA few days later I went for a walk =\r\nin the rough country at the foot of the\nnorth slope of Arunachala and fell =\r\ninto a state of ecstasy during which I\nagain had a vision of Sri Krishna. W=\r\nhen I got back I told Bhagavan. He asked\nme: =E2=80=9Ccan you see Krishna n=\r\now?=E2=80=9D I said, =E2=80=9CNo; only when I have a vision.=E2=80=9D\n\nSo h=\r\ne said: =E2=80=9CWhat is the use of a God who comes and goes? If he is a re=\r\nal\nGod he should be with you always.=E2=80=9D\n\nThat shocked me. Again I alm=\r\nost lost faith in him, but some of the devotees\nexplained to me. Before I l=\r\neft for Madras I asked Bhagavan for a mantra but\nhe did not give me one. I =\r\nasked him for permission to take sannyas, but he\nrefused.\n\nI lost interest =\r\nin all the ritual and incantations and breathing exercises\nthat I had been =\r\ndoing up to then. For instance, I used to get up at three\no&#39;clock in the mo=\r\nrning to attend to my statue of Sri Krishna. All such\nthings ceased to inte=\r\nrest me. I was very worried about this. I thought it\nmeant I had become an =\r\natheist.\n\nAt the first opportunity I went to Tiruvannamalai. I told Bhagava=\r\nn about the\nchange that had come over me and how I had lost interest in all=\r\n the ritual\nthat I had been practising regularly for so many years past.\n\nB=\r\nhagavan looked steadily at me for some time and then said something to me\ni=\r\nn Tamil which I was told, on enquiry, meant =E2=80=9CYou, that is me, that =\r\nis\nBhagavan.=E2=80=9D\n\nThese words sank into my heart and I experienced the=\r\n most wonderful feeling\nof bliss I had ever known.\n\nIt was from this time t=\r\nhat I began to understand Bhagavan and his teaching.\n\nSource:\nhttp://www.sr=\r\niramanamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_June_2010.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd70b52b6278f04890c6515\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;(Published in The Mountain Path=\r\n, July 1965)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been a visionary from childhood.=C2=A0&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When I was only five years old I already had =\r\nvisions of Sri Krishna.
