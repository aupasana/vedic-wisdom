Yes the coconut will r=\r\not if you keep it outside in the sun for so long. \n\n\nI long back saw in Foo=\r\nd TV in US.....he kept the whole coconut in conventional oven for one hour.=\r\n Then he broke the shell with a hammer. The shell came out easily and the w=\r\nhole coconut stayed intact. \n\n\nI think once the shell comes out put the who=\r\nle coconut in oven again, that way the water will dry out and you will get =\r\na dry coconut.=C2=A0 You can shake the coconut to see if there is water ins=\r\nide or not and accordingly experiment. \n\n\nHope this works...good luck with =\r\nyour homams. Its amazing how god makes his devotees do homams even in musli=\r\nm land. \n\n\nBest regards,\nPriya\n\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\n From:=\r\n king_tanvir &lt;lord_rex@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Su=\r\nnday, March 25, 2012 6:05 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] First homam experience=\r\n\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste Narasimha Ji and other members\n\nI have performed a supe=\r\nr-short Shani Homam this evening. I thank you for guiding me so detailed...=\r\n without your manual it would never be possible.\n\nInteresting point to note=\r\n, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India and stayed with a Brahmin family for =\r\nabout 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of my visit was to learn doing homam! Ho=\r\nwever I was disappoint because their procedure was so big that it would tak=\r\ne about 3 hours for the homam, and many more materials also. Of course, the=\r\ny learnt it from &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it was their own tradition. They are not =\r\na modern researcher like you [Narasimha Ji] who could compare many traditio=\r\nns, research on them, and even come up with a shorter version. They had no =\r\nidea that a shorter version is possible, or something can be left out. As a=\r\nn example, they suggested a mantadory japam of 10x times before I do an &#39;x&#39;=\r\n times offering in homam, and many more formalities.\n\nSo, I knew in Banglad=\r\nesh I would never have so much materials needed, and I would not be able to=\r\n perform a 3 hour homam regularly, so it was of no use. \n\nMuch later when I=\r\n was reading your manual, I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from thei=\r\nr teaching :-)\n\nAnyway Ji...\n\nEverything was almost as per recommendation, =\r\nexcept I used a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn&#39;t manage a w=\r\nooden spoon even after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I =\r\nwill have to work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with w=\r\nood.\n\nI burnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.\n\nPurnahuti with ghe=\r\ne only.\n\nThat WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire, I had an idea =\r\nhow fast the woods were burning. So while I was moving with the homam, I kn=\r\new that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire will not survive=\r\n long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods were burning out =\r\nfast.\n\nSo I could not meditate.\n\nMy first Q. - 1) Would you have any sugges=\r\ntion how can I make the fire last long so that it burns for at least 10 min=\r\ns allowing me mediate? I noted even if I had put much wood, they would stil=\r\nl burn out fast...\n\nOffering full / half coconut seems to be the only thing=\r\n that would keep the fire alive for 10-15 mins and let me meditate.\n\nAnothe=\r\nr Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I=\r\n can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use them as sugges=\r\nted in the manual. HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut =\r\nso much that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced =\r\ncoconuts... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not=\r\n it be rotten or something? Any procedure? I am asking this because here no=\r\n one has any idea about that, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnabl=\r\ne&quot; full coconuts. That is why.\n\nMantras work very strong for me. But I feel=\r\n not strong enough for big spiritual or material effects. I have had very s=\r\ntrong experiences with homam before while performing with others. Even a fe=\r\nw times I *arranged* homams for others and I always directly felt a strong =\r\neffect working on me also.\n\nToday with the homam, the effect was not that s=\r\ntrong. I know why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras le=\r\nft. Also, I should honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lor=\r\nd Shani Deva in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I w=\r\nas worried and nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on t=\r\nheir presence. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.\n\nI am goi=\r\nng to add mantras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed=\r\n in all homams like Anugya, Kalasha Suddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I gu=\r\ness Avahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very important.\n\nBy the way I did =\r\n108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with the s=\r\nmallest Shani mantra again.\n\nI am thankful to the ultimate divinity that at=\r\n least I didn&#39;t have any negative experience after the homam. I was pretty =\r\nnervous about the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 when I starte=\r\nd mantras, almost everyday I faced negative energies for the imperfection o=\r\nf pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so strong. But=\r\n I didn&#39;t give up and tried to understand the correct ways because since I =\r\nsaw the power in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way to get the pure ble=\r\nssings, avoiding mistakes.\n\nAs an example, you [Narasimha Ji] instructed to=\r\n stay in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find this 100% true from my =\r\nmantra japam experience. Though no website or almost no one instructed me t=\r\no stay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantras work very strong with=\r\n empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effects when I did japam=\r\n after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own experience but after a l=\r\not of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now days, I can&#39;t eat=\r\n anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in the evening. At times i=\r\nt becomes very difficult not to eat something as I sometimes hang out with =\r\nfriends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no choice.\n\nThat is =\r\nthe thing I appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to make the small [yet very=\r\n important] things always mentioned.\n\nSame thing about your instruction of =\r\nminimum movement of the body, I find it very correct.\n\nAnyway Ji I guess I =\r\nam stretching my mail very long...\n\nmy 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I =\r\ntake Shani as an expression of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can=\r\n offer other Gods&#39; mantras in fire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way=\r\n, or at least a homam for 6-7 grahas?\n\n4) If yes, should I maintain the gra=\r\nha order such as Surya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?\n\n5) Is there any exception=\r\nal instruction while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?=\r\n\n\nWanted to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and=\r\n other deities but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these=\r\n additional questions about graha-homams.\n\nAppreciate your time to answer m=\r\ne.\n\nThanking you again,\nTanvir\n\n\n \r\n--512224004-1508242872-1332864939=:19999\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&quot;Ano=\r\nther Q. - 2) I have sliced coconut copras and drying them for last \n3-4 day=\r\ns, I can dry them no matter how long it takes, so that I can use \nthem as s=\r\nuggested in the manual.

But I have no choi=\r\nce.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThat is the thing I appreciate about you [Narasimha Ji] to mak=\r\ne the small [yet very important] things always mentioned.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSame thi=\r\nng about your instruction of minimum movement of the body, I find it very c=\r\norrect.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnyway Ji I guess I am stretching my mail very long...&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nmy 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expression of=\r\n the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods&#39; mantras in =\r\nfire too. Can I do a Navagraha homam this way, or at least a homam for 6-7 =\r\ngrahas?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such as Surya=\r\n, Chandra, Kuja and so on?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n5) Is there any exceptional instruction=\r\n while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWant=\r\ned to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and other=\r\n deities but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these addit=\r\nional questions about graha-homams.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAppreciate your time to answer=\r\n me.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThanking you again,&lt;br&gt;\nTanvir&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  =\r\n   \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--512224004-1508242872-1332864939=:19999--\r\n\n"}}
