One person was doing =\r\ndaily Chandi homam and invoking Mahalakshmi as the main deity. He was using=\r\n the dhyana shloka for Mahalakshmi from &quot;Vaikritika Rahasyam&quot; (shvetAnanA n=\r\nIlabhujA sushveta stana maNDalA...). He later switched to a different dhyan=\r\na shloka - the one for Adyadi Mahalakshmi from whom Mahakali, Mahalakshmi a=\r\nnd Mahasaraswati came - from &quot;Pradhanika Rahasyam&quot; (sarvasyAdyA mahAlakShmI=\r\nH trigunA parameshvarI...), thinking that it was superior.\n=A0\nHis guru tol=\r\nd him after a few months, &quot;whatever dhyana shloka you use, know its meaning=\r\n and physically imagine someone in that form&quot;. He came and asked me for the=\r\n meaning. I discouraged him, &quot;I don&#39;t think you really want to know the mea=\r\nning and physically imagine someone in that form&quot;. When he insisted, I told=\r\n him the meaning.\n=A0\nThe verses describe Mahalakshmi who is the &quot;First amo=\r\nng all&quot; (sarvasya AdyA) and having all 3 gunas. She is described as holding=\r\n in her hands a liquor bowl, snake, male genital, female genital, king&#39;s he=\r\nad etc. Of course, if one starts imagining such a form, it may distract one=\r\n&#39;s mind based on one&#39;s conditioning!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThe thing here is that these symbols represent some subt=\r\nle things. The &quot;Initial Kinetic Energy&quot; from which whole creation came abou=\r\nt obviously works by intoxicating parts of consciousness with notions (liqu=\r\nor bowl), giving rise to notions of gender and identity (male and female ge=\r\nnitals), self-awareness/Kundalini (snake), egosense (king&#39;s head) etc. When=\r\n one is dealing with such Initial or high level energies, concepts become s=\r\nubtle/abstract. If one wants an explicit outer form, it is better to imagin=\r\ne slightly lower level manifestations with specific gunas and purposes.\n=A0=\r\n\nLet me say it in different words. The Kinetic energy of Purushottama is be=\r\nyond our thoughts, perception and imagination. Various descriptions and ima=\r\ngery in various scriptures are very likely to be misunderstood by us based =\r\non our conditioning. It&#39;s just too hi-fi for foolish and egoistic ignoramus=\r\nes of Kali yuga, like us.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & =\r\nSpirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=A0\n=A0\nOn =\r\nMon, Oct 1, 2012 at 5:06 PM, &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:\n=A0\nDear Narasimha,\n=A0\nI had=\r\n two questions on which I wanted you views.\n=A0\n1 - In the Gita we find a p=\r\nhilosophy which focuses on Purushottama=A0 as the ultimate. In the Tantras =\r\nwe find the focus on Divine Mother as ultimate. Are these two - Adya Shakti=\r\n and Purushottama - the same Being, but referred to in different terms? And=\r\n why this sudden difference in the expression found?\n=A0\n2 - This question =\r\nis more complex. I read and re-read the Pradhanika Rahasya of the Sri Chand=\r\ni. I could not understand it to my heart&#39;s satisfaction, I mean I understoo=\r\nd what was being said but always had the feeling that here is description o=\r\nf reality far deeper than what meaning I can derive from the surface. Why d=\r\nid Makalakshami - the Supreme Mother - come first among=A0 Mahakali, Mahala=\r\nkshmi and Mahasaraswati. Further, from Mahakali comes out Shiva and Saraswa=\r\nti, from Mahalakshmi comes Brahma and Lakshmi and from Mahasaraswati comes =\r\nVishnu and Parvati! Then from verse 25 says -\nbrahmaNe pradadau patnIM mahA=\r\nlakShmInR^ipa trayIm.h |\nrudrAya gaurIM varadAM vAsudevAya cha shriyam.h ||=\r\n 25 ||\n=A0\n&quot;To Brahma as a wife, Mahalakshmi gave Trayi oh king.=A0 To Rudr=\r\na, Gauri,\nand to Vasudeva, Shri.&quot;\n=A0\nConfusing on apparent meaning. I mean=\r\n, why were the couple-forms created in one formation and then made to funct=\r\nion in another formation..\nThe text also says that only one who has eyes of=\r\n gyana will understand this.

The Kinetic e=\r\nnergy of Purushottama is beyond our thoughts, perception and imagination. V=\r\narious descriptions and imagery in various scriptures are very likely to be=\r\n misunderstood by us based on our conditioning. It&#39;s just too hi-fi for foo=\r\nlish and egoistic ignoramuses of Kali yuga, like us.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best rega=\r\nrds,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On Mon, Oct 1, 2012 at 5:06 PM, &lt;de=\r\nleted&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I had two questi=\r\nons on which I wanted you views.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;1 - In the Gita we find a phi=\r\nlosophy which focuses on Purushottama&nbsp; as the ultimate. In the Tantras=\r\n we find the focus on Divine Mother as ultimate. Are these two - Adya Shakt=\r\ni and\n Purushottama - the same Being, but referred to in different terms? A=\r\nnd why this sudden difference in the expression found?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;2 - Thi=\r\ns question is more complex. I read and re-read the Pradhanika Rahasya of th=\r\ne Sri Chandi. I could not understand it to my heart&#39;s satisfaction, I mean =\r\nI understood what was being said but always had the feeling that here is de=\r\nscription of reality far deeper than what meaning I can derive from the sur=\r\nface. Why did Makalakshami - the Supreme Mother - come first among&nbsp; Ma=\r\nhakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati. Further, from Mahakali comes out Shi=\r\nva and Saraswati, from Mahalakshmi comes Brahma and Lakshmi and from Mahasa=\r\nraswati comes Vishnu and Parvati! Then from verse 25 says -&lt;br&gt;brahmaNe pra=\r\ndadau patnIM mahAlakShmInR^ipa trayIm.h |&lt;br&gt;rudrAya gaurIM varadAM vAsudev=\r\nAya cha shriyam.h || 25 ||&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;To Brahma as a wife, Mahalakshmi g=\r\nave Trayi oh king.&nbsp; To Rudra, Gauri,&lt;br&gt;and to Vasudeva,\n Shri.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Confusing on apparent meaning. I mean, why were the couple-forms cr=\r\neated in one formation and then made to function in another formation..&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe text also says that only one who has eyes of gyana will understand this=\r\n. I obviously have no such thing, and could not, even mentally,&lt;br&gt;understa=\r\nnd this process. Hope you can throw some light.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&l=\r\nt;deleted&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-siz=\r\ne: 13.3333px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: tr=\r\nansparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1287737115-1848379286-1353554995=:60506--\r\n\n"}}
