What is the common sense understa=\r\nnding, but one gained from\n&gt; observation of life uptill the age of say 18!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Something moving at an extremely fast pace does not observe space-t=\r\nime\n&gt; as you or I do.

Which\n&gt; m=\r\neans what someone can say at best is the probability of finding an\n&gt; electr=\r\non at a certain distance from the nucleus, only a probability.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; And =\r\nall these have been derived from hardcore mathematical process.\n&gt; Not just =\r\nspeculations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After reading Narasimhaji&#39;s mail I realized the probl=\r\nem arises because\n&gt; of the structure of our commonsense at this reference f=\r\nrame. That is why\n&gt; when we are here, this theoritical problem arises, but =\r\nsay you become\n&gt; the supreme being, the problem itself does not exist.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; There are a set of particles called Tachyons which move at speeds\n&gt; gre=\r\nater than that of light and whole of cause and effect gets reversed\n&gt; for t=\r\nhem.

BUT please explain to me about the supreme\n&gt; cosmic being who is a =\r\nsole link between Dual and Non-dual self. now as\n&gt; you have mentioned (pl. =\r\nrefer to no.1 above) he is all knower so every\n&gt; possibility is known to hi=\r\nm and not only every possibility but even\n&gt; every action going to be taken =\r\nin a perticular Space-time zone and what\n&gt; the eventual result. we call him=\r\n by Naraayana/Shiva/ Bhagavati/\n&gt; GOD/Allah/ Ganapati (As per Atharvashirsh=\r\n) and many such names depending\n&gt; on our faiths.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The point no.1 ind=\r\nicates that HE is all knower and point no.2\n&gt; indicates that Free will is c=\r\nertainly there at our Spac-time level.

There=\r\n is no concept of time or space or space-time continuum\n&gt; within non-dual s=\r\nelf. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of\n&gt; space or time or ob=\r\njectification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality=\r\n and non-duality.\n&gt; Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self capt=\r\nures the entire\n&gt; field of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and=\r\n all space-time\n&gt; continua within the field of duality exist within Him. Fr=\r\nom the\n&gt; perspective of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world =\r\nare\n&gt; His parts and all their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will=\r\n.\n&gt; As all space-time continua are within Him, there is nothing that is\n&gt; u=\r\nnknown to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere; I,\n&gt; y=\r\nou and others, this possibility, that possibility and yet another\n&gt; possibi=\r\nlity - all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His\n&gt; self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, let us come lower and into the field of duality. The field of\n&gt; =\r\nduality consists of infinite divisions of space, time and space-time\n&gt; cont=\r\ninua. There are infinite possibilities within this field.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Norma=\r\nlly, people stuck deeply within duality have a linear sense of\n&gt; time and p=\r\nerceive just a part of one space-time continuum. However,\n&gt; field of dualit=\r\ny also contains planes of consciousness where different\n&gt; senses of time an=\r\nd different space-time continua (that may intersect at\n&gt; various points) ex=\r\nist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time\n&gt; continuum in such a plane o=\r\nf consciousness may experience a point of\n&gt; time that maps to a future time=\r\n in a regular space-time continuum being\n&gt; experienced by you. Also, what i=\r\ns 1 minute in one space-time continuum\n&gt; may be 1 year in another space-tim=\r\ne continuum. Time is not as\n&gt; straight-forward an entity as one may think. =\r\nBasically, the field of\n&gt; duality contains infinite space-time continua and=\r\n what one experiences\n&gt; depends on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s se=\r\nlf-awareness\n&gt; (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a spec=\r\nific\n&gt; space-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality. =\r\nBut\n&gt; relaity\n&gt; &gt; consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect e=\r\nach other.\n&gt; These are all different possibilities and you chart out your c=\r\nourse\n&gt; based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is in a differe=\r\nnt space-time\n&gt; continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;fu=\r\nture&quot; as per\n&gt; the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the p=\r\nerspective\n&gt; of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at tha=\r\nt future\n&gt; time is not yet known and depends on your current action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state in\n=\r\n&gt; future, his observation is merely an observation and from his reference\n&gt;=\r\n frame. It has no causal relationship to your current action or your\n&gt; futu=\r\nre state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to\n&gt; happ=\r\nen. His observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does\n&gt; not cov=\r\ner all the space-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel\n&gt; to reach=\r\n the space-time pair where he observed you (if at all you do!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let us go further. Is there only one future possible for=\r\n you? Or,\n&gt; does the path traversed by you in space-time continuum not fixe=\r\nd but\n&gt; variable based on your actions? Can your actions at important\n&gt; cro=\r\nss-roads alter the course you traverse?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, what is the mean=\r\ning of a yogi observing you at a space-time\n&gt; pair? Is his observation only=\r\n a possibility or a certainty? One may say\n&gt; &quot;how can one observe a possibi=\r\nlity? Anything we observe must be a\n&gt; certainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren=\r\n&#39;t the field of duality and the\n&gt; infinite space-time continua contained in=\r\n it merely a set of infinite\n&gt; possibilities?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some great rishis=\r\n can see not just a space-time pair, but many\n&gt; space-time continua at the =\r\nsame time, i.e. they can see various\n&gt; possibilities based on various possi=\r\nble actions. However, visions seen\n&gt; by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just =\r\none possibility.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline: At the level at =\r\nwhich we exist, there is certainly\n&gt; something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within th=\r\ne limits imposed by the reactions\n&gt; given by nature to your own previous ac=\r\ntions, you do have a scope for\n&gt; engaging in different actions at this time=\r\n. Depending on which action\n&gt; you engage in, the future can be slightly dif=\r\nferent. Some actions can\n&gt; even make the future significantly different. A =\r\nrishi may be able to\n&gt; chart out a significant portion of the field of poss=\r\nibilities for future\n&gt; (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out mos=\r\nt possibilities upto\n&gt; 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to =\r\nsee a few\n&gt; possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figurin=\r\ng out a\n&gt; few moves or guessing a future position). But the supreme cosmic =\r\nbeing\n&gt; knows the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist within H=\r\nim.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. th=\r\ne\n&gt; reference frame of your consciousness! ) some of those possibilities.\n&gt;=\r\n One may know all the possibilities quite deeply and even guess the\n&gt; possi=\r\nbility that will come to fruition, but it is your actions that\n&gt; actually m=\r\nake some of those possibilities a reality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ hom=\r\nam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; No doub=\r\nt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however, I\n&gt; could not help=\r\n it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind.

But\n&gt; then if the=\r\n Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then such\n&gt; a self corr=\r\necting option is already negated out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a=\r\n very large viewpoint no one has any choice\n&gt; in the sense that finally eve=\r\nryone will end up merging with the divine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess freewill =\r\nis not really as free as we love to think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rajar=\r\nshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future=\r\n, bestest homam, purity\n&gt; and overcoming ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very sho=\r\nrt Chandi\n&gt; homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the f=\r\nollowing\n&gt; mail:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/=\r\nmessage/ 761\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not =\r\nproficient in his\n&gt; knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some =\r\nof the ten\n&gt; incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was =\r\nwho and a\n&gt; little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man wi=\r\nth white\n&gt; clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was =\r\nKalki\n&gt; and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy is u=\r\nsually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was\n&gt; with him one morn=\r\ning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was\n&gt; abou a week after t=\r\nhe episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he was thi=\r\nnking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future\n&gt; that is to come has not alread=\r\ny happened. It has already happened in\n&gt; reality, but it will happen later =\r\nwhen the time comes. You know what I\n&gt; mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting=\r\n at, but pretended not to know. I\n&gt; said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is\n&gt; not=\r\n known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main\n&gt; characteristic is=\r\n that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind,\n&gt; contented and relaxed=\r\n. However, he was onto something today. But he\n&gt; could not express himself.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happ=\r\nened\n&gt; at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like =\r\na\n&gt; movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some\n&gt; =\r\npeople may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen\n&gt; later=\r\n will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying\n&gt; something li=\r\nke that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If =\r\nsomething is\n&gt; going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes.=\r\n But\n&gt; somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has\n&gt;=\r\n already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he=\r\n was thinking along these\n&gt; lines. When I told him the man riding the horse=\r\n in his vision over the\n&gt; fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was pro=\r\nbably confused. Given\n&gt; his age and ability to think and understand things,=\r\n this probably seemed\n&gt; like an oddity to him that he should see somebody w=\r\nho had not yet come.\n&gt; So he was trying to think how it was possible and ca=\r\nme to some important\n&gt; conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in\n&gt; man=\r\ny planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It\n&gt; even =\r\nloses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or\n&gt; Brahman o=\r\nr Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very sh=\r\nort Kaali homam with a small\n&gt; naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaaks=\r\nhara added before name. When\n&gt; we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt=\r\n a very intense and powerful\n&gt; energy. It was quite different from the ener=\r\ngy I feel normally. This\n&gt; intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and b=\r\nlissful and a feeling\n&gt; that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am don=\r\ne here. I have\n&gt; nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire c=\r\nonsciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy =\r\ntwice before that.\n&gt; Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditati=\r\nng sitting next to\n&gt; my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. =\r\nSecond time was\n&gt; when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside t=\r\nhe garbhaalaya\n&gt; of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main K=\r\naali idol\n&gt; there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in =\r\nthe past.\n&gt; The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At n=\r\no other\n&gt; time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, a=\r\nfter we finished meditation and opened eyes, that\n&gt; boy remarked, &quot;out of a=\r\nll the different homas I did so far, this is the\n&gt; bestest homam.&quot; I asked =\r\nhim why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it,\n&gt; but it just felt awesome a=\r\nnd different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a really si=\r\nmple and short procedure, shorter than\n&gt; what I give in manuals. But it see=\r\nmed like he was successful in making a\n&gt; powerful energy manifest there. Th=\r\ne bottomline is that internal purity\n&gt; is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and\n&gt; =\r\nget more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep\n&gt; =\r\ndoing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen =\r\nspiritual practices, but do pay\n&gt; attention to internal purity as you engag=\r\ne in external practices. The\n&gt; only worthwhile measure of spiritual progres=\r\ns and purity is how smaller\n&gt; your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you=\r\n can resist attraction to\n&gt; external things better and you can resist inter=\r\nnal enemies like lust,\n&gt; anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma =\r\nbetter. Ego - thinking\n&gt; that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root =\r\ncause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using j=\r\nnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but\n&gt; bhakti yoga is easier. Think th=\r\nat all that is around you - including\n&gt; your house, money, cars, spouse, ch=\r\nildren and your own body - is god&#39;s\n&gt; property and that you are a temporary=\r\n caretaker of all of these\n&gt; properties of god. Do the best job you can, bu=\r\nt without entertaining the\n&gt; notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant take=\r\ns very good care of his\n&gt; master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all =\r\nthose things as his or\n&gt; her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Realize that thinking =\r\nof things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for\n&gt; taking good care of them. A serv=\r\nant who loves one&#39;s master takes the\n&gt; best care of things entrusted to one=\r\n. When a thing is taken away, a\n&gt; servant does not waste time worrying and =\r\ncrying. A servant will accept\n&gt; that is master&#39;s property and can be taken =\r\naway anytime. This enables\n&gt; one to do the best job with what one possesses=\r\n and not worry about what\n&gt; one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s co=\r\nntrol.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of m=\r\naster&#39;s\n&gt; properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without g=\r\netting\n&gt; caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nsoftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yahoo! recommends that you u=\r\npgrade to the new and safer Internet\n&gt; Explorer 8. http://downloads.yahoo.c=\r\nom/in/internetexplorer/\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
