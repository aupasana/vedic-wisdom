What is f=\r\nuture today becomes present tomorrow and past later. Hence the concept of t=\r\nime is inevitably synonymous with death.\n\nDakshina also means south-facing =\r\nor the realm of death, and Bhadra means auspicious, as the great Mother Kal=\r\ni through death reminds of the truth of the ephemeral nature of our life/li=\r\nves and grants us moksha, thereby relieving us temporary death and hence fe=\r\nar!\n\nSince the concept of death has to be dealt by tantric practitioners on=\r\n their path, they are first introduced to Kali, who is the first among the =\r\nDasa (10) Mahavidyas.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanks\nNarayan\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasm=\r\nihaji\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I had gone home for a few days and had the good f=\r\nortune of being able to spend a lot of time at the Kalighat temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n There I heard the priests reciting mantras of Dakshina Kali. \n&gt; \n&gt; What is=\r\n the difference between Dakshina Kali and Bhardra Kali?\n&gt; \n&gt; Both these for=\r\nms are prayed across west bengal but I can&#39;t find out the difference betwee=\r\nn these two forms..\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
