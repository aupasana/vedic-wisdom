These are the steps I follow for=\r\n the homa:\n=C2=A0\nI keep the copper kunda in an aluminum tray, which rests =\r\nupon two bricks on the floor, and the two bricks are on top of a folded hea=\r\nvy-duty black garbage bag. I don&#39;t fuss much about cleaning before and afte=\r\nr each homa, because this arrangement protects the floor, so just on the we=\r\nekends, I clean it up properly by replacing / emptying the tray, and vacuum=\r\ning / wiping any residue. This havan &quot;area&quot; is fixed and I do not remove it=\r\n after each homa--it&#39;s like a fixed altar. \n=C2=A0\nNext to the kunda area, =\r\nI keep a small shrine where everything is laid out for the daily homa. Ther=\r\ne is a small mandap for keeping the kalasha and vigrahas, and in front, I k=\r\neep a supply of the samagri needed for the puja (ghee, aarti tray with diya=\r\n and dhoop stand, kumkum, gandhan, agarbatti, etc.), oil for the diya, matc=\r\nhes=C2=A0and a tray full of coconut halves. (I do not cut the coconut halve=\r\ns into strips for the homa; I just use one coconut half per homa). This arr=\r\nangement prevents having to=C2=A0gather and arrange=C2=A0everything from sc=\r\nratch each day.\n=C2=A0\nThe main kalasha I only exchange the water once a we=\r\nek; during the week, I let=C2=A0the water=C2=A0accumulate the vrttis from t=\r\nhe successive homas.\n=C2=A0\nAccordingly, on any given day, all I have to do=\r\n to prepare for the homa is the following: Empty the burnt offerings from t=\r\nhe previous day&#39;s homa (which I offer to my plants outside as &quot;fertilizer&quot;-=\r\n-they really thrive on it!), fill the pancha patra with water, and cut a fe=\r\nw flowers for the homa offerings. I bring these back to the havan kund, fil=\r\nl the lamp with oil and a wick, arrange the vigrhas for that day&#39;s homa (I =\r\ndo homa to different deities on different days), put the prasad in a little=\r\n offering bowl, and can sit directly for homa. So, this whole procedure tak=\r\nes me less than 5 mins. \n=C2=A0\nI do not bother with melting the ghee, even=\r\n though I live in cold climes in England. I have a 1/2 kg container of ghee=\r\n, that I use each day, and I find that after using it once, it stays in mel=\r\nted / liquidish form (if homa is done at least every 2-3 days) and once I b=\r\nring the wooden spoon to the kund and heat up the ghee, and go back to scoo=\r\np some more ghee from the container, the heat from the spoon does the rest =\r\nof the melting.
