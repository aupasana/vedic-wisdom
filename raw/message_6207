Until man&#39;=\r\ns nature changes, these physical needs will arise, and miseries will always=\r\n be felt, and no amount of physical help will cure them completely. The onl=\r\ny solution of this problem is to make mankind pure. Ignorance is the mother=\r\n of all the evil and all the misery we see. Let men have light, let them be=\r\n pure and spiritually strong and educated, then alone will misery cease in =\r\nthe world, not before.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
