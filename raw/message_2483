I was wondering if the Chandi Homam procedure can be adapted to\naccommodate this, so that the homam is done each of the days but only\noffering as ahutis the verses from the particular chapters to be\nchanted that day. I thought it would be an alternative for those of us\nwho are not yet adept in doing the entire Chandi homam in one setting,\nbut I do not know whether it would be inappropriate or if the\npreliminary or concluding portions of the homam would need to be\nmodified accordingly.\n\nI would be grateful for any feedback.\n\nWarm regards,\nAditi\n\n"}}
