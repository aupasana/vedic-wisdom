While a really spiritual person must con=\r\ntinuously try to destroy ego, so many spiritual gurus are there around us w=\r\nith bloated egos which are easily offended at a hint of criticism or overly=\r\n excited at sycophancy. Such gurus are not of much use.\n \nBut how do separa=\r\nte the grains from the chaff? It is not easy, especially when there are jus=\r\nt a few grains in the middle of a big pile of chaff. Astrology is useful bu=\r\nt not that much. Astrologer&#39;s mind, which makes the final judgments, works =\r\nbased on his/her prejudices and secret beliefs.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn =\r\nthe past, many great souls used intellectual discrimination and intuition t=\r\no judge one&#39;s guru for a long time before whole-heartedly embracing one&#39;s g=\r\nuru. In many traditions within Hinduism, this is encouraged. You do not acc=\r\nept a guru in an impulse. You &quot;test&quot; your guru and take your time to accept=\r\n him. But, once you accept a person as your guru, you follow him faithfully=\r\n.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you take Narendra (Swami Vivekananda), the cel=\r\nebrated disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he was a highly rational and s=\r\nkeptical young man. Though Ramakrishna had induced a samadhi in Narendra by=\r\n mere touch in their second meeting itself, it was not enough to convince N=\r\narendra of Ramakrishna&#39;s ability and purity. He thought the whole experienc=\r\ne could just have been a hallucination/hypnotism and did not jump to any co=\r\nnclusion. As he visited Ramakrishna continuously, received love and knowled=\r\nge from him and saw that Ramakrishna indeed walked the walk (as opposed to =\r\njust talking the talk), he was slowly convinced of the purity of Ramakrishn=\r\na. He then became a tireless soldier who dedicated his life to carrying out=\r\n the mission of his guru!\n \nDuring the early stages, he even told Ramakrish=\r\nna bluntly about the latter&#39;s visions of Kali, Krishna, Rama etc, &quot;Sir, the=\r\ny could all just be your imaginations or hallucinations&quot;. Narendra did not =\r\neven believe in god with a form and believed only in the formless. Ramakris=\r\nhna was never offended at these comments.\n \nOther sishyas like Joginder (Sw=\r\nami Yogananda) also approached Ramakrishna skeptically and tested him for a=\r\n duration. These young men who surrounded Ramakrishna weren&#39;t blind men led=\r\n by a blind man. They were all rishis or associates of rishis, who were reb=\r\norn together for a purpose.\n \nThey observed Ramakrishna for a while, confir=\r\nmed that he practiced what he preached and realized that there was a valuab=\r\nle lesson in each action and word of his. They took a while to realize his =\r\npurity and divinity, but once they realized they became faithful sishyas. H=\r\ne accepted them, loved them and taught them even before they realized his t=\r\nrue nature and accepted him fully as their guru. He knew they were skeptica=\r\nl and testing him, but he was never offended (what good is a guru who canno=\r\nt recognize a worthy student and what good is a guru whose ego is insulted =\r\nat someone&#39;s skepticism). Once they accepted him and became faithful sishya=\r\ns, each one of them was also transformed into a really pure person who take=\r\ns the entire life as a sadhana and maintains purity in every thought and ac=\r\ntion. Each sishya of a Ramakrishna was a role model in spiritual purity.\n \n=\r\n*        *        *\n  \nOne whose rinas draw one towards a fake guru gets su=\r\nch a guru because that is what his karmas entitle him to. The circumstances=\r\n we have to face are based on the previous actions. But the current action =\r\n(freewill) is in our hands. If one can truly believe from the deepest cores=\r\n of heart that one&#39;s guru is pure and like Shiva himself, follows guru blin=\r\ndly and entertains no doubt whatsoever, that WILL pay off oneday. Nature WI=\r\nLL bring light into that person&#39;s spiritual life. It is just a matter of ti=\r\nme.\n \nThus, I will not be judgmental about other gurus and their sishyas. I=\r\nf a sishya believes in his/her guru fully, so be it. It is not our business=\r\n.\n \nBut, if one were to find a guru like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa or Ramana =\r\nMaharshi or Sri Aurobindo or Srila Prabhupada, it is one&#39;s immense luck. Ho=\r\nwever, the point I want to make is that having a great guru is not a guaran=\r\ntee of success and also having a fake guru is not a guarantee of failure!\n =\r\n\nAt the end of the day, the measure of success in any sadhana is the purity=\r\n generated by that sadhana. The measure of the purity is the effacement of =\r\nego. If ego is reduced completely or eliminated, one is making progress. Th=\r\nis can happen inspite of who is the guru, what one is doing etc.\n \nWhen the=\r\n full grace of the Supreme Being falls on a person, any medium is sufficien=\r\nt to reflect that grace.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  =\r\nFrom: Lakshmi Kary \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Monday, Sep=\r\ntember 29, 2008 2:06 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma=\r\n)\n\n\n  Hare Rama Krishna\n  Dear Narasimha.\n  Sorry I got my people and linea=\r\nges all confused!

But Ramakrishna Paramahamsa stands out in =\r\none way. He is one master who mastered every single path. He mastered bhakt=\r\ni yoga, jnaana yoga, karma yoga and even raaja yoga. He worshipped and expe=\r\nrienced Rama, Krishna, Kaali and several forms. He even reached the state o=\r\nf nirvikalpa samadhi, where there is no &quot;experience&quot;. He was in sahaja sama=\r\ndhi always. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere touc=\r\nh or mere look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego (that is wh=\r\ny he could do all that!!!).\n\n        Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on the=\r\nir sishyas and have no ability to recognize the true nature and dharma of e=\r\nach sishya. They force sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the =\r\nform they worship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight=\r\n into the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instructions. He tau=\r\nght totally different mantras, totally different forms and totally differen=\r\nt paths to different sishyas. He even taught contradictory things to differ=\r\nent sishyas. When one sishya who needed to mend his aggressive attitude rou=\r\nghed up somebody for insulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With you=\r\nr attitude, you did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. You sho=\r\nuld learn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your guru in =\r\na good stead and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who needed to me=\r\nnd his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by some people and came=\r\n away silently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you. Shastras say that you should =\r\nkill one who insults your guru. How can you ignore such wrong behavior? You=\r\n should give them a piece of your mind.&quot;\n\n        Spiritual sadhana does no=\r\nt mean just chanting a mantra or repeating a procedure everyday for a certa=\r\nin period of time. Spiritual sadhana is a continuous process by which one t=\r\nransforms oneself from inside out and purifies oneself. That way, every act=\r\nion and every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an opportunity for intro=\r\nspection and transformation of internal attitude.\n\n        Anyway, coming b=\r\nack to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal sadhaka or a normal guru. He =\r\nbelonged to a very special class of sadhakas and he was an exceptional guru=\r\n to an exceptional group of sishyas.\n\n        Without his [indirect] blessi=\r\nngs, I would be a nobody and would be lower than dirt.

It is dependent on what nature expects from you, \n               =\r\n   which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions yo=\r\nu \n                  did in the past while identifying with the action, who=\r\n you affected in the \n                  past (and how) with the actions tha=\r\nt you identified with, what debts you \n                  created in the pro=\r\ncess, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until \n                  n=\r\now.\n\n                  If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debt=\r\ns, nature wants a person \n                  to kill evil persons, that beco=\r\nmes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \n                  tendencies a=\r\nnd karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \n          =\r\n        uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based o=\r\nn one&#39;s \n                  mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants=\r\n a person to spread the \n                  ritual of homam in the world, th=\r\nat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \n                  mental tende=\r\nncies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \n           =\r\n       money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n          =\r\n        * * *\n\n                  The dharma of a being may change from one =\r\nlife to another.\n\n                  At the time of Mahabharata war, it was =\r\nArjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \n                  elders and relatives.=\r\n The time then was such that there was too much weight \n                  o=\r\nn earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n=\r\n                  destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed =\r\nto a great extent, \n                  to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone=\r\n for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \n                  it was his dharma=\r\n to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \n                  res=\r\npected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n\n        =\r\n          When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of=\r\n \n                  Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had=\r\n been Arjuna in a \n                  previous life, according to Ramakrishn=\r\na) , his dharma was different in this \n                  new time and place=\r\n. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n                  aris=\r\ntocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \n       =\r\n           generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and se=\r\nrvice to \n                  others. When he is born again (which he has to,=\r\n as per what Ramakrishna \n                  said), his dharma based on the =\r\ntime and place may be something else.\n\n                  * * *\n\n           =\r\n       The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\n =\r\n                 Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follo=\r\nw your own dharma \n                  and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the =\r\nlight of castism. Though the concept \n                  of caste (varna) ha=\r\ns been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n                 =\r\n caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n   =\r\n               killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vi=\r\nshwamitra was a \n                  kshatrita and a powerful king. He became=\r\n a brahmana and and a maharshi \n                  later. Basically varna sh=\r\nows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \n                  of fat=\r\nher, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one \n         =\r\n         develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.=\r\n\n\n                  Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which te=\r\nlls you to know your \n                  dharma from your caste is wrong. Mo=\r\nreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n                  the world. Each =\r\nperson has individual dharma.\n\n                  Knowing what one&#39;s dharma =\r\nis is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n                  enough, o=\r\nne will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n       =\r\n           mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a=\r\n lot of \n                  noise from other parts of our minds which tell o=\r\nther things. Thus, we get \n                  confused.\n\n                  W=\r\ne should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and =\r\n\n                  decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We ma=\r\ny be err, but doing \n                  the best we can is all that we can d=\r\no!\n\n                  More than following dharma, what is of utmost importa=\r\nnce is to engage in \n                  actions without identification. *Tha=\r\nt* alone ensures that we are not \n                  accumulating new karmas=\r\n, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build \n                  too =\r\nmuch attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best \n       =\r\n           possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma =\r\nin the given \n                  situation is), with as little attachment an=\r\nd self-identification with the \n                  action as possible. When =\r\nthe action is finished, we should leave the result \n                  to go=\r\nd. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n      =\r\n            work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication th=\r\nrough \n                  untached action) will simplify our ego and purify =\r\nour consciousness slowly. \n                  As we become purer, our mind w=\r\nill work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n                  There is a=\r\n positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n           =\r\n       dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is n=\r\not easy, \n                  but not as difficult as people think.\n\n        =\r\n          The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one=\r\n&#39;s sense of \n                  &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time i=\r\nf one engages in action with \n                  little attachment.\n\n       =\r\n           * * *\n\n                  In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intelle=\r\nct and intuition are the inputs. \n                  Another external input =\r\nis the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n                  deri=\r\nve one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n   =\r\n               master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can tak=\r\ne the words of \n                  the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and =\r\nfollow it sincerely.\n\n                  When Arjuna was confused about what=\r\n his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n                  and relatives =\r\nwas not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n               =\r\n   dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dha=\r\nrma \n                  and wanted to renounce the world and go to a seclude=\r\nd place to do sadhana, \n                  Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and=\r\n prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n                  world and do=\r\n the work of Mother for him.\n\n                  One who is not in tune with=\r\n nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n                  debts a=\r\nre and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n      =\r\n            one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear=\r\n insight into \n                  one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give per=\r\nfect guidance.\n\n                  * * *\n\n                  Bottomline is th=\r\nat I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n                 =\r\n declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from=\r\n \n                  time to time and from place to place. Also, there are n=\r\no thumbrules to find \n                  out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one =\r\ncan refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n                  dharma by increa=\r\nsing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \n                =\r\n  sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \n   =\r\n               attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s u=\r\nnderstanding of \n                  one&#39;s individual dharma.\n\n              =\r\n    Best regards,\n                  Narasimha\n                  -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n                  Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n            =\r\n      Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n=\r\n                  Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisd=\r\nom\n                  Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.co=\r\nmcast. net\n                  Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org\n                  Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n                  ------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n                  ----- Original Messa=\r\nge ----- \n                  From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;=\r\n\n                  To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n                  S=\r\nent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n                  Subject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Dharma\n\n                  &gt; Namaste to all\n                  &gt;\n   =\r\n               &gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n                  &gt; and i=\r\nn it in last part\n                  &gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very=\r\n personal.\n                  &gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can=\r\n we approach\n                  &gt; towards it\n                  &gt; Does it has=\r\n to do something with vedas and upanishads\n                  &gt;\n            =\r\n      &gt; regards\n                  &gt; jitender\n\n               \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0218_01C92296.3F6F7E40\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear Lakshmi,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;This is Kali yuga.

He was born to renounce material life \n   =\r\n               despite his &lt;BR&gt;aristocratic upbringing and live the simple =\r\n\n                  life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;generations to embrace a =\r\nsimple \n                  life of mental detachment and service to &lt;BR&gt;othe=\r\nrs. When he \n                  is born again (which he has to, as per what =\r\nRamakrishna \n                  &lt;BR&gt;said), his dharma based on the time and =\r\nplace may be \n                  something else.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The tri=\r\ncky question is: \n                  How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharm=\r\na?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people \n                  have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words s=\r\naying &quot;follow your own \n                  dharma &lt;BR&gt;and not someone else&#39;s=\r\n dharma&quot; in the light of \n                  castism. Though the concept &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;of caste (varna) has been \n                  there in Hinduism for a long =\r\ntime, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;caste \n                  mobility was very much th=\r\nere. Valmiki was a shudra who lived \n                  by &lt;BR&gt;killing birds=\r\n. He became a brahmana and a maharshi \n                  later. Vishwamitra=\r\n was a &lt;BR&gt;kshatrita and a powerful king. He \n                  became a br=\r\nahmana and and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;later. Basically \n                  varna sho=\r\nws one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \n                  &lt;BR&gt;of =\r\nfather, because that is what one is exposed to in \n                  childh=\r\nood. As one &lt;BR&gt;develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own \n                  var=\r\nna based on what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the \n                  misinterpret=\r\nation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know \n                  your &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are \n                  n=\r\not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;the world. Each person has \n                  indi=\r\nvidual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very \n               =\r\n   very very difficult. If one is pure &lt;BR&gt;enough, one will \n              =\r\n    *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n           =\r\n       &lt;BR&gt;mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is \n              =\r\n    surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;noise from other parts of our minds \n       =\r\n           which tell other things.
