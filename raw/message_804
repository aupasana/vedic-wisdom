He will come again after one=\r\n hundred years in the \n&gt; northwest direction.&quot;\n&gt; A Devotee: &quot;Did the Master=\r\n say that he would be born in the \nPunjab?&quot;\n&gt; Vijnanananda: &quot;No, the Master=\r\n did not say that he would be born in \n&gt; the Punjab.&quot; \n&gt; Swami Abhedananda =\r\nrecalled: &quot;One evening Sri Ramakrishna was \n&gt; attended by his faithful atte=\r\nndants Shashi [Ramakrishnananda] and \n&gt; Kali [Abhedananda], who were waitin=\r\ng upon him at Cossipore. The \n&gt; Master inspired them by saying: &#39;My Divine =\r\nMother has shown me \nthat \n&gt; the photograph of this body will be kept upon =\r\naltars and be \n&gt; worshipped in different houses as the pictures of other av=\r\natars \nare \n&gt; worshipped. My Divine Mother has also shown me that I shall h=\r\nave \nto \n&gt; come back again and that my next incarnation will be in the \nWes=\r\nt.&#39;&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; !....!....!\n&gt; On different occasions the Holy Mother made variou=\r\ns statements \nabout \n&gt; the Master&#39;s return. Once she recalled: &quot;The Master =\r\nsaid he would \n&gt; come again after a hundred years. Meanwhile, for those hun=\r\ndred \nyears \n&gt; he would live in the hearts of those who love him. Standing =\r\non the \n&gt; semicircular veranda of Dakshineswar, the Master said this, \npoin=\r\nting \n&gt; towards the northwest. I told him I could not come again. Lakshmi \n=\r\n&gt; also said she would not come again, even if she were chopped into \n&gt; shre=\r\nds like tobacco leaves! The Master laughed and said: &#39;How can \n&gt; you avoid =\r\ncoming? Our roots are twined together like the kalmi \n&gt; plant. Pull one ste=\r\nm and the whole clump comes forward.&#39;&quot;  \n&gt; The Holy Mother also stated: &quot;Th=\r\ne Master said that he would dwell \nin \n&gt; the hearts of his devotees for a h=\r\nundred years in his subtle body. \n&gt; He further said that he would have many=\r\n devotees among the white \n&gt; people.&quot; \n&gt; Swami Saradananda wrote on this su=\r\nbject in Sri Ramakrishna and His \n&gt; Divine Play: &quot;The Master not only knew =\r\nthis about himself through \n&gt; his yogic insight, but he also told us many t=\r\nimes, pointing to the \n&gt; northwest, that the next time he would reincarnate=\r\n there. Some of \nus \n&gt; (Girish Chandra Ghosh and others) said that the Mast=\r\ner even told \n&gt; them the time of his advent, stating: &#39;I shall have to be b=\r\norn in \n&gt; that direction after two hundred years. Then many will be \nlibera=\r\nted, \n&gt; and those who fail at that time will have to wait a long time for \n=\r\n&gt; liberation.&#39;&quot; \n&gt; !....!....!\n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s niece Lakshmi said: &quot;The Mas=\r\nter said, &#39;I shall come \n&gt; back after 100 years.&#39; I can&#39;t definitely say wh=\r\nether that year \n&gt; should be counted from his birth, or death, or on the da=\r\ny when he \n&gt; said it.&quot; \n&gt; !....!....!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; I vaguel=\r\ny recall reading somewhere that Shri Ramakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa once stated=\r\n that he \n&gt; &gt; would be reborn in 100 or 150 years time, can anyone kindly \n=\r\nverify \n&gt; whether that statement \n&gt; &gt; is indeed true; and if so kindly prov=\r\nide a reference to the text \n&gt; that has that quote?
