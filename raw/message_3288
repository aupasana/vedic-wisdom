You are awa=\r\nre\nthat Saturn is also called Mandi, or Mandachari.  in legends, it is \nkno=\r\nwn as famous Siva Temple, which was built by Saturn. Lord Saturn had\natoned=\r\n the sin of Brahamhatya by installing and adoring his Ishta, Lord\nShiva. Th=\r\nere is another legend, which is also popular. When demons were\non the path =\r\nof destruction of devatas, they all pleaded Sage Dadhichi\nfor help. Sage Da=\r\ndhichi offered the shastras created from his body\nbones. But, devatas could=\r\n not defeat the demons. Then sage Dadhichi\nadviced them to approach lord Sa=\r\nturn ,as he was the only capable entity\nto use these shastras and kill the =\r\ndemons. When approached by devatas,\nSaturn expressed his inability, as he w=\r\nas performing Yajna for his ishta\ndevata, lord Shiva, for atoning  the sin =\r\nof brahamhatya. However, after\nforceful pleadings by the all devatas, Satur=\r\nn consented to use the\nshastras of the bones of sage Dadhichi and fight dem=\r\nons, thus leaving \nhis yajna . The place where Saturn killed the demons is =\r\nknown after the\nname of Saturn, Mandapalli.\n\nAfter the victory Saturn creat=\r\ned a great temple for his ishta Shiva by\ninstalling a black ahivling,then t=\r\nhe temple of Pavatiji was also\ninstalled, followed by temple of Narayana an=\r\nd Nageshwaray. All in the\nsame premises. Im this temple. the pujaris perfor=\r\nm pooja for removing\nthe severe effects and Graha dosham of all the planets=\r\n,and mantras are\nalso addressedd to Saturn to help the devotee to free them=\r\n from all\nobstacles and bad times they are undergoing. This pooja takes abo=\r\nut 45\nminutes. The pooja can also be specific for mahamritunjaya , if one\nw=\r\nants that way. After this, gingelli oil is offered on the Shivlinga\nthrough=\r\n a long funnel,and obeseience is paid to other deities. After\nperforming th=\r\ne abhishekam ,the prasad given to the devotee  is Kumkum,\ncalled Sri Ammava=\r\nri Kumkum.\n\nI was undergoing very severe period in my life from 2004 onward=\r\ns, and I\nhad done all the upayas, whatever I could do to the best of my\nkno=\r\nwledge,but of no avail. Guru Rafal Ji is in knw of the things. Even I\nhad s=\r\ntopped my astrology work. Then all of a sudden I just read about\nthis templ=\r\ne in an article, and I simply proceeded to Rajamundry and\nvisited the templ=\r\ne. AQfter my return, within 3 months my peace of mind\nstarted returning, he=\r\nalth improved, astrology centre started re-working\nwith more devotion and i=\r\nnner energy. As a gratitude I again visited the\ngreat temple in November, f=\r\nor thanks giving, and now I feel greatly\nenergised and happy and satisfied.=\r\n It has been really a great\nexperience, after visiting almost all the know =\r\ntemples and places of\nworship in the country during past 20 years.\n\nThe puj=\r\naris there are not at all greeedy or flece anyone. The samagri\ncosts Rs.40/=\r\n- and you can give any amount to the pujari who performs\nspecial pooja anyt=\r\nhing between Rs.150 or more,as per your choice.\nOffering to all deities are=\r\n normally done in cash to help the upkeep of\nthe temple, and pujaris in 4 t=\r\nemples do not look askance at the devotee\nfor money. Great expereince indee=\r\nd, when all other methods fail and\nhopes are faded and one is on the verge =\r\nof collapsing, a visit to Sri\nMandeswara (Saneswara) Swamy temple is a grea=\r\nt blessings for all of us\nwho have lost hopes in life.\n\nWith my best wishes=\r\n to all members and especially to those for whom\nnothing seems to be workin=\r\ng right ! It is just the question of good\nfaith in His powers.\n\nRaj Bhardwa=\r\nj\n\n\n\n"}}
