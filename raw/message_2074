Is it a hard &quot;v&quot; or more like a &quot;w&quot; or some combo of the two?=\r\n My question applies to &quot;Shivaya&quot; as well. I read somewhere that there is n=\r\no hard &quot;v&quot; sound in Sanskrit and thus pronouncing &quot;v&quot; like &quot;w&quot; is more appr=\r\nopriate, but I suppose this rule only applies in certain instances (As &quot;Sav=\r\nitur&quot; does have a hard &quot;v&quot;)?\n\nThank you so much again. I really do apprecia=\r\nte the time and energy you put into your responses.\n\nBest Regards\n\n\n\n--- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namas=\r\nte,\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is originally &quot;om bhuuH bhuvaH svaH&quot;. After sandhi (joining), =\r\nit becomes &quot;om bhuurbhuvassvaH&quot;. The &quot;r&quot; after &quot;bhuu&quot; and &quot;s&quot; after &quot;bhuva&quot;=\r\n are the sounds that visarga transforms into, based on the sounds coming ne=\r\nxt (bh and s respectively). Those sounds are to be vocalized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Pronoun=\r\ncing &quot;bhuuH&quot; as &quot;bhuuhu&quot;, &quot;bhuvaH&quot; as &quot;bhuvaha&quot; and &quot;svaH&quot; as &quot;svaha&quot; is wr=\r\nong. Either pronounce it without sandhi as &quot;om bhuuH bhuvaH svaH&quot; or do san=\r\ndhi and pronounce it as &quot;om bhuurbhuvassvaH&quot;. The latter is preferred.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; BTW, the word &quot;svaH&quot; above is also written by some as &quot;suvaH&quot;. Both are c=\r\norrect.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you pronounce visarga (H) correc=\r\ntly, then you will actually find that first saying &quot;bhuuH&quot; and then &quot;bhuvaH=\r\n&quot; without ANY break in between will automatically make it sound like &quot;bhuur=\r\nbhuvaH&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The grammar rules of Sanskrit (e.g. visarga becoming &quot;r&quot; whe=\r\nn &quot;b&quot; or &quot;bh&quot; comes after it) are not arbitrarily decided by someone, but b=\r\nased on sound logic and/or keen observation. If your pronunciation of vario=\r\nus sounds is perfect, then grammar rules are actually plain common sense. C=\r\nonversely, if your pronunciation is not perfect, perhaps because of corrupt=\r\nions in tradition, then grammar rules can help you *reconstruct* the correc=\r\nt pronunciation. But, one thing is certain. Sanskrit grammar rules are logi=\r\ncal and not arbitrary.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; As an example, take =\r\nthe vowel &quot;ai&quot; (as in the mahaakaali beeja &quot;aim&quot; or in the words &quot;aindrI&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;aishvarya&quot; or &quot;airaavata&quot;). South Indians pronounce this vowel approxima=\r\ntely as &quot;i&quot; in the English words &quot;file&quot; or &quot;mile&quot; or &quot;mine&quot;. North Indians =\r\npronounce it closer to &quot;ae&quot;. They pronounce this vowel approximately as &quot;a&quot;=\r\n in the English words &quot;bank&quot;, &quot;rank&quot;, &quot;man&quot; or &quot;fan&quot;. Which pronunciation i=\r\ns correct?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The vriddhi sandhi rule is a big clue. This sandhi says: a=\r\n+e=3Dai (here, a is the first sound of ananta and e is the first sound of e=\r\ntat). For example, tava+eva=3Dtavaiva. If you pronounce the sound &quot;a&quot; and s=\r\nucceed in pronouncing the sound &quot;e&quot; immediately following it, i.e. without =\r\nANY break in between, then you WILL end up getting the correct pronunciatio=\r\nn of the vowel &quot;ai&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you try this, you will find that the north In=\r\ndian pronunciation of vowel &quot;ai&quot; as &quot;ae&quot; is correct.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will give another example (I am using ITrans transliteration). =\r\nThe vowel &quot;R^i&quot; as in (kR^iShNa or R^iShi or R^ici or R^itam) is mispronoun=\r\nced as &quot;ru&quot; by south Indians and as &quot;ri&quot; by north Indians (e.g. ruShi or ri=\r\nShi). Neither pronunciation is correct. Both are silly, as they contain a c=\r\nonsonant and an vowel, instead of just one vowel.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The clue to the cor=\r\nrect pronunciation is in yaNaadesha sandhi. If &quot;a&quot; comes immediately follow=\r\ning &quot;i&quot; or &quot;R^i&quot; or &quot;L^u&quot; or &quot;u&quot;, then we get the semi-vowels &quot;ya&quot; or &quot;ra&quot; =\r\nor &quot;la&quot; or &quot;va&quot; (respectively). If you pronounce &quot;R^i&quot; as either &quot;ru&quot; or &quot;r=\r\ni&quot; as south/north Indians do and pronounce &quot;a&quot; immediately following it, wi=\r\nthout ANY break in between, you will end up getting &quot;rva&quot; or &quot;rya&quot; (respect=\r\nively) and definitely not &quot;ra&quot;. That means both are wrong.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you fee=\r\nl inside your mouth what is known as the &quot;vowel trapezium&quot; in modern lingui=\r\nstics, then these 4 vowels are on the top line of the trapezium. The vowel =\r\n&quot;i&quot; is on the inside edge of the top line and the vowel &quot;u&quot; is on the outsi=\r\nde edge of the top line. If you trisect the distance between them, you can =\r\nlocate &quot;R^i&quot; and &quot;L^u&quot; (in the order i, R^i, L^u and u). If you do this and=\r\n practice the sounds, you will actually find that yaNaadesha sandhi rule is=\r\n logical and natural. If you pronounce i, R^i, L^u or u and then a, you ind=\r\need get ya, ra, la and va.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I repeat again. Sanskrit grammar rules lik=\r\ne sandhi rules are quite logical and plain common sense. They are not arbit=\r\nrary. Because of some errors that crept into people&#39;s pronunciation, some r=\r\nules may seem arbitrary. But, if one pronounces sounds as they are meant, s=\r\nandhi rules are logical.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One should make on=\r\ne&#39;s best effort to pronounce correctly. But pronunciation is only ONE of se=\r\nveral factors. A jigsaw puzzle is solved when all the pieces come together.=\r\n One piece cannot solve the puzzle.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I cannot poin=\r\nt to any audio that I found satisfactory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please buy the book =\r\n&quot;Mantrapushpam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra with in=\r\ntonation marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I will point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; (1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lin=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; &gt; below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in=\r\n a row. For \n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, all the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without=\r\n any lines below or \n&gt; &gt; &gt; above. They have to be pronounced in the same pi=\r\ntch. People end up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; introducing some pitch variation and mispronounci=\r\nng them. In veda mantras, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pronouncing all udattas in the same pitch =\r\nis the most important thing. Do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not stress any letter or take the pi=\r\ntch up/down when pronouncing a string of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; udattas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) T=\r\nhe last syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to be one \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; syllable. When you pronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If you=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; artificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it &quot;prachodayaa=\r\ntu&quot;, you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; will end up introducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess u=\r\np everything. A \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lot of people do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probab=\r\nly some guru sometime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back started the practice of adding a brief vo=\r\nwel at the end of words ending \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in a consonant, so that his sishyas c=\r\nould listen clearly what consonant he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; was saying. Unfortunately, it =\r\nbecame a standard practice. This is good for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; teaching, but wrong for=\r\n sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a consonant (wh=\r\nich cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT \n&gt; &gt; &gt; add a =\r\nbrief vowel after that consonant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The=\r\n &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in Sanskrit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated i=\r\nn itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to le=\r\nt air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;naH=\r\n&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nupposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, make=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is =\r\nadded to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wro=\r\nng.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;=\r\nH&quot; is pronounced \n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The s=\r\name symbol\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 w=\r\nords, respectively \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If=\r\n you pronounce it as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it so=\r\nunds identical in the 3 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; words.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Watch out for these 3 co=\r\nmmon mistakes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is=\r\n only a small percentage of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it. Creating the right mental images and=\r\n the perfect mental focus is more \n&gt; &gt; &gt; important. If you lose awareness o=\r\nf your body, successfully shut down all \n&gt; &gt; &gt; other thoughts in the mind a=\r\nnd achieve a perfect mental focus on any veda \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra with correct pr=\r\nonunciation, it will be a fantastic experience. Please \n&gt; &gt; &gt; note that cor=\r\nrect pronunciation is not difficult to achieve, but the other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; things=\r\n I mentioned here are not that easy!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Messa=\r\nge ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Proper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and Intonation - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAudio Source\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Could yo=\r\nu point me towards any easily obtainable audio recording of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ga=\r\nyatri mantra which you deem to be correctly executed?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also,=\r\n would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
