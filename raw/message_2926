If the pranpratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other lan=\r\nguage and used, will it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of=\r\n the person doing the prasnpratistha to be a constant?\n=C2=A0\nI mean, let u=\r\ns leave aside the case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha of an idol be=\r\ncause someone like Him does not need language to call the deity into an ido=\r\nl.

Please bear in mind that any=\r\n observation is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar or highe=\r\nr spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to perceiv=\r\ne it. What we are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own men=\r\ntal conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of deludin=\r\ng *anyone*.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/nega=\r\ntive/ creative/\n&gt; destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assumi=\r\nng that it is\n&gt; reaching God, is it=C2=A0not enough?\n=C2=A0\nThe purpose of =\r\nan=C2=A0idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual =\r\nperson imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particular object o=\r\nn a continuous basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As =\r\ntime goes on, his mind=C2=A0can be focused on that specific form faster and=\r\n easier by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are s=\r\neparate entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are able to p=\r\nerceive in some vague form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present =\r\nin the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several spirit=\r\nual thoughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol=\r\n can evoke some similar thoughts in another person too.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, the=\r\nre is some translation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perce=\r\nived and interpreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one&#39;=\r\ns mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to o=\r\nur own mental conditioning!\n=C2=A0\nSuppose a foolish person thought while p=\r\nraying to an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemi=\r\nes, brings people under one&#39;s control=C2=A0and makes one successful. Suppos=\r\ne you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts=\r\n. However, if you see her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses=\r\n and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the f=\r\nact that someone used that idol as a repository of negative thoughts become=\r\ns a minor obstruction.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, please note that this principle work=\r\ns without an idol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a c=\r\nhurch bench) and prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those=\r\n thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a=\r\n little susceptible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be =\r\na=C2=A0little higher when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just=\r\n air. That&#39;s all.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, please note that most people have some de=\r\nvotion, some surrender, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they ar=\r\ne praying to god, within or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish=\r\n thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the do=\r\nwnside I mentioned is not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable on=\r\nly in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practice=\r\ns without understanding what they are doing.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; is Idol worship risky=\r\n?\n=C2=A0\nBottomline is that I do not see any risk in idol worship.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?\n=C2=A0\nGod=\r\n created man as his replica.

But, due to th=\r\ne corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he is not able to create god corre=\r\nctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of his current corrupt state! Th=\r\ne goal is to keep creating god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep=\r\n refining oneself and eventually become pure. When one is pure and creates =\r\ngod as a replica of oneself, that god will match the god that created man i=\r\nn the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free from the cyc=\r\nle.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nI saw people deviating and speaking disre=\r\nspectfully about respected spiritual leaders of other religions.\n=C2=A0\nIn =\r\ngeneral, please remember that saying negative things about people that one =\r\nmay not have understood fully or correctly is unwise.\n=C2=A0\nFrom time to t=\r\nime, the Lord may send someone to a part of the world to maintain the corre=\r\nct balance of dharma and adhrama that is required in that part of the world=\r\n at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how ma=\r\nny misdeeds were done by people claiming to follow that person. Worse thing=\r\ns may have happened if god did not send that person!

At=\r\n the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful div=\r\nine presence.\n=C2=A0\nI was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple in M=\r\nayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachal=\r\nam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous=\r\n amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples wher=\r\ne the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not=\r\n get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Cal=\r\ncutta.\n=C2=A0\nThere was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to =\r\nby a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu befor=\r\ne we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that t=\r\nemple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form o=\r\nf the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did =\r\nnot understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed =\r\nmy eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was d=\r\nazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays lik=\r\ne Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do=\r\n not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple with=\r\nout roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few =\r\ntimes, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally=\r\n decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only =\r\n5 min and left\n in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone fr=\r\nom Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n=C2=A0\nLik=\r\ne this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence ac=\r\nross India.\n=C2=A0\nApart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my =\r\nbest experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalan=\r\ndi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the =\r\nunderground chamber there.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nEven the middle of=\r\n a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple in USA. These =\r\nwestern countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in Ind=\r\nia too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in Ind=\r\nia will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there is not much =\r\nleft at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has=\r\n a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I su=\r\nggest the following:\n=C2=A0\nMayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in ea=\r\nst India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=\r\n=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=\r\n=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan an=\r\nd Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain i=\r\nn central India.\n=C2=A0\nThere are many other good places, but the above com=\r\ne to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for sev=\r\neral months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadh=\r\nana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNara=\r\nsimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n---\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/JyotishWri tings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nn nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Astro Seeker \nTo: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com \nSent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\nSubject: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n\n\n\n\n\nRespected Narsimhaji, \n\n\nI would like to kno=\r\nw your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in today&#39;s time.

Suppose you fo=\r\ncus on that idol. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1) My questio=\r\nn is, so eventually some thoughts/emotions of the worshipper gets lodged in=\r\n the idol, both positive and negative. What is the relevance of doing a pra=\r\nnpratistha in an idol? Will not the ritual of pranpratistha bring the energ=\r\ny of the deity into the idol? If it does, then how can the emotions/thought=\r\ns of the worshipper get lodged in the idol since it already contains the en=\r\nergy of the deity?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Or does it mean that the en=\r\nergy/emotions of the worshipper get lodged in an idol where the pranpratist=\r\nha ritual has been incorrectly/ incompletely done, which happens so often i=\r\nn the case of idols at home.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2) What is the re=\r\nlevance of the Sanskrit language in pranpratistha ritual.&nbsp; Or rather, =\r\nthe significance of Sanskrit when it comes to spirituality in general. If t=\r\nhe pranpratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other language and=\r\n used, will it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of the pers=\r\non doing the prasnpratistha to be a constant?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nI mean, let us leave aside the case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha =\r\nof an idol because someone like Him does not need language to call the deit=\r\ny into an idol. But for others, how important is Sanskrit?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;............ ......... ......... .......=\r\n.. ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..=\r\n....... ......&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;............ ......... ......... .......=\r\n.. ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..=\r\n....... ......&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On a different issue about judging&nbs=\r\np;so called holy men from history&nbsp;-&nbsp;a deviation - I would like to=\r\n make one point. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;=\r\nLet us not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwi=\r\nse&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While what you say is correct, there can always be some rat=\r\nional judgement passed on figures from history based on incontrovertible ev=\r\nidence. And I don&#39;t mean the actions of their followers but the very own li=\r\nves of these people as recorded by their contemporaries. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that =\r\nalways judge a holy man not just by his words but by his conduct as well. T=\r\nhat is really the BEST way to form some opinion about people who claim to b=\r\ne spiritual. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Therefore, if a&nbsp;historicall=\r\ny authentic biography of a spiritual person is read and compared with stand=\r\nard&nbsp;models of spirtuality/ spiritual life along with the words/saying =\r\nof the person,&nbsp;one can make a fair judgement.

Wh=\r\nat we are able to perceive and observe is also based on our own mental cond=\r\nitioning and our own karmik debts.

If a spiritual person imagines a parti=\r\ncular energy or form of god in a particular object on a continuous basis, s=\r\nlowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on, his mind&=\r\nnbsp;can be focused on that specific form faster and easier by simply looki=\r\nng at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separate entities, they =\r\nare all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague f=\r\norm other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if =\r\nan idol is working as a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a perso=\r\nn trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar=\r\n thoughts in another person too.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, there is=\r\n some translation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perceived =\r\nand interpreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one&#39;s men=\r\ntal conditioning.

Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind=\r\n of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who helps you overcome you=\r\nr weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to yo=\r\nu.

Suppose someone goes to=\r\n a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain des=\r\nires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyone=\r\n praying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The conc=\r\nentration of thoughts may be a&nbsp;little higher when an idol serves as a =\r\nrepository as opposed to just air.

Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanie=\r\nd by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a b=\r\nig deal.
