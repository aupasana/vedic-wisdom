The fruits of actions of the current life will be experienced onl=\r\ny in the next life as per this concept. \n\nIf my understanding of the concep=\r\nt is right then i have the=A0 following queries: \n\n1. No matter what one do=\r\nes in the current life (like praying for health, money, etc.) it will only =\r\nmanifest in the next life. Then is it not just a coincidence if a prayer is=\r\n answered or sadhana bears material fruits (as it would have manifested any=\r\nway even in the absence of any efforts in the current life since it was due=\r\n from the previous life)? \n\n2. If our birth is only to empty this karma i.e=\r\n. a man doing good deeds will be born again to enjoy its pleasures and suff=\r\ner pain for bad deeds, is it not necessary to absolutely refrain from any d=\r\need either good or bad to avoid re-birth? \n\n3. Is it not enough to focus on=\r\n &#39;sanchitha karma&#39;=A0 in the present life and direct all our efforts in dev=\r\neloping dispassion towards material existence and empty the antahkarna of a=\r\nll the feelings and dispositions? \n\n4. Does every spiritual activity merely=\r\n try to entice the common person with material gains but has a hidden purpo=\r\nse of liberating the mind of desires? (which is the only tangible result ex=\r\nperienced from a sadhana) \n\n5. If the 4th point is true then prayer, homa, =\r\ndevotion, good deeds, austerities, penance, etc. are all hitting around the=\r\n bush. The root is in our own self.
