Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep\n&gt; doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.\n \nI know one person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a realized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning that he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did not find anyone like that.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWe indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting people just like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.\n \nWhy should it be so?\n \nThe age of fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters though they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn&#39;t it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.\n \nThe old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.\n \n*        *        *\n \nParamahansa Yogananda said that great masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse this time. How do we reconcile?\n \nQuite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to god himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn the old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely and unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of the world is today based on the concept of democracy or switching to it slowly.\n \nIn spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. it made sense to place people&#39;s spiritual lives completely and unconditionally in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relevant concepts and ideas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit from them. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures and just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait patiently. It is a more fruitful method than to search for a sadguru who will lift you.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation, is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say some sexual ritual?\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt;  \n&gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would probably not be able to remain so when born in thid age is a simple fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt;  \n&gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?\n&gt;  \n&gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years. \n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; \n&gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web. He is a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts. He has a charming and endearing disposition and a lucid and eloquent way of explaining high philosophy in simple and demystified terms. Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom. Who is to tell how *we* will fare when our time comes for a test?\n&gt; \n&gt; No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one has understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most of the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can still fall. Take your mind off god for a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then why should we judge others?\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The most important thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group who make good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticing their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spiritual truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Perhaps an increase of dharma is not possible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast in key places. We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store. Her ways are definitely inscrutable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For the last few days there are so many Sex scandals by the so called (famous and infamous) spiritual Guru&#39;s like Nithyananda swami, Kalki Bhagwan etc etc are being exposed to the masses. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is there any relationship with these incidents with the establishment of the Dharma as you keep saying in the upcoming years?
