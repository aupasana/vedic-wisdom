Can law arise\nby itself? Can any law come out =\r\nof nothing? Surely there must be an ultimate\ncause. That is God.That is the=\r\n supreme Brahman or the Absolute. God is\nself-existent Being. He is infinit=\r\nely powerful, wise and good.\n\nThe deepest craving, the deepest aspiration i=\r\nn man is for eternal happiness,\neternal knowledge and eternal Truth. Man sh=\r\nould search for some supernatural\nentity which can satisfy his deepest crav=\r\nings and aspirations.\n\nNature is not a mere chance collection of events, a =\r\nmere jumble of\naccidents, but an orderly affair. The planets move regularly=\r\n in their\norbits, seeds grow into trees regularly, the seasons succeed each=\r\n other in\norder. Now Nature cannot order itself. It requires the existence =\r\nof an\nintelligent being, i.e., God, who is responsible for it. Even Einstei=\r\nn, the\ngreat scientist, was strongly convinced of the creation of the unive=\r\nrse by a\nSupreme Intelligence.\n\nAlbeit everything is transitory in this wor=\r\nld, people purchase enormous\nplots of land, build bungalows in various plac=\r\nes and erect five-storied\nhouses. They want to establish eternal life in th=\r\nis sense-universe. This\nshows that man is essentially immortal. In spite of=\r\n the knowledge that\neveryone has to die, man thinks that he will live for e=\r\nver and makes very\ngrand arrangements to live here perpetually. Further, no=\r\nbody wants death.\nEverybody wants to live, and takes treatment when ill, sp=\r\nending any\namount. Hence,\nthe essential nature of man should be eternal exi=\r\nstence.\n\nEven a fool thinks that he is wise. Everyone wants to show that he=\r\n knows\nmore than others.Nobody likes to be called a fool. Children tease th=\r\neir\nparents with various sorts of questions. The desire to know is ingraine=\r\nd in\nthem. These indicate that our essential nature is knowledge.\n\nWhen a m=\r\nan laughs, people seldom ask why he is laughing. On the other hand\nwhen a m=\r\nan cries, everybody asks why he is crying. This shows that our\nessential na=\r\nture is bliss. No one wants misery, but everyone wants\nhappiness, and all o=\r\nne=E2=80=99s activities in life are directed towards the\nacquisition of hap=\r\npiness. This also proves that our real nature is bliss. In\ndeep sleep when =\r\nthere are no objects, senses or mind, we feel bliss; hence\nour essential na=\r\nture should be bliss. That again is the reason why people\nailing from painf=\r\nul maladies even desire to give up their bodies and thus\nget rid of the pai=\r\nn.\n\nYou find that even the world&#39;s best doctors fail to cure a dying king. =\r\nYou\nmight have also heard of many instances where patients ailing from the =\r\nworst\ntype of diseases are cured miraculously where even the ablest doctors=\r\n have\ndeclared the cases hopeless. This itself is a clear proof that there =\r\nis the\ndivine hand behind all cures.\n\nSome people die when they are eighty =\r\nyears old; some die when they are in\nthe womb; some die at twenty; some at =\r\nforty. What is the cause for the\nvariation? Who has fixed the span of life =\r\nfor all? This clearly proves that\nthere is the theory of Karma, that there =\r\nis one Omniscient Lord, who is the\ndispenser of the fruits of the actions o=\r\nf the Jivas, who fixes the span of\nlife of the Jivas in accordance with the=\r\nir nature of Karma or actions, who\nknows the exact relation between Karmas =\r\nand their fruits. As Karma is Jada\nor insentient, it certainly cannot dispe=\r\nnse with the fruits of their\nactions.\n\nClose your eyes and imagine for a mo=\r\nment that you are dead.You can never do\nso. You can never think that you wi=\r\nll not exist (after death). You will\nimagine that your dead body is lying d=\r\nown and that you are witnessing the\ndead body. This clearly proves that you=\r\n are always the witnessing subject\n(Sakshi, Drashta).There is an inherent f=\r\neeling in everybody &#39;I exist,&#39; &#39;Aham\nAsmi&#39;.\n\nThere are five Indriyas (organ=\r\ns that grasp) and five Vishayas (objects). Eye\ncan see\nforms. Forms are mad=\r\ne up of Agni-tattwa (fire principle). Eyes are also\nformed out of fire Tanm=\r\natra. So there is a relationship between eye and\nform. Eyes cannot hear sou=\r\nnds. Ear is made up of Shabda-tanmatra (sound\nelement). Sound emanates from=\r\n Akasa (ether).There is a relationship between\near and sound. Ear cannot se=\r\ne. All the five senses are insentient or\nnon-intelligent. They borrow their=\r\n light and power from Atma or pure Spirit\nwhich is at the back of these sen=\r\nses just as a cup of water, when exposed to\nthe sun, borrows the heat from =\r\nthe sun.\n\nIn sleep there are no senses, no objects, no mind apparent and ye=\r\nt you\nexperience peace and bliss. When there are no objects, wherefrom have=\r\n you\nderived the bliss? The mind rests in Brahman during sleep and it is fr=\r\nom\nBrahman this bliss is derived. Further during sleep when there are no ot=\r\nher\npersons &#39;I&#39; alone exists.\n\nSource: GOD EXISTS By SRI SWAMI SIVANANDA\n\n-=\r\n- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001485eba2fc2d3603049bc1236f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Every breath that flows in the =\r\nnose,&lt;br&gt;Every beat that throbs in the heart,&lt;br&gt;Every artery that pulsates=\r\n in the body,&lt;br&gt;Every thought that arises in the mind,&lt;br&gt;Speaks to you th=\r\nat God is near.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Every flower that wafts fragrance,&lt;br&gt;Ever=\r\ny fruit that attracts you,&lt;br&gt;Every gentle breeze that blows,&lt;br&gt;Every rive=\r\nr that smoothly flows,&lt;br&gt;Speaks of God and His mercy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The vast ocean with its powerful waves,&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nThe Mig=\r\nhty Himalayas with its glaciers,&lt;br&gt;The bright Sun and stars in the wide sk=\r\ny,&lt;br&gt;The lofty tree with its branches,&lt;br&gt;The cool springs in the hills an=\r\nd dales,&lt;br&gt;Tell me of His omnipotence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;The melody of sweet music,&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nThe oration of powerful orator=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;The poems of reputed poets,&lt;br&gt;The inventions of able scientists,&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe operations of dexterous surgeons,&lt;br&gt;The utterances of holy saints,&lt;br&gt;=\r\nThe thoughts of the Bhagavad Gita,&lt;br&gt;The revelations of the Upanishads,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n\nSpeak of God and His wisdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;Even many educated men now say boldly that there is no God, that every=\r\nthing in this world goes on and evolves according to definite laws.
