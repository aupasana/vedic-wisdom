In vairaagyam all karma is done but =\r\nwithout expecting anything in return, without being involved in the materia=\r\nlistic aspects of karma. Bhagiratha, with his unparalleled effort to bring =\r\nGanga to earth, showed us how much effort a man can put in and as a result =\r\nwhat wonders can be done.\n\nOn knowing that his ancestors (60000 Sagara Kuma=\r\nras) will reach swarga only if the pure waters of Ganga flow through their =\r\nashes, from his mother, Bhagiratha immediately leaves to Himalayas to do ta=\r\npas for Lord Brahma:\n\nAfter purifying himself in a pushkarini, it starts ta=\r\npas with extra-ordinary concentration.

Later=\r\n it was once in a few days. Then it became once in a month. After that, he =\r\njust used to drink a little water and continue his `Tapas&#39;. Finally the air=\r\n was his only food!!! 1000 years passed=E2=80=A6.!!!!\n\nBrahma, the creator =\r\nof the worlds, on the requests of Gods to save them from the tremendous tap=\r\naagni of Bhagiratha, appears before him and blesses him with children and G=\r\nanga. However, Brahma deva suggests that none except Parama Shiva can take =\r\nthe force when Ganga falls onto earth, and if not with that force earth wil=\r\nl be washed away=E2=80=A6\n\nMen are of three kinds:\n\nThere are cowards, who =\r\ndo not begin their work at all, afraid that some trouble may arise midway. =\r\nThose who begin but later give up the task, afraid of the difficulties that=\r\n arise. Brave people who belong to a third group. They continue to work in =\r\nspite of even an army of difficulties, and finally achieve the goal.\n\nBhagi=\r\nratha belonged to this third category of brave men. He again began a severe=\r\n `Tapas&#39; to please Lord Ishwara. With folded hands, and standing on one leg=\r\n, he meditated on Lord Iswara with the deepest concentration. So a whole ye=\r\nar passed. Pleased with Bhagiratha&#39;s devotion Lord ishwara takes the immens=\r\ne force of Ganga and controls her in his jataajutam. He completely stops he=\r\nr from flowing to teach her a lesson (she was a mischievous girl, proud of =\r\nher strength!), but for Bhagiratha it was another difficulty=E2=80=A6 But h=\r\ne again with tapas pleases Lord Shiva to release Ganga down to earth. Ganga=\r\n followed Bhagiratha shyly and slowly, like his daughter (Bhaagirathi). But=\r\n she grew a little mischievous, though Shiva taught her a lesson once, when=\r\n near Jahnu maharshi&#39;s ashram. She wandered all over the Ashrama like a sma=\r\nll girl and the entire place was filled with water. Disturbed from tapas by=\r\n it, Jahnu maharshi in a single gulp swallows her entirely. And\n suddenly d=\r\nifficulties again for Bhagiratha. But it is not the first time for him, so =\r\nimmediately pleases Jahnu maharshi (Jaahnavi comes out of Jahnu maharshi&#39;s =\r\near) and finally sends his ancestors to higher worlds=E2=80=A6..\n\nMorals in=\r\n the story: \n\n1.Karma must be done in massive quantity as Bhagiratha did, b=\r\nut selflessly=E2=80=A6\n\n2.
