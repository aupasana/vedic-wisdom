Even very serious blocki=\r\nng karmas reserved for future births might be rapdily burned away if one is=\r\n sincere in practise and sadhana.\n\n3.The agaami Karma ( Karma being perform=\r\ned right now and which will come in the future ) can be positively impacted=\r\n since the homa refines ones present condition.\n\nAll in all Homa/Remedial m=\r\neasures are an huge blessing since it has the potential to burn the Sanchit=\r\na and also modify the Agaami via the refinement feedback and also there is =\r\nan remote possibility the present karma might get rearranged a little bit l=\r\nike Narasimha ji said.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [&gt;...that act of homam or japam is also a karma that pushed out or\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nblocked the older karma.]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Japam/Homam etc...are offcourse &quot;new Karm=\r\nas&quot;.

I see no inconsistency between the two statements you\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; asked me to reconcile:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (1) Nobody can escape the result of one&#39;s=\r\n karmas.\n&gt; &gt; (2) Remedies such as homam and japam can prevent the ill-effec=\r\nts of\n&gt; &gt; karma.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What we have to realize is that karma (action) is =\r\nsomething that keeps\n&gt; &gt; flowing continuously and dynamically. It is not so=\r\nmething frozen in\n&gt; &gt; time. Yes, karmas done in previous lives, *before* cu=\r\nrrent birth, are\n&gt; &gt; frozen in the form of one&#39;s horoscope. BUT, one does n=\r\not stop doing\n&gt; &gt; karmas after birth. One keeps doing karmas and they get a=\r\ndded to the\n&gt; &gt; karma pipeline.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One has to experience the results o=\r\nf one&#39;s karmas, but different\n&gt; karmas\n&gt; &gt; may give results after different=\r\n waiting times. Some karmas take a\n&gt; long\n&gt; &gt; time to give results and some=\r\n fructify fast. When big karmas one\n&gt; commits\n&gt; &gt; after birth are added to =\r\nthis karma pipeline, it may be re-arranged.\n&gt; The\n&gt; &gt; newer karmas done in =\r\nthis life may give results ahead of older karmas\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; some older karmas=\r\n may be pushed back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When you sow some kind of seeds in a field, it=\r\n may take a long time\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; them to become trees and give fruits (sweet=\r\n or sour or bitter). When\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; sow some other kind of seeds, it may ta=\r\nke a short time for them to\n&gt; &gt; become trees and give fruits (sweet or sour=\r\n or bitter). Like that,\n&gt; &gt; different karmas (seeds) need different time to=\r\n give fruits.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If your field is filled with bad trees or plants or s=\r\needs, it does not\n&gt; &gt; prevent you from sowing new seeds that give desirable=\r\n fruits. A new\n&gt; &gt; plant may give good fruits or atleast stop an older bad =\r\nplant from\n&gt; &gt; growing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one blocked an older bad karma from givi=\r\nng its result using a\n&gt; remedy\n&gt; &gt; such as homam or japam, that act of homa=\r\nm or japam is also a karma\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; pushed out or blocked the older karma=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There is one more thing really. Apart from sowing n=\r\new seeds or\n&gt; blocking\n&gt; &gt; old seeds/plants from growing, remedies can also=\r\n make one spiritually\n&gt; &gt; mature and even liberate one. With spiritual matu=\r\nrity, one can handle\n&gt; &gt; the stress of bad times better. When I have a prob=\r\nlem, I can get\n&gt; worried\n&gt; &gt; and the problem can be blown up, become weight=\r\nier in my mind and cause\n&gt; &gt; more stress. Or I can say, &quot;well, this too wil=\r\nl pass&quot; and move on.\n&gt; &gt; Though the basic problem itself cannot be avoided,=\r\n I can stop it from\n&gt; &gt; becoming weightier in my mind and causing more stre=\r\nss. Most of our\n&gt; &gt; problems cause far more stress than they should, becaus=\r\ne we waste so\n&gt; &gt; much time and mental energy worrying about and worrying a=\r\nbout what is\n&gt; &gt; not in our hands, instead of accepting what is not in our =\r\nhands and\n&gt; &gt; focusing attention on what is in our hands and doing the best=\r\n we can.\n&gt; A\n&gt; &gt; clear mind enabled by spiritual sadhana can minimize such =\r\ndispersion\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; energy and wasting of time. That way too, spiritual sad=\r\nhana helps.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I personally know several people who do homam everyday =\r\nnow and lead\n&gt; much\n&gt; &gt; happier lives, though the ground situation may have=\r\n been the same!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Japam and homam can also be used as &quot;placebos&quot; like=\r\n you said. But they\n&gt; &gt; have the potential to be far more than that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyoti=\r\nsh Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishW=\r\nritings\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sat, Jul 9, 2011 at 2:35 AM, Yoge=\r\nsh Lajmi wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Mr.Narasimha PVR Rao,\n&gt; &gt; Kindly reconcile the=\r\n following\n&gt; &gt; opinions of our Great Ancient Rishis...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1.

If=\r\n one chants the kavacha of a planet many times,\n&gt; eventually\n&gt; &gt; a protecti=\r\nve sheath is formed around one&#39;s consciousness with the\n&gt; nature\n&gt; &gt; and en=\r\nergy of that planet. This will obviously offer protection that\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; con=\r\nsistent with the nature of that planet, in general and in one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; chart. =\r\nBut, please remember that reading the kavacha of any planet\n&gt; will\n&gt; &gt; NOT =\r\nharm you. Even the kavacha of 8th lord or 6th lord will not harm\n&gt; &gt; one.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he chants Sukra kavacha, Venus will\n&gt; p=\r\nrotect\n&gt; &gt; one from loss of courage (3rd), problems to shoulders (3rd), unt=\r\nimely\n&gt; &gt; death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th), problems in anus/genital area=\r\n\n&gt; (8th)\n&gt; &gt; etc. There may be other things based on other factors like asp=\r\nects,\n&gt; &gt; occupancy etc. Based on his inherent nature, Venus may also prote=\r\nct in\n&gt; &gt; the matters of love, romance, creativity etc also. Bottomline is =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt; the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the planet is conducive to w=\r\nill\n&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; protected by the planet&#39;s energy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you pick a wrong =\r\nplanet, you may not get the desired result, but no\n&gt; &gt; harm is done. Even b=\r\nad planets in your chart will have some aspects\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; want to protect =\r\nand doing their kavacha will protect those aspects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best will be to=\r\n chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna\n&gt; &gt; lord, Moon&#39;s dis=\r\npositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to\n&gt; &gt; chant the kavachas=\r\n of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the\n&gt; &gt; kavachas I have seen unt=\r\nil now, Narayana kavacha (from\n&gt; &gt; SrimadBhagavatam)\n&gt; &gt; and Chandi Kavacha=\r\n are the most potent kavachas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But please note that chanting a kava=\r\ncha once or twice or even once or\n&gt; &gt; twice a day is hardly sufficient. If =\r\none has enough purity already,\n&gt; most\n&gt; &gt; mantras work right away. But most=\r\n of us have very dense conditioning\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; the energy of mantras gets di=\r\nspersed. The energy of the planet/deity\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the kavacha we chant canno=\r\nt form a sheath around us easily. It\n&gt; requires\n&gt; &gt; intense sadhana for mos=\r\nt people. If one chants a kavacha 10-30 times\n&gt; &gt; everyday and does it for =\r\n40-60 days, then some kind of results can be\n&gt; &gt; expected. Intense sadhana =\r\nwith any mantra is needed for most people to\n&gt; &gt; see some results. Getting =\r\nthings done by a professional priest is also\n&gt; &gt; not that useful, as there =\r\nare very very few priests with the required\n&gt; &gt; purity, the ability to iden=\r\ntify with your problem and the ability to\n&gt; &gt; transfer the energy. For most=\r\n people, the best solution is to learn\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; chant by themselves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Ta=\r\nrpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://sa=\r\nraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Jul 7, 2011 at 11:39 =\r\nAM, monkeymonkeyking10 wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I sincerely hope=\r\n our moderator forgives this question which I also\n&gt; &gt; posted on the jyotis=\r\nh forum...I am a bit unclear about Kavacha for the\n&gt; &gt; planets.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; For=\r\n example, if a planet such as Rahu is giving one to have problems\n&gt; &gt; durin=\r\ng his dasha, would one recite the Kavach of Rahu, OR some other\n&gt; &gt; &quot;counte=\r\nr-balancing&quot; planet that was strong in one&#39;s chart?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Raj\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
