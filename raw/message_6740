She was a fiery example =\r\nof wonderful renunciation, great boldness and courage, that distinguished h=\r\ner out as a fearless yogini.Among the later lady devotees of Sri Ramakrishn=\r\na, and the holy Mother Saradamani Devi, the name of Gauri Mata should be me=\r\nntioned. She felt the call for the higher life from her very girlhood and r=\r\nesisting all efforts of her relatives to get her married she renounced home=\r\n and hearth and became a sannyasini. She wandered about fearlessly in many =\r\nparts of India and performed severe austerities in the Himalayas, and later=\r\n on, in Brindavan.\n\nYogini Mata is another such lady and an associate of Ga=\r\nuri Mata. She was a highly spiritual lady living a life of great detachment=\r\n and intense continuous sadhana. She had performed the purnabhisheka ceremo=\r\nny of the tantras as well as the viraja homa of the Vedas, both indicative =\r\nof having renounced the worldly life completely. The present Durga Mata of =\r\nSaradeshwari Ashram, Calcutta, is a similar sannyasini. \n\n\n"}}
