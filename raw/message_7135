Rather, it is a pro=\r\nfoundly transformative spiritual experience that leaves one unalterably and=\r\n deeply changed forever. In what is without doubt Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ach=\r\naryaji&#39;s most powerful and inspiring Dharma talk to date, this authentic sp=\r\niritual master reveals the exact nature of the Divine as revealed in the an=\r\ncient Vedic literature, and what is required of us in order to know that Di=\r\nvine intimately. This talk will radically transform both your understanding=\r\n of God, as well as your very approach to reality itself!\n\nWATCH THE FULL V=\r\nIDEO HERE:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DY164ypTI5bQ\n\n\n\nPlease forward =\r\nto all you know.\n\n\nAum Tat Sat\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
