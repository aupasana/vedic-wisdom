I red in the book &#39;End of Kali Yuga&#39; written =\r\nby Dr,Vedavyas, first, i just got interest and i fineshed reading that book=\r\n, that he said by calculating the time of the Death of Lord Krishna ( Passe=\r\nd away from Earth of End of the &#39;Krishna Avatara&#39; ) at 3012 B.C. and the 36=\r\n Years of Yuga Sandhi (passage of Yuga) and the Year 1999 of this present d=\r\nays is End of Kali Yuga,where are we now ?  and red another book is &#39;Bhavis=\r\nya purana&#39; which is telling that the same and another book is &#39;Kalajnanam b=\r\ny Potuluri Veera Bramhendra swamy&#39; but in this book swamy said in thiti wit=\r\nh vara and naksatra etc. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember that in  Agu.month while watchin=\r\ng &#39;CNN&#39; news channel they said that Just eight ( 8 ) Years left to save the=\r\n earth. and the same i hard from &#39;BBC&#39; too, and  we can observe the same ar=\r\nound us in the world wide,the same symtoms like, financial crisis, wars bet=\r\nween countries,Terroriest ayyacks without any reson, the peoples beheaver, =\r\nnegligence of Prayers and God, Unculture habbits of Religion, Food habbits =\r\nand like many more. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t say how to stop the Pralay but how to es=\r\ncape from it and the what prayer we  have to do to get a better life in nex=\r\nt birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And finally how many more Years is there for Pralaya or End =\r\nof Kali Yuga ? what we have to do ? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And i want to know  about Narost=\r\nrodamus Feture Pridictions too. as he said every Predictions, which he had =\r\nwrote over 500 years ago, at the same time &#39;Kalajnana&#39; by Veerabrabramhedra=\r\n swamy, and Vidhyaranya swamy who was the GURU for the KRISHNADEVARAYALA KI=\r\nMGDOM.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Is J Hora 5400 of our site can tell this?  At what date all &#39;=\r\nNava Grahas come in the 1st House or in &#39;Mesha Rasi&#39; Sir ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please For=\r\ngive me for my any mistakes done by me unknownly. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; yours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhavad=\r\nhiyudu.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Harikishan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram, GURU JI & to all\n&gt;       =\r\n            There is a contraversy in this matter (calculations) is that so=\r\nme one say  that the calculation is showing in lacks of years, and in other=\r\n one is showing in Thousnds, which is correct one? Don&#39;t keep us in dark an=\r\nd in confuese,.\n&gt; Till what i red that  this manvantara name is Vivastvara =\r\nmanvantara, and this having 4 yugas, every one know, and we rae in the Kali=\r\n Yuga, and almost who are in this subject and maya civilizaion, Norstadamus=\r\n, Kalagnana and Bhavisypurana ,is also predicting we are in end of kaai Yug=\r\na,\n&gt; Yours Groupmett.\n&gt; Hari\n&gt;\n\n\nThere is no definite meaning of Yuga. Yuga=\r\n means 2.\nBut it can even mean 5, 10 or a period of hundreds or even thousa=\r\nnds\nof years. Hence while dealing with yuga system, it is better to follow\n=\r\nthe other tradition, which defines yugas according to how a country\nis bein=\r\ng ruled.\nIf the king rules the country according to Dharma 100%, then it is=\r\n\nSatyayug. If he rules by 75% Dharma, it is Tretayug, if by 50% Dharma,\nit =\r\nis Dwaparyug and if he rules by only 25% Dharma, it is Kaliyug.\nThis surely=\r\n means that we are living in Kaliyug now because nobody \nwill say that we a=\r\nre being ruled by 100 or even 75% Dharma.\nRegards,\nKedar Damle\n\n\n"}}
