This is an unbelievable ex=\r\nperience that I\n          have had. I have not added anything from my own. =\r\nI am writing exactly\n          as was happened in my life. I am going back =\r\nto the period of 1973/74.\n          Kindly read this only when you are in r=\r\neligious mood.\n          &gt;  \n          &gt; I was working as telegraphist at O=\r\nkha Port Post office near Dwarka.\n          My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm a=\r\nnd I was getting late fee allowance for\n          extra duty. There was a T=\r\nelephone exchange just opposite to Post\n          office and due to same De=\r\np=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone\n          operators. One =\r\nMr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n          was working =\r\nas Operator. He was a staunch devotee of    shri\n          Ramkrishnadev. W=\r\nhenever I was meeting him he was always talking about\n          shri Thakur=\r\n. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at\n          his h=\r\nome called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by\n          h=\r\nim and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n          Katha=\r\nmrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting\n          =\r\non Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n         =\r\n then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n      =\r\n    and were talking only about Thakur.\n          &gt; One day when we were at=\r\n sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n          some guest ha=\r\nve come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son\n          will com=\r\ne in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. --\n        =\r\n  And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n          &gt; A=\r\nt one another incident he told me that there will be a plane crash\n        =\r\n  tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him.\n   =\r\n       He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, h=\r\ne\n          told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Y=\r\net I\n          went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was =\r\npunctured\n          on the way. This was surprising.\n          &gt; This all i=\r\nncidents made me to believe that he had some super power\n          and this=\r\n was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n          shri T=\r\nhakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n          Thaku=\r\nr and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself\n         =\r\n to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him=\r\n\n          deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his=\r\n grace. \n          &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.=\r\n10 morning\n          while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 a=\r\nm I was waking\n          up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morni=\r\nng that I have\n          accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife=\r\n was annoyed and she\n          argued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=\r\n=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision?\n          Ramkrishna Param=\r\nhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta.

I thought-- yes I have taken\n          hasty decisi=\r\non. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n          &gt; But I remember that=\r\n Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n          their disciples to=\r\n test him before accepting him. I also decided to\n          test Thakur. I =\r\nimmediately told my wife that =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel ha=\r\ns\n          never come to our home. You have also not seen him.

What he told?\n          &gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this w=\r\nay? Do you know what happened?\n          Yesterday was my night duty and I =\r\nhad just come to my home at 05.30\n          mornings today and tried to sle=\r\nep for 1 or 2 hours.

This is a=\r\nn unbelievable experience that I&lt;BR&gt;have had. \n          I have not added a=\r\nnything from my own. I am writing exactly&lt;BR&gt;as was \n          happened in =\r\nmy life. I am going back to the period of \n          1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;Kindly rea=\r\nd this only when you are in religious \n          mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha \n          Port Post office near D=\r\nwarka.&lt;BR&gt;My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I \n          was getting late f=\r\nee allowance for&lt;BR&gt;extra duty. There was a \n          Telephone exchange j=\r\nust opposite to Post&lt;BR&gt;office and due to same \n          Dep=E2=80=99t; I =\r\nhad friendship with some Telephone&lt;BR&gt;operators. One Mr. \n          Ramanbh=\r\nai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;was working as \n          Oper=\r\nator. He was a staunch devotee of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n          shri&lt;BR&gt;Ramk=\r\nrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always \n          talking abou=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a \n          weekly g=\r\nathering at&lt;BR&gt;his home called SATSANGA. He was singing \n          devotion=\r\nal songs created by&lt;BR&gt;him and was weeping while singing. He \n          was=\r\n reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were \n          a=\r\nttending this weekly meeting&lt;BR&gt;on Saturday evening. I was then 24 \n       =\r\n   years old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;then. We were used to go to seashore \n=\r\n          daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;and were talking only about \n  =\r\n        Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told =\r\n\n          me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;some guest have come to my home and m=\r\ny wife is \n          remembering me. My son&lt;BR&gt;will come in a few minutes t=\r\no call me. I \n          shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. --&lt;BR&gt;And with my su=\r\nrprise his 8 years old son \n          came to call him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At one ano=\r\nther incident he told me that \n          there will be a plane crash&lt;BR&gt;tom=\r\norrow and that also happened. I was \n          very much impressed about hi=\r\nm.&lt;BR&gt;He could foresee the events. One day \n          I had to go to Dwarka=\r\n by Bus, he&lt;BR&gt;told me not to go through bus, as \n          bus tire will b=\r\ne punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;went to Bus station but bus did \n          not come f=\r\nrom Dwarka as was punctured&lt;BR&gt;on the way. This was \n          surprising.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had \n          some s=\r\nuper power&lt;BR&gt;and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I \n          =\r\nwas attracted to&lt;BR&gt;shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be \n     =\r\n     disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm =\r\n\n          I surrendered myself&lt;BR&gt;to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house b=\r\nefore Thakur \n          picture. I prayed him&lt;BR&gt;deeply from my heart to ac=\r\ncept me as his \n          follower and bestow his grace. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Next day =\r\nmorning I had a \n          discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;while=\r\n taking the tea. As my \n          duty was to start from 7 am I was waking&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;up at 5.45 morning. I told \n          to my wife in the morning that I h=\r\nave&lt;BR&gt;accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev \n          as my Gurudev. My wife was an=\r\nnoyed and she&lt;BR&gt;argued with me a lot. \n          =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=\r\n=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision?&lt;BR&gt;Ramkrishna \n          Para=\r\nmhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a&lt;BR&gt;great \n          =\r\nSaint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give&lt;BR&gt;us \n    =\r\n      Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma \n         =\r\n Acharya&lt;BR&gt;since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her \n   =\r\n       arguments were right at her place as people in general not \n        =\r\n  know&lt;BR&gt;much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have \n   =\r\n       taken&lt;BR&gt;hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. \n     =\r\n     --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was \n=\r\n          telling&lt;BR&gt;their disciples to test him before accepting him. I al=\r\nso \n          decided to&lt;BR&gt;test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =\r\n=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, \n          Mr. Patel has&lt;BR&gt;never come to =\r\nour home. You have also not seen him. \n          He has never asked&lt;BR&gt;me w=\r\nhere I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is \n          coming to our house withi=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that \n          my selection for T=\r\nhakur is&lt;BR&gt;perfect?=E2=80=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She laughed at \n          me=EF=BF=\r\n=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D=\r\n--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I prayed Shri \n          Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to=\r\n justify my&lt;BR&gt;decision and \n          convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to=\r\n test your existence \n          even&lt;BR&gt;today.=E2=80=99&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To our grea=\r\nt surprise, Mr. Patel was at my \n          home at 06.30 in the&lt;BR&gt;morning =\r\nwith angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          =E2=80=98 How dare you te=\r\nst Thakur this way? Do you know what \n          happened?&lt;BR&gt;Yesterday was =\r\nmy night duty and I had just come to my \n          home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;morning=\r\ns today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. \n          Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;=\r\npulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your \n          friend=\r\n=E2=80=99s house. He&lt;BR&gt;is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will \n  =\r\n        show you his house=E2=80=9D&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I immediately rushed to your ho=\r\nme. Thakur \n          was guiding me the way to&lt;BR&gt;your house and pushing m=\r\ne too. What you \n          want? Why you are disturbing&lt;BR&gt;him in such an e=\r\narly morning for such \n          a silly things?=E2=80=99&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We both w=\r\nere so excited and surprised that we \n          had no words that&lt;BR&gt;Mornin=\r\ng. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I will never forget that 5th \n          April, a miracle day in=\r\n my life.
