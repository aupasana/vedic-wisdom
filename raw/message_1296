As wool is a good conductor of \nenergy.\n\nBefore you start =\r\nrequest Lord Ganapati that there are no obstacles or \nrequest him to remove=\r\n the obstacles.\n\nKeep the place clean, wash yourself the pooja items like t=\r\nhe divi etc.\n\nWhen you do these things than automatically the place where y=\r\nou do \npooja cleans up in a few days and good vibrations start to exist in =\r\n\nthe place. \n\nMost of the books have a similar process, please pick that.\n\n=\r\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n"}}
