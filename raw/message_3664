He left behind him his wife Alagammal, their three sons,\nNagaswami aged =\r\nfourteen, Ramana aged twelve and Nagasundaram aged six and\ntheir daughter A=\r\nlamelu aged four. When Ramana returned from his school at\nDindigul to Tiruc=\r\nhuli, to see his dead father for the last time, he\nreflected thoughtfully, =\r\n=E2=80=9CWhen Father is lying here, why do they say that he\nhas gone?=E2=80=\r\n=9D One of the elders answered him, =E2=80=9CIf this were your father, woul=\r\nd\nhe not receive you with love? So you see, he has gone.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe sudd=\r\nen death of the head of the family was a dramatic event which\nresulted in t=\r\nhe family being split up. Alagammal moved to Manamadurai with\nthe younger c=\r\nhildren Nagasundaram and Alamelu to live with her younger\nbrother-in-law Ne=\r\nlliappa Iyer,who was also working as a pleader. The two\nolder children move=\r\nd into the house of Subba Iyer, another uncle on the\nfather=E2=80=99s side,=\r\nwho lived at number 11 Chokkappa Naicken Street near the\nfamous Meenakshi t=\r\nemple.\n\nRamana was sent to Scott=E2=80=99s Middle School and later to the A=\r\nmerican Mission\nHigh School. He was an average scholar who learned easily, =\r\nbut was not much\ninterested in his lessons. He would often go unprepared to=\r\n class. If others\nrecited the day=E2=80=99s lesson he would remember enough=\r\n to enable him to keep up.\n\nLater he told his devotees the following story =\r\nwith regard to his\nschooldays, =E2=80=9CWhile the school lessons were being=\r\n taught, lest I should fall\nasleep I used to tie a thread to the nail on th=\r\ne wall, and tie my hair to\nit. When the head nods, the thread is pulled tig=\r\nht and that used to wake me\nup. Otherwise, the teacher used to twist my ear=\r\ns and wake me up.=E2=80=9D\n\nWrestling, boxing, running and other sports wer=\r\ne much more appealing to\nRamana. He was stronger than most boys of his age =\r\nand his strength and\nability even impressed the older boys. He also liked t=\r\no play football with\nhis friends. People noticed that his team always won. =\r\nThis and other similar\noccurrences earned him the nickname =E2=80=98Thangak=\r\nai=E2=80=99 (Golden Hand). It is a title\ngiven in Tamil Nadu to people who =\r\nare always successful in their\nundertakings.\n\nRamana did not study Sanskrit=\r\n or the sacred traditions of Hinduism such as\nthe Vedas or the Upanishads. =\r\nIn both the schools he attended he was taught\nChristianity, but Hindu boys =\r\ngenerally showed little interest in such bible\nclasses =E2=80=93 and Ramana=\r\n was no exception in this respect.\n\nAlthough he was very much like any othe=\r\nr boy, he did have one peculiar\ntrait. His sleep used to be exceptionally d=\r\neep. When a relative later\nvisited him at the Ashram Ramana recalled the fo=\r\nllowing incident which\nhappened in Dindigul, =E2=80=9CYour uncle Periappa S=\r\neshaiyar was living there then.\nThere was some function in the house and al=\r\nl went to it and then in the\nnight went to the temple. I was left alone in =\r\nthe house. I was sitting\nreading in the front room,but after a while I lock=\r\ned the front door and\nfastened the windows and went to sleep. When they ret=\r\nurned from the temple\nno amount of shouting or banging at the door or windo=\r\nw could wake me. At\nlast they managed to open the door with a key from the =\r\nopposite house and\nthen they tried to wake me up by beating me.All the boys=\r\n beat me to their\nheart=E2=80=99s content, and your uncle did too, but with=\r\nout effect. I knew nothing\nabout it till they told me next morning. =E2=80=\r\n=A6 The same sort of thing happened\nto me in Madurai too. The boys didn=E2=\r\n=80=99t dare to touch me when I was awake,but\nif they had any grudge agains=\r\nt me they would come when I was asleep and\ncarry me wherever they liked and=\r\n beat me as much as they liked and then put\nme back to bed, and I would kno=\r\nw nothing about it until they told me in the\nmorning.\n\nSoon thereafter, in =\r\nthe middle of July 1896, at the age of 16, the great\nchange took place in h=\r\nis life. He was at the time a pupil in his final year\nat secondary school. =\r\nHe later described the incident which changed his life\ncompletely and irrev=\r\nersibly, =E2=80=9CIt was about six weeks before I left Madurai\nfor good tha=\r\nt the great change in my life took place. It was so sudden. One\nday I sat u=\r\np alone on the first floor of my uncle=E2=80=99s house. I was in my usual\nh=\r\nealth. I seldom had any illness. I was a heavy sleeper. =E2=80=A6 So, on th=\r\nat day\nas I sat alone there was nothing wrong with my health. But a sudden =\r\nand\nunmistakable fear of death seized me. I felt I was going to die.Why I s=\r\nhould\nhave so felt cannot now be explained by anything felt in my body. Nor=\r\n could\nI explain it to myself then. I did not however trouble myself to dis=\r\ncover if\nthe fear was well grounded. I felt =E2=80=98I was going to die,=E2=\r\n=80=99 and at once set\nabout thinking out what I should do. I did not care =\r\nto consult doctors or\nelders or even friends. I felt I had to solve the pro=\r\nblem myself then and\nthere.\n\nThe shock of fear of death made me at once int=\r\nrospective, or =E2=80=98introverted=E2=80=99.I\nsaid to myself mentally, i.e=\r\n., without uttering the words =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98Now, death has\ncome. What =\r\ndoes it mean? What is it that is dying? This body dies.=E2=80=99 I at\nonce =\r\ndramatized the scene of death. I extended my limbs and held them rigid\nas t=\r\nhough rigor-mortis had set in. I imitated a corpse to lend an air of\nrealit=\r\ny to my further investigation. I held my breath and kept my mouth\nclosed, p=\r\nressing the lips tightly together so that no sound might escape.\nLet not th=\r\ne word =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or any other word be uttered! =E2=80=98Well then=\r\n,=E2=80=99 said I to\nmyself,=E2=80=98this body is dead. It will be carried =\r\nstiff to the burning ground\nand there burnt and reduced to ashes. But with =\r\nthe death of this body, am\n=E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D dead? Is the body =E2=80=9CI=\r\n=E2=80=9D? This body is silent and inert. But I feel the\nfull force of my p=\r\nersonality and even the sound =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D within myself, - apart\nfr=\r\nom the body. So =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D am a spirit, a thing transcending the b=\r\nody. The\nmaterial body dies, but the spirit transcending it cannot be touch=\r\ned by\ndeath. I am therefore the deathless spirit.=E2=80=99\n\nAll this was no=\r\nt a mere intellectual process, but flashed before me vividly\nas living trut=\r\nh, something which I perceived immediately,without any\nargument almost. =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 was something very real, the only real thing in that\nstate=\r\n, and all the conscious activity that was connected with my body was\ncentre=\r\nd on that. The =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 or my =E2=80=98self=E2=80=99 was holding=\r\n the focus of attention by\na powerful fascination from that time forwards. =\r\nFear of death had vanished\nonce and forever. Absorption in the Self has con=\r\ntinued from that moment\nright up to this time. Other thoughts may come and =\r\ngo like the various notes\nof a musician, but the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 contin=\r\nues like the basic or fundamental sruti\nnote which accompanies and blends w=\r\nith all other notes.Whether the body was\nengaged in talking, reading or any=\r\nthing else,I was still centred on =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.\n\nHe reports, =E2=80=\r\n=9CWhen I lay down with limbs outstretched and mentally enacted\nthe death s=\r\ncene and realized that the body would be taken and cremated and\nyet I would=\r\n live, some force, call it atmic power [power of atman] or\nanything else, r=\r\nose within me and took possession of me. With that, I was\nreborn and I beca=\r\nme a new man. I became indifferent to everything\nafterwards,having neither =\r\nlikes nor dislikes.=E2=80=9D\n\nFrom now on he swallowed everything that was =\r\nserved to him,whether delicious\nor tasteless, good or bad, with no regard t=\r\no how it tasted or smelled, or to\nits quality. Formerly, if he thought an i=\r\nnjustice had been done to him or if\nother boys teased him, he would stand u=\r\np for himself. Now he accepted\neverything without protest. He was also no l=\r\nonger interested in joining in\nhis friends=E2=80=99 sporting activities, bu=\r\nt rather sat alone and meditated with\neyes closed in yogic posture. At scho=\r\nol he started to encounter\nproblems,because he was no longer interested in =\r\nbooks. He remembered,=E2=80=9CAfter\nthe =E2=80=98death=E2=80=99 experience =\r\nI was living in a different\nworld. How could I turn my attention to books? =\r\nBefore that, I would at least\nattend to what the other boys repeated and re=\r\npeat the same myself. But\nafterwards, I could not do even that. At school, =\r\nmy mind would not dwell on\nstudy at all. I would be imagining and expecting=\r\n God would suddenly drop\ndown from Heaven before me.=E2=80=9D\n\nAfter his en=\r\nlightenment Ramana started to visit the temple regularly.He\nrecalled, =E2=\r\n=80=9CFormerly I would go there rarely with friends,see the images, put\non =\r\nsacred ashes and sacred vermilion on the forehead and return home without\na=\r\nny perceptible emotion.\n\nDuring his last month in Madurai, Ramana suffered =\r\nfrom an unusual intense\npain in his head and a burning sensation. But all s=\r\nymptoms of his profound\nchange disappeared when he stepped into the temple =\r\nat Tiruvannamalai for the\nfirst time on 1st September\n1896.\n\nSource: Ramana=\r\n Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd0eba237a120047efe2cff\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIn February 1892 Sundaram Iyer unexpectedly died, he was in his =\r\nmid-forties.

I became indifferent to everything afterwards,having neither =\r\nlikes nor dislikes.=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;From now on he swallowed every=\r\nthing that was served to him,whether delicious or tasteless, good or bad, w=\r\nith no regard to how it tasted or smelled, or to its quality. Formerly, if =\r\nhe thought an injustice had been done to him or if other boys teased him, h=\r\ne would stand up for himself. Now he accepted everything without protest. H=\r\ne was also no longer interested in joining in his friends=E2=80=99 sporting=\r\n activities, but rather sat alone and meditated with eyes closed in yogic p=\r\nosture. At school he started to encounter problems,because he was no longer=\r\n interested in books. He remembered,=E2=80=9CAfter the =E2=80=98death=E2=80=\r\n=99 experience I was living in a different&lt;br&gt;\n\nworld. How could I turn my =\r\nattention to books? Before that, I would at least attend to what the other =\r\nboys repeated and repeat the same myself. But afterwards, I could not do ev=\r\nen that. At school, my mind would not dwell on study at all. I would be ima=\r\ngining and expecting God would suddenly drop down from Heaven before me.=E2=\r\n=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;After his enlightenment Ra=\r\nmana started to visit the temple regularly.He recalled, =E2=80=9CFormerly I=\r\n would go there rarely with friends,see the images, put on sacred ashes and=\r\n sacred vermilion on the forehead and return home without any perceptible e=\r\nmotion.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;During his last month in Madurai, Ramana suffered f=\r\nrom an unusual intense pain in his head and a burning sensation.
