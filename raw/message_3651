What kind of progress one is making is primary.\n\nHow well has your li=\r\nmited personality been replaced? How proud do you feel when you achieve som=\r\nething or someone praises you and how angry or sad you feel when you fail o=\r\nr someone abuses you? How happy do you feel when something good happens to =\r\nyou or your family physically and how sad do you feel when something bad ha=\r\nppens to you or your family? When you are attracted to something, how badly=\r\n do you want to have it? When you are repelled by something, how badly do y=\r\nou want to avoid it?\n\nTHAT determines how much progress you have made. Not =\r\nhow many millions of times you repeated a mantra or how many thousands of h=\r\nomas you did or how many scriptures you read or how many temples you visite=\r\nd or how many mystical visions you saw or how many mystical sounds you hear=\r\nd.\n\nIf you had a vision and yet there is no progress, the vision is probabl=\r\ny a hallucination. Even if it is real, it is as good as a hallucination. If=\r\n you say &quot;I have a cow in my house&quot;, I will say &quot;show me milk from it.&quot; If =\r\nyou say there is no milk, I will say it is probably a big toy cow and not a=\r\n real cow. Even if it is a real cow, it is as good as a toy cow that gives =\r\nno milk.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIf you see message 3481 (http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481), you will see a couple of examples where=\r\n one person experienced something and another person demonstrated awareness=\r\n of that experience. Such third party verification can suggest that an expe=\r\nrience is perhaps not a hallucination of one mind.\n\nHowever, the thing with=\r\n third party verification is that extra-sensory things may not be perceived=\r\n uniformly. In Rajarshi&#39;s example, one person perceived an elephant and ano=\r\nther a great force, at a Mahaganapathi homam.\n\nI mentioned a couple of exam=\r\nples earlier. In one case, a person was meditating with Gayatri mantra whil=\r\ne thinking of Mahalakshmi and, after attaining a good level of focus, he pe=\r\nrceived the Mother as all-pervading light that filled his entire consciousn=\r\ness. He was in a blissful state. A priest with some psychic abilities stand=\r\ning a few feet away and doing a Rudraabhishekam had a vision of 18-handed M=\r\nahalakshmi standing in the place of this person.\n\nIn another example I ment=\r\nioned before, one person finishing a Chandi homam was calling the Mother ba=\r\nck into his heart from the fire. His eyes were closed and he was visualizin=\r\ng the Mother as light that was entering him and he felt nice. A person sitt=\r\ning behind him and meditating was startled by a vision that flashed of a da=\r\nrk goddess who was jumping at him with a pile of kumkum. When he opened eye=\r\ns, he found the person performing homam pointing hands at himself.\n\nOne may=\r\n perceive the same entity as energy or force or light or sound or a specifi=\r\nc human-like form. Thus, it is difficult to find third party verification o=\r\nf a mystical experience, except in rare cases.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nThe focus=\r\n on experiences is counter-productive. One yearning for an experience may b=\r\ne doing so for sub-conscious satisfaction of ego.\n\nMoreover, anticipation o=\r\nf an experience or some other tangible result hampers one&#39;s focus during me=\r\nditation or homam or other sadhanas. The goal of sadhana is to overcome ego=\r\n (&quot;I-ness&quot;) and create a vacuum in the mind that can be filled by the deity=\r\n. If one is not distracted by thoughts and keeps the mind focused on mantra=\r\n to the best of one&#39;s ability, a time will come someday when the remaining =\r\nfew thoughts wither away like plants not getting enough water. When all tho=\r\nughts cease, a vacuum is created in the mind which can be filled by the man=\r\ntra or its deity. THAT is the goal of sadhana. A mind filled with anticipat=\r\nion of a result and pride cannot create such a vacuum. The anticipation of =\r\na result is like a big tree that will not wither away and instead give rise=\r\n to many plants continually.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIf you believe you had a visi=\r\non of a deity or a higher being, make sure it does not increase your pride =\r\nor sense of entitlement (&quot;I deserve this.

It is not a full st=\r\nop or period, but just a comma. Let me tell a parable.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; A person love=\r\nd one dress and wore it always. He never removed the dress and kept the dre=\r\nss on him all the time and never considered the possibility of changing int=\r\no a different dress. The idea of removing that dress was unbearable to that=\r\n person. He thought he should wear that dress forever.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The dress bec=\r\name so dirty and torn that it was time to change it. A person looking extre=\r\nmely scary came up to the person oneday to remove the dress. He removed the=\r\n dress gently if one co-operated with him and tore it apart violently if on=\r\ne fought back. After this scary person removed the old dress, another perso=\r\nn came and gave new clothes. Some people became so afraid and ashamed when =\r\nthey lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed around naked. If they d=\r\nid not become afraid or ashamed, they would&#39;ve soon gotten new clothes and =\r\nslowly started to enjoy them as well.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The clothes in this parable ar=\r\ne akin to the physical body we occupy. The person looking extremely scary i=\r\ns Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator is the person giving new c=\r\nlothes. New body taken in the next birth is the new clothes. Persons runnin=\r\ng away in fear or shame before new clothese are given are like different ki=\r\nnds of spirits.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Regarding your visua=\r\nlization of your father using reiki, please note that all visualizations of=\r\n the mind are imagery created by one&#39;s conscious and sub-conscious conditio=\r\nnining. One&#39;s beliefs, desires, pride, frustrations etc shape the imagery o=\r\nne&#39;s mind visualizes. One cannot assume it to be accurate. Also, there is n=\r\no reliable way to know if your prayers made any difference to the path take=\r\nn by your father after the cremation. The curiosity and the tendency to spe=\r\nculate will naturally last for sometime, but the bottomline is that you can=\r\nnot really do much more than speculate.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n\n&gt; =\r\n\n\n&gt; Regarding the hen/cock, it is associated with Koumaari, among the forms=\r\n of Divine Mother. In the 8th chapter of Chandipath, the Maatrikas (Mothers=\r\n) are described (Braahmi, Maaheswari, Koumari, Vaishnavi etc). Koumari is a=\r\nccompanied by peacock and cock. In the Kaashi descriptions given by Rajarsh=\r\ni, a sadhaka of Kaala Bhairava was worshipping in funeral pyre at a sacred =\r\nplace with Kaala Bhairava as the guardian deity (Kaashi).

And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and inter=\r\nest. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (=\r\nafter struggling with renal failure and other complications) at our home in=\r\n Hyderabad. When we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for=\r\n final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram na=\r\nam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doin=\r\ng a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started =\r\nwondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. =\r\nI thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my da=\r\nd&#39;s funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). An=\r\nd then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by m=\r\nyself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think t=\r\nhat I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, =\r\nI started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...espec=\r\nially\n\n&gt;  in/around the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watche=\r\nd&#39; the sensations as equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even th=\r\nis would change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at =\r\nthe level of the mind, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi=\r\n Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element =\r\nto it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and=\r\n jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my re=\r\nquest) - and he went away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minut=\r\nes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought some ghee. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; It was my first time at a smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time=\r\n that I had seen death/dead body at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;del=\r\nicate&#39; situation for me, but soon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest =\r\nbrother - exactly at sunset time), I composed myself, went in the direction=\r\n opposite to where all the friends/relatives were standing and sat down on =\r\na stone platform in sukhaasana. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on e=\r\nither side, told them that I would like to meditate, and requested them to =\r\nlet me know if &#39;something&#39; happens. I had already observed a brown colored =\r\ndog (thanks to the vivid description in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the=\r\n funeral-pyre platform, so I think, I was expecting the dog to behave a lit=\r\ntle differently (silly me!!):). \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked =\r\nMother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and see=\r\nked their support and blessings in my very first attempt in doing such a ri=\r\ntual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on breath, and I =\r\nsaw my breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my breath for few =\r\nminutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warning that this =\r\nshould be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gaining spiritual=\r\n progress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be different. I ha=\r\nd a deep desire that my father accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey=\r\n in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further and felt =\r\nthat there was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about attempting such =\r\na unconventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendere=\r\nd myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mu=\r\nndane desires. Everytime I have done\n\n&gt;  homam in the past, I have asked yo=\r\nu to purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe that it won&#39;=\r\nt be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karmas, if I co=\r\nntinue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I ask you to p=\r\nurify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane desire =\r\nthat his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peaceful. I am =\r\nsincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurities and my=\r\n ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yours if he =\r\nis doing something wrong&quot;. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; After this mental dialogue, I th=\r\nough of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought about Maa=\r\n Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra that I am a=\r\n little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL are for=\r\nms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter, which D=\r\nevi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga and instea=\r\nd saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying my mental=\r\n imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that with th=\r\ne colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purple was di=\r\nfferent, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating that colou=\r\nr with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying =\r\nto be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa which has ar=\r\nrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the thoughts =\r\nabout the desire and surrendering\n of\n\n&gt;  my ignorance. I sought permission=\r\n from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also reme=\r\nmber clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind, an=\r\nd to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to definet=\r\nely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I had a small m=\r\nental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going=\r\n to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visuali=\r\nsing that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visual=\r\nise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at th=\r\ne end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam withou=\r\nt the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation =\r\nof Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise he=\r\nr lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few m=\r\ninutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it=\r\n at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think =\r\nabout five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see i=\r\nf the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and =\r\ndid NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was sil=\r\nly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless\n I\n=\r\n\n&gt;  continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering an=\r\nd opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as i=\r\nt had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of la=\r\nnd next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure=\r\n) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning f=\r\nuneral and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if t=\r\nhe hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, p=\r\nerhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the fire parti=\r\ncles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of=\r\n the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watche=\r\nd the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came in=\r\nstead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time f=\r\nor us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I\n\n&gt;  con=\r\ntinued the mental chanting. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; And then my cousin signalled me=\r\n that it was time for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start wal=\r\nking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in th=\r\ne plastic packet itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess=\r\n from Maa for my impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offe=\r\nred only three times, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer a=\r\nnd started wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samag=\r\nri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and =\r\nasked me to hurry up and join them, and even though it was dark and he woul=\r\nd not have seen exactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I=\r\n did not want anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly step=\r\nped back, emptied the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised =\r\nto the Devi again for my impudence and requested her to accept this final o=\r\nffering and threw it at the funeral\n\n&gt;  pyre from a distance. I thanked her=\r\n once again and requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked eve=\r\nryone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walk=\r\ned and joined the group. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; When I was washing my hands and fe=\r\net at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to th=\r\ne fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesame seeds =\r\nor jaggery??). \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; On the way back home and for the entire even=\r\ning, I felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense=\r\n of achievement, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my =\r\nmind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a c=\r\nertian stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as m=\r\nuch as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The v=\r\nisualisations could have been a product of my own imagination - but the sil=\r\nence was real. And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing.=\r\n \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had=\r\n witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat sp=\r\necial. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love fo=\r\nr our father.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Now that it is few days since that incident, I=\r\n have questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it=\r\n jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and=\r\n the fact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? =\r\nDid Shakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I v=\r\nisualise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half=\r\n-constructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him?=\r\n \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I am not sure if these questions can be answered or if the=\r\ny should be answered at all, but based on the above experience, if anyone h=\r\nas any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.\n\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Thank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued inspiratio=\r\nn. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Also, apologies for the length of the note.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; Regards\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Sharad\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1300298168-1265410962=:84421\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually, whether an experien=\r\nce is real or hallucination is secondary. What kind of progress one is maki=\r\nng is primary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How well has your limited personality been replaced? =\r\nHow proud do you feel when you achieve something or someone praises you and=\r\n how angry or sad you feel when you fail or someone abuses you? How happy d=\r\no you feel when something good happens to you or your family physically and=\r\n how sad do you feel when something bad happens to you or your family? When=\r\n you are attracted to something, how badly do you want to have it? When you=\r\n are repelled by something, how badly do you want to avoid it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;THAT =\r\ndetermines how much progress you have made. Not how many millions of times =\r\nyou repeated a mantra or how many thousands of homas you did or how many sc=\r\nriptures you read or how many temples you visited or how many mystical visi=\r\nons\n you saw or how many mystical sounds you heard.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you had a vis=\r\nion and yet there is no progress, the vision is probably a hallucination. E=\r\nven if it is real, it is as good as a hallucination. If you say &quot;I have a c=\r\now in my house&quot;, I will say &quot;show me milk from it.&quot; If you say there is no =\r\nmilk, I will say it is probably a big toy cow and not a real cow. Even if i=\r\nt is a real cow, it is as good as a toy cow that gives no milk.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you see message 3481 (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom/message/3481), you will see a couple of examples where one perso=\r\nn experienced something and another person demonstrated awareness of that e=\r\nxperience. Such third party verification can suggest that an experience is =\r\nperhaps not a hallucination of one mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the thing with thi=\r\nrd party verification is that extra-sensory things may not be perceived\n un=\r\niformly. In Rajarshi&#39;s example, one person perceived an elephant and anothe=\r\nr a great force, at a Mahaganapathi homam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I mentioned a couple of e=\r\nxamples earlier. In one case, a person was meditating with Gayatri mantra w=\r\nhile thinking of Mahalakshmi and, after attaining a good level of focus, he=\r\n perceived the Mother as all-pervading light that filled his entire conscio=\r\nusness. He was in a blissful state. A priest with some psychic abilities st=\r\nanding a few feet away and doing a Rudraabhishekam had a vision of 18-hande=\r\nd Mahalakshmi standing in the place of this person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In another examp=\r\nle I mentioned before, one person finishing a Chandi homam was calling the =\r\nMother back into his heart from the fire. His eyes were closed and he was v=\r\nisualizing the Mother as light that was entering him and he felt nice. A pe=\r\nrson sitting behind him and meditating was startled by a vision that flashe=\r\nd of a dark goddess who was jumping at him with a pile of kumkum.\n When he =\r\nopened eyes, he found the person performing homam pointing hands at himself=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One may perceive the same entity as energy or force or light or so=\r\nund or a specific human-like form. Thus, it is difficult to find third part=\r\ny verification of a mystical experience, except in rare cases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The focus on experiences is counter-productive. One yearni=\r\nng for an experience may be doing so for sub-conscious satisfaction of ego.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, anticipation of an experience or some other tangible resu=\r\nlt hampers one&#39;s focus during meditation or homam or other sadhanas. The go=\r\nal of sadhana is to overcome ego (&quot;I-ness&quot;) and create a vacuum in the mind=\r\n that can be filled by the deity. If one is not distracted by thoughts and =\r\nkeeps the mind focused on mantra to the best of one&#39;s ability, a time will =\r\ncome someday when the remaining few thoughts wither away\n like plants not g=\r\netting enough water. When all thoughts cease, a vacuum is created in the mi=\r\nnd which can be filled by the mantra or its deity. THAT is the goal of sadh=\r\nana. A mind filled with anticipation of a result and pride cannot create su=\r\nch a vacuum. The anticipation of a result is like a big tree that will not =\r\nwither away and instead give rise to many plants continually.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you believe you had a vision of a deity or a higher bein=\r\ng, make sure it does not increase your pride or sense of entitlement (&quot;I de=\r\nserve this.

A person looking ex=\r\ntremely scary came up to the person oneday to remove the dress. He removed =\r\nthe dress gently if one co-operated with him and tore it apart violently if=\r\n one fought back. After this scary person removed the old dress, another pe=\r\nrson came and gave new clothes. Some people became so afraid and ashamed wh=\r\nen they lost old clothes that they ran away and roamed around naked.

The person looking ex=\r\ntremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator is the pers=\r\non giving new clothes.

And =\r\nI have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On the 28th of Jan, my father passed a=\r\nway peacefully (after struggling with renal failure and other complications=\r\n) at our home in Hyderabad. When we were taking my father&#39;s body to the sma=\r\nshaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind was constantly reminded of the brilli=\r\nant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his ex=\r\nperience of doing a Chandi Homam on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji)=\r\n, and I started wondering if I would get to see some Aghoris in the smashaa=\r\nn bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs =\r\na homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that he would also attain some punya (as p=\r\ner the note). And then immediately, I had an intense desire to perform a si=\r\nmilar homam by myself, but I quickly reminded myself that I must be kidding=\r\n to even think that I can do such a feat. As we descended the steps of the =\r\nsmashaan bhumi, I started experiencing intensely subtle sensations all over=\r\n my body...especially&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  in/around the abdominal region. As taught i=\r\nn Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equanimously as I could, and tol=\r\nd myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon after, a thought came to my mi=\r\nnd, that it is all at the level of the mind, and may be I should perform a =\r\nmini version of Chandi Homam in my mental imagery. But I still wanted to ha=\r\nve a tangible element to it, so I asked a friend, if he could procure some =\r\nblack sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I think of it, this friend was not=\r\n even baffled at my request) - and he went away saying he would try and ret=\r\nurned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 things and in addition he bought =\r\nsome ghee. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It was my first time at =\r\na smashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead b=\r\nody at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but =\r\nsoon after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset t=\r\nime), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the fr=\r\niends/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasan=\r\na. I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I =\r\nwould like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; ha=\r\nppens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid desc=\r\nription in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I =\r\nthink, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):=\r\n). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I closed my eyes - thanked Mothe=\r\nr Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked t=\r\nheir support and blessings in my very first attempt in doing such a ritual.=\r\n Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to focussing on breath, and I saw m=\r\ny breathing was a little fast. I continued watching my breath for few minut=\r\nes and soon, I was centred enough. I remembered the warning that this shoul=\r\nd be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest intention of gaining spiritual prog=\r\nress; so I inspected my mind and found the truth to be different. I had a d=\r\neep desire that my father accumulates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in t=\r\nhe non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I inspected further and felt that =\r\nthere was some thrill/excitement too in my mind about attempting such a unc=\r\nonventional thing. I did not want to give-up, so I mentally surrendered mys=\r\nelf and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane=\r\n desires. Everytime I have\n done&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  homam in the past, I have asked =\r\nyou to purify my mind, because I have believed and still believe that it wo=\r\nn&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullification of my past karmas, if I =\r\ncontinue generating new ones at the same speed. Today as well, I ask you to=\r\n purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, has this mundane desir=\r\ne that his father attains some punya and his journey ahead is peaceful. I a=\r\nm sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accept my impurities and =\r\nmy ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon this son of yours if h=\r\ne is doing something wrong&quot;. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; After =\r\nthis mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even =\r\nthough I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ON=\r\nLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my=\r\n mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should =\r\nnot really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visu=\r\nalise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and=\r\n fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying=\r\n to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his f=\r\neet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my m=\r\nind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skelet=\r\nal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is th=\r\ne form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repea=\r\nted mentally the thoughts about the desire and\n surrendering of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  m=\r\ny ignorance. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by ex=\r\nplaning the context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared to=\r\no, and I told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt d=\r\neem me to be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I had a small mental dialogue with=\r\n my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, and I seeke=\r\nd his permission, forgiveness and blessings. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried vi=\r\nsualising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not actually v=\r\nisualise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with the swaha =\r\nat the end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam w=\r\nithout the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisa=\r\ntion of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visuali=\r\nse her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A =\r\nfew minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and thr=\r\new it at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I t=\r\nhink about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to =\r\nsee if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes,=\r\n and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it wa=\r\ns silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but\n neverthele=\r\nss I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings fl=\r\nuttering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a ro=\r\noster, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the =\r\npiece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - =\r\nam not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to th=\r\ne burning funeral and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It see=\r\nmed as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second=\r\n it felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the=\r\n fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as =\r\na result of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platfor=\r\nm. I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black =\r\nhen came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until i=\r\nt is time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. S=\r\no\n I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  continued the mental chanting. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to=\r\n leave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the =\r\nblack sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walk=\r\ned towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and as=\r\nked her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was =\r\nsooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did =\r\nManish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin =\r\nof mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join the=\r\nm, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was =\r\nhappening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that=\r\n I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of=\r\n the packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudenc=\r\ne and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the\n fune=\r\nral&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested =\r\nher to simply do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo=\r\n group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When I was washing my hands and feet=\r\n at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to the =\r\nfire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesame seeds or=\r\n jaggery??). &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On the way back home a=\r\nnd for the entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt s=\r\nay that I felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happened=\r\n was not strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking abo=\r\nut &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. I =\r\nwatched my breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a se=\r\nnse of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my own ima=\r\ngination - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was the=\r\n most beautiful thing. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The next day=\r\n, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires, but th=\r\ne one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if my broth=\r\ner was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now that it is few days since that incident, I have=\r\n questions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jump=\r\ning &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the =\r\nfact that in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did S=\r\nhakti really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visual=\r\nise my dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-cons=\r\ntructed building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure if these questions can be=\r\n answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the above expe=\r\nrience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ teachings, I would be mo=\r\nst appreciative.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thank you PVR/Manis=\r\nh and Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Also, apologies for the length of the note.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sharad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-1300298168-1265410962=:84421--\r\n\n"}}
