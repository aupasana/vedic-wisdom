Rao &lt;pvr108@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sri Shanmukha Sivacharyar,\n&gt;\n&gt; A year consists of months and a month consist of days. If one uses years,\n&gt; months and days *consistently*, all years should start with a particular\n&gt; month and end with particular month and all months should start with a\n&gt; particular day and end with a particular day.\n&gt;\n&gt; But that is broken if one mixes tithis (lunar days or rather soli-lunar\n&gt; days) with months of souramaana. One month may start on Sukla Ashtami and\n&gt; another month on Sukla Chaturthi. How logical is that?\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Even the chaandramana calculations we follow today may be imperfect.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, ask a simple question: Why were the twelve months named that\n&gt; way?\n&gt;\n&gt; Chaitra month starts when Moon and Sun are together in Meena (Poorvabhadra\n&gt; 4th pada, Uttarabhadra, Revati). Why is it named Chaitra? Vaisakha month\n&gt; starts when Moon and Sun are together in Mesha (Aswini, Bharani, Krittika\n&gt; 1st pada). Why is it named Vaisakha? Jyeshtha month starts when Moon and Sun\n&gt; are together in Vrishabha (Krittika 2nd, 3rd and 4th padas, Rohini,\n&gt; Mrigasira 1st and 2nd padas). Why is it named Jyeshtha?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you look carefully, the names of the months are based on stars\n&gt; (Chita-Chaitra, Visakha-Vaisakha, Jyeshtha-Jyeshtha etc). Starting from\n&gt; Chitra, 12 out of 27 stars are picked for the names of months. At the time\n&gt; of Full Moon in Chaitra month, Moon moves by 180 degrees compared to where\n&gt; he was at the beginning of the month (Meena) and is around Chitra star. At\n&gt; the time of Full Moon in Vaisakha month, Moon moves by 180 degrees compared\n&gt; to where he was at the beginning of the month (Mesha) and is around Visakha\n&gt; star. And so on.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is logical to guess that the zodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not\n&gt; necessarily aligned to the twelve rasis) and the name of a month is decided\n&gt; based on the star occupied by Moon at the middle of the month, i.e. at the\n&gt; time of Full Moon. A prominent star was chosen in the twelve equal parts and\n&gt; the month was named based on it.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Mooladhara chakra is in the middle of the body and it is the basis of our\n&gt; existence. The chakras at the top of the head or the bottom of the feet are\n&gt; not taken as the base. In astrology, zodiac is decided by the Chitra star,\n&gt; i.e. Chitra star is perfectly aligned to the *middle* of the zodiac. We do\n&gt; not fix the beginning of the zodiac by the exact location of Aswini star,\n&gt; but by taking 180 degrees from the exact location of Chitra star. Similarly,\n&gt; it is possible that a month is named based on the star occupied at the\n&gt; *middle* of the month rather than the beginning.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; When the current month started as per soli-lunar (chaandramaana) calendar\n&gt; on January 15, Sun and Moon were in Capricorn. So it is called &quot;Maagha\n&gt; maasa&quot; based on current conventions.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, Pournima of that month is running right now and Moon is in the 2nd\n&gt; pada of Pushya star right now. He is far from Magha star. Is this really\n&gt; Maagha Pournima as people think?\n&gt;\n&gt; My personal view is that it is Pushya Pournima right now and Feb 11 is\n&gt; Pushya Krishna Chaturdasi and not MahaaShivaraatri.\n&gt;\n&gt; When a new month as per Chaandramaana starts on February 13, people\n&gt; consider it as Phalguna maasa because Moon and Sun are in Kumbha. But the\n&gt; next Pournima on February 28 coincides with Magha nakshatra. I suggest that\n&gt; THAT is the real Maagha Pournima. So March 13 is the Maagha Krishna\n&gt; Chaturdasi, i.e. MahaaShivaraatri.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline: I agree with the conclusion of souramaana proponents this\n&gt; particular time, but for a different reason compared to theirs. I\n&gt; respectfully suggest that we are all lacking in our understanding of the\n&gt; correct calendar used with tithi based festivals. We celebrate festivals on\n&gt; the correct days most of the times, but make mistakes now and then. Some\n&gt; misunderstandings still need to be corrected.\n&gt;\n&gt; Good thing is that the knowledge of rishis is self-revealing and\n&gt; self-correcting. If one is sincere and applies oneself, one can find the\n&gt; answers.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\r\n--0016368342581fb97e047e727a55\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Ap=\r\nple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Pranaams Narasimha,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;From Aghora II: Kundalini=\r\n, I reproduce what Vimalananda says &quot;....There are four important nigh=\r\nts: Maha (Shiva) Ratri or Krishna Chaturdasi during lunar month of Magha, K=\r\nrura Ratri (Holi) or Pournami after Maha ratri, Moha Ratri or Astami in lun=\r\nar month of Shravana, and Kala ratri or Krishna Chaturdasi in lunar month o=\r\nf Ashwin...&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-si=\r\nze: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; f=\r\nace=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size=\r\n: large;&quot;&gt;Most calendars in North India have put Holi as March 1 but in lig=\r\nht of what you/Sivachariar are saying about MahaShivaRatri, Holi should be =\r\ncelebrated on March 29 instead?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;App=\r\nle-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple=\r\n-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;best regards&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; face=3D&quot;garamond, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-s=\r\npan&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;Hari&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gm=\r\nail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sat, Jan 30, 2010 at 2:12 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.
