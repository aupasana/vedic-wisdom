One member kept pouri=\r\nng ghee into the side of the fire so that the fire burns well. She then add=\r\ned the firewood whenever necessary so that the fire burns brightly. I reall=\r\ny liked this. When I am doing the ceremony without assistance some of my at=\r\ntention is on keeping the fire going. This distracts me from the reciting t=\r\nhe mantras.\n\nTowards the end when I do the 3 pradakshinam, should the atten=\r\nding members of the public also do the same?\n\nPlease guide me.\nRanga\n\n\n"}}
