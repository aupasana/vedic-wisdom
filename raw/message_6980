Form is simply =\r\nmanifestation of formless. \nAll this world, which we perceive is manifestat=\r\nion of brahm. some call this manifestation as illusion and some say it as t=\r\nruth. difference is only in words. All this world is maya, the illusion.\n\nY=\r\nou already knew this. \n\nI believe that the Geeta is imparted by brahm, the =\r\nformless, in form of lord krishna. When lord krishna says &#39;i&#39; we should int=\r\nerpret iv as brahm. Lord krishna Himself is manifestation (maya, form, illu=\r\nsion - whatever name u use) of formless.\n\nIn simple words, par brahm is say=\r\ning that i am formless, but lord of this maya, i come in forms using my own=\r\n maya.\n\nIt is like a tailor making suits for people to attend a ceremony. a=\r\nnd ultimately tailor also wears a self made suit and attends the same cerem=\r\nony. :)\n\nSorry if i confused insted of helping.\nSorry for mistakes.\n\nRegard=\r\ns\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Murahari Vadapalli &lt;murahariv@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste All, \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Your help in understanding this verse is =\r\ngreatly appreciated. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; ajo pi sann avyayatma bhtanam isvaro pi san\n&gt;=\r\n prakrtim svam adhisthaya sambhavamy atma-mayaya\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Translation: Altho=\r\nugh being birthless, imperishable and immmutable, The Lord of all living en=\r\ntities; being so situated I appear in this world in my original transcedent=\r\nal &quot;FORM&quot; by my internal potency\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; This verse is very confusing to me=\r\n because my understanding is as follows:\n&gt; a) It is due to the sound, the f=\r\norm and name are created and that&#39;s why it is said that world is with names=\r\n and forms\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; How to reconcile this verse with vedas and upanishadic s=\r\ncriptures that talk about nirakara brahman? Why is bhagavan talking about f=\r\norm here? \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks & Regards,\n&gt; --Murahari\n&gt; =A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
