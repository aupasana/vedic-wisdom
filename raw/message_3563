I recommend preferring normal devatas to astra devatas (deities w=\r\nho personify weapons).\n=C2=A0\nDevatas like Mahasudarshana and Pratyangira a=\r\nre personifications of weapons. Their sadhanas are akin to taking a weapon =\r\nand using it. When one takes a weapon, one can either do a ceremonial pooja=\r\n to it and put it back or actually use it to solve problems. Though homas a=\r\nnd poojas to astra devatas were akin to the latter in old days, they are ak=\r\nin to the former now-a-days. In the old days, detached sadhakas of a high c=\r\naliber existed in the priest class and they used to do homas and poojas to =\r\nastra devatas like Mahasudarsana and Pratyangira and produced results quick=\r\nly. Though most priests of today are only capable of doing an aayudha pooja=\r\n rather than using the aayudha, they nevertheless instinctively go for thes=\r\ne\n poojas based on the old habits. However, based on the changed capabiliti=\r\nes, one should change the strategy.\n\nJust as a son who is troubled by bulli=\r\nes at school is better off complaining to mother or father and let them tak=\r\ne care of the problem, instead of taking the weapon of mother or father and=\r\n trying to use it oneself, my humble opinion is that worship of deities who=\r\n hold those weapons is better today than worship of deities personifying we=\r\napons, to solve serious problems.\n\nFor countering black magic, I suggest do=\r\ning Rahu-Ketu homam or Chandi homam or Narasimha homam. Narasimha homam wit=\r\nh &quot;ugram veeram&quot; mantra may be a good idea. For removing black magic, homam=\r\n or worship of Dattatreya is also a good idea.\n\nIf you want the specific ma=\r\nterial result of removing black magic, maintain physical purity around you =\r\nwhen you do homam. Offer black sesame seeds in homam. If you have a pomegra=\r\nnate tree near you, offering pomegranate flowers in\n homam is a good idea. =\r\nPut a full lime (green) everyday as poornaahuti and make sure it burns full=\r\ny by putting enough fuel (wood/coconut/ ghee) along with it. You may need t=\r\no offer more ghee a few times as poornaahuti burnas, to make it burn fully.=\r\n Also, in the sankalpa of the homam, you may add &quot;maamuddishya kR^itebhyaH =\r\nabhicaaraadi prayogebhyo bhaavita pIDaayaaH upashamanaarthaM&quot; (in ITrans tr=\r\nansliteration) after &quot;so and so devataa prasaada siddhyartham&quot; that appears=\r\n in the Sankalpa in the manuals.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritua=\r\nl manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a di=\r\nfference:\n http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Fri, 1/22/10, prm77=\r\n82 &lt;prm7782@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: prm7782 &lt;prm7782@yahoo. com&gt;\nSubject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] which homam to choose?\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nD=\r\nate: Friday, January 22, 2010, 5:05 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nWhich homam works best fo=\r\nr getting rid of black magic?
