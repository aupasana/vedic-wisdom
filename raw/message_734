H=\r\ne \nhas effectively convinced me that Pride is the one what needs to be \ncon=\r\ntrolled and finally annihilate. in my case, whenever i did some \nsadhana, i=\r\n would feel some pride which used to go unnoticed by me \nmost of the times.=\r\n Now atleast i&#39;ve started acknowledging it and \nthat, in my opinion is the =\r\nfirst step. once you acknowledge some \nerrors then only you can take a corr=\r\nective steps.\n\nHe has also blew away a big burden from my heart and that is=\r\n the \nburden of Longing for subtle experiences.\n\nand there are some other t=\r\nhings which was clarified very effectively \nwhich i would mention some othe=\r\nr time.\n\nthe following sentences of his would be really inspirational for m=\r\nany\n\n&gt;Don&#39;t worry about mundane things like respect, disrespect, \n&gt;sillines=\r\ns, smartness, eloquence, disorganized writings etc. We are \n&gt;not here to im=\r\npress anyone, including our gurus or sishyas. We are \n&gt;here to do sadhana, =\r\nbecome pure, realize our mission, finish the \n&gt;mission and then give up the=\r\n body.\n\nsome ligther thought from me: During Havan, it is you and \nMahaGana=\r\npati (or some other deitiy). so even if some unwanted things \nhappens, you =\r\ncan talk to the deity and say &quot;it is you who is \nperforming through me so i=\r\n need not worry. it is you who needs to \nworry about that afterall.

Let=\r\n me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the =\r\nmaster and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master=\r\n. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are yo=\r\nur way to serve \n&gt; &gt; your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord =\r\nmay be very wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and al=\r\nso many big checks everyday to mail \nothers. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a serv=\r\nant to physically carry papers to the \nbank \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do the needful.=\r\n Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and =\r\nyet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda \nin \n&gt; &gt; this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wo=\r\nrld. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; various=\r\n rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme g=\r\nod of this world operates through various physical \n&gt; &gt; persons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; pres=\r\nent on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, pu=\r\nrify ourselves and \n&gt; &gt; try \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s wo=\r\nrk. Just as a servant \n&gt; &gt; carries \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we d=\r\no such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as=\r\n good work tends to \npromote \n&gt; &gt; ego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against i=\r\nt. A servant carrying a million \n&gt; &gt; dollar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; check to the bank and ca=\r\nshing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the b=\r\nank and cashing it. Both are \nmerely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and d=\r\no not own anything. Both are \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master =\r\nto carry out his agenda. \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are consi=\r\ndered great deeds in this world and \none \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who does what are considere=\r\nd meagre deeds in this world are \nboth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god e=\r\nxecute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One=\r\n may consider oneself superior \nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds a=\r\nre considered superior by the \n&gt; &gt; world, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as fool=\r\nish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another s=\r\nervant carrying something \n&gt; &gt; less \n&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If t=\r\nhis attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nttitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situatio=\r\nns his previous karmas place one in. One can remain \nhappy \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nblissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in \n&gt; &gt; light \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sa=\r\ndhana like homam.

Suppose person Y is listening \nto \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with=\r\n focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the \n&gt; &gt; mantra \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. \nOne \n&gt; &gt; can=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the \nmantra.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           However, there is a difference between meditation \na=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation \nan=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So m=\r\naking \n&gt; &gt; some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as op=\r\nposed to \n&gt; &gt; silent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowl=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any=\r\n Other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followe=\r\nd apart from having vegeterain \nfood?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybo=\r\ndy whose upanayanam (sacred thread \nceremony) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been performed can=\r\n do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           One s=\r\nhould follow the yamas and niyamas set by \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rule=\r\ns one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, =\r\none should eat only vegetarian food \non \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; day of homam and ta=\r\nke a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid ea=\r\nting any solid food 2 hours before \nhomam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           By th=\r\ne way, if one without a sacred thread wants to \ndo \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam for spiritu=\r\nal progress, I am willing to take \nresponsibility \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allow the=\r\nm to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru \nas \n&gt; &gt; guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred \nin \n&gt; &gt; the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of \npurity \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or \nno \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not \nmatter \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. \nThe \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed \nthis \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; up \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           As long as one desires no specific material \nbenefits \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n(and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for \nspirit=\r\nual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 4)Any good date to start t=\r\nhe Homam? or any day \nwould \n&gt; &gt; be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          =\r\n For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi \n&gt; &gt; morning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But =\r\nany day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n         Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my \n&gt; &gt; India \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           When I went to India in May 2008, I an=\r\nd my guru \nManish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific=\r\n project). We \n&gt; &gt; ended \n&gt; &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several pl=\r\naces (wherever we \n&gt; &gt; were). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to ca=\r\nrry an umbrella with me. \nAs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in Indi=\r\na, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We=\r\n proceeded to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to d=\r\no a homam. \nManish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily =\r\nin this city \n&gt; &gt; after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfinished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started \n&gt; &gt; raining \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket \non \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two \n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nmall \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; cover \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went =\r\noff \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshet=\r\nra \n&gt; &gt; later \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued=\r\n for a \nfew \n&gt; &gt; days \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on tha=\r\nt trip as we \ncovered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained i=\r\nn every place we \n&gt; &gt; went \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place=\r\n and prepared to move \non.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ ---------\n --\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          =\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpan=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-\n \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastr=\r\no. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windo=\r\nws): \nhttp://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           Sri Jagannat=\r\nh Centre (SJC) website: \n&gt; &gt; http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n         ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n --\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimpl=\r\ne@ gmail.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam \ndaily,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof to=\r\np of a \nhouse\n&gt; &gt; (3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ?
