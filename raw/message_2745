In any case, what is called as Ahamkara in 24 princi=\r\nples of Sankhya is actually Asmita, which can be very-loosely pitted as Aha=\r\nmkara.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The idea stated by me was on firm grounds - with reference to=\r\n Patanjali Sutras and the words of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi=\r\n. And this idea is there in my first mail, though not the exact table: \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  =3D ASMITA   =3D Physical Egotism\n&gt;   ASTRA=\r\nL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D MANAS    =3D Astral attachments\n&gt;   CAUSAL I-NES=\r\nS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D CHITTA   =3D Causal Perceptions\n&gt; \n&gt;   Also, one of the=\r\n 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don&#39;t have sen=\r\nse of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since astral-bod=\r\nied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to \n&gt; &gt; see, hear, smell, ta=\r\nste and so on (refer Autobiography of a \n&gt; &gt; Yogi)... the sense of egoism d=\r\noes not take roots in the astral-body &gt; and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Kar=\r\nma.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has \n&gt; &gt; Physical=\r\n Karma.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Lastly, extending upon this idea further, there are beings i=\r\nn the Astral cosmos who have never been in Physical forms - We Physical bei=\r\nngs are not the only ones in the cycles of creation. While they will still =\r\nhave the idea of &quot;Asmita&quot; in their causal bodies, but they will always be r=\r\nepelled by the grosser-vibrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bodies=\r\n/Cosmos, and hence would not incur any Physical Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; [ TO A=\r\nLL IN THE LIST ]  \n&gt;   - If the above explanation resolves the issue, well =\r\nand good.

I-ness derived from Ahamkara,M=\r\nanas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Cau=\r\nsal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, e=\r\nverything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas =\r\nco-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sens=\r\ne-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived=\r\n from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discr=\r\niminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it w=\r\nhat to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due t=\r\no its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this =\r\nclarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of i=\r\nndividualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am =\r\nthat&quot;?

So, even when the mind is drawn away=\r\n from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in=\r\n a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unaccept=\r\nable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) b=\r\necause they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does =\r\nhave an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not =\r\nhave that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMoreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact wi=\r\nth each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interact=\r\nions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges=\r\n various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and te=\r\nlls it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action=\r\n) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and =\r\nmy manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totall=\r\ny out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the log=\r\nical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts=\r\n of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while intera=\r\ncting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be =\r\ndeemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminol=\r\nogies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your under=\r\nstanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the ide=\r\na of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamka=\r\nra must be overcome only in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Cau=\r\nsal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to figh=\r\nt with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaar=\r\na/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ..=\r\n.they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the In=\r\ndividual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara.=\r\n Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the S=\r\noul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already=\r\n given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ah=\r\namkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea =\r\nof Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account =\r\nfor neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of =\r\nanother, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your bud=\r\ndhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the =\r\n5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially,=\r\n the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not relate=\r\nd as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the applicati=\r\non of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two=\r\n of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;contro=\r\nlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear wh=\r\nen we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heavie=\r\nst Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis o=\r\nf the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astr=\r\nal/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral an=\r\nd Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the h=\r\numan activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualize=\r\nd consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same=\r\n as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being t=\r\nhinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individ=\r\nualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/p=\r\nerceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized con=\r\nsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not deri=\r\nved from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses =\r\nastral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work=\r\n through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like G=\r\nanesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never=\r\n getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this pa=\r\nrticular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in P=\r\nhysical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied bein=\r\ngs, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the=\r\n sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess=\r\n ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or c=\r\nonditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of =\r\nthe kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in =\r\nAutobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix =\r\nof 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, B=\r\nuddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functio=\r\nns of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elemen=\r\nts).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expire=\r\ns as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away =\r\nat a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the cor=\r\nresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas sl=\r\nipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all =\r\nother modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body =\r\nis finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta =\r\nwith infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi b=\r\neing another variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the =\r\nother 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain f=\r\nreedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is n=\r\not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all =\r\nthe past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t=\r\n have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like=\r\n a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it=\r\n down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Ch=\r\nitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, corres=\r\npond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;S=\r\natvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). T=\r\nhe all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Sa=\r\nmskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all r=\r\nesidual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coheren=\r\nt and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (=\r\nChitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore=\r\n katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer wi=\r\nth the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes=\r\n to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... th=\r\ne sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t =\r\ncreate Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sen=\r\nse everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out=\r\n while the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activ=\r\nities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas,=\r\n as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body=\r\n, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yuk=\r\nteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back =\r\nto the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently =\r\nin the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which=\r\n is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutra=\r\ns also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drista=\r\nnushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirs=\r\nt after objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objec=\r\nts, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only =\r\nway to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by tran=\r\nsferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma =\r\nor otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7.

For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) =\r\nis not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal =\r\nbody as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bod=\r\nies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind)=\r\n and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal bod=\r\ny) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego cont=\r\nrols manas and buddhi also.

That sense of I-ness permeates through al=\r\nl layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down the individualized con=\r\nsciousness into various groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sa=\r\nreeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkara=\r\nnas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of =\r\nthe entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thoug=\r\nh the word jnaana means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi=\r\n pursues Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination.

One star=\r\nts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning=\r\n or an end). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not =\r\nbeing Self. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So=\r\n it is not Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimi=\r\nnation, finally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga =\r\nis very difficult to follow in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Vichaara (contemplation) is the process of sadhana for an adherer of pur=\r\ne gyaana yoga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the gyaana (kn=\r\nowledge of Self) achieved by such a person at the end is not really differe=\r\nnt from the knowledge of Self achieved by a person following another path.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Try the new Yahoo!
