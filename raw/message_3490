Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nam=\r\naste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks to Rajarshi for the well-written, inspiring and e=\r\nxcellent series on his experiences with Manish at Kashi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Krishnendu, I=\r\n can understand where you are coming from. However, there is one more angle=\r\n to consider.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me long back that we should guard against fo=\r\ncusing on &quot;personalities&quot; and building awe. He said we should focus on sadh=\r\nana. He said, &quot;my message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone=\r\n is special. My assertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone =\r\ncan and should find god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody=\r\n could. As people do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there=\r\n will be many people who make great progress. World will be a changed place=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish said, &quot;people should do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you a=\r\nre on earth. Never give the excuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. D=\r\no whatever you can. If you know how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do jap=\r\nam. Or you can sit down and do a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhan=\r\na or the other for as much time as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, =\r\nbut keep doing sadhana to the best of your ability.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I have personally seen clear indications tha=\r\nt Manish operates on a different plane compared to most people. I will give=\r\n a few small examples in this writeup. However, I want to re-iterate that M=\r\nanish does not see himself as a special person or a &quot;man of god&quot; as you say=\r\n, but sees himself as a small instrument of Nature.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I mention any=\r\n supernatural things involving Manish, the goal is to show that such things=\r\n are possible even now and not just limited to books and stories. As Rajars=\r\nhi wisely said, we &quot;educated city people&quot; lack faith. True, skepticism is u=\r\nseful as a lot of fake people do exploit the blind faith of people, but the=\r\n pendulum has swung too far and educated people have lost faith so complete=\r\nly that it is almost cynical.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is like lazy people of a village wh=\r\no do not have the energy and patience to climb a hill next to the village r=\r\nefusing to believe that anybody can climb that hill. Thus, if someone climb=\r\ns the hill, finds something nice on the hill and wants to inspire others to=\r\n climb it, such accounts will be inspiring.\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal is to inspire and=\r\n enable a group of spiritual aspirants to do sadhana, become powerful instr=\r\numents of Nature and end up inspiring many more people. The ultimate goal i=\r\ns to uphold Veda dharma of rishis in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When we went to Calcutta to visit Dakshineshwar, =\r\nwe stayed near the Kalighat temple. We could not find a hotel room as hotel=\r\ns were full and someone at a temple referred us to a nearby house that was =\r\nbeing converted to a lodge. House owners lived upstairs. We checked in our =\r\nluggage downstairs. Manish told me, &quot;we have a rina with this couple. His w=\r\nife is very sincere and spiritual. We need to do something.&quot; We met his wif=\r\ne later and saw her horoscope. She was indeed quite spiritual. She is a wor=\r\nshipper of Sarada Mata and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and a regular visitor of=\r\n Ramakrishna Mutt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish showed a very tall wall on one side of that =\r\nproperty and asked them, &quot;is there a smashaan (cemetary) on the other side =\r\nof that wall&quot;. They said no. Manish said, &quot;hmm, it somehow feels like that.=\r\n&quot; That person clarified then, &quot;it is a house and not a smashaan, but this h=\r\nouse was a small mosque several decades ago and they supposedly buried seve=\r\nral people of that large family in the backyard itself.&quot; After all, Manish&#39;=\r\ns &quot;perception&quot; was correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, we two ended up doing two simultaneou=\r\ns Ganapathi homas on the next night next to that wall.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; On his advice, one lady started chanting =\r\nChandipath everyday to solve some problem with her son, which was bothering=\r\n her very much.\n&gt; \n&gt; Oneday Manish talked to her daughter. He asked her, &quot;w=\r\nhat is your mother doing? She is doing Chandipath alright, but she is askin=\r\ng for weird things. Check with her and ask her to stop asking those things.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When she cornered her mother on what she was asking, her mother fina=\r\nlly revealed that she was frustrated with the situation with her son and so=\r\n was asking Devi at the time of Chandipath to take her life so that she doe=\r\ns not have to see her son&#39;s situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Her daughter straightened her o=\r\nut and she stopped that. As a postscript, her son&#39;s problem was solved afte=\r\nr she did Chandipath for a few more weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me a few times that he &quot;knows&quot; when someone=\r\n thinks of him.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we were staying at a hotel in Kurukshetra, Manish=\r\n said to me one evening, &quot;the hotel owner is thinking of me right now. He i=\r\ns thinking about me and money.&quot; Interestingly, phone in the room rang in a =\r\nminute and it was the hotel owner. He called to ask if we wanted to pay for=\r\n the next day ahead instead of paying in the morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish came to Seatle, USA for a conference =\r\nin fall 2005 and I met him physically for the first time then. After lunch,=\r\n we were walking around. Suddenly, Manish declared, &quot;there is a rudraaksha =\r\nmaalaa meant for your son close to here. I can sense it. Let us go and find=\r\n it.&quot; We walked quite a distance. Then he said, &quot;this is the place.&quot; There =\r\nwas a big country market kind of place in a small shopping complex. We went=\r\n in, but found nothing. We came out of the complex. Manish looked around an=\r\nd said, &quot;no, this is the place. I was confused by the smell from the fish m=\r\narket inside this complex. Let us try again.&quot; We went in again and this tim=\r\ne Manish took me inside a small alley and there was a small mom & pop kind =\r\nof shop selling some Tibetan things. They had several Rudraaksha maalaas. M=\r\nanish picked one, bought it and gave it for my son.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I mentioned this earlier. Manish told me one=\r\nday that he &quot;saw me&quot; doing my daily Chandi homam while he was driving fast =\r\non a highway in UK. He lifted one hand in abhaya mudra (blessing pose) whil=\r\ne driving. His wife asked what he was doing. He said he told her, &quot;Narasimh=\r\na is doing homam right now. I am blessing him.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When he mentioned this=\r\n, I wanted to verify it. I normally wear red or yellow or white veshti and =\r\nanga vastram (lower cloth and upper cloth) for my homam. That day I was wea=\r\nring a blue veshti and a blue T-shirt. I was gifted that blue veshti by a p=\r\nriest and wore it only twice until now. So one is unlikely to *guess* this.=\r\n I asked him, &quot;if you saw me, tell me what kind of clothes I was wearing.&quot; =\r\nHe said, &quot;Narasimha, it seemed like some shade of blue. You were wearing a =\r\nT-shirt and it was also another shade of blue.&quot; He was correct. If one was =\r\nmerely guessing it, the probability of getting is correct was very very sma=\r\nll - almost zero.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; When =\r\nwe went to Pune, Delhi and Kurukshetra for the Krishna movie shooting, it r=\r\nained heavily. In May, it was a bit early for the monsoon rains. When we re=\r\nached the temple at Mayapur, Manish said that nature was pleased with the w=\r\nork on Krishna and rains wherever we went was a sign. Sometimes Manish says=\r\n big-sounding things like this, which may give an impression that he is pro=\r\nud. But I realized that it is not because of pride, but he was simply makin=\r\ng observations from the plane he is in. From where others are, they may sou=\r\nnd weird or proud or pretentious.\n&gt; \n&gt; I kind of dismissed him, &quot;well, it c=\r\nould be a coincidence. It is very hot here right now and I see no clouds an=\r\nywhere. If it rains here today, I will believe your theory.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish se=\r\nriously looked at the sky and nodded his head. Because it was too hot, we r=\r\netired into our room at the accommodation there, unpacked our stuff and got=\r\n tripod etc ready. Within ten minutes, we heard loud thunders. In a few min=\r\nutes, there was a heavy thunderstorm that lasted half an hour. There were p=\r\nuddles of water everywhere. Manish remarked, &quot;see, it rained here also. God=\r\ns are happy with this work. This film is an important work.&quot; The rest of th=\r\ne day and next day was perfect and we shot what we wanted. \n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; During March 2006 Shata Chandi homam a=\r\nt the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai where Mother gave a darshan to Manish a=\r\nnd asked to start a homam movement, I was meditating in the garbhalaya one =\r\nevening, sitting in front of Manish. We were both meditating on Savitri Gay=\r\natri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal awareness of my body and =\r\nI felt like I was some all-pervading orange light. I saw that there was a p=\r\nerson at the center of that light, who was emiting that light. When I looke=\r\nd closer, it was Manish. After a little time, he suddenly transformed into =\r\na very famous saint from the past. I wondered &quot;why did Manish change into t=\r\nhat saint&quot;. That disturbed my focus and my regular self-awareness returned =\r\nand I became aware that I was Narasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and M=\r\nanish was sitting in front of me. I opened my eyes. At the same time, Manis=\r\nh also opened his eyes. Without my saying anything, he asked &quot;you saw me, n=\r\no?&quot; I was surprised that he\n&gt;  knew it. However, what baffled me the most w=\r\nas why he transformed into that saint. I stuttered, &quot;but...&quot;. Without my fi=\r\nnishing it, he remarked, &quot;you see Narasimha, the blessings of my guru of la=\r\nst life are still with me. That is why you saw him in me!&quot; He not only knew=\r\n what I saw, but explained it succintly.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I wo=\r\nke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In =\r\nother words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous =\r\nbolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split second, my percep=\r\ntion of that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakt=\r\ni&quot;. My changed perception was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti =\r\nthat was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was=\r\n there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreove=\r\nr, I also &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted together by million=\r\ns of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberat=\r\ned with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived that I too was chant=\r\ning that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled with that sound an=\r\nd a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled wit=\r\nh that sound\n&gt;  and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anything else. C=\r\nompared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic s=\r\ntate to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can=\r\n be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing th=\r\nis loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought =\r\ndisturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I r=\r\neturned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceived that I w=\r\nas a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again f=\r\nilled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I mentioned this incident=\r\n a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was the middle of the n=\r\night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and said =\r\nthat I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in which=\r\n I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also mentio=\r\nned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you heard, right?&quot; Th=\r\nat was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with that beejaaksha=\r\nra before and it is not something one would expect me to have a mystical ex=\r\nperience with.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Man=\r\nish shed some light: &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshara.=\r\n So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nice =\r\nsamadhi. Some people close to me may also have experienced that deity at th=\r\nat time. But we should realize that this is all Her play and we are just ni=\r\nmittas. What she does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are jus=\r\nt dummies observing what comes our way. We neither make anything happen nor=\r\n should we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attrac=\r\nted or repelled by anything.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; \n&gt; When Manish called me in mid-2004, he told me, &quot;You are doing good w=\r\nork by giving free astrology software and doing several poojas, but you are=\r\n not experiencing anything. Time has now come for your Kundalini to awaken =\r\nand for you to start experiencing things&quot;. I thought he was crazy. He sent =\r\nme a Rudraaksha maalaa and asked me to do 2x108 times Gayatri mantra everyd=\r\nay using that maalaa while maintaining brahmacharya (celibacy) and keeping =\r\nthe back straight and without any body movement at all. I ignored the Rudra=\r\naksha maalaa sent by him for many months before starting the practice he wa=\r\nnted in May 2005. I experienced something very intense, powerful, profound =\r\nand life changing within 18 days of starting the practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I ment=\r\nioned what happened to him, he laughed and said, &quot;now an irreversible trans=\r\nformation has been kicked off&quot;. He said, &quot;we two were born together many ti=\r\nmes. Even if you think I am crazy, you cannot leave me and will be pulled t=\r\nowards me. Such is our relationship. You don&#39;t know who you are and who I a=\r\nm, but I do.&quot; He also told me then about his first phone call to me in 2004=\r\n: &quot;I did not have your phone number but wanted to connect with you. When I =\r\nwas in a trance after meditation, I simply picked up the phone and dialed w=\r\nhatever digits my hand felt like pressing. Then I got you on the phone.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Though I still thought he was crazy, I knew that what I had experienced =\r\nwas too profound and the coincidence that it happened soon after starting t=\r\no use his maalaa was too strong, to ignore. I started to wonder if he was g=\r\nenuine after all, but his manner of speaking was still too weird for me. I =\r\nnever hid my thoughts from him and shared freely.\n&gt; \n&gt; My journey since the=\r\nn has been very interesting and I have shared parts of it on this yahoogrou=\r\np. Someone said Rajarshi&#39;s mails reminded of Vimalananda. There is indeed s=\r\nomething Vimalananda-like about Manish. In fact, Manish says he is like a s=\r\npiritual son to Vimalananda and holds Vimalananda in great esteem. I don&#39;t =\r\nknow Vimalananda, but I know Manish and I can imagine several things mentio=\r\nned by Vimalananda in &quot;Aghora&quot; series books being correct.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite som=\r\ne of his supernatural abilities that I have seen, like the ability to creat=\r\ne a specific mystical experience in someone thousands of miles away, he ins=\r\nists that Devi does everything and he is just a small instrument and an obs=\r\nerver of Devi&#39;s leelaa and a small player in the big game of chess being pl=\r\nayed by Devi. In fact, his main teaching to me was to improve devotion, fai=\r\nth and surrender and give up doership of my actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; His teachings are=\r\n sublime and yet practical. He is not content to explain theory, but practi=\r\ncally demonstrates the weaknesses of mind and how to overcome them. Instead=\r\n of swimming in modern pseudo-vedanta, he made me understand and appreciate=\r\n duality and non-duality at the same time. He made me understand things thr=\r\nough experience. He brought great change in my attitude and thinking in the=\r\n last 5.5 years of interaction. He destroyed my biases and expanded the hor=\r\nizons of my understanding and gave a much better perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most imp=\r\nortantly, using me as an instrument, he enabled many sincere spiritual seek=\r\ners to embrace the ancient Vedic sadhana of rishis - homam or fire ritual f=\r\nor saattwik purposes. He tells me that one lakh (one hundred thousand) peop=\r\nle will be doing homam on a regular basis one hundred years from now.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAs I said at the beginning of this email, inspiring sadhana is more importa=\r\nnt than inspiring awe regarding specific personalities, though the latter s=\r\nometimes helps with the former.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; I will conclude with Manish&#39;s words I mentioned before:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;My=\r\n message is not that I am special, but it is that everyone is special. My a=\r\nssertion is not that I found god, but it is that everyone can and should fi=\r\nnd god. I am a normal person. If I could find god, anybody could. As people=\r\n do homam sincerely and unselfishly for a few years, there will be many peo=\r\nple who make great progress. World will be a changed place.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;People s=\r\nhould do sadhana. Don&#39;t waste time when you are on earth. Never give the ex=\r\ncuse that you don&#39;t know how to do sadhana. Do whatever you can. If you kno=\r\nw how to do homam, do homam. Otherwise do japam. Or you can sit down and do=\r\n a bhajan chanting god&#39;s name. Do some sadhana or the other for as much tim=\r\ne as you can. Don&#39;t worry about the results, but keep doing sadhana to the =\r\nbest of your ability.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =A0 Free Jyotish Softwar=\r\ne, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that ma=\r\nke a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =A0 Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 1/18/10, chaudhuri.krishnend=\r\nu &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;krishnenduchdh=\r\nr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Resected Narasimhaji\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, January 18, 2010, 2:06 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       From time to t=\r\nime various sayings and incidents related to Manishji are scattered in this=\r\n forum and maybe at other places.His site also contains\n&gt; \n&gt; some valuable =\r\nmaterials.Will it not be nice to archive them as i feel they are great piec=\r\nes of inspiration.
