Of course, each story metaphorically repre=\r\nsents some absolute truths.\n \n1) Shiva is the supreme consciousness. Parvat=\r\ni shows Kundalini or self-awareness in Moolaadhaara chakra, which is the so=\r\nurce of all duality. One&#39;s self-awareness creates an entity called self-int=\r\nerest. Though this self-interest operating in the material plane (moolaadha=\r\nara chakra) is created by the self-awareness in the field of duality, it is=\r\n originally from supreme consciousness (i.e. Shiva is the father of Ganesha=\r\n). But it is not aware of that. This self-interest considers it its job to =\r\nstop self-awareness from merging with the supreme consciousness. Supreme co=\r\nnsciousness is forced to kill this self-ineterest in order to merge with on=\r\ne&#39;s self-awareness. Notions like &quot;I need this&quot;, &quot;I have to do that&quot; stop on=\r\ne&#39;s self-awareness from merging with the infinite and limit one&#39;s self-awar=\r\neness to being aware of the material plane. When such notions are destroyed=\r\n, one&#39;s self-awareness can be established in the infinite and supreme consc=\r\niousness.\n \nHowever, when a yogi&#39;s self-awareness returns from the infinite=\r\n to the material plane, that self-interest needs to be brought back to life=\r\n. However, self-interest of such a yogi is more sublime and expanded than b=\r\nefore!\n \nThe original boy who was killed by Shiva was merely a boy who was =\r\nguarding his mother. The new boy who was brought back to life was respected=\r\n by the whole world. The original self-interest of a person makes one too a=\r\nttached to the material plane and stops self-awareness from merging with th=\r\ne infinite. The self-interest recreated by a yogi who experienced the infin=\r\nite is not so limited and covers the whole world. Such a yogi&#39;s self-intere=\r\nst makes him engage in the right actions to safeguard not only his material=\r\n interests, but do one&#39;s dharma for the betterment of the entire world and =\r\nmerge with the infinite. Unlike the original boy guarding moolaadhaara chak=\r\nra, Ganesha brought back to life by Shiva guards Moolaadhaara chakra and th=\r\ne entire sushumna naadi.\n \n2) Throat has visuddhi chakra and it contains th=\r\ne element of ether. Elements of air, water and earth can be defiled with im=\r\npurity. But the element of ether is ever pure and untouched by impurities. =\r\nIf any poison that is released as a part of one&#39;s sadhana - search for the =\r\nnectar of the bliss of sat-chid-aananda - affects elements below the elemen=\r\nt of ether, it will create some destruction and problems. But if it is limi=\r\nted to ether and not allowed to come in contact with air etc, it has no bad=\r\n effect.\n \n3) Raama is an incarnation of Vishnu corresponding to Sun, who s=\r\nhows soul. Raama symbolizes aatmaa or soul (Aatmaaraama).\n \nSugriva is a so=\r\nn of Sun and stands for dharma. Griva means neck, which contains visuddhi c=\r\nhakra, and Sugriva means one with a good neck, i.e. a pure one. Sygriva sta=\r\nnds for purity and dharma.\n \nVali is a son of Indra, who shows the power of=\r\n indriyas (sense pleasures). Vaali also means the strong one. He symbolizes=\r\n the strong trap of senses and one&#39;s pride in oneself. When that humbles on=\r\ne&#39;s purity and dharma, it is a tough battle for purity and dharma! In other=\r\n words, purity and dharma is no match for pride and trap of senses.\n \nFrom =\r\nthe perspective of soul or Aatman, the distinction betweem good and bad and=\r\n divine and demoic is very thin. That is why saints who have risen above th=\r\ne mind and established in the imperishable and infinite Aatman show very li=\r\nttle differentiation between rich and poor, saintly and evil and show the s=\r\name love and compassion towards a saint and a sinner. It is tough for aatma=\r\nn to distinguish between (1) dharmik and pure attitude and (2) vain and pro=\r\nud attitude under the influence of senses. That is why Raama is confused wh=\r\no is Vaali and who is Sugriva.\n \nThe pride and trap of senses is tough to c=\r\nonfront. If the soul (i.e. the identification with the infinite Aatman rath=\r\ner than a body or a mind) confronts it, it enhances the pride. To put it in=\r\n simple words, even thinking that &quot;I am the infinite aatman&quot; may makes one =\r\nproud of one&#39;s infiniteness, which actually finitizes one. In other words, =\r\nVaali being confronted by AatmaaRaama would strengthen Vaali and weaken Aat=\r\nmaaRaama. Thus, this pride and trap of senses needs to be tacked indirectly=\r\n and subtly.\n \nYour questions are good and answers are not easy convey in s=\r\nimple words, but I tried. Hope it made some sense.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimh=\r\na\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicast=\r\nro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSr=\r\ni Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n  From: Murahari Vadapalli \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n  Sent: Monday, October 12, 2009 7:43 PM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Query =\r\non Puranic stories\n\n  Namaste, \n\n  1) For lord Shiva, there is no concept o=\r\nf time. However in the story of &quot;Birth of Ganesha&quot;, it&#39;s mentioned that Shi=\r\nva cuts off Ganesha&#39;s head for he &quot;fails&quot; to recognize Ganesha as his Son. =\r\nWhy did Shiva, who is the Lord of Kaala, fail to recognize Ganesha? \n  Is i=\r\nt anything to do with Shiva, tacitly trying to re-design Ganesha, who has b=\r\neen created by Parvati, with an Elephant Head and there-by telling all of u=\r\ns that to evolve spiritually, the mortal beings require elephantine memory =\r\nor something like that? \n\n  Is there any hidden meaning in that story? \n\n  =\r\n2) In Ksheera Sagara manthana story, when halahala comes out of churning th=\r\ne ocean, Shiva consumes it and stores it in his throat. Why throat only? Wh=\r\ny not stomach or any other part of parama purusha? \n\n  Are our spiritual ma=\r\nsters any way saying that Throat is somehow linked to Visuddha, which is in=\r\nturn linked to overcoming of sadness and hence when one evolves spiritually=\r\n, sadness is overcome. Is there any spiritual signification to this story o=\r\nf consuming poison and holding it in &quot;Throat&quot;?\n\n  3.  Lord Rama is a purna =\r\navatara and he could have easily distinguished between Vali and Sugriva. If=\r\n so, why did Rama ask Sugriva to wear a mala to distinguish between Vali an=\r\nd Sugriva and also why did Rama have to kill Vali while hiding behind the t=\r\nree? (Vali having a mali which can weaken the opponent looks very trivial)\n=\r\n\n  Thanks & Regards,\n  --Murahari\r\n------=_NextPart_000_023D_01CA4B91.6DE49B00\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: smal=\r\nler; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: center 50=\r\n%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62px; =\r\nBORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 62px;=\r\n BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV=\r\n.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hover {\n=\r\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none=\r\n\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.at=\r\ntach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING=\r\n-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row =\r\nDIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DIV DI=\r\nV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold\n}\n=\r\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8=\r\nd8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#ygrp-=\r\nmkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;\n  f=\r\nont-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0px=\r\n;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: 0 0;=\r\n\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3603&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nbgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear Murahari,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Good questions.

However in the story of \n  &quot;Birth of Ganesha&quot;, it&#39;s ment=\r\nioned that Shiva cuts off Ganesha&#39;s head for he \n  &quot;fails&quot; to recognize Gan=\r\nesha as his Son. Why did Shiva, who is the Lord of \n  Kaala, fail to recogn=\r\nize Ganesha? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Is it anything to do with Shiva, tacitly trying =\r\nto re-design Ganesha, who \n  has been created by Parvati, with an Elephant =\r\nHead and there-by telling all of \n  us that to evolve spiritually, the mort=\r\nal beings require elephantine memory or \n  something like that? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Is there any hidd=\r\nen meaning in that story? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;2) In Ksheera Sagara manthana story, when halahala come=\r\ns out of churning \n  the ocean, Shiva consumes it and stores it in his thro=\r\nat. Why throat only? Why \n  not stomach or any other part of parama purusha=\r\n? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Are =\r\nour spiritual masters any way saying that Throat is somehow linked to \n  Vi=\r\nsuddha, which is inturn linked to overcoming of sadness and hence when one =\r\n\n  evolves spiritually, sadness is overcome. Is there&nbsp;any spiritual \n =\r\n signification to&nbsp;this story of consuming poison and holding it in \n  =\r\n&quot;Throat&quot;?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;3. &nbsp;Lord Rama is a purna avatara and he could have easily \n  distin=\r\nguished between Vali and Sugriva. If so, why did Rama ask Sugriva to \n  wea=\r\nr a mala to distinguish between Vali and Sugriva and also why did Rama have=\r\n \n  to kill Vali while hiding behind the tree? (Vali having a mali which ca=\r\nn \n  weaken the opponent looks very trivial)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#ff409f&gt;Thanks &amp; Re=\r\ngards,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT \ncolor=3D#ff409f&gt;--Murahari&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_023D_01CA4B91.6DE49B00--\r\n\n"}}
