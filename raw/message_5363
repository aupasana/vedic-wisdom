Let me add a bit to some points=\r\n you have mentioned.\n\n=C2=A0Books and articles by Peta members are far more=\r\n convincing for switching to Veg \nsources. I can also provide tens of links=\r\n and book reference which oppose their \nview.\n=C2=A0\nA few months back, I f=\r\nound myself in the middle of a very serious debate on \nscientific relevance=\r\n of veganism. A group of vegan evangelists were on one side \nand a person w=\r\nith a solid scientific temperament on the other side. More than \n300 messag=\r\nes were exchanged in huge, point by point debate. Eventually the vegan \neva=\r\nngelists resorted to abusing and what not. Thats ok, but during the course =\r\nof \nthe conversation, I had to read up a lot of actual science on nutrition=\r\n and \nbecame amazed to find that there is=C2=A0very little science on the s=\r\nide of the \nvegans. This is sad but true. What is bad is most of the points=\r\n generally raised \nby=C2=A0vegan websites etc=C2=A0do not stand the=C2=A0sc=\r\nrutiny of real science, they merely \ncherrry pick from researches, take a l=\r\nine and a line there, and jump to hasty \nconclusion to drive their agenda h=\r\nome. That is politics and not science! \n\n=C2=A0\nI am a vegetarian, but I ta=\r\nke serious=C2=A0exception to such politics in the name of \nscience. \n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nAgain, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift a=\r\nll the \npopulation to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is d=\r\necreasing day \nby day because of many reasons)\n=C2=A0\nNot only is it imposs=\r\nible, but it is also=C2=A0unnatural. \n=C2=A0\nSee,=C2=A0 I ask one question.=\r\n If humans were supposed to be herbivores, why don&#39;t we \nhave a caecum in t=\r\nhe stomach, why is the size of the intestines similar and \nfacilitative of =\r\nomnivorous diets, and lastly, why is there such a tremendous gap \nin the bi=\r\no-availability between vegeterian and non vegeterian sources of \nfood.=C2=\r\n=A0The very body structure of humans have become modified by evolution for =\r\nan \nomnivorous diet,=C2=A0so what science are we talking about? The reason =\r\nthat the \npancreas is almost an appendage is due to the fact that humans as=\r\n a speciees \nwere force to shift to a=C2=A0animal protient diet to sustain =\r\nitself. The pancreas \nwas like a caecum at one point, way back, before the =\r\nspecies moved into \ngrasslands. Eating fruits came much later (there are go=\r\nod reasons for this).=C2=A0Had \nthis shift in food resulting in body struct=\r\nural change=C2=A0not happened, the species \nwoudl not have survived at all.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nMy point is simple,=C2=A0 eat whatever you feel like, based on your=\r\n culture, \nupbrining, likes/dislikes etc etc=C2=A0but a) do not believe in =\r\nfake science b) do \nnot unnecessarily=C2=A0evangelize people trying to conv=\r\nert them to x or y food habit, \nbecause,=C2=A0for every one point that is r=\r\naised by one side, counter points can be \nraised by the other.I dislike eva=\r\nngelism of all kinds, be it=C2=A0Christian \nevangelism or Vegan evangelism.=\r\n \n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n____________\n=C2=A0\nPS: The topic of ethics and karma is=\r\n=C2=A0long, and needs deep thinking. This is \nseperate from the science I m=\r\nentioned above. While it=C2=A0is absolutely true that \nkilling is a damagin=\r\ng karma, the issue is far from being that simple. None of \nthe holy men I h=\r\nave read till, except Vimalananda, actually makes any atempt to \nunderstand=\r\n the complexity of the problem, leave aside giving a holistic view of \nthin=\r\ngs.=C2=A0Vimalananda does not provide an answer but he appreaciates the pro=\r\nblem, \nwhich is an excellent frist step.=C2=A0This 3rd book=C2=A0on karma i=\r\ns an IQ \npuzzle.=C2=A0Damn=C2=A0good stuff!=C2=A0 For example he acknowledg=\r\nes that all people can never \nshift to vegeterianism, in which case he talk=\r\ns about the 3fold law of Buddhists, \ni.e. the karma of meat gets distribute=\r\nd among a) the one who kills b) the one \nwho dresses the meat c) the one wh=\r\no cooks, leaving the one who eats with least \nkarma to deal with.=C2=A0 He =\r\nalso acknowledges that crops are equally unnatural as \nbreeding animals for=\r\n food, and there is solid karma=C2=A0involved here too. \nPersonally he advi=\r\nses against meat eating, which is correct, in the sense that \nthose who eat=\r\n meat, can&#39;t keep the preparation and quantity under balance. \nNeither they=\r\n know of how to tackle the karma. Therefore avoiding is good, \nbut=C2=A0not=\r\n compulsory. \n\n=C2=A0\nSomeone mentioned about mistreatment of animals bred =\r\nfor food, and this karma \nadds, this is true. But how about the crops we bu=\r\ny from the market, passing \nthrough=C2=A0x number of middle men who cheat t=\r\nhe farmer and each other, the farmer \nremains miserably poor and often ends=\r\n up commiting suicide, not to forget the \nextremely unnatural act of adding=\r\n serious chemicals to the soil to increase \nproduction resulting in spoilin=\r\ng the soil completely and affecting the quality \nof the food grains in the =\r\nprocess. In this age, veg or non veg, you cannot \nescape bad karmas from fo=\r\nod.\n=C2=A0\nTo understand and appreciate the complexity of the problem on a =\r\nlarge time scale \nconsider this, when=C2=A0man went to open grasslands it s=\r\ntarted two simultaneously \nprocesses.=C2=A0Domesticating animals and croppi=\r\nng, both of which are unnatural.=C2=A0Of \nall animals only a handful could =\r\nget domesticated, rest did not.=C2=A0Why? Humans \nthen reared them in a=C2=\r\n=A0quid pro quo basis, for=C2=A0food, wool, milk etc etc. These \nanimal wou=\r\nld=C2=A0NOT have survived=C2=A0as a species, had it not been for human \nint=\r\nervention. Just like rice/wheat crops would never have survived in the plan=\r\nt \nkingdom,. had=C2=A0humans not cultivated them purposefully.=C2=A0So this=\r\n looks more like \na=C2=A0design of nature than any thing else. It may inter=\r\nest you to know that Robert \nSvboda shifted completely to a vegenterian die=\r\nt, but eventually had to include \neggs in his diet, since his body reacted.=\r\n It can=C2=A0happen to some people when a \nnatural protein source is cut ou=\r\nt, to which the body is accustomed. =C2=A0He \nmentioned this in during an i=\r\nnterview. \n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Between me and Yo=\r\nu, there is only me. \nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n\n\n\n__=\r\n______________________________\nFrom: Dr. A.

Please point out my mistakes I will make i=\r\nn this process.\n\nWe are trying to discuss three points here\n\n1) Choosing a =\r\ndietary habit\n2) Dependence of Human population on Non-veg sources of nutri=\r\ntion\n3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg food.\n\nI commented on two p=\r\noints \n\n1) Choosing a dietary habit \n2) Dependence of Human population on n=\r\non veg sources of nutrition\n\n1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n\nOne should choose=\r\n his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) \nand goal in =\r\nhis life. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or \nresearch say=\r\ns. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for \na pers=\r\non seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food unless he is \na=\r\nble to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha =\r\nJi \nabout this point.\n\nIn some diseases Non veg sources play an very import=\r\nant role (Although not a \nnecessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs =\r\nper day can save a person from \ncostly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections.=\r\n In TB, Soup made of goat meat do \nwonders. Ayurveda also recommend it stro=\r\nngly Charak Samhita) etc.\n\n2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sou=\r\nrces of nutrition\n\nI agree with the link provided in this discussions. Book=\r\ns and articles by Peta \nmembers are far more convincing for switching to Ve=\r\ng sources. I can also provide \ntens of links and book reference which oppos=\r\ne their view. Honestly, I do not \nbelieve each and every information on net=\r\n and not every book written about \nnutirtion, just like astrology. Let us l=\r\neave this debate aside and look at other \naspect of it.\n\nBy &#39;Practically im=\r\npossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. In \nIndia (Leav=\r\ne other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people are \nNon ve=\r\ngetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg sources. =\r\n\nCurrently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gram \ns=\r\noyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include almon=\r\nds \ncashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 R=\r\ns per \nKg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), \n\n\nIn=\r\n last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by 40-60=\r\n%. \neven at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete bal=\r\nanced \ndiet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 g=\r\nms of \nlegumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along w=\r\nith grains \nand roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Differen=\r\nt sources may \nquote different quantities). There is average family size of=\r\n 5 and average \nfamily income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the o=\r\nnly thing needed in \nour life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n\nEven =\r\nat current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If \nadditio=\r\nnal 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% \n=\r\nand I need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n\nSir, I am not adv=\r\nocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even \nfor milk I =\r\nprefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not \nexpect no=\r\n cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it \nyo=\r\nurself)\n\nAgain, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to sh=\r\nift all the \npopulation to veg sources especially when the agriculture land=\r\n is decreasing day \nby day because of many reasons)\n\n3) Bioavailability or =\r\nBV of different sources\n\nIt is always a questionable point. because again s=\r\nections supporting vegetarian \ndiet will highlight the results which suppor=\r\nt veg food and vice versa. There are \nlot of halfbaked researches. but if w=\r\ne think scientifically we will find that \nfor different sources different s=\r\nources are better. For example calcium animal \nsources are best (Including =\r\nmilk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg \nsources are best, for protei=\r\nns animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support \nthis) So I think we can =\r\nnot say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. \nObviously humans c=\r\nan not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned \nI agree wit=\r\nh the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n\nYes, I agree Non veg food increases tam=\r\nas in mind. But so does the deep fried \nvegetarian food, although less but =\r\nin daily habit it will not let you escape \nfrom Tamas. I agree with Narasim=\r\nha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting \nfood, less energy is availa=\r\nble for brain. it is a scietific fact that after \nfood, significant blood s=\r\nupply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy \nfood, tea, coffee, c=\r\noke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat! \nThis is true. So=\r\n one should eat what one want to become.\n\nBut still at last, I want to ment=\r\nion that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am \njust highlighting the fact=\r\ns. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should understand \nthat we may be right=\r\n but we should realise that it does not necessarily mean \nother person is n=\r\not right.\n\nPlease point out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree th=\r\nat some values i \nmentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. B=\r\nut they are approximate \nand not too much off the line.\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I disgree with two points you men=\r\ntioned. Let me clarify. (I am only dealing \n&gt;with \n&gt;\n&gt; the science part of =\r\nthese discussions, as I had already maintained right at the \n&gt;\n&gt; beginning)=\r\n.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Nation=\r\nal Public Radio) \n&gt;several \n&gt;\n&gt; months back. They conducted an experiment o=\r\nn gorillas. One set of gorillas was \n\n&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fe=\r\nd with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; months, researchers found a gap i=\r\nn the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; fed with meat were duller.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; If=C3=82=C2=A0you have any references for this, in terms of whether th=\r\ney published any \n&gt; paper on the same, I am interested to know and analyse =\r\nthat in details. I am \n&gt; open to learning and reviewing my position, provid=\r\ned there is genuine \nevidence.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Their theory was that diges=\r\ntion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt;\n&gt; nuts and fruits m=\r\nay have diverted more energy towards the development of brain. \n&gt;\n&gt; Though =\r\nthey were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or \n&gt;not,=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0a \n&gt;\n&gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize o=\r\nne&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; This is a wrong theory as f=\r\nar as human nutrition=C3=82=C2=A0is concerned, because human \n&gt; stomach str=\r\nucture (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal \n&gt;products \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products. In my other mail, I=\r\n have \n\n&gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutr=\r\nition and \n&gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0take a few days since \n&gt;I \n&gt;\n&gt; have to get them from people who deal =\r\nwith these topics professionally, but \n&gt;time \n&gt;\n&gt; is not a problem.=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from the most accepted and reputed \n&gt; s=\r\ncientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I said, =\r\nit is myth \n&gt; that=C3=82=C2=A0vegeterian=C3=82=C2=A0foods are=C3=82=C2=A0ea=\r\nsier to digest, if digestibility is the \n&gt;criteria. \n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nFurther, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any =\r\nmore \n&gt;\n&gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their \n=\r\n&gt;needs. \n&gt;\n&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, =\r\nfeed the poor \n&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; An animal h=\r\nas a specific physical=C3=82=C2=A0structure and needs to maintain the same.=\r\n \n&gt;But \n&gt;\n&gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen =\r\npeople feeding \n&gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an anim=\r\nal whose whole body \n&gt; structure is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust =\r\nto any food for the sake of \n&gt;\n&gt; survival, but will become internally weak =\r\nand susceptable to disease and \n&gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the d=\r\nisease and weakness that may result \n&gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal?=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up bein=\r\ng diseased, but the \n&gt;chances \n&gt;\n&gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smoke=\r\nrs die of cancer, but smoking makes one \n&gt;\n&gt; susceptible to cancer. It incr=\r\neases the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; opinion is that an animal i=\r\nf kept at home, it should taken care of in the best \n\n&gt; way possible, provi=\r\nding it with whatever maybe needed, including the right \n&gt;diet.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; _______________\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; A ques=\r\ntion for you.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body=\r\n structures have concluded that \n&gt;meat \n&gt;\n&gt; eating along with cropping and =\r\nfruits has been prevelant since at least 4 \n&gt; million years. That, without =\r\na diet which was omnivorous, the structure of the \n\n&gt; human stomach (lack o=\r\nf a developed=C3=82=C2=A0caecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold increase \n&gt;i=\r\nn=C3=82=C2=A0brain \n&gt;\n&gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82=C2=A0coul=\r\nd never have been what it is today. \n&gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has =\r\nbeen a=C3=82=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained that \n&gt;it \n&gt;\n&gt; has changed =\r\nthe very structure of the human body. This cannot be done \n&gt; consciously, b=\r\nut only by the work of natural forces.

Self-identification of plants wit=\r\nh their \n&gt;physical \n&gt;\n&gt; body is much subtler and the karma entailed in eati=\r\nng plant-based foods is much \n&gt;\n&gt; smaller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Especially these days, very=\r\n cruel methods are used for meat production by \n&gt; corporations and animals =\r\nare treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their \n\n&gt; suffering goes to=\r\n the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a =\r\nscientist on NPR (National Public Radio) \n&gt;several \n&gt;\n&gt; months back. They c=\r\nonducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \n\n&gt; fed with me=\r\nat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; months, r=\r\nesearchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; fed=\r\n with meat were duller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes =\r\nup more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt;\n&gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted mo=\r\nre energy towards the development of brain. \n&gt;\n&gt; Though they were not sure =\r\nif the same thing applies to human beings or not, a \n&gt; balanced vegetarian =\r\ndiet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) After we=\r\n eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well \n&gt;\n&gt; on=\r\n work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive \n&gt;pr=\r\nocess \n&gt;\n&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and the=\r\nre isn&#39;t much \n&gt; agni available for other activities such as digestion of i=\r\nntellectual ideas \n&gt;that \n&gt;\n&gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of =\r\nspiritual ideas/experiences also \n&gt; requires agni and that cannot happen we=\r\nll. That is why meditation or homam \n&gt;after \n&gt;\n&gt; a heavy meal are fruitless=\r\n and we are normally advised to do sadhana before \n&gt; eating.\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) If fo=\r\nods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food \n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed=\r\n more \n&gt;\n&gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and th=\r\nere is less \n&gt;agni \n&gt;\n&gt; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritu=\r\nal ideas and experiences. If \n&gt;\n&gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy =\r\nto digest (simple grains, simple \n&gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all soft=\r\nly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), \n&gt;\n&gt; less agni is diverted towards=\r\n digestion and more agni is available for \n&gt; assimilaring intellectual and =\r\nspiritual ideas and experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet g=\r\nrass well. But huge stacks of dry grass \n&gt;may \n&gt;\n&gt; be burnt by just one spa=\r\nrk! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be \n&gt;enough \n&gt;\n&gt; to assimila=\r\nte spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; vaasanas a=\r\nnd few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nin a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it =\r\nall \n\n&gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; \n&gt; One p=\r\nerson may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \n=\r\n\n&gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat s=\r\naattwik \n&gt;\n&gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation=\r\n and yet struggle \n&gt;\n&gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of=\r\n action for one is to \n&gt;ignore \n&gt;\n&gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. A=\r\nll other things being equal, that \n&gt; maximizes the agni available for spiri=\r\ntual progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own =\r\nvaasanas and their \n&gt;needs. \n&gt;\n&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian foo=\r\nd, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; (8)=\r\n One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n=\r\n&gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the materi=\r\nal \n&gt; world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too muc=\r\nh food is \n\n&gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of overeating mo=\r\nst of the time and fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; better to eat limited=\r\n amount always. Regular practices are more important for \n&gt; transformation =\r\nand success, than occasional practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; (9) By merely thinking that go=\r\nd is the doer of all actions or considering food \n\n&gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, on=\r\ne cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; deeply ingrained t=\r\nhat thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally \n&gt;\n&gt; feels 10=\r\n0% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n&gt; eating=\r\n) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1701723193-1291278694=:8023\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste&nbsp;Atul&nbsp;ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Very good mail. Let me add a bit to some points you have ment=\r\nioned.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;Books and articles by Peta me=\r\nmbers are far more convincing for switching to Veg sources. I can also prov=\r\nide tens of links and book reference which oppose their view.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;A few months back, I found myself in the middle of =\r\na very serious debate on scientific relevance of veganism. A group of vegan=\r\n evangelists were on one side and a person with a solid scientific temperam=\r\nent on the other side. More than 300 messages were exchanged in huge, point=\r\n by point debate. Eventually the vegan evangelists resorted to abusing and =\r\nwhat not. Thats ok, but during the course of the conversation, I had to rea=\r\nd up a lot of actual science on nutrition and became amazed to find that th=\r\nere is&nbsp;very little science on the side of the vegans. This is sad but =\r\ntrue. What is bad is most of the points generally raised by&nbsp;vegan webs=\r\nites etc&nbsp;do not stand the&nbsp;scrutiny of real science, they merely c=\r\nherrry pick from researches, take a line and a line there, and jump to hast=\r\ny conclusion to drive their agenda home. That is politics and not science! =\r\n&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;I am a vegetarian, but I take serious&nbsp;exception =\r\nto such politics in the name of science. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Again, I=\r\n think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift all the popul=\r\nation to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is decreasing day=\r\n by day because of many reasons)&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Not onl=\r\ny is it impossible, but it is also&nbsp;unnatural. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Se=\r\ne,&nbsp; I ask one question. If humans were supposed to be herbivores, why =\r\ndon&#39;t we have a caecum in the stomach, why is the size of the intestines si=\r\nmilar and facilitative of omnivorous diets, and lastly, why is there such a=\r\n tremendous gap in the bio-availability between vegeterian and non vegeteri=\r\nan sources of food.&nbsp;The very body structure of humans have become modi=\r\nfied by evolution for an omnivorous diet,&nbsp;so what science are we talki=\r\nng about? The reason that the pancreas is almost an appendage is due to the=\r\n fact that humans as a speciees were force to shift to a&nbsp;animal protie=\r\nnt diet to sustain itself. The pancreas was like a caecum at one point, way=\r\n back, before the species moved into grasslands. Eating fruits came much la=\r\nter (there are good reasons for this).&nbsp;Had this shift in food resultin=\r\ng in body structural change&nbsp;not happened, the species woudl not have s=\r\nurvived at all.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;My point is simple,&nbsp; eat whatever=\r\n you feel like, based on your culture, upbrining, likes/dislikes etc etc&nb=\r\nsp;but a) do not believe in fake science b) do not unnecessarily&nbsp;evang=\r\nelize people trying to convert them to x or y food habit, because,&nbsp;for=\r\n every one point that is raised by one side, counter points can be raised b=\r\ny the other.I dislike evangelism of all kinds, be it&nbsp;Christian evangel=\r\nism or Vegan evangelism. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;____________&lt;/=\r\nP&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;PS: The topic of ethics and karma is&nbsp;long, and nee=\r\nds deep thinking. This is seperate from the science I mentioned above. Whil=\r\ne it&nbsp;is absolutely true that killing is a damaging karma, the issue is=\r\n far from being that simple. None of the holy men I have read till, except =\r\nVimalananda, actually makes any atempt to understand the complexity of the =\r\nproblem, leave aside giving a holistic view of things.&nbsp;Vimalananda doe=\r\ns not provide an answer but he appreaciates the problem, which is an excell=\r\nent frist step.&nbsp;This 3rd book&nbsp;on karma is an IQ puzzle.&nbsp;Damn=\r\n&nbsp;good stuff!&nbsp; For example he acknowledges that all people can nev=\r\ner shift to vegeterianism, in which case he talks about the 3fold law of Bu=\r\nddhists, i.e. the karma of meat gets distributed among a) the one who kills=\r\n b) the one who dresses the meat c) the one who cooks, leaving the one who =\r\neats with least karma to deal with.&nbsp; He also acknowledges that crops a=\r\nre equally\n unnatural as breeding animals for food, and there is solid karm=\r\na&nbsp;involved here too. Personally he advises against meat eating, which =\r\nis correct, in the sense that those who eat meat, can&#39;t keep the preparatio=\r\nn and quantity under balance. Neither they know of how to tackle the karma.=\r\n Therefore avoiding is good, but&nbsp;not compulsory. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n&gt;Someone mentioned about mistreatment of animals bred for food, and this ka=\r\nrma adds, this is true. But how about the crops we buy from the market, pas=\r\nsing through&nbsp;x number of middle men who cheat the farmer and each othe=\r\nr, the farmer remains miserably poor and often ends up commiting suicide, n=\r\not to forget the extremely unnatural act of adding serious chemicals to the=\r\n soil to increase production resulting in spoiling the soil completely and =\r\naffecting the quality of the food grains in the process. In this age, veg o=\r\nr non veg, you cannot escape bad karmas from food.&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;To =\r\nunderstand and appreciate the complexity of the problem on a large time sca=\r\nle consider this, when&nbsp;man went to open grasslands it started two simu=\r\nltaneously processes.&nbsp;Domesticating animals and cropping, both of whic=\r\nh are unnatural.&nbsp;Of all animals only a handful could get domesticated,=\r\n rest did not.&nbsp;Why? Humans then reared them in a&nbsp;quid pro quo bas=\r\nis, for&nbsp;food, wool, milk etc etc. These animal would&nbsp;NOT have sur=\r\nvived&nbsp;as a species, had it not been for human intervention. Just like =\r\nrice/wheat crops would never have survived in the plant kingdom,. had&nbsp;=\r\nhumans not cultivated them purposefully.&nbsp;So this looks more like a&nbs=\r\np;design of nature than any thing else. It may interest you to know that Ro=\r\nbert Svboda shifted completely to a vegenterian diet, but eventually had to=\r\n include eggs in his diet, since his body reacted. It can&nbsp;happen to so=\r\nme people when a natural protein source is cut out, to which\n the body is a=\r\nccustomed. &nbsp;He mentioned this in during an interview. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nP&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;-Regards&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;=\r\nSTRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLO=\r\nR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot; color=3D#0000=\r\n00 size=3D3&gt;&quot;Between me and You, there is only me. \n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt&quot;&gt;Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, ser=\r\nif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; FONT-SIZE: 12pt; MARGIN: 5px 0px =\r\n5px 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new =\r\nyork, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTahoma size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Dr. A.

Please point out m=\r\ny mistakes I will make in this process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We are trying to discuss thr=\r\nee points here&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Choosing a dietary habit&lt;BR&gt;2) Dependence of Human=\r\n population on Non-veg sources of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;3) bioavailability or BV of =\r\nNon veg vs Veg food.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I commented on two points &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Choosing a=\r\n dietary habit &lt;BR&gt;2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of =\r\nnutrition&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Choosing a Dietary habit&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One should choose his d=\r\nietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal in his lif=\r\ne. He should not bother what the BV or other factor or research says. For a=\r\nn athlete, Eggs are important part of his training. and for a person seekin=\r\ng spirituality one should stick to vegetarian food\n unless he is able to ri=\r\nse above the difference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji about =\r\nthis point.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In some diseases Non veg sources play an very important =\r\nrole (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs per d=\r\nay can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB=\r\n, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it strongly Ch=\r\narak Samhita) etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sour=\r\nces of nutrition&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I agree with the link provided in this discussions.=\r\n Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for switching t=\r\no Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book reference which op=\r\npose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on n=\r\net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us =\r\nleave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By &#39;Practica=\r\nlly impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and\n demand/supply factor. In India=\r\n (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people are N=\r\non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg sour=\r\nces. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gra=\r\nm soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include al=\r\nmonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40=\r\n Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by=\r\n 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complet=\r\ne balanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-=\r\n70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, alon=\r\ng with grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Differ=\r\nent sources may quote different quantities). There is average family size o=\r\nf 5 and average family income is 200\n Rs per day! And nutrition is not the =\r\nonly thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Even at current prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If ad=\r\nditional 40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 1=\r\n00% and I need not to explain what will happen at that time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sir, I =\r\nam not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even fo=\r\nr milk I prefer a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not e=\r\nxpect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produc=\r\ne it yourself)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Again, I think and believe that practically it is imp=\r\nossible to shift all the population to veg sources especially when the agri=\r\nculture land is decreasing day by day because of many reasons)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) Bi=\r\noavailability or BV of different sources&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is always a questionable=\r\n point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight th=\r\ne results which support veg\n food and vice versa. There are lot of halfbake=\r\nd researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for differen=\r\nt sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal sources =\r\nare best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources a=\r\nre best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) =\r\nSo I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. O=\r\nbviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is conce=\r\nrned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, I agree Non =\r\nveg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetarian foo=\r\nd, although less but in daily habit it will not let you escape from Tamas. =\r\nI agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting food, le=\r\nss energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact that after food, s=\r\nignificant blood supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy foo=\r\nd, tea, coffee, coke\n and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat!=\r\n This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But still =\r\nat last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am just=\r\n highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should understand=\r\n that we may be right but we should realise that it does not necessarily me=\r\nan other person is not right.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please point out my mistakes I had mad=\r\ne in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned here may not be exactl=\r\ny as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too much off the l=\r\nine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kind Regards&lt;BR&gt;Atul&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisd=\r\nom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nand=\r\ny &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me clarif=\r\ny. (I am only dealing with\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the science part of these discussions,=\r\n as I had already maintained right at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; beginning).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Nationa=\r\nl Public Radio) several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months back. They conducted an experiment =\r\non gorillas. One set of gorillas was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat. The other set =\r\nwas fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months, researchers f=\r\nound a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with =\r\nmeat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If=C3=82&nbsp;you have any references fo=\r\nr this, in terms of whether they published any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; paper on the same, =\r\nI am interested to know and analyse that in details. I am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; open to =\r\nlearning and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat takes up =\r\nmore energy. Gorillas fed with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted m=\r\nore energy towards the\n development of brain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though they were not=\r\n sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=C3=82&nbsp;=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellec=\r\ntual development.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is a wrong theory as fa=\r\nr as human nutrition=C3=82&nbsp;is concerned, because human &lt;BR&gt;&gt; stomac=\r\nh structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products. In my other =\r\nmail, I have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on c=\r\nlinical nutrition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide mor=\r\ne; which may=C3=82&nbsp;take a few days since I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have to get them f=\r\nrom people who deal with these topics professionally, but time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is =\r\nnot a problem.=C3=82&nbsp;All the papers are=C3=82&nbsp;from the most accep=\r\nted and reputed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; scientific=C3=82&nbsp;journals. There is no confus=\r\nion. Which is why I said, it is myth &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n that=C3=82&nbsp;vegeterian=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;foods are=C3=82&nbsp;easier to digest, if digestibility is the =\r\ncriteria. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Further, in my experience,=\r\n I never found traditional vegeterians to be any more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dull or smar=\r\nter than traditional omnivores. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (7) =\r\nRegarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, fe=\r\ned the poor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; An animal has a specific physical=C3=82&nbsp;structure and needs to ma=\r\nintain the same. But &lt;BR&gt;&gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of m=\r\neals. I have seen people feeding &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statist=\r\nically speaking, an animal whose whole body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; structure is designed =\r\nto be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; survival=\r\n, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nweaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may resul=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased=\r\n, but the chances &lt;BR&gt;&gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die o=\r\nf cancer, but smoking makes one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; susceptible to cancer. It increase=\r\ns the probability. Therefore my personal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; opinion is that an animal=\r\n if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; way possible=\r\n, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; _______________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A question for you.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures have concl=\r\nuded that meat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prev=\r\nelant since at least 4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; million years. That, without a diet which w=\r\nas\n omnivorous, the structure of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; human stomach (lack of a deve=\r\nloped=C3=82&nbsp;caecum),=C3=82&nbsp;and the threefold increase in=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;brain &lt;BR&gt;&gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82&nbsp;could neve=\r\nr have been what it is today. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has =\r\nbeen a=C3=82&nbsp;natural process, so ingrained that it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; has change=\r\nd the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done &lt;BR&gt;&gt; consci=\r\nously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if you want, I will =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; provide relevent research=C3=82&nbsp;papers to prove my claim).&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; What is your take on this? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;Between me and You, there is only me. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Take away the me, so only =\r\nYou remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; __________=\r\n______________________&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; To: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Food we eat&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There has been a lot of discussion on=\r\n food. A few quick comments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (1) We are we we eat. Product=\r\nion of various chemicals in our body and their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interactions, are c=\r\nontrolled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound &lt;BR&gt;&gt; impact =\r\non us.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) Much has been written on the material benefits =\r\nfrom vegetarianism. But that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not all. There are spiritual and s=\r\nubtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of a=\r\nn animal that strongly identifies with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; physical body entails a=\r\n karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; body is =\r\nmuch subtler and\n the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; smaller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods =\r\nare used for meat production by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; corporations and animals are treat=\r\ned very cruelly. Part of the karma for their &lt;BR&gt;&gt; suffering goes to the=\r\n ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) I heard an interview=\r\n with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months ba=\r\nck. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After sever=\r\nal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two =\r\nsets. The ones &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Their t=\r\nheory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the developmen=\r\nt of brain. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to=\r\n human\n beings or not, a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maxi=\r\nmize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (4) After we eat a he=\r\navy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on work=\r\n that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive process &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there =\r\nisn&#39;t much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; agni available for other activities such as digestion o=\r\nf intellectual ideas that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestio=\r\nn of spiritual ideas/experiences also &lt;BR&gt;&gt; requires agni and that canno=\r\nt happen well. That is why meditation or homam after &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a heavy meal =\r\nare fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eat=\r\ning.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e=\r\n.g. meats, deep fried food &lt;BR&gt;&gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimula=\r\nte digestive agni etc) are consumed more &lt;BR&gt;&gt; frequently, agni is\n dive=\r\nrted towards digestion more often and there is less agni &lt;BR&gt;&gt; available=\r\n for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, sim=\r\nple &lt;BR&gt;&gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spi=\r\nces, and fruits), &lt;BR&gt;&gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more=\r\n agni is available for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ide=\r\nas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet gr=\r\nass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be burnt by just one sp=\r\nark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to assim=\r\nilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; v=\r\naasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be nee=\r\nded &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet gras=\r\ns). Thus, it all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in\n nadis and =\r\nchakras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One person may eat meat and deep fried foods, spe=\r\nnd a lot of agni on digesting &lt;BR&gt;&gt; them and yet make excellent spiritua=\r\nl progress. Another person may eat saattwik &lt;BR&gt;&gt; food, maximize the agn=\r\ni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to progr=\r\ness spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignore &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, =\r\nthat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas an=\r\nd their needs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. =\r\nOtherwise, feed the poor &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume=\r\n enough &lt;BR&gt;&gt; food to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharm=\r\na in the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; world using physical body and\n make spiritual pr=\r\nogress. Eating too much food is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specif=\r\nic days, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular practi=\r\nces are more important for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformation and success, than occasi=\r\nonal practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doe=\r\nr of all actions or considering food &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one canno=\r\nt escape the karma involved. It depends on how &lt;BR&gt;&gt; deeply ingrained th=\r\nat thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feels=\r\n 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;
