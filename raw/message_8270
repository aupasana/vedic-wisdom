R=C5=ABm=C4=AB\nis =\r\na descriptive name meaning &quot;Roman&quot; since he lived most of his life in\nan ar=\r\nea called &quot;R=FBm&quot;. Rumi&#39;s father was Bah=C4=81 ud-D=C4=ABn Walad, a\ntheolog=\r\nian, jurist and a mystic from Wakhsh. When the Mongols invaded\nCentral Asia=\r\n sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his\nwhole family a=\r\nnd a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to\nhagiographical acc=\r\nount  Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic\nPersian poets, &#39;Attar,=\r\n in the Iranian city of Nishapur, located in the\nprovince of Khor=C4=81s=C4=\r\n=81n. &#39;Attar immediately recognized Rumi&#39;s\nspiritual eminence. He saw the f=\r\nather walking ahead of the son and said,\n&quot;Here comes a sea followed by an o=\r\ncean.&quot; He gave the boy his\nAsr=C4=81rn=C4=81ma, a book about the entangleme=\r\nnt of the soul in the\nmaterial world. This meeting had a deep impact on the=\r\n eighteen-year-old\nRumi and later on became the inspiration for his works. =\r\nHe then spend a\nlarge part of his life as a Maulavi and a teacher of Islami=\r\nc\nJurisprudence.\n\nIt was his meeting with the dervish Shams-e Tabrizi on 15=\r\n November 1244\nthat completely changed his life. From an accomplished teach=\r\ner and\njurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic. Shams had traveled\nthr=\r\noughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could\n&quot;endure=\r\n my company&quot;. A voice said to him, &quot;What will you give in\nreturn?&quot; Shams re=\r\nplied, &quot;My head!&quot; The voice then said, &quot;The one you\nseek is Jalal ud-Din of=\r\n Konya.&quot; So Shams went to the school where Rumi\nwas a teacher. He found Rum=\r\ni discoursing on Scepticism and Neoplatonism,\nand stringing many a brillian=\r\nt pearl of metaphysics.  Heaps of books lay\naround and in front of him, and=\r\n on his lips was the key to all their\nmysteries.\n\nLooking at all this intel=\r\nlectual scholarship of Rumi, Shams i Tabriz\ncried out, &quot;What is all this no=\r\nise and babble? What are all these\nsyllogisms and judgments and demonstrati=\r\nons?&quot;\n&quot;Peace, O fool!&quot; Exclaimed the Maulvi (Rumi), &quot;Do not laugh\nat the do=\r\nctrines of the sages. Get out of my college! This is argument\nand discussio=\r\nn; what have you to do with it? My discourse is beyond your\nunderstanding. =\r\nIt brightens the glass of perception!&quot;\n\nShams did not say a word but starte=\r\nd walking away, when to the surprise\nof all present, the whole library of b=\r\nooks caught fire and turned to\nashes. Rumi cried in dismay, &quot;How did you ki=\r\nndle this fire, which\nhas burned the books of the philosophers?&quot; Shams repl=\r\nied, &quot;O\nunbeliever, this is vision and ecstasy: what have you to do with it=\r\n? My\nstate is beyond your thought, my flame is the Alchemist&#39;s elixir.&quot;\nRum=\r\ni left his school and scholarship and started following Shams from\nthen on.=\r\n\n\nOn the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams\nwa=\r\ns called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is\nrumor=\r\ned that Shams was murdered by other Muslim clerics with the\nconnivance of R=\r\numi&#39;s son; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the\nprivilege of their mys=\r\ntical friendship.\n\nRumi&#39;s love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Sh=\r\nams found their\nexpression in an outpouring lyric poems, Divan-e Shams-e Ta=\r\nbrizi. He\nhimself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damas=\r\ncus.\nThere, he realized:\n\n     Why should I seek? I am the same as\n     He.=\r\n His essence speaks through me.\n     I have been looking for myself!\n\nA few=\r\n translated couplets from Rumi&#39;s most famous work, Masnavi:\n\n&quot;How could you=\r\n reach the pearl by only looking at the sea? If you seek\nthe pearl, be a di=\r\nver.&quot;\n\n&quot;Observe the wonders as they occur around you. Don&#39;t claim them. Fee=\r\nl\nthe artistry moving through & be silent.&quot;\n\n&quot;I started looking for you, no=\r\nt knowing how blind that was. Lovers\ndon&#39;t finally meet somewhere. They are=\r\n in each other all along.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yesterday i was clever, so i wanted to change =\r\nthe world; today i am\nwise so i am changing myself.&quot;\n\n&quot;There is no Love gre=\r\nater than Love with no object.

Those who\nare not in love w=\r\nith God will see only their own faces in it.&quot;\n\n&quot;Reason is the shadow cast b=\r\ny God; God is the sun.&quot;\n\n&quot;Do not feel lonely, the entire universe is inside=\r\n of you.&quot;\n\n&quot;Love said to me, there is nothing that is not me. Be silent.&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;The rose&#39;s rarest essence lives in the thorns.&quot;\n\n&quot;Why do you stay in priso=\r\nn when the door is so wide open? Move outside\nthe tangle of fear-thinking. =\r\nLive in silence.&quot;\n\n&quot;Deafened by the voice of desire you are unaware the Bel=\r\noved lives in\nthe core of your heart.

Who comes to a lake for wate=\r\nr and sees the\nreflection of moon.&quot;\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know much; I have lost all my=\r\n knowledge because I&#39;m just\nintoxicated with a glass of Love.&quot;\n\n&quot;When you c=\r\nome looking for sugar, your bag will be examined to see how\nmuch it can hol=\r\nd; it will be filled accordingly.&quot;\n\n&quot;God turns you from one feeling to anot=\r\nher & teaches you by means of\nopposites, so that you will have two wings to=\r\n fly - not one.&quot;\n\n&quot;The closer I get, the more I see how far I am.&quot;\n\n&quot;By God=\r\n when you see your beauty you will be the idol for yourself.&quot;\n\n&quot;You are the=\r\n secret of God&#39;s secret&quot;\n\n&quot;We search for Him here & there, while looking ri=\r\nght at Him. Sitting by\nHis side, we ask; &#39;O Beloved, where is the Beloved?&quot;=\r\n\n\n&quot;When I look in my innermost self, I see that the Universe has not yet\nbe=\r\nen created&quot;\n\n&quot;What is the soul? Consciousness. The more awareness, the deep=\r\ner the\nsoul, and when such essence overflows, you feel sacredness around.&quot;\n=\r\n\n&quot;Death has nothing to do with going away.
