I also bought havan =\r\nsamagri, dry \ncoconuts etc.\n\n                    Actually i want to start w=\r\nith short cut method \nso please advice me that ,how much ghee,havan samagri=\r\n, dry coconut \netc are used in one havana, so that i will plan these items =\r\n\naccordingly.I have arranged 2 kg of havan samagri, 1 kg dry coconuts \netc.=\r\n.So how to divide this in ratio as per single day process.How \nmuch ghee in=\r\n grams per havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf notes \non homam again and =\r\nagain but doing practical things r difficult and \nneed much more focus and =\r\nmethodology.\n\n               Although  by God grace and your encouragement =\r\nto \npeople for doing homams, even i myself get transformed towards \nhomam ,=\r\nso thanks for that. But i need your step by step guidance as \neverything is=\r\n  not included in your notes( although its best notes \non homam). Its my we=\r\nakness actually.\n\n\n               In normal homams by priests in India ,the=\r\ny do swaha \nwith ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean after they=\r\n pour \nghee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one drop of ghee \n=\r\nin water too. So is it correct way or not ?\n\n               \n              =\r\n If single person is doing a homam then how to manage \nahutis of ghee and s=\r\namagri both and of course mantra mala or notes u \nprovided ? Bcz in India, =\r\nnormally full group or family do homams and \npriest only says mantras.So i =\r\nthink two people r must for homam.\n\n               I have spoon made of woo=\r\nd ,Is it ok or i have to buy \nof copper metal ?\n\n                I am still=\r\n unmarried so can i do with my mother this \nchandi homam ?\n\n             \n =\r\n      Please provide me some beautiful answers of these queries.And \ndont m=\r\nind if my queries prove to be very simple and illogical.But i \nhave to star=\r\nt from basics .So just cooperate with me as i love the \nwork with perfectio=\r\nn.In next mail i will ask some queries on mantras \nin order to understand p=\r\nroperly.\n\nU r really spreading vedic wisdom in true practical sense. I salu=\r\nte \nto u.\n\nthanks and full respect to u Sir,\ndheeraj khosla,\nDelhi\n\n\n\n\n\n   =\r\n      \n\n\n\n\n"}}
