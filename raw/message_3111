Though many other=\r\n masters came to earth in the last few centuries, who perfected some types =\r\nof spiritual moods or the other, he is someone who perfected everything. He=\r\n would chant Hari&#39;s name, melt with emotion and go into bhaava samaadhi for=\r\n hours together. He would engage in 64 kriyas of tantra, without his mind b=\r\neing perturbed by anything. He would be in samadhi where he is at the feet =\r\nof god. He would be in samadhi where he is in oneness with god. He would be=\r\n in nirvikalpa samadhi where there are no gods, no demons, no beings or obj=\r\nects, but just Aatman or Brahman.\n \nThe same person who would behave like a=\r\n small child at times would also show unmatched wisdom all the time. He wou=\r\nld transform an illiterate servant boy (Latu) into a great spiritual master=\r\n (Swami Adbhutananda) who was established in Shiva-consciousness at all tim=\r\nes. He would transform an energetic, skeptical, irreverant, independent, ra=\r\ntional and highly intelligent young man with several biases (Naren) into a =\r\nvenerable and compassionate saint known as a great teacher around the world=\r\n (Swami Vivekananda).\n \nHe practiced karma yoga and his sishyas and the mut=\r\nt established by them engaged in so much social service across India. He pr=\r\nacticed jnaana yoga and his sishyas popularized Adwaita across the world. H=\r\ne even engaged in raja yoga and taught a select few like Vivekananda. He of=\r\n course practiced bhakti yoga and melted in devotion when thinking of Kaali=\r\n in the same way as he did when thought of Krishna. He even did Christian a=\r\nnd Islamic sadhanas.\n \nHe not only experienced the Absolute himself, but wa=\r\ns capable of making others experience. His mere touch took Vivekananda into=\r\n samadhi in their second meeting. Vivekananda experienced other higher stat=\r\nes later due to Ramakrishna&#39;s will (e.g. what happened for a few days after=\r\n he mocked the Vedantic statement that all is god, in front of Ramakrishna)=\r\n. Even his guru Totapuri who was an adept in Adwaita and experienced nirvik=\r\nalpa samadhi several times was, for the first time in his life, introduced =\r\nto the power of the Mother by Ramakrishna. Totapuri considered faith in sag=\r\nuna forms of god as childish and believed only in the formless Brahman. But=\r\n he left Dakshineshwar with a healthy respect for the Saguna forms. He actu=\r\nally went inside the temple and prostrated before the idol before he left D=\r\nakshineshwar! And, there is the kalpataru day, when people started experien=\r\ncing different levels of spiritual bliss just by touching him. Everyone who=\r\n touched him that day went into a spiritual ecstasy and stayed in it frozen=\r\n right there in the garden. Some even went into different levels of samadhi=\r\n.\n \nIf this is how the Leela of an incarnation is, imagine how the leela of=\r\n a poorna purusha like Lord Krishna must have been!\n \nI personally love ana=\r\nlogies, allegories, metaphors and parables. Ramakrishna was an absolute mas=\r\nter of those. He demystified things and taught the highest Truths in simple=\r\n terms so that everybody can understand the essence.\n \nRamakrishna is an ab=\r\nsolutely unique saint who showed that all paths lead to god, not by stating=\r\n theory, but by demonstrating it practically.\n \nUnlike saints like Buddha, =\r\nAadi Shankara, Moses and Jesus, he is relatively recent and his life is wel=\r\nl-documented.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe field of duality is like a dream.=\r\n Being established in Brahman or Aatman is like the wakeful state. All the =\r\nobjects of dream disappear when one is awake. They are unreal. However, the=\r\ny are quite real for one who is still in the dream! And, a roaring lion fro=\r\nm a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are so different in their nature, =\r\nabilities and effect. Even though a jnaani may tell you there is god (Brahm=\r\nan) in everything and all are equal, it is true only for one established in=\r\n Brahman. If one is awake, a roaring lion from a dream and a meowing cat fr=\r\nom a dream are equal. But, to somebody still sleeping, both are so differen=\r\nt.\n \nThough all beings are but god, different beings play different roles i=\r\nn the field of Maayaa and there is a clear hierarchy.\n \nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/tarpana\n-----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; I have not read the Kathamrita - so I cannot comment on it really but I f=\r\nound Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga by Swami Saradananda to be an excellent b=\r\nook, exhaustive and detailed in the analysis. Swami Saradananda takes so my=\r\n pains to beautifully explain various aspects of Ramakrishna&#39;s spiritual be=\r\nhaviour and general explanations of spiritual things as well. \n&gt;  \n&gt; For ex=\r\nample it is from this book that I first understood why an Avatar like Ramak=\r\nrishna had to perform such severe sadhana. Also thiis book gives a detailed=\r\n recording of Ramakrishna&#39;s Tantric sadhanas, how he completed all the 64 k=\r\nriyas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is one point I have observed with Ramakrishna&#39;s teaching=\r\ns.His advises are often specific to the person he was advising. For someone=\r\n he may say study the Adhyatma Ramayana, for another he advised never to to=\r\nuch the Adhyatma Ramayana! Like a perfect teacher he advised the specific m=\r\nedicine for the specific problem in the path of spirituality that the speci=\r\nfic person was facing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Second is his  fantastic razor sharp intellect=\r\n. No one gives better examples to explain some aspect of spirituality than =\r\nRamakrishna. Simple yet perfect. He uses the intellect to explain yet does =\r\nnot get caught up in the mazes of words. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Third and most important, t=\r\nhe range of spiritual moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to re=\r\nspect to every great master who has walked on this planet, I can&#39;t recall a=\r\nnother name who has expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His =\r\nspiritual journey is not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal=\r\n where he relishes every dish to the core.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Juding purely from an inte=\r\nllectual perspective, I believe there are some possibility of corruption in=\r\n the teachings of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha to Shana=\r\nkara to Guru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to Aurobindo . Corruptions no=\r\nt in the teaching per se but corruption arising out of misinterpretation of=\r\n the words over time. One cannot really blame them for this because it is a=\r\nlmost impossible to forsee what turn of events lead to what kind of mindset=\r\ns which can make their statements/advises defuct or even dangerous over tim=\r\ne.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For example, Jesus says I am the path. Obviously Christians have m=\r\nistook this to understand that Jesus is the only path. What he ment by I ma=\r\ny not be Jesus the man, but Jesus the idea - of purity and of love.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nuddha gave a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spiritual=\r\nity is more important than spiritual discussion. People mistook that to und=\r\nerstand Budha was as atheist.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Shanakara, the great man that he was, w=\r\nould have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in which we lat=\r\ner day college educated Indians use the phrases like Aham Brahmasmi and eve=\r\nrything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest movie in town.  A=\r\nlso I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Guru Nanak in ord=\r\ner to infuse more life into spirituality of Hindus as well as Muslims and b=\r\nring a comprise in the two ideas decried practises like idol worship and pi=\r\ntri tarpan.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Chaitanya was the emotional pinnacle of spirituality. He =\r\nwas capable. Others less capable misunderstood the path to feel that withou=\r\nt shedding bucket full of tears you wont land at God&#39;s doorsteps. Emotions =\r\nare good, but they can mislead too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vivekananda - absolute leader. Li=\r\nke all leaders, he does make some statements at times which are not well de=\r\nliberated upon, which results in misinterpretations later on. Of course a l=\r\neader cannot be expected to think for ten days before speaking one  sentenc=\r\ne. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Vivekanada, but the price of s=\r\npontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date specially if you are fantas=\r\ntic.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aurobindo, brilliant and rare analysis of spiritual steps/stages=\r\n. One that I have never found in any other writing. However the problem is =\r\nexactly the same. Often people wrongly believe that only by reading and int=\r\nellectually comprehending Aurobindo;s writings one can make spiritual progr=\r\ness. There is no substitute for raw old fashioned sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please not=\r\ne all these are great men were without question, spiritually much realized.=\r\n I am merely doing an intellectual analysis from a historial perspective.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; And then Ramakrishna, such a vast range of emotions and practices coup=\r\nled with simple and pointed examples and advises, it is hardly possible for=\r\n him to get misinterpreted. He uses Shanakra&#39;s phrase &quot;Brahma satya jagat m=\r\nithya&quot; but he also teaches Totapuri why Mahamaya is so powerful. He seems l=\r\nike a perfect assimilation of all ideas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just my two cents. \n&gt;  \n&gt; -R=\r\negards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva =\r\nSutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: How Ramakrishna deals with a debater.\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, 20 November, 2009, 9:17 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a &gt;vill=\r\nage in west bengal, who probably could not even sign his own &gt;name.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna, whom i lovingly address as &#39;Thakur&#39; is simply Rama and Krishna a=\r\nnd no less......\n&gt; \n&gt; And Kathamruta is THE book which has given answers an=\r\nd confirmations to my queries and understandings which haunted me from chil=\r\ndhood.

The brahmani - who was Thakur&#39;s g=\r\nuru - had called Gauri for a session of discussion on the spiritual abiliti=\r\nes etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous debater and a sadhaka=C3=82 w=\r\nho never lost any debate. \n&gt; &gt; Plus Thakur used to say that Gauri had remak=\r\nrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa of Ma Kali by stretching out his l=\r\neft hand, piling wood on the bare=C3=82 arm, lighting it and then using his=\r\n right hand to pour ghee! And the homa would last for an hour or more and h=\r\ne would keep his left hand perfectly still all this while. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n He had a certain siddhi in the use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of whi=\r\nch one could never win in a debate=C3=82 against him. Plus he had a deep, r=\r\nesounding voice which Ramakrishna described as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; When Gauri entered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw =\r\nthe Kali temple, he started repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that t=\r\nime was coming out of the temple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna star=\r\nted saying that specific mantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that=\r\n Gauri could hear. Gauri, on being thus challanged=C3=82 started shouting t=\r\nhe mantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just give=\r\nn him a divine voice and he too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed.=\r\n He roared again=C3=82 but Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gau=\r\nri realized he has lost his voice. And his siddhi too! \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; At =\r\nfirst he was furious with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ram=\r\nakrishna. Finally he proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fraction of wh=\r\nose power do Avatars come down on earth. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Later one day Gau=\r\nri came to Ramakrishna asking for his blessing to take sanyasa. He quit deb=\r\nating and went away from that place, promising that he would not return unt=\r\nill he realized the Self. Thakur also blessed him according.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought u=\r\np in a village in west bengal, who probably could not even sign his own nam=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
