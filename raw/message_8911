HELP!!\n\nTeacher : They also said skip everything , just remember god for =\r\ntwo\nminutes, sincerely, and god will just be there and listen.\n\nStudent : N=\r\not exactly, but similar stuff.\n\nTeacher : Well, my first question is, when =\r\nwas the last time somebody\ndid this?\n\nStudent : What?\n\nTeacher : Remembered=\r\n god sincerely for two minute straight, without the\nmind interfering and ru=\r\nnning a background commentary?\n\nStudent : Why the hell do you have to prove=\r\n me wrong every damn time?\n\nTeacher : point is , neither does anyone unders=\r\ntand the real essence of\nthat advice and neither can you follow that advice=\r\n, so you better stick\nto what i am telling you.\n\nStudent : Okay, but first =\r\nanswer my questions.\n\nTeacher : Shoot, you have 10 minutes, and then the pr=\r\ness conference\nends.\n\nStudent : Why celibacy?\n\nTeacher : Let us say, you ar=\r\ne standing at the lavatory of an airbus A380\n( in flight ), and your destin=\r\nation is to reach the cockpit. And you\nstart walking towards it, and mind y=\r\nou walking is hard, because you are\nbound by tight huge rubber bands from t=\r\nhe back of the airplane.\n\nStudent : Okay.\n\nTeacher : And off you go towards=\r\n the cockpit, and as soon as you walk\nlike 20 steps, you encounter an open =\r\nexit, the one on the side. What\nwill happen?\n\nStudent : I will be sucked ou=\r\nt of the plane, due to the immense air\npressure of it.\n\nTeacher : And to ad=\r\nd to that, you will re spawn at the back of the\nplane, and you are back to =\r\nsquare one. Mind you even those 20 steps are\nhellishly difficult.\n\nStudent =\r\n: And then start all over again?\n\nTeacher : Yep.\n\nStudent : no progress til=\r\nl the door closes?\n\nTeacher : Nope, every time you will be sucked out, why =\r\nwaste all the\neffort? If you don&#39;t feel like closing the door , why not mak=\r\ne love with\nan air hostess and join the mile high club?\n\nStudent : oho!!\n\nT=\r\neacher : The back of the plane is akin to your widely read mooldhara,\nand t=\r\nhe cockpit is akin to your much publicized sahasrara, the exit on\nthe side =\r\nis your gentile thus you have a choice.\n\nStudent : What that might=A0 be?\n\n=\r\nTeacher : Its your either your cock or the cockpit. LOL\n\nStudent : You dirt=\r\ny old man.\n\nTeacher : Gande video tum dekho, dirty old man main banoon, kya=\r\n insaaf\nhai.\n\nStudent : What are all those rubber bands for in that analogy=\r\n?\n\nTeacher : Your attachments, your conditioning, vaasnas, habits, etc.\n\nSt=\r\nudent : And since they are pulling me back, their akin to rubber\nbands.\n\nTe=\r\nacher : Now you realized that? What a dodo.\n\nStudent: So closing the air do=\r\nor is important.\n\nTeacher : Yes, and top it off there will be many times, w=\r\nhen you are not\nprocessing straight to the cockpit, the forces format he ba=\r\nck will be so\nstrong, that you will be handgun not he economy class seats. =\r\nAnd if you\nadd an open exit to all these forces, what will happen?\n\nStudent=\r\n : I&#39;ll be landing on my face in the lavatory.\n\nTeacher : Precisely.\n\nStude=\r\nnt : Ouch.\n\nTeacher : Precisely x 2\n\nStudent : Got it, but what when I am m=\r\narried?\n\nTeacher : Holy crap!! You are 21, what is the need to think, I mea=\r\nn you\ncould die like tomorrow , you are atleast 5 years from marriage, and =\r\nit\nis also quite possible that=A0 you remain unmarried.\n\nStudent : WHAT??? =\r\nNo but i want to get married.\n\nTeacher : What, &quot;what&quot;? We&#39;ll cross that bri=\r\ndge when we get to it,=A0\nbut for any married person, celibacy is equivalen=\r\nt to sticking to one\npartner, physically as well as mentally and if your pa=\r\nrtner demands sex,\nit is your duty to fulfill it. What good is a man who ca=\r\nn&#39;t be of any\nsexual use to his own wife? You can remain completely celibat=\r\ne in a\nmarriage during the time that you need to stay celibate. And you are=\r\n 21,\nyou should be worried about a lot more things than marriage.\n\nP.S. And=\r\n if you are into all this god shod business, it is not necessary\nthat your =\r\nspouse be also into this, and by denying them this basic right\n( Sex shex a=\r\nnd all that jazz ), you might be inducing them to curse you\nand god , thus =\r\ncreating more karma&#39;s.\n\nStudent : Eeekss=85 Okay.

Without o=\r\njas , you are like a person who\nsmells like a sewer rat, with ojas you are =\r\nlike the axe deodrant guy,\neverybody (ethereal) just wants you!!\n\nStudent :=\r\n Go on\n\nTeacher : Nope, not right now, other wise your over intellectual mi=\r\nnd\nwill gallop to conclusions and block you from actually doing some thing.=\r\n\n\nStudent : Now what about sleep?\n\nTeacher : &quot;You&quot; are already sleeping.\n\nS=\r\ntudent : You mean &quot;you&quot; like the &quot;battery&quot; analogy,\n\nTeacher : yes, and whe=\r\nn you add physical sleep to it, you are sleeping\ntwice over.\n\nStudent : ouc=\r\nh.\n\nTeacher : When you are trying to wake up to god, you think excessive\nsl=\r\neeping which dulls the mind actually helps your case or the deters it?\n\nStu=\r\ndent : Deters it.\n\nTeacher : To add to that, what about all the sexy dreams=\r\n you can get?\nYou don&#39;t want the exit door in the airplane opening without =\r\nwarning\nnow, do you?\n\nStudent : No, no.\n\nTeacher : Any questions on sleep?\n=\r\n\nStudent: Even if i had any, i ma sure you will answer automatically like\ni=\r\nt is your habit, but I don&#39;t know what to say, its overwhelming, thus,\nyou =\r\ndecide.\n\nTeacher : There are more things, but will tell you later, rather y=\r\nou\nwill tell me yourself.

I sucks at maths.\n\nTeacher : Yep.\n\nS=\r\ntudent: Not understanding\n\nTeacher : You ever heard of a vrata katha?\n\nStud=\r\nent : Yes.\n\nTeacher : What exactly happens in a fast?\n\nStudent : People don=\r\n&#39;t eat?\n\nTeacher : Why?\n\nStudent: because its a fucking fast.\n\nTeacher : Sl=\r\now down Rambo, why do not eat?\n\nStudent : God knows.\n\nTeacher : Fast -- no =\r\nfood -- increases bhoot agni, since jathara agni\nisn&#39;t being fed, then read=\r\n a katha or a story , so that the &quot;image&quot; of\nthe story has a better chance =\r\nof being generated inside another form of\nthe person&#39;s body on the inside a=\r\nnd help him/ her out by creating a\nremedial &quot;image&quot;.\n\nStudent : holy crap\n\n=\r\nTeacher : Now you tell me why food?\n\nStudent : because less the food or rat=\r\nher the more managed it is , less\njathara agni can get inflamed and more bh=\r\noot agni can be managed and\nthus any recitation of any text, homam or tarpa=\r\nn can have a better\nimpact on the other forms of the body thus actually hel=\r\nping the real\n&quot;me&quot; out.\n\nTeacher : Where do i bow down , wash your feet and=\r\n drink the water kind\nsir?\n*Blushes*\n\nStudent : I think is should do that f=\r\nor you.\n\nTeacher : Never me, only god.\n\nTeacher : So you understood food to=\r\no?\n\nStudent : I am guessing, yes. And to add to that, the heavier the food,=\r\n\nthe more digestive fire is needed, thus less spiritual fire, exactly in\nth=\r\ne case of meat and chicken. Holy shit!!\n\nTeacher :\nKismat meri jaga do\nMusi=\r\nc thoda bada do\nIk patiyala or pila do\nIss party mein aag laga do\n\nhttp://y=\r\noutu.be/hV8l59pxfho?t=3D1m6s\n\nStudent :\nMain Sharabi!!\nMain Sharabi!!\nMain =\r\nSharabi!!\nMain Sharabi!!\n\nTeacher : And from this date, you are also banned=\r\n from alcohol.\n\nStudent : WHAT??? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BUT WHY YOU HAVE BEEN DAN=\r\nCING AND\nDRINK SO MUCH.\n\nTeacher : Simply . because you are not me.\n\nStuden=\r\nt : no, no, no, no. I demand an explanation.\n\nTeacher : You already know it=\r\n.\n\nStudent : You tell, i don&#39;t know anything\n\nTeacher : You just told me wi=\r\nth that meat explanation.\n\nStudent : So i keep pouring it int he digestive =\r\nfire and oh well=85=85.\ncrap.\n\nTeacher : Precisely.\n\nStudent : that implies=\r\n you are not offering it into the digestive fire.\n\nTeacher : And now we mov=\r\ne on to matters of serious contemplation.\n\nStudent : You haven&#39;t answered m=\r\ne.\n\nTeacher : Tell me about the first day the figure and fitness gym.\n\nStud=\r\nent : It was good, but days after it were hell.\n\nTeacher : felt like a bull=\r\ndozer rolled over you?\n\nStudent : Pretty much, my muscles were hurting.\n\nTe=\r\nacher : And how long did it take you to actually build some visible\nmuscle?=\r\n\n\nStudent : a good 8 months, with gym 4 to 5 days a week that too for 1 to\n=\r\ntwo hours.\n\nTeacher : Same case with god.\n\nStudent : How?\n\nTeacher : What w=\r\nas the dumbbell size you started out with?\n\nStudent : 4 kgs\n\nTeacher : And =\r\ntoday?\n\nStudent : 15 kgs seems light.\n\nTeacher : Same case here, the more y=\r\nou practice/perform , the better you\nwill get. With god, no visible muscles=\r\n will be there, and nobody will\nappreciate except the people who are much s=\r\ntronger than you, but this\ndesire to get recognized should also go away the=\r\n more you progress.\n\nStudent : So this is like a gym?\n\nTeacher : yes, repet=\r\nition of a mantra is akin to reps in a set, the more\nyou do, the closer you=\r\n are. Lets say a text like durga saptashati, which\nyou have never read, you=\r\n start reading, you will make a 1000 errors, but\nif you actually start rect=\r\nifying a couple of errors by marking the words\ndown and making an effort to=\r\n correct, after some time you will be able\nto recite it perfectly. lets you=\r\n make 1000 errors, and lets you recite\nit 1000 times, each time focusing on=\r\n 5 words, in 500 recitations I think\nyou will be much better than off than =\r\nyou started.\n\nStudent : So it is all effort.\n\nTeacher : Knowledge without e=\r\nffort and without love is actually poison,\nand useless. Don&#39;t be scared of =\r\nerrors and take it as an excuse to run\naway and not do anything at all. You=\r\n have to start out with a 4kg\ndumbbell only,don&#39;t compete with any one else=\r\n or feel embarrassed that\nthey can pick up 20 kg ones and you can&#39;t. They m=\r\nust have given at least\n2 years of regular EFFORT to be where they are.\n\nSt=\r\nudent : Correct. Actually this gym example makes it quite clear to me.\n\nTea=\r\ncher : Good. And don&#39;t you ever dare to forget, what you are in this\nfor an=\r\nd why you started out, to eliminate yourself and only for god and\ngod alone=\r\n. no special hocus pocus powers, no siddhi, no showing off your\nknowledge c=\r\nrap, no progress no nothing, only god. The more homams, the\nmore tarpans, t=\r\nhe more chanting , you will do, the more time you will\nspend there, the bet=\r\nter you will get. its pretty simple. But in the\nbeginning errors will be th=\r\nere, ask for forgiveness and move on. If you\ntry to pick up a 20 kg dumbbel=\r\nl in the beginning obviously your hand\nwill break.\n\nStudent : Just like my =\r\nback used to ache severely even after 20 minutes\nof siting straight, but no=\r\nw it is much better, i can sit still for\naround 2 hours without it ruining =\r\nmy attempt at chanting.\n\nTeacher : And never ever think you are not going t=\r\no fail. You wont be\nable to keep your celibacy straightaway, but lets say s=\r\ntart out with 10\ndays, then progressively increase it. You will fall down, =\r\nbut do get up,\nfor the sake of god, get back up and start all over again. S=\r\name with\nsleep, same with food. Inch by inch move towards the target and yo=\r\nu will\nget there, nature&#39;s eternal promise. The more you will work out in\ns=\r\npiritual terms, the more you spiritual muscles will grow. and the\nbetter yo=\r\nu will look ;) the guys who are already good at the stuff,\nplease consider =\r\nhow much time and effort and has gone into their\npractice. And please stick=\r\n to one thing, or one form , or method, excel\nat it, stop being a prostitut=\r\ne and develop a relationship with a form to\ngo closer with him/ her it. No =\r\n3 or 4 mantras, only one at a time.\n\nStudent : Practice and more practice i=\r\nt is then, but still I can have\none drink, no?\n\nTeacher : Till I don&#39;t allo=\r\nw, nope. But here is one for now.\n\nStudent :\naapke waaste gunaah sahi\nhum p=\r\niye to saab banti hai\nsau ( 100 ) gamon ko nichodne ke baad\nek katra sharab=\r\n banti hai\n\nTeacher : Oh teri bhen ki, kya baat hai, I bow down to god, wit=\r\nhout whom\nthose lines are impossible to come out.

And you start walking towards it, and min=\r\nd you walking is hard, because you are bound by tight huge rubber bands fro=\r\nm the back of the airplane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Okay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And off=\r\n you go towards the cockpit, and as soon as you walk like 20 steps, you enc=\r\nounter an open exit, the one on the side. What will happen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student =\r\n: I will be sucked out of the plane, due to the immense air pressure of it.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And to add to that, you will re spawn at the back of the =\r\nplane, and you are back to square one. Mind you even those 20 steps are hel=\r\nlishly difficult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : And then start all over again?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Te=\r\nacher : Yep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : no progress till the door closes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teac=\r\nher : Nope, every time you will be sucked out, why waste all the effort? If=\r\n you don&#39;t feel like closing the door , why not make love with an air hoste=\r\nss and join the mile high club?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : oho!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : The=\r\n back of the plane is akin to your widely read mooldhara, and the cockpit i=\r\ns akin to your much publicized sahasrara, the exit on the side is your gent=\r\nile thus you have a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : What that might=A0 be?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nTeacher : Its your either your cock or the cockpit. LOL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Yo=\r\nu dirty old man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Gande video tum dekho, dirty old man main=\r\n banoon, kya insaaf hai.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : What are all those rubber bands f=\r\nor in that analogy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Your attachments, your conditioning, v=\r\naasnas, habits, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : And since they are pulling me back, t=\r\nheir akin to rubber bands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Now you realized that? What a d=\r\nodo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student: So closing the air door is important.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher :=\r\n Yes, and top it off there will be many times, when you are not processing =\r\nstraight to the cockpit, the forces format he back will be so strong, that =\r\nyou will be handgun not he economy class seats. And if you add an open exit=\r\n to all these forces, what will happen?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : I&#39;ll be landing on=\r\n my face in the lavatory.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Precisely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Ouch=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Precisely x 2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Got it, but what when I a=\r\nm married?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Holy crap!! You are 21, what is the need to thi=\r\nnk, I mean you could die like tomorrow , you are atleast 5 years from marri=\r\nage, and it is also quite possible that=A0 you remain unmarried.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stu=\r\ndent : WHAT??? No but i want to get married.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : What, &quot;what&quot;?=\r\n We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it,=A0 but for any married person, =\r\ncelibacy is equivalent to sticking to one partner, physically as well as me=\r\nntally and if your partner demands sex, it is your duty to fulfill it. What=\r\n good is a man who can&#39;t be of any sexual use to his own wife? You can rema=\r\nin completely celibate in a marriage during the time that you need to stay =\r\ncelibate. And you are 21, you should be worried about a lot more things tha=\r\nn marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P.S. And if you are into all this god shod business, it =\r\nis not necessary that your spouse be also into this, and by denying them th=\r\nis basic right ( Sex shex and all that jazz ), you might be inducing them t=\r\no curse you and god , thus creating more karma&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Eeekss=\r\n=85 Okay. Why sleep?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : You understood celibacy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stude=\r\nnt : I think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Yay!! Lets celebrate!!&lt;br&gt;*Sings it aloud*=\r\n=A0 http://youtu.be/hV8l59pxfho?t=3D1m20s&lt;br&gt;Yes yes i want it more&lt;br&gt;Aaj =\r\nna chalega zor&lt;br&gt;Khulegi daaro machega shor&lt;br&gt;Aajao saare on the floor&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Bus isi baat pe botal kholo&lt;br&gt;Kiye jo saare paap woh dholo&lt;br&gt;Aao mere sa=\r\nath me holo&lt;br&gt;Put your hand&#39;s up zor se bolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main=\r\n Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : But I reall=\r\ny haven&#39;t told you about ojas and other stuff pertaining to celibacy, I wil=\r\nl tell you when I think you are ready.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Okay Sharabi ji.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Celibacy builds up ojas, one of the elementary things to mak=\r\ne you approachable by a deity. Without ojas , you are like a person who sme=\r\nlls like a sewer rat, with ojas you are like the axe deodrant guy, everybod=\r\ny (ethereal) just wants you!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Go on&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Nope,=\r\n not right now, other wise your over intellectual mind will gallop to concl=\r\nusions and block you from actually doing some thing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Now w=\r\nhat about sleep?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : &quot;You&quot; are already sleeping.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studen=\r\nt : You mean &quot;you&quot; like the &quot;battery&quot; analogy,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : yes, and wh=\r\nen you add physical sleep to it, you are sleeping twice over.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studen=\r\nt : ouch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : When you are trying to wake up to god, you think=\r\n excessive sleeping which dulls the mind actually helps your case or the de=\r\nters it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Deters it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : To add to that, what =\r\nabout all the sexy dreams you can get? You don&#39;t want the exit door in the =\r\nairplane opening without warning now, do you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : No, no.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Teacher : Any questions on sleep?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student: Even if i had any, i m=\r\na sure you will answer automatically like it is your habit, but I don&#39;t kno=\r\nw what to say, its overwhelming, thus, you decide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : There a=\r\nre more things, but will tell you later, rather you will tell me yourself. =\r\nSo We are done with sleep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student: Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher :&lt;br&gt;Bus isi=\r\n baat pe botal kholo&lt;br&gt;Kiye jo saare paap woh dholo&lt;br&gt;Aao mere saath me h=\r\nolo&lt;br&gt;Put your hand&#39;s up zor se bolo&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student :&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And we=\r\n are back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student :=A0 Food.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Simple Answer is Fire=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Agni dev? But how?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Bhoot agni and jath=\r\nara agni.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : HOW?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Inverse relationship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Student: Like in ratios? I sucks at maths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Yep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nStudent: Not understanding&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : You ever heard of a vrata katha=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Yes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : What exactly happens in a fast?&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : People don&#39;t eat?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student: beca=\r\nuse its a fucking fast.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Slow down Rambo, why do not eat?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : God knows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Fast -- no food -- increases bh=\r\noot agni, since jathara agni isn&#39;t being fed, then read a katha or a story =\r\n, so that the &quot;image&quot; of the story has a better chance of being generated i=\r\nnside another form of the person&#39;s body on the inside and help him/ her out=\r\n by creating a remedial &quot;image&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : holy crap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher =\r\n: Now you tell me why food?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : because less the food or rathe=\r\nr the more managed it is , less jathara agni can get inflamed and more bhoo=\r\nt agni can be managed and thus any recitation of any text, homam or tarpan =\r\ncan have a better impact on the other forms of the body thus actually helpi=\r\nng the real &quot;me&quot; out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Where do i bow down , wash your feet=\r\n and drink the water kind sir? &lt;br&gt;*Blushes*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : I think is sh=\r\nould do that for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Never me, only god.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher :=\r\n So you understood food too?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : I am guessing, yes. And to ad=\r\nd to that, the heavier the food, the more digestive fire is needed, thus le=\r\nss spiritual fire, exactly in the case of meat and chicken. Holy shit!!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Teacher : &lt;br&gt;Kismat meri jaga do&lt;br&gt;Music thoda bada do&lt;br&gt;Ik patiyala=\r\n or pila do&lt;br&gt;Iss party mein aag laga do&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://youtu.be/hV8l59pxfh=\r\no?t=3D1m6s&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student :&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sha=\r\nrabi!!&lt;br&gt;Main Sharabi!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And from this date, you are also =\r\nbanned from alcohol.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : WHAT??? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO BUT WHY YOU H=\r\nAVE BEEN DANCING AND DRINK SO MUCH.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Simply . because you a=\r\nre not me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : no, no, no, no. I demand an explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Teacher : You already know it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : You tell, i don&#39;t know any=\r\nthing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : You just told me with that meat explanation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nStudent : So i keep pouring it int he digestive fire and oh well=85=85. cra=\r\np.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Precisely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : that implies you are not of=\r\nfering it into the digestive fire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And now we move on to m=\r\natters of serious contemplation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : You haven&#39;t answered me.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Tell me about the first day the figure and fitness gym.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : It was good, but days after it were hell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : f=\r\nelt like a bulldozer rolled over you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Pretty much, my musc=\r\nles were hurting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And how long did it take you to actually=\r\n build some visible muscle?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : a good 8 months, with gym 4 to=\r\n 5 days a week that too for 1 to two hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Same case with=\r\n god.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : How?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : What was the dumbbell size you=\r\n started out with?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : 4 kgs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : And today?&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Student : 15 kgs seems light.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Same case here, the more y=\r\nou practice/perform , the better you will get. With god, no visible muscles=\r\n will be there, and nobody will appreciate except the people who are much s=\r\ntronger than you, but this desire to get recognized should also go away the=\r\n more you progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : So this is like a gym?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher =\r\n: yes, repetition of a mantra is akin to reps in a set, the more you do, th=\r\ne closer you are. Lets say a text like durga saptashati, which you have nev=\r\ner read, you start reading, you will make a 1000 errors, but if you actuall=\r\ny start rectifying a couple of errors by marking the words down and making =\r\nan effort to correct, after some time you will be able to recite it perfect=\r\nly. lets you make 1000 errors, and lets you recite it 1000 times, each time=\r\n focusing on 5 words, in 500 recitations I think you will be much better th=\r\nan off than you started. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : So it is all effort.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teac=\r\nher : Knowledge without effort and without love is actually poison, and use=\r\nless. Don&#39;t be scared of errors and take it as an excuse to run away and no=\r\nt do anything at all. You have to start out with a 4kg dumbbell only,don&#39;t =\r\ncompete with any one else or feel embarrassed that they can pick up 20 kg o=\r\nnes and you can&#39;t. They must have given at least 2 years of regular EFFORT =\r\nto be where they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Correct. Actually this gym example m=\r\nakes it quite clear to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teacher : Good. And don&#39;t you ever dare t=\r\no forget, what you are in this for and why you started out, to eliminate yo=\r\nurself and only for god and god alone. no special hocus pocus powers, no si=\r\nddhi, no showing off your knowledge crap, no progress no nothing, only god.=\r\n The more homams, the more tarpans, the more chanting , you will do, the mo=\r\nre time you will spend there, the better you will get. its pretty simple. B=\r\nut in the beginning errors will be there, ask for forgiveness and move on. =\r\nIf you try to pick up a 20 kg dumbbell in the beginning obviously your hand=\r\n will break.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student : Just like my back used to ache severely even =\r\nafter 20 minutes of siting straight, but now it is much better, i can sit s=\r\ntill for around 2 hours without it ruining my attempt at chanting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T=\r\neacher : And never ever think you are not going to fail. You wont be able t=\r\no keep your celibacy straightaway, but lets say start out with 10 days, the=\r\nn progressively increase it. You will fall down, but do get up, for the sak=\r\ne of god, get back up and start all over again. Same with sleep, same with =\r\nfood. Inch by inch move towards the target and you will get there, nature&#39;s=\r\n eternal promise. The more you will work out in spiritual terms, the more y=\r\nou spiritual muscles will grow. and the better you will look ;) the guys wh=\r\no are already good at the stuff, please consider how much time and effort a=\r\nnd has gone into their practice. And please stick to one thing, or one form=\r\n , or method, excel at it, stop being a prostitute and develop a relationsh=\r\nip with a form to go closer with him/ her it.
