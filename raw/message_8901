Hence they are=\r\n never meant to be taken literally ever. They are meant to encourage the de=\r\nvotee to pursue a particular path.\n\n1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Ram=\r\na name equals 100 names of Vishnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana)\n\n2. N=\r\next we have Brahmanda Purana that says:\nsahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrtt=\r\nya tu yat phalam;\nekavrttya tu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati\n\none Kris=\r\nhna Japa =3D  3 Rama Japa\n\n3. What more, the same anushashasana parva in wh=\r\nich Vishnu Sahasra Nama is present in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this :=\r\n\n\nyO mAm nama sahasrena stotumicchati pandava\nyohamekena shlokena stuta eva=\r\n na samshaya \n\nBy saying this Krishna is implying that one can get the same=\r\n punya os saying entire Vishnu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vi=\r\nshnu Sahasra nama..  Now each shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN its=\r\nelf.. \nNow we have circular reference in the equation that can never be sat=\r\nisfied !! (Much like GNU stands for GNU is not UNIX !!)\n\nHence this one nam=\r\ne being equivalent to N other names is a wild goose chase. As PVRji said, i=\r\nts all in the state of mind.\n\nBut there is a specific meditation technique =\r\nthat can be specifically applied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned=\r\n in preface of VSN itself (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah).=\r\n Here gauNa does not mean minor. It means &quot;being related to guna&quot;. It means=\r\n each name extolls one (several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can pon=\r\nder over that quality of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to =\r\npractice such technique and requires quite a bit of cross reference reading=\r\n. It is to be slowly developed over time. But it is very effective.\n\nRegard=\r\ns,\nSrikanth\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; First, on Ranga&#39;s question:\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no=\r\n single &quot;effective&quot; way. Whether one is chanting oneself or \n&gt; listening to=\r\n a person/cassette/CD/MP3, is not the primary factor. The \n&gt; primary factor=\r\n is how focused one&#39;s mind is on it. The goal of chanting \n&gt; a stotra or a =\r\nmantra is to eliminate or atleast limit other thoughts and \n&gt; focus the min=\r\nd on it. That can happen with chanting as well as \n&gt; listening.\n&gt; \n&gt; For ex=\r\nample, I may be chanting Vishnu sahasra nama stotra and yet my \n&gt; mind may =\r\nbe wandering everywhere and focusing on all kind of dirty \n&gt; thoughts. Anot=\r\nher person listening to me while doing some chores may be \n&gt; focusing a goo=\r\nd part of their mental attention on the prayer and \n&gt; contemplating each wo=\r\nrd and its meaning and contemplating the qualities \n&gt; of Lord. In that case=\r\n, that listener will get a lot more benefit from it \n&gt; than I will!\n&gt; \n&gt; Ea=\r\nch deity has some qualities. Focusing the mind on a deity and his/her \n&gt; ma=\r\nntra increases those qualities, over time, in one&#39;s own mind and in \n&gt; one&#39;=\r\ns surroundings. If a lot of sadhakas with good concentration worship \n&gt; Cha=\r\nndi in this world, there may be a lot of violent outrage and fierce \n&gt; figh=\r\nt against adharma in this world. If a lot of sadhakas with good \n&gt; concentr=\r\nation worship Vishnu, there may be an upsurge of calm, \n&gt; self-assured and =\r\nconfident sattwa in the fight for establishing dharma. \n&gt; These energies ba=\r\nlance each other. World is probably in a transition \n&gt; phase right now and =\r\nworshippers of Chandi are needed. But, soon, we will \n&gt; need a lot more peo=\r\nple worshipping Vishnu.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, good sadhakas worshipping Ganesha =\r\nincrease the sense of \n&gt; stability and groundedness in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seco=\r\nnd: Anushtup is the metre with 8 syllables per line and 4 lines per \n&gt; vers=\r\ne. Whole Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is in anushtup metre. \n&gt; Traditionally=\r\n, one specific verse is said to be equivalent to reading \n&gt; all 1000 names:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; shrIrAma rAma rAmeti. rame rAme manorame.\n&gt; sahasra nAma tattulyaM. r=\r\nAma nAma vrAnane..\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, this verse means that chanting &quot;shrIrAma =\r\nrAma rAma&quot; mantra \n&gt; (known as Amrita mantra) is equivalent to chanting 100=\r\n0 names.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, don&#39;t take it as a shortcut. If one is lazy and unfo=\r\ncused, \n&gt; chanting this verse even 100 times may do nothing. First, engage =\r\nin some \n&gt; regular practices to remove laziness, instill discipline and sin=\r\ncerity, \n&gt; and get a state of mind where you can focus well on god. THEN th=\r\ne above \n&gt; 7-letter mantra can be as effective as 1000 names.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
