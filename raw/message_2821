They perform rituals and make offerings while harbouring\nsuch desires. Such tamasic and rajasic sentiments attract\nill-intentioned beings from the vital plane to the place of worship.\n\nTherefore she said that one should be cautious about which temples one\nvisits, especially if one is weak and susceptible to negative energies.\nAnd when one does visit, one should try one&#39;s hardest to do so with the\nspirit of complete surrender to *whatever* Divine presence is there (and\nwithout seeking to fulfil petty desires).\n\nSo it may be that there is a risk.\n\nBest regards,\n\nSamir\n\n\nOn 08/10/2009 17:54, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worship risky?
