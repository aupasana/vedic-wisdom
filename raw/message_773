My last question and a comment/questio=\r\nn if you \nhave a moment in your busy day.\n\nIs it always advisable to start =\r\nout with a Ganesh Mantra just to be \nsure that our prayers are actually acc=\r\nepted by the Lord? Is &quot;Om Gam \nGanapataye Namaha&quot; considered a Prasiddha ma=\r\nntra? Is &quot;Om Hrim Gam \nHrim Mahaganapataye Namaha&quot; also considered Prasiddh=\r\na? I have heard \nthat Hrim bija can be very detrimental to 7th house so not=\r\n sure about \nthe later mantra.\n\nMy following comment/question is meant in a=\r\nn purely inquisitve sense \nand not in a judgemental one. It always struck m=\r\ne as odd, that \npronunciation of Mantra can be very critical, especially wi=\r\nth mantra \nlike Gayatri. This makes me think we are merely tapping into som=\r\ne \nkind of power to be sure, but not God himself as why would God care \nabo=\r\nut things such as pronunciation/intonation? Same goes for \nHoma/Yagya and s=\r\no forth. Why the need for such elaborate things? I \nalso know some Kriya Yo=\r\nga practioners and it can be quite complex. \nWhy not something simple like =\r\nsitting and concentrating at third eye \ncenter? Does one really need to und=\r\nertake elaborate/ritualistic \nmeasures to &quot;reach&quot; God? I personally like th=\r\ne approach of Zen \nBuddhism or Surat Shabd Yoga. This is just my opinion an=\r\nd not meant \nto be construed as offensive or even abrasive in any manner, m=\r\ny \napologies if it does.\n\nThank you.\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Do not w=\r\norry. It is not \nuncommon in\n&gt; Tulasi maalas to have cracks.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have =\r\nheard best place to keep mala while doing Japa is near  the\n&gt; &gt; heart, at l=\r\neast always above navel, is that correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. Keeping the current med=\r\nitating bead of the maalaa close to the \nanaahata\n&gt; chakra is a good idea.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Mooladhara, svadhishthana and manipoora chakras are the bhur, \nbhuvar =\r\nand\n&gt; suvar lokas, which exist physically. Above navel are the lokas that \n=\r\ndo not\n&gt; exist physically and exist only spiritually. The goal of sadhana \n=\r\nis, if not\n&gt; to get moksha, to go to a higher spiritual loka. Keeping the b=\r\nead \nabove\n&gt; navel is a good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lastly, I distinctly notice feeli=\r\nngs of anger after doing Japa?I \nhave\n&gt; &gt; just started doing Japa as a reme=\r\ndy, is this anger residue some \nkind\n&gt; &gt; of by product of the purification =\r\nprocess? The mantra is a very\n&gt; &gt; common, Prasiddha Vishnu Mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Pos=\r\nsible. Certain prior vasanas and karamas need to be washed away \nor burned\n=\r\n&gt; in sadhana in order to progress. When a room is being swept by a \nbroom, =\r\nsome\n&gt; dirt may spill over at its door.

If this specific pre-occupation minimized many other \n(and\n&gt; &gt; worse)\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pre-occupations, it is not a bad thing at all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is like a =\r\nmonkey that keeps jumping from one place to another\n&gt; &gt; place being\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ti=\r\ned to a pole with a chain to limit its jumping. The monkey may\n&gt; &gt; still be=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jumping up and down, but the chain atleast *limits* its movement\n&gt; &gt; =\r\naround one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pole.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, if the monkey learns to stay in =\r\none place without\n&gt; &gt; jumping, it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; needs no chain or pole anymore. Chai=\r\nn was there in the first \nplace\n&gt; &gt; to limit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; its jumping.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Ea=\r\nch person is the best judge of where one is and what is\n&gt; &gt; appropriate for=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; oneself. We make progress by recognizing our weaknesses and\n&gt; &gt; addre=\r\nssing them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In addition, there are certain chakras in the tips of=\r\n fingers \nthat are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; directly connected to the brain. Objects like rudra=\r\nksha and \ntulasi\n&gt; &gt; beads can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stimulate those minor energy centers. T=\r\nhus, there is *some* use \nin the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; beginning.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Does Japa h=\r\nave to be done with a Mala?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Upto you. For most people, I recommen=\r\nd using a maalaa.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 1. What are the ramifications of crossing the=\r\n Meru bead?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; What use is it to know? Avoid it as much as you can. =\r\nIf you cross\n&gt; &gt; it, so be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Don&#39;t worry and move on. But, avoid cro=\r\nssing it again.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I know some scriptures say Japa done with Mala =\r\n(in my case \nVishnu\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mantra done with Tulsi Mala) is more effective t=\r\nhen japa done \nwithout\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mala.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Is this meant to be ta=\r\nken seriously?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is also given in a scripture that Rudraksha and=\r\n Tulasi maalaas\n&gt; &gt; can be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; used for chanting any mantra and they are m=\r\nany more times \npowerful than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; other maalaas. My suggestion is to pick =\r\nup either a Rudraksha \nmaalaa\n&gt; &gt; or a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Tulasi maalaa based on your tas=\r\nte and use it for *all* mantras.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I want to categorically state th=\r\nat using a Tulasi maalaa for \nShiva or a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Rudraksha maalaa for Vishnu w=\r\nill NOT do you any harm.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; 3. What should one concentrate when re=\r\nciting Japa for purpose \nof\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; remedial measures? The mantra, the devat=\r\na, one&#39;s goals?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Anything that works as an anchor to limit the min=\r\nd from straying\n&gt; &gt; away too\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much is useful. An image or visualization=\r\n of deity may work for \nsome.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Focussing on each sound and ups and down=\r\ns in intonation may work \nfor\n&gt; &gt; some.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The goal is to minimize other =\r\nthoughts. Thinking of one&#39;s goals \nwill\n&gt; &gt; usually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; make the mind stra=\r\ny away into unnecessary pre-occupations. It is\n&gt; &gt; better to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; focus on =\r\ndeity or mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma=\r\n&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday=\r\n, December 13, 2008 11:59 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Japa?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; This is my first post.
