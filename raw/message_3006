Vimalanda in 2nd part says that=\r\n in the begining we need to create deity with the help of our astral deity,=\r\n so for that i think i need to know the proper roop for the homam.\n\n2)if so=\r\nmebody could please explain what are these astral,subtle body & kaaran,stho=\r\nol sharir, they are used a lot.\n\n3)If in the beginning we see the deity fro=\r\nm our very own astral body, then how is this experience different from hall=\r\nucination, because we are not experiencing any which is something special. =\r\nWe are seeing which we are constantly forcing upon our mind.Had the deity b=\r\neen somewhere outside only then we were achieving something. Please clear m=\r\ny doubts on this. i hope my question is clear.\n\nRegards \nJitender\n\n\n\n\n"}}
