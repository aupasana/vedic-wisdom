In these times of Islamophobia, t=\r\nhey have been sidelined by the vociferous radical Sunni groups who claim to=\r\n be &#39;true&#39; Islam, and who look down upon all religions including Sufism.\n\nO=\r\nur conception of God is a perfect being, all loving and compassionate. This=\r\n is the reality according to all saints (Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist=\r\n) who directly experienced God/Truth.\n\nHow can this perfect being be blamed=\r\n for the stupidity of humans fighting each other?\n\nAllah is not to blame fo=\r\nr Muslims killing each other in His Name.\n\nVishnu and Shiva are not to blam=\r\ne for Vaishnavites and Shaivaites (their followers) despising and fighting =\r\neach other in India.\nKrishna cannot be blamed for the terrible atrocities c=\r\nommitted in the as a result of the caste system. \n\nThe lower human nature i=\r\ns responsible.\n\nThe need to feel superior is responsible. \n\n&quot;My house is be=\r\ntter than your house, my car/my country/my religion is better&quot;...it&#39;s all a=\r\nbout the &quot;my&quot; not about God. &quot;My&quot; God is better than your God, so I am bett=\r\ner than you&quot;...is the implied meaning. Fighting in the name of God is not a=\r\nbout God, but about &quot;me&quot;..it&#39;s all about pride and superiority.\n\nIt is true=\r\n that Islam today has a very dark side. Darker than other religions at the =\r\nmoment...though every religion has dark elements in its past. I&#39;ve been at =\r\nthe receiving end of some negativity from a couple of Muslim friends when I=\r\n was at university- they dropped me as a friend because I wasn&#39;t Muslim but=\r\n Hindu. It was hurtful at the time but I&#39;m over it. People are all on a pat=\r\nh of evolution. If I&#39;d been born in a Muslim family, I may have been condit=\r\nioned into thinking their way. This world is a play of God. All this is hap=\r\npening as per His wish. I actually feel sorry for people who fight in the N=\r\name of God.....what unnecessary stress and tension they create in their hea=\r\nds. \n\nSufis are a wonderful tolerant group. They are an example of the bhak=\r\nti tradition of India where they see themselves as the lover and God as the=\r\n Beloved. The bhakti tradition says you can build a relationship with God a=\r\ns a friend/parent/servant/lover....the Sufis follow the path of becoming tr=\r\nue lovers of God. Their methods of worship are banned in many Islamic count=\r\nries and they are not considered Muslim at all by the mainstream and treate=\r\nd very badly. But the mainstream are just missing out in the most beautiful=\r\n part of their tradition. \n\nThanks Narasimhaji for the kind comments.\n\nBest=\r\n wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;svarupa&quot; &lt;sva=\r\nrupa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; I just want to reply to this and you will not hear me =\r\nagain.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes there were some tolerant sufi saints, but what percentage o=\r\nf muslins are they?\n&gt; Do we respect something because 10% of its members ar=\r\ne tolerant?\n&gt; How much destruction and killing has islam brought?\n&gt; How muc=\r\nh killing and destroying did mahammad do himself to spead &quot;the right religi=\r\non&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; I have no problems with other traditions/religions/path because, =\r\nother then a few encounters here and there, they can coexist together. This=\r\n\n&gt; is not the case with islam. If you need examples, take a lot at how othe=\r\nr traditions/religions/paths are treated in any of the islamic countries.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Take care\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

Some even accepted and wor=\r\nshiped Hindu deities. Yet, when someone speaks of &quot;Allah&quot;, it elicits this =\r\nreaction!\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not want to comment on whether this reaction is correct=\r\n or incorrect. After all, everyone acts uniquely based on one&#39;s conditionin=\r\ng and cumulative life experiences. Moreover, I am not really a scholar on I=\r\nslam and am not familiar with various interpretations of Quran and other sc=\r\nriptures of Islam.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, all I want to say is that intolerance feeds in=\r\ntolerance and love feeds love. You react to someone&#39;s intolerance with furt=\r\nher intolerance and that will make them react to you with further intoleran=\r\nce. And so on. Unfortunately intolerance spreads much faster (like a wild f=\r\nire!) than does love.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna ji, nice composition!
