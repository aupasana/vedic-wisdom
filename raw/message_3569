Unlike Suratha who gets a boon related t=\r\no his natural\nabilities, the Vaishya does not get a boon to get his family =\r\nback or a\nboon to become the best merchant who is detached from the fruits =\r\nof his\nwork but rather he is given the boon of getting the knowledge which\n=\r\nleads to final emancipation.  Is the message simply here that we need to\nst=\r\nep away from a business oriented mind into a spiritual mindset?\n\nVeenu\n\n\n\n"}}
