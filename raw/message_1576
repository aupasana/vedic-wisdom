When we channe=\r\nl it properly, we fulfil our dharma successfully. When the fire is unchanne=\r\nled and beset with impurities, we waste energy and fail to fulfil our dharm=\r\na.\n \nFire in conjunction with sattwa guna generates knowledge (jnaana shakt=\r\ni). Fire in conjunction with rajo guna generates actions (kriyaa shakti). F=\r\nire in conjunction with tamo guna generates desires (ichchhaa shakti). We n=\r\need people who mainly have sattwa and also some rajas. Such people have cle=\r\nar thinking backed by correct knowledge and engage in fruitful actions. It =\r\nis more important to engage in a few fruitful actions than to engage in too=\r\n many mis-directed actions and be left with unfulfilled desires and frustra=\r\ntion, which is what happens when there is too much tamas and rajas. There a=\r\nre many self-styled &quot;Hindutva&quot; warriors today who fall in the latter catego=\r\nry. They yell from rooftops in shrill voices, but do not accomplish much. D=\r\no we need some more such people?\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhat Hindutva need=\r\ns today is a few detached Arjunas who destroy mighty armies without hatred =\r\nfor anyone in their heart. What Hindutva needs today is a few detached Vive=\r\nkanandas who inspire millions with their magnetic personality without any p=\r\nassion in their heart.\n \nAct like a passionate man, but have no passion in =\r\nyour heart. Fight unwaveringly, but have no hatred for anyone.\n \nIf one is =\r\nfighting a war with passion, frustration or hatred in one&#39;s heart, one will=\r\n only go so far and achieve only so much. What such a person achieves will =\r\nbe short-lived. If one first overcomes attractions and repulsions, has a st=\r\nable and unperturbed heart without passion and hatred and becomes a detache=\r\nd instrument of Nature engaging in spontaneous actions without any attachme=\r\nnt, one will achieve much more and what one achieves will be long-lived.\n \n=\r\nI am writing this to this group of people because my intuition tells me tha=\r\nt there are some on this group who have the potential to become such instru=\r\nments of Mother.\n \nDo some spiritual sadhana first and overcome the weaknes=\r\nses. Have a stable, unperturbed and equanimous heart. Then Nature will show=\r\n you the way.\n \n*        *        *\n \nCeturies ago, western invaders went a=\r\nbout their business with great dexterity and patience to affect the psyche =\r\nof Hindus, especially intelligentsia. Their slow, patient, dexterous and sy=\r\nstematic propaganda is bearing fruit even today. To undo their work, one ne=\r\neds to be equally dexterous and patient. This is not the work for hot-blood=\r\ned, angry and frustrated people. One needs to be cool-headed, smart and pat=\r\nient.\n \nAnother thing is that sanatana dharma is broken today. In pursuit o=\r\nf modern education, the cream of Indian intelligentsia stopped engaging in =\r\nour traditional knowledge. This brought a discontinuity in knowledge. We ha=\r\nve some faithful Hindus engaging in superstitious and/or purposeless practi=\r\nces. We have many priests who are corrupted by money and fame, don&#39;t do any=\r\n sadhana and don&#39;t have any spiritual strength. Many intelligent people eit=\r\nher dissociate themselves from religion or follow religion passively withou=\r\nt much faith and with some shame or misgivings. At the root of this is the =\r\nbroken knowledge and purposeless practices.\n \nAlso, we have many bad practi=\r\nces that afflict Hinduism due to Kali, which need to be gotten rid of. For =\r\nexample, caste system of today is so different from old days. The concept o=\r\nf caste mobility is gone now - one would start with father&#39;s caste, but get=\r\n a caste later on based on one&#39;s aptitude and attitude in old days. For exa=\r\nmple, Valmiki was a shudra by birth who lived by killing birds and he becam=\r\ne a brahmana and a brahmarshi later. Vishwamitra was a kshatriya by birth b=\r\nut became a brahmana and a brahmarshi later and even became one of saptarsh=\r\nis. If lower caste and untouchable Hindus feel aversion to Hinduism which i=\r\ns exploted by Christian missionaries who offer money and respect to convert=\r\n, some fault lies with Hinduism too. We need to reform casteism.\n \nThere ar=\r\ne many things that need to be done. At one level, some propaganda needs to =\r\nbe done on the greatness of Hinduism. This needs to be done with a cool, sc=\r\nholarly and patient attitude (as opposed to yelling in shrill voice from ro=\r\noftops like some Hindutva activists foolishly do). At another level, broken=\r\n links within Hinduism need to be rediscovered so that the knowledgebase of=\r\n our philosophy is correctly represented to sway the intelligentsia. While =\r\nother religions are based on &quot;faith&quot; in the words of a messiah, Hinduism ha=\r\ns a wide-ranging and sophisticated philosophy and methods that can enable a=\r\nnyone to become a messiah. However, the knowledge has become corrupted and =\r\nincomplete and some intelligent people are justified in not having faith. A=\r\nt yet another level, we need to reform some social and cultural aspects of =\r\nHindusm and undo some changes brought in by Kali.\n \nThere are many things t=\r\no do and this will take many decades of focused and concerted effort.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nPersonally, I have no doubt that the time of weakening (=\r\nor even fall) of certain faiths has come. In the next few decades, some fai=\r\nths will be weakened considerably and sanatana dharma will be strengthened.=\r\n However, this being Kali yuga, such a change will not be permanent.\n \nBest=\r\n regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam=\r\n\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3=\r\n): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.S=\r\nriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n \n--- On Tue, 3/31/09, Rahul Chaturvedi &lt;rahul@...=\r\n&gt;

That-if she received divine inspiration she would g=\r\no to Kandhamal.The first one of describing conversions as God&#39;s work is the=\r\n usual clich=E9 which comes handy to all those involved in conversion. Conv=\r\nersion is to Christianity what Jehad is to Islam. Sr Prema further explaine=\r\nd that, &#39;Every human being has the right to believe. Each person is born wi=\r\nth dignity. Religious conversion is God&#39;s work&#39;. The contradictions galore =\r\nwithin the two sentences are glaring. If every person has the right to beli=\r\neve then where is the need to initiate that person to something new and str=\r\nange and in something in which that person is not born in? Should one god b=\r\ne exorcised out of the person and another god be installed to uphold the di=\r\ngnity with which this person was born with?This is actually what conversion=\r\n is all about. Why this rupturing of the person from what he/she was .So wh=\r\nat Sr Prema really means is that every person has a right to be converted a=\r\nnd hence the right of the person to believe is conditioned  and restrictedt=\r\no only believing in the god in whom Sr Prema and her whole church believes =\r\nin. This is what Sr Prema articulated when she so naively asserted that eve=\r\nry person has a right to believe and every person is born with dignity. Tha=\r\nt this god is only 2000 years old and somehow seems to be always in the com=\r\npany of those who invade the land of others is another dimension which need=\r\ns a longer treatise.\n\n    If conversion is God&#39;s work then whose work is re=\r\n-conversion?  Sr Prema-the Superior General of the MoC and the whole armies=\r\n of Christian missionaries involved in conversion has failed this god miser=\r\nably-because their god has failed them. If conversion is God&#39;s work he seem=\r\ns to be rather slow and inefficient. The Catholic Church has the biggest ar=\r\nmy of nuns and priests and the Christian evangelical churches have their ow=\r\nn brand of evangelists, the Southern Baptists alone as a group has nearly 1=\r\n00,00 career missionaries in North India. Yet this God seem to be hardly ha=\r\nving an impact. This god also seem to be scared-does not direct their effor=\r\nts to the Islamic countries. Is He afraid of terrorists?It is the simple un=\r\narmed, poverty stricken tribals and passive Hindus that this God and his di=\r\nvine inspired missionaries  target at . And yet not so easy given the enorm=\r\nous funds that flow and the armies at the disposal of this god he had to gi=\r\nve divine\n    inspiration to a Christian agency to massacre an unarmed poor=\r\n swamiji whom he found a great hurdle to spread his kingdom.\n    Sr Prema h=\r\nas unwittingly exposed the bluff of the Congress and the UPA leaders. We ar=\r\ne told that conversion is not taking place. Conversion takes different form=\r\ns-globally, it is  disguised as a military coup, violence and very often a =\r\ndeception of service and development is the sheen given to this violent con=\r\nversion. Yes conversion is violence wrought on a person-to deprive the pers=\r\non of his/her dignity which according to Sr Prema every person is born with=\r\n-to tear the person off his affinity, his religious heritage and made him/h=\r\ner an alien is a psychological bleeding to death. Christianity and conversi=\r\non are two sides of the same coin. Where ever Christianity went it was bloo=\r\ndshed-destruction, and a hidden agenda of political power, economic aggrand=\r\nizement, and pauperization of the victims. In the words of the Kenyatta (th=\r\ne Kenyan freedom fighter) &#39;when the missionaries came they had the Bible an=\r\nd we had the land. They said, &#39;Let us pray,&#39; We\n    closed our eyes, when w=\r\ne opened them, they had our lands and we had the Bible&#39;. This is true not o=\r\nnly in Africa but all over the globe. Those countries which broke away from=\r\n the stranglehold of Vatican became progressive-like Canada, Australia, Eng=\r\nland but those colonized by the catholic powers like Spain, Portugal Mexico=\r\n, Argentina, Cuba, Italy are mired in military rule and church tyranny. Chr=\r\nistianity today likes to be seen as a peace loving, compassionate religion =\r\nof brotherhood. But far from it-the religion was born in blood and grew in =\r\nbloodshed. Economic and political powers are its hidden agenda covered with=\r\n service organizations, education institutions etc.\n    May be Sr Prema is =\r\ntoo na=EFve to understand and she as all nuns and priests are ignorant of c=\r\nhurch history. These nuns and priests are brainwashed into this service and=\r\n love of the poor mission.Many soon realize but then it is too late for the=\r\nm especially in India to be courageous to act and pull out. They become lik=\r\ne voices in the wilderness and the church is too powerful an organization t=\r\no fight against by ordinary innocent and truthful persons.\n    This brings =\r\nme to Sr Prema&#39;s pious wish-that she would visit Kandhamal if she receives =\r\n&#39;divine inspiration&#39; and she would definitely intervene. One wonder what in=\r\ntervention is she talking about-intervene for whom and with whom? Sr Prema =\r\nwould do a greater service if she visited the ex nun Jesme in Kerala and li=\r\nstened to her tale of sexual harassment within the convent-how she was betr=\r\nayed by her own and even had to submit herself to priests to be stripped na=\r\nked. This is nothing new. and not a singular case but happenings that have =\r\nbeen on for ages-these sexual escapades -including rape and murder have bee=\r\nn happenings within the confines of the convents and the church compound .O=\r\nnly when a nun is raped outside these confines then all hell breaks loose. =\r\nSr Prema could direct her divine inspired mission to empathize with Sr Jesm=\r\ny and many like her and intervene with the church authorities .Sr Prema the=\r\n Superior General of the MoC should be aware\n    that nuns are on contracep=\r\ntives, nuns have begotten children of bishops and priests-whole dioceses ha=\r\nve been sold in the USA to pay the compensation for the sexual violation on=\r\n alter boys by priests. A Jesuit province in the USA has declared itself in=\r\nsolvent because it cannot garner the huge funds to pay the compensation to =\r\nthe sexual victims by its perpetrators-the priests. Be it in India or in ot=\r\nher parts of the world all this pales into nothing-only Kandhamal occupies =\r\nand covers the whole vision of the pious Christians and Sr Prema is no exce=\r\nption.  I suggest that she first visit the Ashram of Swami Lakshmanada and =\r\nsoothe the terror stricken children in whose presence the 84 year Swamiji w=\r\nas brutally butchered. Three nuns who were with him were also killed. Will =\r\nSr Prema intervene with those murderers and see that justice is done? One l=\r\nast request Sr Prema and her MoC work for the poor she asaserts-then why sh=\r\nould the money meant for the  poor of\n    this country find its way to the =\r\nconfers of Rome? It is very difficult to divest conversion and money. Are t=\r\nhe accounts of the MoC being audited? If not why? Why should the lands and =\r\nthe church properties be exempted from tax and auditing? This is something =\r\nanti-national .Money cannot change its value simply because it is held in t=\r\nhe hands of a particular community-All monies must be accounted for. Is it =\r\nnot strange that those working in Minority Education institutions and drawi=\r\nng the UGC pay scales are Income tax assesses but the priests and the nuns =\r\nworking in the same institutions are exempted from paying Income tax. They =\r\ntoo draw the same salaries-if not more for less work-they too hold individu=\r\nal bank accounts and they too draw their pensions till their death-all from=\r\n the taxpayers monies. Why should they be exempted from paying the Income t=\r\nax? This is just one area to show that the workings of the poor of which Sr=\r\n Prema and all missionaries are\n    engaged and other service organizations=\r\n are a big money spinning business. A special vocabulary must be coded to u=\r\nnderstand the language of the Christians. Power is sugar coated and called =\r\nservice. Forgiveness is easily extended to those who hurt them-to show how =\r\ncompassionate they are. But they refuse to stop hurting others-they refuse =\r\nto stop dehumanizing the tribals and the poor. Why don&#39;t they leave the poo=\r\nr alone? If in spite of  the enormous funds which have flowed and are flowi=\r\nng  from abroad combined with  the government&#39;s Five Year Plans and a globa=\r\nlly  powerful God by  their side the missionaries are not able to diminish =\r\n poverty, to reduce hunger and assetlessness, then is it not time to pause =\r\ntake stock of  what is fundamentally wrong? Who is swindling whom? Why are =\r\nthe poor kept in poverty? Why should the poor continue to be poor, why shou=\r\nld backwardness be ever growing? Account for the work that has been so far =\r\ncarried on and stop the\n    pauperization and the plunder of this country a=\r\nnd its poor. Should we wait for Sr Prema and the likes of her for divine in=\r\nspiration to be just logical and sensible? \n    Tailpiece-\n    Even the Pop=\r\ne has lost his ability to pray that he has now assigned the Archbishop of G=\r\nawhati to script prayers for him! The Catholic Church needs prayer scripter=\r\ns- for it is unable to turn the hearts and souls of its followers to that s=\r\npirit within themselves and seek redemption and justice.\n    Dr Mrs Hilda R=\r\naja,\n    Vadodara\n\n\n\n          Get your own website and domain for just Rs.=\r\n1,999/year.* Go to http://in.business.yahoo.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    -- \n    &quot;Sree M=\r\naa Kali Kambal&#39;s Aasirvatham&#39;s&quot;\n            &quot;aum Sakthi Aum&quot;\n           &quot;Sw=\r\nami Satha Sivom&quot;\n             Renuka S sivom.\n              Harsha S sivom =\r\n.\n    www.swamisathasivom.org\n\n\n\n\n\n  -- \n  best regards,\n\n  Rahul Chaturved=\r\ni, MD\n  CEO\n  Total Care Rewards Group\n\n   Direct: (USA)  508 568 0070\n   V=\r\nM    :  708 375 0001  ( US and Canada 1- 888 400 8260) Extension - 100009\n =\r\n  Fax   :  708 375 0099\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0233_01C9B253.5358FBA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n Rahul and others,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;We all have some fire within us.=\r\n When we channel \nit&nbsp;properly, we fulfil our dharma successfully.

This needs \nto be done with a cool, scholarly&nbsp;and patient att=\r\nitude (as opposed to \nyelling in shrill voice from rooftops like some Hindu=\r\ntva activists foolishly \ndo). At another level, broken links within Hinduis=\r\nm need to be rediscovered so \nthat the knowledgebase of our philosophy is c=\r\norrectly represented to sway the \nintelligentsia. While other religions are=\r\n based on &quot;faith&quot; in the words of a \nmessiah, Hinduism has a wide-ranging a=\r\nnd sophisticated philosophy and methods \nthat can enable &lt;EM&gt;anyone &lt;/EM&gt;to=\r\n &lt;EM&gt;become&lt;/EM&gt; a messiah. However, the \nknowledge has become corrupted an=\r\nd incomplete and some intelligent people are \njustified in not having&nbsp;=\r\nfaith. At yet another level, we need to reform some \nsocial and cultural as=\r\npects of Hindusm and undo some changes brought in by \nKali.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;There are many things to do and this will take many \ndecades of fo=\r\ncused and concerted effort.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Personally, I have no doubt that the time of \nweakening (=\r\nor even fall)&nbsp;of certain faiths has come.

Th=\r\nat-if she received divine inspiration she would \n    go to Kandhamal.The fi=\r\nrst one of describing conversions as God=92s work is the \n    usual clich=\r\n=E9 which comes handy to all those involved in conversion. \n    Conversion =\r\nis to Christianity what Jehad is to Islam. Sr Prema further \n    explained =\r\nthat, =91Every human being has the right to believe. Each person is \n    bo=\r\nrn with dignity. Religious conversion is God=92s work=92. The contradiction=\r\ns \n    galore within the two sentences are glaring. If every person has the=\r\n right \n    to believe then where is the need to initiate that person to so=\r\nmething new \n    and strange and in something in which that person is not b=\r\norn in? Should one \n    god be exorcised out of the person and another god =\r\nbe installed to uphold \n    the dignity with which this person was born wit=\r\nh?This is actually what \n    conversion is all about. Why this rupturing of=\r\n the person from what he/she \n    was .So what Sr Prema really means is tha=\r\nt every person has a right to be \n    converted and hence the right of the =\r\nperson to believe is conditioned&nbsp; \n    and restrictedto only believing=\r\n in the god in whom Sr Prema and her whole \n    church believes in. This is=\r\n what Sr Prema articulated when she so naively \n    asserted that every per=\r\nson has a right to believe and every person is born \n    with dignity. That=\r\n this god is only 2000 years old and somehow seems to be \n    always in the=\r\n company of those who invade the land of others is another \n    dimension w=\r\nhich needs a longer treatise.&lt;BR&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10=\r\npt; FONT-FAMILY: tahoma,new york,times,serif&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:=\r\n 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: tahoma,new york,times,serif&quot;&gt;\n    &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SI=\r\nZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: arial,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;If \n    conversion is Go=\r\nd=92s work then whose work is re-conversion?&nbsp; Sr \n    Prema-the Superi=\r\nor General of the MoC and the whole armies of Christian \n    missionaries i=\r\nnvolved in conversion has failed this god miserably-because \n    their god =\r\nhas failed them. If conversion is God=92s work he seems to be rather \n    s=\r\nlow and inefficient. The Catholic Church has the biggest army of nuns and \n=\r\n    priests and the Christian evangelical churches have their own brand of =\r\n\n    evangelists, the Southern Baptists alone as a group has nearly 100,00 =\r\ncareer \n    missionaries in North India. Yet this God seem to be hardly hav=\r\ning an \n    impact. This god also seem to be scared-does not direct their e=\r\nfforts to the \n    Islamic countries. Is He afraid of terrorists?It is the =\r\nsimple unarmed, \n    poverty stricken tribals and passive Hindus that this =\r\nGod and his divine \n    inspired missionaries&nbsp; target at . And yet not=\r\n so easy given the \n    enormous funds that flow and the armies at the disp=\r\nosal of this god he had \n    to give divine&lt;BR&gt;inspiration to a Christian a=\r\ngency to massacre an unarmed \n    poor swamiji whom he found a great hurdle=\r\n to spread his kingdom.&lt;BR&gt;Sr Prema \n    has unwittingly exposed the bluff =\r\nof the Congress and the UPA leaders. We \n    are told that conversion is no=\r\nt taking place. Conversion takes different \n    forms-globally, it is&nbsp;=\r\n disguised as a military coup, violence and very \n    often a deception of =\r\nservice and development is the sheen given to this \n    violent conversion.=\r\n Yes conversion is violence wrought on a person-to \n    deprive the person =\r\nof his/her dignity which according to Sr Prema every \n    person is born wi=\r\nth-to tear the person off his affinity, his religious \n    heritage and mad=\r\ne him/her an alien is a psychological bleeding to death. \n    Christianity =\r\nand conversion are two sides of the same coin. Where ever \n    Christianity=\r\n went it was bloodshed-destruction, and a hidden agenda of \n    political p=\r\nower, economic aggrandizement, and pauperization of the victims. \n    In th=\r\ne words of the Kenyatta (the Kenyan freedom fighter) =91when the \n    missi=\r\nonaries came they had the Bible and we had the land. They said, =91Let us \n=\r\n    pray,=92 We&lt;BR&gt;closed our eyes, when we opened them, they had our lands=\r\n and we \n    had the Bible=92. This is true not only in Africa but all over=\r\n the globe. \n    Those countries which broke away from the stranglehold of =\r\nVatican became \n    progressive-like Canada, Australia, England but those c=\r\nolonized by the \n    catholic powers like Spain, Portugal Mexico, Argentina=\r\n, Cuba, Italy are \n    mired in military rule and church tyranny. Christian=\r\nity today likes to be \n    seen as a peace loving, compassionate religion o=\r\nf brotherhood. But far from \n    it-the religion was born in blood and grew=\r\n in bloodshed. Economic and \n    political powers are its hidden agenda cov=\r\nered with service organizations, \n    education institutions etc.&lt;BR&gt;May be=\r\n Sr Prema is too na=EFve to understand \n    and she as all nuns and priests=\r\n are ignorant of church history. These nuns \n    and priests are brainwashe=\r\nd into this service and love of the poor \n    mission.Many soon realize but=\r\n then it is too late for them especially in \n    India to be courageous to =\r\nact and pull out. They become like voices in the \n    wilderness and the ch=\r\nurch is too powerful an organization to fight against \n    by ordinary inno=\r\ncent and truthful persons.&lt;BR&gt;This brings me to Sr Prema=92s \n    pious wis=\r\nh-that she would visit Kandhamal if she receives =91divine \n    inspiration=\r\n=92 and she would definitely intervene. One wonder what \n    intervention i=\r\ns she talking about-intervene for whom and with whom? Sr Prema \n    would d=\r\no a greater service if she visited the ex nun Jesme in Kerala and \n    list=\r\nened to her tale of sexual harassment within the convent-how she was \n    b=\r\netrayed by her own and even had to submit herself to priests to be stripped=\r\n \n    naked. This is nothing new. and not a singular case but happenings th=\r\nat have \n    been on for ages-these sexual escapades =96including rape and =\r\nmurder have been \n    happenings within the confines of the convents and th=\r\ne church compound .Only \n    when a nun is raped outside these confines the=\r\nn all hell breaks loose. Sr \n    Prema could direct her divine inspired mis=\r\nsion to empathize with Sr Jesmy \n    and many like her and intervene with t=\r\nhe church authorities .Sr Prema the \n    Superior General of the MoC should=\r\n be aware&lt;BR&gt;that nuns are on \n    contraceptives, nuns have begotten child=\r\nren of bishops and priests-whole \n    dioceses have been sold in the USA to=\r\n pay the compensation for the sexual \n    violation on alter boys by priest=\r\ns. A Jesuit province in the USA has \n    declared itself insolvent because =\r\nit cannot garner the huge funds to pay the \n    compensation to the sexual =\r\nvictims by its perpetrators-the priests. Be it in \n    India or in other pa=\r\nrts of the world all this pales into nothing-only \n    Kandhamal occupies a=\r\nnd covers the whole vision of the pious Christians and \n    Sr Prema is no =\r\nexception.&nbsp; I suggest that she first visit the Ashram of \n    Swami La=\r\nkshmanada and soothe the terror stricken children in whose presence \n    th=\r\ne 84 year Swamiji was brutally butchered. Three nuns who were with him \n   =\r\n were also killed. Will Sr Prema intervene with those murderers and see tha=\r\nt \n    justice is done? One last request Sr Prema and her MoC work for the =\r\npoor she \n    asaserts-then why should the money meant for the&nbsp; poor o=\r\nf&lt;BR&gt;this \n    country find its way to the confers of Rome? It is very diff=\r\nicult to divest \n    conversion and money. Are the accounts of the MoC bein=\r\ng audited? If not why? \n    Why should the lands and the church properties =\r\nbe exempted from tax and \n    auditing? This is something anti-national .Mo=\r\nney cannot change its value \n    simply because it is held in the hands of =\r\na particular community-All monies \n    must be accounted for. Is it not str=\r\nange that those working in Minority \n    Education institutions and drawing=\r\n the UGC pay scales are Income tax \n    assesses but the priests and the nu=\r\nns working in the same institutions are \n    exempted from paying Income ta=\r\nx. They too draw the same salaries-if not more \n    for less work-they too =\r\nhold individual bank accounts and they too draw their \n    pensions till th=\r\neir death-all from the taxpayers monies. Why should they be \n    exempted f=\r\nrom paying the Income tax? This is just one area to show that the \n    work=\r\nings of the poor of which Sr Prema and all missionaries are&lt;BR&gt;engaged \n   =\r\n and other service organizations are a big money spinning business. A speci=\r\nal \n    vocabulary must be coded to understand the language of the Christia=\r\nns. Power \n    is sugar coated and called service. Forgiveness is easily ex=\r\ntended to those \n    who hurt them-to show how compassionate they are. But =\r\nthey refuse to stop \n    hurting others-they refuse to stop dehumanizing th=\r\ne tribals and the poor. \n    Why don=92t they leave the poor alone? If in s=\r\npite of&nbsp; the enormous funds \n    which have flowed and are flowing&nbs=\r\np; from abroad combined with&nbsp; the \n    government=92s Five Year Plans =\r\nand a globally&nbsp; powerful God by&nbsp; \n    their side the missionaries=\r\n are not able to diminish&nbsp; poverty, to \n    reduce hunger and assetles=\r\nsness, then is it not time to pause take stock \n    of&nbsp; what is fundam=\r\nentally wrong? Who is swindling whom? Why are the \n    poor kept in poverty=\r\n? Why should the poor continue to be poor, why should \n    backwardness be =\r\never growing? Account for the work that has been so far \n    carried on and=\r\n stop the&lt;BR&gt;pauperization and the plunder of this country and \n    its poo=\r\nr. Should we wait for Sr Prema and the likes of her for divine \n    inspira=\r\ntion to be just logical and sensible? &lt;BR&gt;Tailpiece-&lt;BR&gt;Even the Pope \n    =\r\nhas lost his ability to pray that he has now assigned the Archbishop of \n  =\r\n  Gawhati to script prayers for him! The Catholic Church needs prayer \n    =\r\nscripters- for it is unable to turn the hearts and souls of its followers t=\r\no \n    that spirit within themselves and seek redemption and justice.&lt;BR&gt;Dr=\r\n Mrs \n    Hilda Raja,&lt;BR&gt;Vadodara&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Get y=\r\nour own \n    website and domain for just Rs.1,999/year.* Go to &lt;A \n    href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://in.business.yahoo.com/&quot; target=3D_blank \n    rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://in.business.yahoo.com/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR \n    clear=3Dall&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-- &lt;BR&gt;&quot;Sree Maa Kali Kambal&#39;s Aasirvatham&#39;s&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp; &nbsp; \n    &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;aum Sakthi Aum&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &n=\r\nbsp;&quot;Swami Satha \n    Sivom&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Renuka S =\r\nsivom.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; \n    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Harsha S sivom .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A \n =\r\n   href=3D&quot;http://www.swamisathasivom.org&quot; target=3D_blank \n    rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;www.swamisathasivom.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR \n  clear=\r\n=3Dall&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-- &lt;BR&gt;best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rahul Chaturvedi, MD&lt;BR&gt;CEO&lt;BR&gt;Total=\r\n \n  Care Rewards Group&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Direct: (USA) &nbsp;508 568 0070&lt;BR&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;VM \n  &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp;708 375 0001 &nbsp;( US and Canada 1- 888 400=\r\n 8260) \n  Extension - 100009&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;Fax &nbsp; : &nbsp;708 375 \n0099&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0233_01C9B253.5358FBA0--\r\n\n"}}
