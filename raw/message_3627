It is not a full stop or period, but just a comma=\r\n. Let me tell a parable.\n\nA person loved one dress and wore it always. He n=\r\never removed the dress and kept the dress on him all the time and never con=\r\nsidered the possibility of changing into a different dress. The idea of rem=\r\noving that dress was unbearable to that person. He thought he should wear t=\r\nhat dress forever.\n\nThe dress became so dirty and torn that it was time to =\r\nchange it. A person looking extremely scary came up to the person oneday to=\r\n remove the dress. He removed the dress gently if one co-operated with him =\r\nand tore it apart violently if one fought back. After this scary person rem=\r\noved the old dress, another person came and gave new clothes. Some people b=\r\necame so afraid and ashamed when they lost old clothes that they ran away a=\r\nnd roamed around naked. If they did not become afraid or ashamed, they woul=\r\nd&#39;ve soon gotten new clothes and slowly started to enjoy them as well.\n\nThe=\r\n clothes in this parable are akin to the physical body we occupy. The perso=\r\nn looking extremely scary is Mahaakaala - personification of Death. Creator=\r\n is the person giving new clothes. New body taken in the next birth is the =\r\nnew clothes. Persons running away in fear or shame before new clothese are =\r\ngiven are like different kinds of spirits.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegarding your =\r\nvisualization of your father using reiki, please note that all visualizatio=\r\nns of the mind are imagery created by one&#39;s conscious and sub-conscious con=\r\nditionining. One&#39;s beliefs, desires, pride, frustrations etc shape the imag=\r\nery one&#39;s mind visualizes. One cannot assume it to be accurate. Also, there=\r\n is no reliable way to know if your prayers made any difference to the path=\r\n taken by your father after the cremation. The curiosity and the tendency t=\r\no speculate will naturally last for sometime, but the bottomline is that yo=\r\nu cannot really do much more than speculate.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nRegarding th=\r\ne hen/cock, it is associated with Koumaari, among the forms of Divine Mothe=\r\nr.

And =\r\nI have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. \n\n\n=\r\n\nOn the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling wit=\r\nh renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we =\r\nwere taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my min=\r\nd was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3=\r\n) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on =\r\na funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would=\r\n get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonder=\r\nful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so tha=\r\nt he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, =\r\nI had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly=\r\n reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a =\r\nfeat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experienci=\r\nng intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially\n in/around the=\r\n abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as eq=\r\nuanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon =\r\nafter, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, =\r\nand may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental ima=\r\ngery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a fri=\r\nend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I th=\r\nink of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went aw=\r\nay saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 thi=\r\nngs and in addition he bought some ghee. \n\n\n\nIt was my first time at a smas=\r\nhaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body at=\r\n such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon a=\r\nfter the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time), =\r\nI composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the friends/=\r\nrelatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I a=\r\nsked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I would =\r\nlike to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happens.=\r\n I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descriptio=\r\nn in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I think,=\r\n I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). \n\n\n=\r\n\nI closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the =\r\nGods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very firs=\r\nt attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to=\r\n focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued=\r\n watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remem=\r\nbered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest in=\r\ntention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the=\r\n truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some=\r\n &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39; . I=\r\n inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my=\r\n mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-=\r\nup, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am =\r\nnot a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done\n homam in =\r\nthe past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and s=\r\ntill believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nullification o=\r\nf my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Toda=\r\ny as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have,=\r\n has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his journey=\r\n ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please ac=\r\ncept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon=\r\n this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n\n\n\nAfter this mental d=\r\nialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thou=\r\nght about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantr=\r\na that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said=\r\n, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really ma=\r\ntter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Dur=\r\nga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupy=\r\ning my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate=\r\n that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the =\r\npurple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associati=\r\nng that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39;=\r\n (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa=\r\n which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally =\r\nthe thoughts about the desire and surrendering of\n my ignorance. I sought p=\r\nermission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I =\r\nalso remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be=\r\n kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but t=\r\no definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n\n\n\nI had a small ment=\r\nal dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to=\r\n do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n\n\n\nAnd then I=\r\n started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was=\r\n offering something in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerin=\r\ngs taking place - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the ma=\r\nntra for a while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at =\r\nthe end. Through out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi s=\r\ntanding on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her f=\r\neet alternatively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I=\r\n felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little di=\r\nstance in the direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten =\r\nminutes later, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had c=\r\nome and was sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find th=\r\ne dog. I was not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to thi=\r\nnk I would be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I\n continued. Few =\r\nminutes later, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to=\r\n see a shining black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but =\r\nbright red hood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smas=\r\nhaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending =\r\nfrom a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started =\r\njumping and moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to ju=\r\nmp inside the funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was =\r\nacting strange because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked =\r\nlike &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire h=\r\nitting the cement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few =\r\nminutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but=\r\n nevertheless I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I a=\r\nsked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So I\n continued the mental chan=\r\nting. \n\n\n\nAnd then my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to =\r\nleave. I waited for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the b=\r\nlack sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walke=\r\nd towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and ask=\r\ned her to accept my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was s=\r\nooooo hot that I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did M=\r\nanish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin o=\r\nf mine, shouted my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them=\r\n, and even though it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was h=\r\nappening, I was a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that =\r\nI had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of =\r\nthe packets in both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence=\r\n and requested her to accept this final offering and threw it at the funera=\r\nl\n pyre from a distance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simp=\r\nly do the needful and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and =\r\nRajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. \n\n\n\nWhen I w=\r\nas washing my hands and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now t=\r\nhere was a red tinge to the fire, which was not there before (could be beca=\r\nuse of black sesame seeds or jaggery??). \n\n\n\nOn the way back home and for t=\r\nhe entire evening, I felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that =\r\nI felt a sense of achievement, because the thought of what happened was not=\r\n strong in my mind. I had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;.=\r\n There was a certian stillness within my existence that evening. I watched =\r\nmy breath as much as I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;=\r\nwonder&#39;. The visualisations could have been a product of my own imagination=\r\n - but the silence was real. And this experience of silence was the most be=\r\nautiful thing. \n\n\n\nThe next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he h=\r\nad witnessed many fires, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat =\r\nspecial. I wondered if my brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love =\r\nfor our father.\n\n\n\nNow that it is few days since that incident, I have ques=\r\ntions like - is the hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;=\r\nmadly&#39; around the fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fact =\r\nthat in Hyd, people perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti=\r\n really grant some &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise m=\r\ny dad crawl and climb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-construct=\r\ned building the next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? \n\n\n\nI am =\r\nnot sure if these questions can be answered or if they should be answered a=\r\nt all, but based on the above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ =\r\nguidance/ teachings, I would be most appreciative.\n\n\n\nThank you PVR/Manish =\r\nand Rajarshi for the continued inspiration. \n\n\n\nAlso, apologies for the len=\r\ngth of the note.\n\n\n\nRegards\n\nSharad\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n=\r\n\n\r\n--0-578302294-1265230119=:95619\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am sorry to know your loss =\r\nand thank you for an account of your experiment and experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Manish keeps saying, death is not a terminal thing.

Perhaps the place you went to and you yourself have=\r\n some blessing of Koumaari.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot;=\r\n ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;br&gt;----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;=\r\nWed, 2/3/10, sharadsap &lt;i&gt;&lt;sharadsap@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nblockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid\n rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: =\r\n5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: sharadsap &lt;sharadsap@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;S=\r\nubject: [vedic-wisdom] Experience at a Smashaan Bhumi&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Wednesday, February 3, 2010, 6:19 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv2117267897&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n  =\r\n  &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Dear Members,&lt;br&gt;\nAfter a l=\r\not of deliberation, I decided to write this note to share an experience wit=\r\nh the members on this forum - hoping that doing so would elicit some feedba=\r\nck in the form of further guidance.  &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI am a student of Vipassana =\r\nand have been doing homam (mostly Agnihotra and very recently started a sim=\r\nple version of Durga Homam) &#39;almost&#39; regularly for a year now. And I have b=\r\neen reading the posts on this forum with much awe and interest. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nO=\r\nn the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after struggling with =\r\nrenal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. When we we=\r\nre taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, my mind =\r\nwas constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - 1/2/3) =\r\nwritten by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homam on a =\r\nfuneral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I would g=\r\net to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how wonderfu=\r\nl it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - so that =\r\nhe would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediately, I =\r\nhad an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I quickly r=\r\neminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do such a fe=\r\nat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started experiencing=\r\n intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially\n in/around the a=\r\nbdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations as equa=\r\nnimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. Soon af=\r\nter, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mind, an=\r\nd may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental image=\r\nry. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a frien=\r\nd, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when I thin=\r\nk of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he went away=\r\n saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2 thing=\r\ns and in addition he bought some ghee. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt was my first time at a =\r\nsmashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead bod=\r\ny at such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but so=\r\non after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset tim=\r\ne), I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the frie=\r\nnds/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana.=\r\n I asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I wo=\r\nuld like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happ=\r\nens. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descri=\r\nption in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I th=\r\nink, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):).=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandpar=\r\nents, the Gods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my=\r\n very first attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I =\r\nam used to focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I=\r\n continued watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enoug=\r\nh. I remembered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the=\r\n purest intention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and=\r\n found the truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumu=\r\nlates some &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangal=\r\nmayee&#39; . I inspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement=\r\n too in my mind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not wan=\r\nt to give-up, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth =\r\nMaa, I am not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done\n=\r\n homam in the past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have beli=\r\neved and still believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/ nulli=\r\nfication of my past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same s=\r\npeed. Today as well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind th=\r\nat I have, has this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and h=\r\nis journey ahead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so=\r\n please accept my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Ple=\r\nase pardon this son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAft=\r\ner this mental dialogue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (ev=\r\nen though I thought about Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the=\r\n ONLY Devi mantra that I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In=\r\n my mind, I said, ALL are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it shou=\r\nld not really matter, which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just v=\r\nisualise Maa Durga and instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, =\r\nand fully occupying my mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was try=\r\ning to co-relate that with the colour of gangrene which had developed in hi=\r\ns feet, but the purple was different, and immediately a thought sprung in m=\r\ny mind associating that colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;ske=\r\nletal jewellery&#39; (NOT trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is=\r\n the form of Maa which has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, re=\r\npeated mentally the thoughts about the desire and surrendering of\n my ignor=\r\nance. I sought permission from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning=\r\n the context. I also remember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and =\r\nI told Maa to be kind, and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me =\r\nto be fit, but to definetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nI had a small mental dialogue with my father, wherein I briefed him abo=\r\nut what I was going to do, and I seeked his permission, forgiveness and ble=\r\nssings. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd then I started my mantra chanting (with swaha) - and =\r\ntried visualising that I was offering something in the pyre. I could not ac=\r\ntually visualise any offerings taking place - but I still continued with th=\r\ne swaha at the end of the mantra for a while, and then switched to a mantra=\r\n-japam without the swaha at the end. Through out I was fully aware of the v=\r\nisualisation of Maa Chandi standing on my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would=\r\n visualise her lifting her feet alternatively, as if she was crushing somet=\r\nhing. A few minutes later, I felt the Devi removed a feet or a wooden log -=\r\n and threw it at a little distance in the direction which was opposite to m=\r\nine. I think about five/ten minutes later, I became a little curious and wa=\r\nnted to see if the dog had come and was sitting somewhere around. I opened =\r\nmy eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I was not disappointed, but I told mysel=\r\nf, it was silly of me to think I would be able to invite the deity, but nev=\r\nertheless I\n continued. Few minutes later, I heard some sound of wings flut=\r\ntering and opened my eyes to see a shining black hen (I think it was a roos=\r\nter, as it had a small, but bright red hood/crown). It had come from the pi=\r\nece of land next to the smashaan bhumi (either a graveyard or a temple - am=\r\n not sure) after descending from a 6ft boundary wall. It came close to the =\r\nburning funeral and started jumping and moving around the funeral. It seeme=\r\nd as if the hen wanted to jump inside the funeral and die. Another second i=\r\nt felt, perhaps the hen was acting strange because it was amused with the f=\r\nire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnus&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a =\r\nresult of the funeral fire hitting the cement roof of the funeral platform.=\r\n I watched the bird for few minutes, laughed at myself, thinking a black he=\r\nn came instead of a dog, but nevertheless I said I would continue until it =\r\nis time for us to leave. I asked my cousin and he said 30 more minutes. So =\r\nI\n continued the mental chanting. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd then my cousin signalled me=\r\n that it was time for everyone to leave. I waited for everyone to start wal=\r\nking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame seeds, jaggery and ghee in th=\r\ne plastic packet itself, and walked towards the funeral. I seeked forgivess=\r\n from Maa for my impudence and asked her to accept my offerings. I had offe=\r\nred only three times, and it was sooooo hot that I could not stand closer a=\r\nnd started wondering how far did Manish and Rajarshi sit to offer the samag=\r\nri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shouted my name from behind, and =\r\nasked me to hurry up and join them, and even though it was dark and he woul=\r\nd not have seen exactly what was happening, I was a little scared because I=\r\n did not want anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39; tendencies, I quickly step=\r\nped back, emptied the contents of the packets in both my hands, apologised =\r\nto the Devi again for my impudence and requested her to accept this final o=\r\nffering and threw it at the funeral\n pyre from a distance. I thanked her on=\r\nce again and requested her to simply do the needful and then thanked everyo=\r\nne (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish/ PVR) and quickly walked =\r\nand joined the group. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen I was washing my hands and feet at the=\r\n well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tinge to the fire, w=\r\nhich was not there before (could be because of black sesame seeds or jagger=\r\ny??). &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOn the way back home and for the entire evening, I felt ver=\r\ny very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of achievement=\r\n, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. I had nei=\r\nther forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian stillnes=\r\ns within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as I could.=\r\n No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visualisations c=\r\nould have been a product of my own imagination - but the silence was real. =\r\nAnd this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe =\r\nnext day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fires=\r\n, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if =\r\nmy brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nNow that it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is t=\r\nhe hen too, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the=\r\n fire? Is there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, peop=\r\nle perform hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant som=\r\ne &#39;punya&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and c=\r\nlimb (as opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the n=\r\next day when I was channeling some reiki to him? &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI am not sure if=\r\n these questions can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but =\r\nbased on the above experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/ guidance/ t=\r\neachings, I would be most appreciative.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThank you PVR/Manish and R=\r\najarshi for the continued inspiration. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAlso, apologies for the le=\r\nngth of the note.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegards&lt;br&gt;\nSharad&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n   =\r\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-578302294-1265230119=:95619--\r\n\n"}}
