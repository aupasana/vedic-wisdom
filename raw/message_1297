This is a fantastic movement, where=\r\n now they have \ndone research on homan etc and the effects on the environme=\r\nnt and \nbody.\n\nIn Maharastra, followers of dattatreya had a simple agnihotr=\r\na process\nof using cow dunk and ghee and cotton bud.

The first Homa i did was=\r\n of &#39;108 MahaMrutunjaya Mantra&#39;. \nThe \n&gt; information and propagation came f=\r\nrom &#39;Art of Living&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is intresting Coincidence to note here which i=\r\n realised \nyesterday:\n&gt; \n&gt; MAHA KAALI gave Darshan to Manishji on 3rd March=\r\n 2006 and \nInstructed \n&gt; him to start Homam movement. chain of events happe=\r\nned in that line \n&gt; and Narasimha (My Guru) took the task of propagating it=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now consider this - Sri Sri Ravishankar also started propagating \n&gt; =\r\nHomam on Daily basis (15 minutes Agnihotra Homa, MahaMrutunjay Homa \n&gt; etc.=\r\n.) around the same time. AOL came out with a small book for \n&gt; doing Homam =\r\neveryday, they started supplying Homa Kundam and Cow-\n&gt; dung blocks for fir=\r\ne rituals. I Purchased the Homa Kundam and \n&gt; CowDung Slices from them when=\r\n i was in Mumbai and did my couple of \n&gt; Homam for MahaMrutunjaya Mantra. A=\r\nOL has a giant numbers of \n&gt; followers all over the world and its obvious t=\r\nhat many people are \n&gt; doing Regulay Homam (As per AOL&#39;s way).\n&gt; \n&gt; around =\r\nthe same time Narasimha came out with the first Manual and \n&gt; that was Maha=\r\nGanapati Homa.\n&gt; \n&gt; This tells me that, Homam is NOT without reasons. Some =\r\ndivine plan \n&gt; is strongly behind this movement which is evident by activit=\r\nies of  \n&gt; Manish & Narasimha, Ravishankar, Shri Maa and others who have \n&gt;=\r\n started it on regular basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; This were my thoughts. i suddenly realis=\r\ned a Yesterday the \n&gt; coincidence mentioned above and thought it proper to =\r\nput in front \nof \n&gt; all the list.\n&gt;   \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Someone =\r\nsent me a few snippets \n&gt; from an \n&gt; &gt; interview posted on her website. Ple=\r\nase see below.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is interesting that she considers Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa as \n&gt; her guru. It \n&gt; &gt; is interesting that Ramakrishna told her =\r\nshe had to &quot;do fire \n&gt; ceremonies and \n&gt; &gt; show what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that=\r\n time the whole world will be \n&gt; peace&quot;. This \n&gt; &gt; is similar to what my gu=\r\nru was told by Divine Mother when she \n&gt; appeared to \n&gt; &gt; him during Shata =\r\nChandi homam at Chennai.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; She told him that many people are and wil=\r\nl be born who will \n&gt; perform a short \n&gt; &gt; fire ritual on a regular basis, =\r\nestablish sanatana dharma and \n&gt; peace in the \n&gt; &gt; world and also make quic=\r\nk spiritual progress individually in that \n&gt; process. \n&gt; &gt; Shree Maa&#39;s stat=\r\nement about what Ramakrishna told her is along \n&gt; similar \n&gt; &gt; lines.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; My guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular \n&gt; Chandi=\r\n homam \n&gt; &gt; should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is \n=\r\ndone \n&gt; 3 times a \n&gt; &gt; day. These places do not need to be near any temples=\r\n or famous \n&gt; places and \n&gt; &gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elabo=\r\nrate. For example, \n&gt; there is no \n&gt; &gt; need to offer silk sarees etc in fir=\r\ne. A simple ritual with bare \n&gt; minimum \n&gt; &gt; offerings is enough, but it ne=\r\neds to be performed 3 times \n&gt; everyday. When a \n&gt; &gt; few such centres are e=\r\nstablished, it will apparently lead to a \n&gt; chain of \n&gt; &gt; events that will =\r\nhelp re-establish sanatana dharma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though not 3 times a day, these=\r\n people have done a Chandi homam \n&gt; everyday for \n&gt; &gt; 3 years in the same p=\r\nlace and finished 1000 such homas. That is \n&gt; fantastic! \n&gt; &gt; It is the sad=\r\nhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and \n&gt; brings \n&gt; &gt; deities =\r\nto a place. While several ancient temples are without any \n&gt; divine \n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\nesence these days, new places of divine presence may be created \n&gt; by pure =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the \n&gt; wo=\r\nrld.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homa=\r\nm \n&gt; during which \n&gt; &gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on =\r\nspreading \n&gt; homam was \n&gt; &gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39;s birth anniversary and th=\r\ne time of sankalpa \n&gt; was within \n&gt; &gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi P=\r\nravesha time of the birth \n&gt; anniversary. \n&gt; &gt; All of this was a coincidenc=\r\ne and we were unaware of this \n&gt; significance when \n&gt; &gt; we decided the muhu=\r\nrta. It is interesting to know that \nRamakrishna \n&gt; did \n&gt; &gt; mention fire c=\r\neremonies specifically to somebody and that his \n&gt; words are \n&gt; &gt; similar t=\r\no the words of Mother.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Master, has a=\r\n small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is the very inter=\r\nesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pasted for your benefit), from=\r\n an interview found here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonomy_menu=\r\n/54/86\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was tellin=\r\ng, &quot;You have to go \n&gt; now for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our country, and all other country, you=\r\n have to go do fire \n&gt; ceremonies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and show what is truth, what is dig=\r\nnity, and at that time the \n&gt; whole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/sni=\r\np&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American=\r\n \n&gt; descent),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that same page describes his background, how he met her=\r\n and all \n&gt; that;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;s=\r\nnip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughout Middle Asia was arduous \na=\r\nt \n&gt; best,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he had traveled an unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where=\r\n he \n&gt; studied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with a number of gurus, coming to embrace the worship =\r\nof Chandi \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary =\r\nsystem of \n&gt; worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and meditation, while undertaking great austerit=\r\nies in the \n&gt; process.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chan=\r\ndi Yagya, a three year fire \n&gt; ceremony\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and worship of the Goddess, w=\r\nithout setting foot outside from \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; humble temple grounds they esta=\r\nblished in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
