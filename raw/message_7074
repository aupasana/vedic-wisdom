On=\r\ne may have a Lombarghini in garage and not drive it \nwhile you are (any any=\r\nbody is) watching.&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\nI have a different way of looking at it. Siddha=\r\n is one who has siddhis, those \nwhich appear when one is able to choose a s=\r\nhakti near sahashrar, and/or bring \nthe kundalini back to lower chakras aft=\r\ner having spend sufficient time in \nNirvikalpa, thus gaining some mastery o=\r\nver the world of duality.\n=C2=A0\nIf I have a friend who has a cow at home w=\r\nhich no one has seen, which is not \nknow by others to have produced any mil=\r\nk ever, never seen my friend buying grass \nfor the cow, and my friend does =\r\nnot even speak of a cow to the best of my \nknowledge,=C2=A0does the cow exi=\r\nst? \n\n=C2=A0\nA siddha is one who has siddhis. (not just any siddhis, but on=\r\nes that come as a \nbyproduct of a state).=C2=A0If he/she chooses to stay in=\r\n society, will someday or the \nother manifest externally his ability, consc=\r\niously or unconsciously. Not because \nhe wants to, but because that is a na=\r\ntural state of his being. If I keep a tiger \nat home, someday it will roar.=\r\n Not because it wants to display some magic, but \nthat is what happens natu=\r\nrally. \n\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;But that does NOT liberate one. One may get stuck for a l=\r\nong time.&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\nWhat is liberation? Are Rishis, the nine Naths (nav-nath=\r\ns)=C2=A0liberated?=C2=A0 Is Lord \nShiva &#39;stuck&#39; or liberated? \n\n=C2=A0\nThis=\r\n is not like acquiring some ability at some chakra and the kundalini gettin=\r\ng \nstuck there and not rising any more. We are talking of a state where the=\r\n \nindividual has already experienced Nirvikalpa samadhi=C2=A0for sufficient=\r\n time and \nthen come back from there, on being &quot;pulled by a higher force&quot; f=\r\nor some specific \npurpose of Nature. This is a very=C2=A0rare occurance. If=\r\n a person is able to take \nhis kundalini shakti into the three hidden chakr=\r\nas defined in books of \nhatha-yoga as well as Aghora 2,=C2=A0beyond the sah=\r\nashrar,=C2=A0and reach=C2=A0that \nplace=C2=A0called=C2=A0&quot;Golaka&quot;, is that=\r\n=C2=A0being &#39;stuck&#39;? \n\n=C2=A0\nIf you think that is still being &#39;stuck&#39;, all=\r\n I can say if we have an entirely \ndifferent way of understanding the same =\r\nreality\n=C2=A0\nA Siddha is a different phenomenon altogether. He is stuck -=\r\n if at all that word \nhas to be used -=C2=A0to the extent that he is not pu=\r\nlled into a more refined orbit \nand becomes a Nath or eventually a Rishi. B=\r\nut is he/she really stuck because he \nhas not merged his/her existence into=\r\n the infinite? I disagree. That is easy for \na siddha to do. Infact once a =\r\nperson experiences Nirvikalpa Samadhi \nsufficiently, he/she will 9 out of 1=\r\n0 times merge into the infinite and cease to \nexist. It is that 1 out of 10=\r\n who may=C2=A0keep an individual existence and yet \nremain acutely realized=\r\n=C2=A0of the universal reality.=C2=A0This happens only when Nature \nhas a j=\r\nob for that soul. That is when the Siddha/Nath/Rishis emerges.\n=C2=A0\nFor a=\r\n Siddha or a Nath, merging back into the infinite is not difficult.=C2=A0Bu=\r\nt \ntheir play is to=C2=A0stay in their orbits, function as Nature (often hi=\r\ngher \nbeings)=C2=A0wants them, and if needed, go to more rarified levels of=\r\n consciousness \nwithout ceasing their individual existence. \n\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;What=\r\n is sahaja samadhi where one is working through a body without any \nidentif=\r\nication with it, where one is aware of the sense objects perceived by \none&#39;=\r\ns senses and interacts with them as though they were external to one, while=\r\n \nfully aware at the same time that they are actually within one and not ex=\r\nternal \nto one? Where do you think Kundalini will be when one is in this st=\r\nate?&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\nSiddhas, Nath, Rishis are already in Sahaja Samadhi, but in d=\r\neeper and deeper \nrealms of the orbit. Nearing the infinite and yet not mer=\r\nging into it.=C2=A0All this \nhappens post realization of Nirvikalpa Samadhi=\r\n for *sufficient periods* of time. \n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0&lt;&lt;Is it possible that one=\r\n who did not identify with any petal in sahasrara and \nfinally reached this=\r\n state may not have any higher siddhis a siddha may have? \nBut is he inferi=\r\nor or superior?&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\nThere are three ways, they say, in which this stat=\r\ne is possible. Choose a petal \nnear the shahasrar, bring kundalini back to =\r\nthe lower chakras (which allows \nmastery over these elements), (maybe these=\r\n two are related, I don&#39;t know) and/or \nenter the &quot;rare/hidden&quot; chakras lea=\r\nding to the state called=C2=A0Goloka. The precise \ndynamics of these super-=\r\nhigh states of being are never defined in exact depth. \nAghora 2, chapter o=\r\nn immortals, explains reasonably.\n=C2=A0\nMy main=C2=A0argument remains that=\r\n if a being is able to do this, and chooses to stay \nin society for suffici=\r\nent time, invariably=C2=A0people around him/her WILL \npercieve=C2=A0some su=\r\npernatural ability, not because he/she is on a display spree, \nbut because =\r\nit comes naturally to him/her state of being. \n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt; Even if Vi=\r\nmalananda is perfectly pure, if a reader is not, it will corrupt \nthe under=\r\nstanding.

In which case one=\r\n may wonder what is the use of this \nconversation anyway.\n=C2=A0\nb) Some of=\r\n what the=C2=A0Aghora books mention are very clear, and simple English. It =\r\n\ncannot be interpreted in any other way IMO.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;though 2pwr16 =\r\nis a huge exaggeration.&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\nOf course. A very wild one. -:D\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt; =\r\n\nWith no prejudice or malice, I simply think that the knowledge in those bo=\r\noks \ncan be balanced by some literature on the other extreme.&gt;&gt;\n\nAgreed.=C2=\r\n=A0They will complement each other, they won&#39;t contradict. \n\n&lt;&lt;The issues o=\r\nf what siddhis are, how they come, whether one should actively \npursue them=\r\n, IS an important one.&gt;&gt;\n\nYes, siddhis=C2=A0are not be pursued. For any nor=\r\nmal=C2=A0sadhaka, the aim is to awaken \nKundalini shakti and eventually, so=\r\nme day, some lifetime, go to the state of \nNirvikalpa. Till then, it is bes=\r\nt never to crave, want, desire or work \nspecifically=C2=A0for a super-natur=\r\nal ability. Else one can get stuck.\n\nBut the Siddhi of a true=C2=A0Siddha h=\r\nowever=C2=A0is an entirely different thing.=C2=A0He has \nalready reached Ni=\r\nrvikalpa Samadhi and stayed in that state for sufficient \nperiod of time. H=\r\nis understanding of reality is permanently altered.=C2=A0His \nmotivations a=\r\nre different. He is a instrument of higher purpose.\n\nIf I compare the chanc=\r\nes of a sadhaka reaching the state of Nirvikalpa to the \nchances of a begga=\r\nr in India reaching White House, the chances of a sadhaka \nbecoming a true =\r\nSiddha is similar to the chances of a begger reaching the moon! \nThat remot=\r\ne. So yes, for all practical purposes one need not bother about any \nsupern=\r\natural ability. \n\n\n&lt;&lt; \n(4) For the purpose of debate, I amplified our disag=\r\nreement. :-) The \ndisagreement between us is actually very subtle.

But even they=\r\n arise from Aadyaa (Initial \nOne), i.e. the shakti of Supreme Cosmic Being.=\r\n When Supreme Cosmic Being and His \nShakti arise from undivided pure consci=\r\nousness, so many desires/thoughts arise \nin them. Saptarshis who come from =\r\nthem implement those desires. They engage in a \nplay by creating many unive=\r\nrses, many Brahmas, many Vishnus, many Shivas, many \nIndras etc and all tha=\r\nt is a reaction to the desire that was in their \nconsciousness, inherited f=\r\nrom the supreme being from whom they just arose, at \ntime minus infinity.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nYoga Vaasishtham gives many examples of nesting of consciousness and=\r\n how desires \nin one level of nesting impact the next level. That principle=\r\n applies here.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline is that everything is a reaction to some a=\r\nction. The fruits we are \nreceiving now are reactions to what we did as ind=\r\nividual beings with ego. These \nbeings may have come from many levels of ne=\r\nsting. We want to stop desiring \nthings, be done with the fruits, trace bac=\r\nk each level of nesting, and merge in \nthe supreme cosmic being finally.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhether you define siddhi as any supernormal=\r\n ability OR a truly special ability \none gets by latching on to one of the =\r\npetals of Sahasrara chakra, the bottomline \nis that you cannot judge who ha=\r\ns which siddhi by external observation.

One uses them if and \nwhen a situation warrants it naturally. If Vivek=\r\nananda or someone is not \nrecorded to have externally demonstrated a higher=\r\n siddhi, you cannot conclude he \ndid not have any.

That is wh=\r\ny we used terms like mantra-siddhi \n(realizing a mantra), or some other app=\r\narently miraculous/supernatural ability. \nAnd the word siddha is often used=\r\n to describe someone who has some such ability. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThis definition o=\r\nf a Siddha is incorrect. It is a corruption which has entered \nour thought-=\r\nprocess over centuries, just like every other spiritual person who \nuses an=\r\n epithet Rishi is not really a Rishi. \n\n=C2=A0 \nSo who is a Siddha really? =\r\nOne who has acquired some miraculous ability? Nope. \nTechnically a Siddha i=\r\ns one who has taken his awareness (Kundalini) to the \nSahashrar Chakra, thu=\r\ns experiencing Nirvikalpa, and THEN bringing the awareness \nback to the low=\r\ner chakras. In this process, he often acquires *degrees of \nmastery* over t=\r\nhe five elements of the chakras. That is a true Siddha. Aghora \npart 2 very=\r\n clearly defines, (same is also hinted at in some other books too), \nthis i=\r\nn much details. There is absolutely no scope of ambiguity here, unless one =\r\n\nrefuses to accept the book as valid (fine by me). Like it says, what is th=\r\ne \ndifference between a gyani and a vigyani? A gyani experiences the state =\r\nof \nNirvikalpa and realizes &quot;All is Brahman&quot;. But it is one thing to realiz=\r\ne &quot;all is \nbrahman&quot;, it is another thing to acquire some of the shaktis of =\r\nBrahman. \n\n=C2=A0 \nF or example, consider a glass of water and an ocean. Bo=\r\nth of them have the same \nchemical compostion (H2O). Realizing this is real=\r\nizing &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. But an \nocean can sustain and create a Tsunami, a g=\r\nlass of water cannot, even if it \nwants to. Of course it may often never ha=\r\nve a desire to do so in the first \nplace! However that is the difference, t=\r\nechnically, between a gyani and a \nvi-gyani. And the whole process of a Sid=\r\ndha and higher starts ONLY AFTER someone \nis able to bring the Kundalini ba=\r\nck from Sahashra chakra to the lower chakras \nagain. Needless to say, for m=\r\nost of us ordinary people, even getting a Kundalini \nto awaken is a big dea=\r\nl, taking it to Shahashrar is already too hi fi and may \ntake lifetimes, br=\r\ninging is back is impossible/unthinkable totally. \n\n=C2=A0 \nWhat happens wh=\r\nen a person becomes a Siddha by the parameter described above? It \nis impos=\r\nsible to imagine. He/she operates from a plane of reference so different \nt=\r\nhat ordinary folks just cannot fathom. Infact, most of us can&#39;t even fathom=\r\n \nwhat samadhi feels like until experienced, what to speak of siddha-hood. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n__________________________________________ \n=C2=A0 \nA Trilanga Sw=\r\nami did tri-khanda yogas, cuts his limbs, puts them into fire and \neventual=\r\nly the limbs regenerate. Even Sai Baba did a similar thing. Is this a \nsidd=\r\nhi (miraculous ability) or a sadhana? To us average folks, anything out of =\r\n\nthe ordinary seems miraculous. The internet itself would appear \nsupernatu=\r\nral/miraculous a few centuries ago! \n\n=C2=A0 \nTherefore, one who reaches a =\r\nstate of Siddha-hood, will automatically produce \nexternal effects which ap=\r\npear miraculous to ordinary people. Not like he/she is \nspecifically trying=\r\n for it, but it is a byproduct of a totally different \ninternal reference f=\r\nrame. Hence the crucial difference between a &quot;gyani&quot; and a \n&quot;vigyani&quot;. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nTo give an example from physics, if you could move at speeds close =\r\nto that of \nlight, you will see things elongating, time becoming slower, yo=\r\nu will age less, \netc etc. If you could move at speeds higher than that of =\r\nlight, you will observe \neffects of an action even before the action happen=\r\ns.=C2=A0 A supremely altered \nreference frame creates external effects whic=\r\nh are extraordinary and appear \nmiraculous to observers who are in a differ=\r\nent reference frame. This is the \nreality of the world. No amount of philos=\r\nophy can change this. \n\n=C2=A0 \n___________________________________________=\r\n_____________ \n=C2=A0 \nEvery spiritual book has a point of view and an audi=\r\nence. Same with Aghora. One \nmay like it or one may not like it. But there =\r\nis zero scope of saying \nVimalananda knew something else and book creates a=\r\n different impression etc etc. \nNothing of that sort. The chapter on Immort=\r\nals in book 2 is very, very clear and \nvery direct. It is not possible to i=\r\nnterpret it any other way. \n\n=C2=A0 \nOur scriptures have plenty of stories =\r\nof miraculous things done by and \nassociated with Rishis. Did they have a d=\r\nesire from past lives? Which past life, \nwhen Rishis are eternal? The desir=\r\ne from past-life can explain why a sadhaka who \nhas not yet experienced sta=\r\nte of Brahman (nirvikalpa), striving for and \nattaining xyz supernatural ab=\r\nility, but it cannot explain the external, \nmiraculous occurances which acc=\r\nompany a being who has attain siddha-hood or \nbeyond (Rishis). To me, it is=\r\n a natural byproduct of their vastly different \ninternal state of being. No=\r\nt something they may have strived for, but something \nthat accompanies and =\r\nmanifests externally corresponding to their internal \nmastery over the elem=\r\nents. \n\n=C2=A0 \n-Regards \n=C2=A0Rajarshi \n=C2=A0 \nBazeecha-e-atfal hain dun=\r\niya mere aage. \nHota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage \n=C2=A0 \nEk khel hai=\r\nn aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek \nEk baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage. \n\n\n=\r\n\n___________________________________\n\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter.=\r\nnet&gt; \nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Thu, 4 August, 2011 1:13:01 A=\r\nM \nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] One more key point (Re: On Siddhis & Spiritual P=\r\nrogress) \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste, \n=C2=A0 \nAn interesting point came up in a pri=\r\nvate exchange with a couple of folks and I \nwill write it down for the bene=\r\nfit of others. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nIt is not like &quot;you get =\r\nso & so siddhi when you reach so & so level&quot;. \n=C2=A0 \nSiddhis come because=\r\n one DESIRED them in this or a PREVIOUS life.

Such blanket statements are incorrect \n&gt; and gloss over nuances and crea=\r\nte a totally wrong picture. \n=C2=A0 \nWhat I said is not a &quot;blanket statemen=\r\nt&quot;, but an explicit teaching of Vasishtha \nto Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It =\r\nis also absolutely consistent with Upanishadic \nlearning. \n\n=C2=A0 \nYou tal=\r\nk about taking the words of a great instead of speculating. In fact, did \nV=\r\nimalananda *explicitly* write that Ramakrishna is only a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; and =\r\nnot \na siddha or a natha or a rishi, that Vivekananda is not a rishi or nat=\r\nha or \nsiddha or paramahamsa, and so on? In my case, my statement above is =\r\nexplicitly \nand unambiguously stated by Vasishtha. By answering Vivekananda=\r\n&#39;s question &quot;will \nsiddhis help me in god realization&quot; in the negative, Ram=\r\nakrishna also affirmed \nthis teaching of Vasishtha. Krishna also essentiall=\r\ny refers to the same thing in \nBhagavad Gita when he talks about seeking sm=\r\nall things from demigods vs seeking \n&quot;me&quot; (Self). Vaishtha&#39;s words, however=\r\n, are the clearest and most unambiguous. \n\n=C2=A0 \nYoga Vaasishtham was tau=\r\nght by Vasishtha to Lord Rama in the presence of \nVishwamitra and other gre=\r\nat sages and recorded by Valmiki. It is the highest \nwatermark of spiritual=\r\n knowledge. \n\n=C2=A0 \nAghora series is nice, but can give wrong notions to =\r\nsome who may tend to be \nfascinated by external miracles. I have no doubt t=\r\nhat Vimalananda had no \nconfusions himself, but some people reading those b=\r\nooks can form misconceptions \n(though it is still ok if that makes them do =\r\nsadhana. The only problem is if \nthey start doing the bad karma of making n=\r\negative judgments on greats thinking \nthey are blindly following Vimalanand=\r\na). It is a good idea to balance the \nperspective with some Vedantic unders=\r\ntanding such as Yoga Vasishtham or Bhagavad \nGita. \n\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Infact it al=\r\nso violates a point which you yourself made in an earlier mail. The \n&gt;\n&gt; ex=\r\nternal is connected to the internal. Some siddhis are not possible unless o=\r\nne \n&gt;\n&gt; attains a very rarified level of realization. And they manifest ext=\r\nernally. \n=C2=A0 \nYes, some external siddhis are possible only at a very ra=\r\nrefied level of \nrealization. But some with the same or higher level of rea=\r\nlization may not \npossess the same external siddhi. Thus external miracles =\r\ncannot be used as \nmeasures of one&#39;s level. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThis is like the anal=\r\nogy I gave of collecting fruits from the trees on the side \nof the road to =\r\nthe hilltop. Some keep tavelling on the road and accept only \nthose fruits =\r\nthat land in their lap by themselves. Some get distracted from the \njourney=\r\n and pursue the fruits actively. Collecting fruits is neither necessary \nno=\r\nr sufficient for reaching the top. Though having a fruit that is available =\r\n\nonly at a very high altitude shows that one has reached great altitude, it=\r\n \ncannot be used as a measure of one&#39;s progress, for someone may have climb=\r\ned \ngreater heights without collecting that (or any) fruit. \n\n=C2=A0 \nExter=\r\nnal and internal do NOT have a one-to-one correspondence. Just as you \ncann=\r\not tell what is inside a house by looking at it from outside, so cannot you=\r\n \ntell one&#39;s state of mind from looking at one. One&#39;s spiritual maturity an=\r\nd \nattainment is in one&#39;s state of mind. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0=\r\n \n&gt; If a loved and revered spiritual figure is percieved to be questioned, =\r\n\n&gt; naturally a reaction is expected.

Here too I see no confusion. \n=C2=A0 \nWell, they not on=\r\nly regarded him as &quot;higher than them&quot;, but they also regarded \nhim as the h=\r\nighest. They regarded him as the Supreme Being himself.

Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part of a Rishi =\r\nwho came down. An \namsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but sufficient part of=\r\n the Rishi&#39;s \nconsciousness that comes down for a secific purpose and once =\r\nthe purpose is \nserved, goes back to the source. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Si=\r\nddhas. Therefore, \nvery technically, Swami Vivekananda is an *amsa* of a Ri=\r\nshi, a projection of a \nRishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW, all of these Sid=\r\ndhas, Naths, Munis etc are \nprojection Rishis one way or the other. Each is=\r\n kept is ingorance of their real \nbeing (Rishi) such that the play can go o=\r\nn (not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). \nThey are Nitya-siddha because even =\r\nif they take birth over and over, being parts \nof extremely higher beings, =\r\nthese emanations/projections/amsas will surely \neventually go back to the s=\r\nource when the work is done. \n\n=C2=A0 \nHowever, in their forms as specific =\r\nindividuals like Vivekananda, whether these \namsa attain the specific stage=\r\ns which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will \ndetermine if they are to be ca=\r\nlled so. They may not need to do so since they are \nhere for a purpose. But=\r\n, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true \nsense is when he, a=\r\ns Vimalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific \nshaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot;=\r\n and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it, \ndeeper and de=\r\neper.=C2=A0 \n\n=C2=A0 \nThere is a book of conversations between Totapuri and=\r\n a certain sadhaka (his \ndisciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to =\r\nstay in the Swargadwara \nsmashana and later someone build a small ashram fo=\r\nr him. Totapuri&#39;s ashram still \nexists in Puri. In that conversation, Totap=\r\nuri also mentions a similar ideas of \nwhat is a siddha and higher. And how =\r\nonly a Siddha and none less is a true \nVigyani. He further mentions that Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the \nstage of a Siddha. His work wa=\r\ns specific, he did the work and went off. He did \nnot need to and therefore=\r\n did not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. \n\n=C2=A0 \nAdded to thi=\r\ns the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the \ndisciples of R=\r\namakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual \nbeing, and =\r\nhigher than them.

The \ngoal of existence and sa=\r\ndhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither \nspecifically sought n=\r\nor specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature \ngives one some sid=\r\ndhi(s), one should accept them with neither excitement nor \ndisappointment.=\r\n But one should NOT run after them, for they are neither \nnecessary nor suf=\r\nficient for self-realization and liberation. \n\n=C2=A0 \nVivekananda used the=\r\n same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to give his \nsiddhis to Vivekana=\r\nnda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable him to realize \ngod. Ramakris=\r\nhna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, \nwhen R=\r\namakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda&#39;s two \nact=\r\nions demonstrate Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nLet us use the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one&#39;s s=\r\npiritual \nsadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb t=\r\nhe hill from \ndifferent sides and using different paths. There may be trees=\r\n with nice fruits \non the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special ab=\r\nilities. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIf one gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and co=\r\nllecting fruits, one&#39;s \njourney gets delayed and one may not reach the top.=\r\n That is why Vasishtha says a \nseeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nBut if some fruits fall in one&#39;s lap by themselves, one can keep =\r\nthem. \nSimilarly, siddhis that come to one by themselves can be accepted by=\r\n a seeker of \nSelf. \n\n=C2=A0 \nNow an important distinction: \n=C2=A0 \nThere =\r\nare some trees that are found at lower altitudes also, but some really \nspe=\r\ncial trees are found at very high altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, =\r\nit \nshows that one has climbed great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do no=\r\nt mean \nmuch, but some siddhis are very special and only really elevated sa=\r\ndhakas can \nobtain them (whether by trying or without trying). If a sadhaka=\r\ns demonstrates \nsuch a siddhi, you can see that one progressed a lot. Howev=\r\ner, the key is that \none who climbed the same or more distance may not have=\r\n that or any other fruit. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nUnlike in the=\r\n example of climbing hill, which is an external activity, spiritual \nprogre=\r\nss in real life is *internal*. There is NO way for anyone to know for sure =\r\n\nhow much progress one has made, how much self-control one has internally a=\r\nnd \nwhat exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind. We may try to judge it from externa=\r\nl factors \nsuch as actions, words etc, but it is not necessarily accurate. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nHere, some people swayed by siddhis may be tempted to use one&#39;s s=\r\niddhis to judge \nhow high one climbed. But that is faulty. One person who r=\r\neached the absolute \ntop may not have any fruits, while one person who stil=\r\nl has ways to climb may \nhave gotten some really nice fruit. Using externas=\r\nlly demonstrable siddhis that \nare neither necessary nor sufficient for Sel=\r\nf-realization as a measure of one&#39;s \nprogress is unsound. \n\n=C2=A0 \nGiven t=\r\nhat spiritual progress is internal, how can we judge it and compare \npeople=\r\n then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a sarvaantaryaami - a \nperfec=\r\nted being who has access to each being&#39;s internal state - can do that. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nRajarshi, you are assuming that Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on \nVimalananda&#39;s scale. You are concluding =\r\nthat Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; \nAbhedananda, Vivekananda etc are lower =\r\nthan that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and \nhence Vimalananda is superior to Ab=\r\nhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIs Paramahamsa Nithyana=\r\nnda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa \nbecause he is kno=\r\nwn so? See, how people are famously known may or may not \nreflect their spi=\r\nritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you \ncannot see it. =\r\n\n\n=C2=A0 \nWe do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really is. He may not =\r\nbe just a \nparamahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, but be a siddha or a natha o=\r\nr even a rishi. \nHe may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself said and some=\r\n religious experts of \nthat time declared based on various signs. If Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu \nhimself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda etc can defi=\r\nnitely be rishis or naths in \nVimalananda&#39;s scale. If your argument is that=\r\n they cannot be because they did \nnot demonstrate siddhis compatible with t=\r\nhat status, that is a non-point as I \nexplained above. The disagreement bet=\r\nween then boils down a difference in the \nrelevance and importance of exter=\r\nnally demonstrated siddhis. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nWhy this is r=\r\nelevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to \nhave mis=\r\nconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing \nmira=\r\ncles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. \n\n=C2=A0 \nVasishtha is =\r\nnot only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught \nLord R=\r\nama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will \n=\r\nbalance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis =\r\nare \nneither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don&#39;t be distra=\r\ncted by \nthem or be infatuated with them. \n\n=C2=A0 \nThe goal of sadhana is =\r\nthat your notions of &quot;this is I and these are mine&quot; get \nsubtler and subtle=\r\nr and hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and \nweaker. Other=\r\ns may or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you \nknow your=\r\n progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no \nre=\r\nlevance or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your \nsad=\r\nhana. \n\n=C2=A0 \nBest regards, \nNarasimha \n---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------- \n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, \n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana: \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitt=\r\ner ID: @homam108 \n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------- \n=C2=A0 \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a long friendly ;-)=\r\n exchange between Rajarshi and me on Friday \n&gt; (July 29) on twitter on meas=\r\nuring spiritual caliber. This came from the \n&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s commen=\r\nts on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding th=\r\neir attitude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and said=\r\n their spiritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was =\r\n2 power 16. He also talked about \n&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber ment=\r\nioned by V. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of musings on that. \n&gt; \n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------- \n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here a=\r\nre a few comments on your statements a couple of days \n&gt; back on Twitter co=\r\nmparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, =\r\nrose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n&gt; which is a better flower. T=\r\nhey have different properties like color, \n&gt; size, shape, number of petals,=\r\n type/intensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; values depend on the purpose and =\r\nthey cannot be quantified universally. \n&gt; How can any sane person then say =\r\nthat spiritual caliber of different \n&gt; people can be compared and quanitifi=\r\ned? The field of duality has \n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of =\r\na yogi has infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual cal=\r\niber of a person as one \n&gt; number and compare them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even a=\r\nttempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha =\r\n&lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for=\r\n deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; where Vishnu is supr=\r\neme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some c=\r\nonsider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None =\r\nof them is absolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; and for specific purposes,=\r\n i.e. from a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; people who take them as abs=\r\nolute and argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so =\r\nand so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; know that none of the hierarch=\r\nies is absolute. \n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare =\r\nthe wisdom of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of=\r\n Ramakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion o=\r\nf Shirdi Sai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri M=\r\nahashaya, \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of E=\r\nknath \n&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, =\r\netc, \n&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific =\r\n\n&gt; limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n=\r\n&gt; another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n=\r\n&gt; on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n&gt; =\r\nYou should just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n&gt; o=\r\nf them that you like the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from=\r\n specific perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, his words should make one reali=\r\nze that there is always \n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resultin=\r\ng mastery over the field \n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One sh=\r\nould never rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gos=\r\npel and starting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially maki=\r\nng statements like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put to=\r\ngtr&quot; and thinking \n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda i=\r\ns assumed to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Even if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume =\r\n\n&gt; that you can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramak=\r\nrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per =\r\nVimalananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or =\r\nmay be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; th=\r\ne details we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; statu=\r\nre based on his own classification? \n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal t=\r\no each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You=\r\n probably made this statement based on \n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimala=\r\nnanda. For the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he wa=\r\ns a real person or an imagined \n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and ver=\r\ny wisely!) left the latter \n&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book=\r\n! \n&gt; \n&gt; If we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a =\r\n\n&gt; simpler definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \n&gt; =\r\none&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; t=\r\nold Abhedananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \n&gt; =\r\nback, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \n&gt; on=\r\ne more birth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; th=\r\ne other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \n&gt; w=\r\naiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; A=\r\nbhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda! \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that =\r\nthis is just one definition. One can have many \n&gt; definitions. The key is n=\r\not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is w=\r\neightier than Y and so what he said must \n&gt; be more correct&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; People =\r\nwith lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \n&gt; to be =\r\nabsolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \n&gt; are doi=\r\nng the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t=\r\n fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n&gt; absol\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
