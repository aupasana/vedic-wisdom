These are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far\nwe must=\r\n imitate His life and character, if we seek true\nillumination, and delivera=\r\nnce from all blindness of heart.  Let\nit be our most earnest study, therefo=\r\nre, to dwell upon the life\nof Jesus Christ.\n\n2. His teaching surpasseth all=\r\n teaching of holy men, and such as\nhave His Spirit find therein the hidden =\r\nmanna.(2)  But there are\nmany who, though they frequently hear the Gospel, =\r\nyet feel but\nlittle longing after it, because they have not the mind of\nChr=\r\nist.  He, therefore, that will fully and with true wisdom\nunderstand the wo=\r\nrds of Christ, let him strive to conform his\nwhole life to that mind of Chr=\r\nist.\n\n3. What doth it profit thee to enter into deep discussion\nconcerning =\r\nthe Holy Trinity, if thou lack humility, and be thus\ndispleasing to the Tri=\r\nnity?  For verily it is not deep words that\nmake a man holy and upright; it=\r\n is a good life which maketh a man\ndear to God.  I had rather feel contriti=\r\non than be skilful in the\ndefinition thereof.  If thou knewest the whole Bi=\r\nble, and the\nsayings of all the philosophers, what should all this profit t=\r\nhee\nwithout the love and grace of God?  Vanity of vanities, all is\nvanity, =\r\nsave to love God, and Him only to serve.  That is the\nhighest wisdom, to ca=\r\nst the world behind us, and to reach forward\nto the heavenly kingdom.\n\n4. I=\r\nt is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches\nthat shall peri=\r\nsh.  It is vanity, too, to covet honours, and to\nlift up ourselves on high.=\r\n  It is vanity to follow the desires of\nthe flesh and be led by them, for t=\r\nhis shall bring misery at the\nlast.  It is vanity to desire a long life, an=\r\nd to have little\ncare for a good life.  It is vanity to take thought only f=\r\nor the\nlife which now is, and not to look forward to the things which\nshall=\r\n be hereafter.  It is vanity to love that which quickly\npasseth away, and n=\r\not to hasten where eternal joy abideth.\n\n5. Be ofttimes mindful of the sayi=\r\nng,(3) The eye is not satisfied\nwith seeing, nor the ear with hearing.  Str=\r\nive, therefore, to\nturn away thy heart from the love of the things that are=\r\n seen,\nand to set it upon the things that are not seen.  For they who\nfollo=\r\nw after their own fleshly lusts, defile the conscience, and\ndestroy the gra=\r\nce of God.\n\n(1) John viii. 12.   (2) Revelations ii. 17.\n(3) Ecclesiastes i=\r\n. 8.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOf thinking humbly of oneself\n\nThere is naturally in ever=\r\ny man a desire to know, but what\nprofiteth knowledge without the fear of Go=\r\nd?  Better of a surety\nis a lowly peasant who serveth God, than a proud phi=\r\nlosopher who\nwatcheth the stars and neglecteth the knowledge of himself.  H=\r\ne\nwho knoweth himself well is vile in his own sight; neither\nregardeth he t=\r\nhe praises of men.  If I knew all the things that\nare in the world, and wer=\r\ne not in charity, what should it help me\nbefore God, who is to judge me acc=\r\nording to my deeds?\n\n2. Rest from inordinate desire of knowledge, for there=\r\nin is found\nmuch distraction and deceit.  Those who have knowledge desire t=\r\no\nappear learned, and to be called wise.  Many things there are to\nknow whi=\r\nch profiteth little or nothing to the soul.  And foolish\nout of measure is =\r\nhe who attendeth upon other things rather than\nthose which serve to his sou=\r\nl&#39;s health.  Many words satisfy not\nthe soul, but a good life refresheth th=\r\ne mind, and a pure\nconscience giveth great confidence towards God.\n\n3. The =\r\ngreater and more complete thy knowledge, the more severely\nshalt thou be ju=\r\ndged, unless thou hast lived holily.  Therefore\nbe not lifted up by any ski=\r\nll or knowledge that thou hast; but\nrather fear concerning the knowledge wh=\r\nich is given to thee.  If\nit seemeth to thee that thou knowest many things,=\r\n and\nunderstandest them well, know also that there are many more\nthings whi=\r\nch thou knowest not.  Be not high-minded, but rather\nconfess thine ignoranc=\r\ne.  Why desirest thou to lift thyself above\nanother, when there are found m=\r\nany more learned and more skilled\nin the Scripture than thou?  If thou wilt=\r\n know and learn anything\nwith profit, love to be thyself unknown and to be =\r\ncounted for\nnothing.\n\n4. That is the highest and most profitable lesson, wh=\r\nen a man\ntruly knoweth and judgeth lowly of himself.  To account nothing\nof=\r\n one&#39;s self, and to think always kindly and highly of others,\nthis is great=\r\n and perfect wisdom.  Even shouldest thou see thy\nneighbor sin openly or gr=\r\nievously, yet thou oughtest not to\nreckon thyself better than he, for thou =\r\nknowest not how long\nthou shalt keep thine integrity.  All of us are weak a=\r\nnd frail;\nhold thou no man more frail \n\n\n"}}
