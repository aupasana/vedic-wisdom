If you keep polluting the =\r\nlist with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the list. We welcome a=\r\nll views, but one can disagree with great scholars and masters without beli=\r\nttling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attitude.\n\nAadi Shank=\r\nara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you study his works, you=\r\n will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in his commentarie=\r\ns, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in Vedic s=\r\ncriptures, breadth of\n commentaries of Vedic literature and the linguistic =\r\nrichness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all scholars of K=\r\nali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about the importance of =\r\ndevotion out of context and portray the greatest and most prolific scholar =\r\nof Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.\n\n* * *\n\nSanskrit is a very usefu=\r\nl language. So much great literature that shows various paths to reaching g=\r\nod is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras directly resona=\r\nte with the energy centers in one&#39;s subtle consciousness. So, if one wants =\r\nto learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in Sanskrit, it is a=\r\n great idea.\n\nAt the same time, Shankara&#39;s advice of chanting the name of G=\r\novinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue one in the final m=\r\noments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complete* surrender to =\r\npersonal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in the end.\n Learnin=\r\ng various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplining the mind with =\r\nvarious activities, keeping the company of the saintly - all these are for =\r\nthe purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending on one&#39;s rinas =\r\nand conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activities, such as lea=\r\nrning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing rituals etc. But=\r\n, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so that people do not=\r\n forget it and get bogged down.\n\nIf one wanting to climb a mountain keeps w=\r\nalking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, one may eventual=\r\nly forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stuck at the base f=\r\norever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that forever may forget =\r\nthat reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compassionate masters=\r\n may sometimes remind us of the final goal.\n\n* * *\n\nI am reminded of a smal=\r\nl episode from the life of Swami\n Vivekananda.\n\nSwami Vivekananda said at a=\r\n San Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple of a man who could not write his o=\r\nwn name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How often have I wished I c=\r\nould take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!&quot;\n\nStudent said, &quot;But, =\r\nSwami, that is the part of you I like best.&quot;\n\nSwami Vivekananda said, &quot;That=\r\n is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am.&quot;\n\nVivekananda was na=\r\nmed so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viveka (discrimination) arising f=\r\nrom a brilliant logical mind, but because TRUE viveka (discrimination) was =\r\nto arise in his mind later and he was to realize the limitations of his reg=\r\nular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; That Adi shankara i=\r\ns celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,\n&gt; does speak a =\r\nlot about his immaturity in disseminating his teachings in a\n&gt; useful manne=\r\nr.\n\nMaturity of a teacher is not measured by the\n following. And great teac=\r\nhers do not care about being &quot;celebrated&quot;.\n\nIn any case, it is not true tha=\r\nt Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percentage of Vedanta =\r\nscholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shankara&#39;s=\r\n commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosophers for many many =\r\ngenerations.\n\nApart from his scholarly works, the mutts established by him =\r\nhave shaped the religious consciousness of a significant percentage of Hind=\r\nus in the last couple of millennia.\n\nAny teachings in written/spoken words =\r\ncan never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great great teachers =\r\nalso lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only the teachings of r=\r\nishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to influence the thin=\r\nking of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Shankara&#39;s words -=\r\n scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retained their meaning =\r\nand power for more than\n a couple of millennia. The longevity of his works =\r\nis amazing.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is ok to have strong opinions. As people&#39;s understan=\r\nding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try not to offend ot=\r\nhers with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras of=\r\n gods and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, is =\r\nnot good karma.

So co=\r\nmpassionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am reminded of a small episode from the life of Swami\n Vivekanand=\r\na.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda said at a San Francisco class: &quot;I am the discip=\r\nle of a man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo h=\r\nis shoes. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it in=\r\nto the Ganges!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Student said, &quot;But, Swami, that is the part of you I=\r\n like best.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda said, &quot;That is because you are a fool=\r\n, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivekananda was named so by Ramakrishn=\r\na, not because he had viveka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logi=\r\ncal mind, but because TRUE viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind=\r\n later and he was to realize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrim=\r\nination of logical mind).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; That Adi shankara is cel=\r\nebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,&lt;br&gt;&gt; does speak a=\r\n lot about his immaturity in disseminating his teachings in a&lt;br&gt;&gt; usefu=\r\nl manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maturity of a teacher is not measured by the\n following. A=\r\nnd great teachers do not care about being &quot;celebrated&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In any case,=\r\n it is not true that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant per=\r\ncentage of Vedanta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavil=\r\ny by Adi Shankara&#39;s commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosop=\r\nhers for many many generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from his scholarly works, the =\r\nmutts established by him have shaped the religious consciousness of a signi=\r\nficant percentage of Hindus in the last couple of millennia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Any tea=\r\nchings in written/spoken words can never be perfect and perish quickly. The=\r\n words of great great teachers also lose their meaning and relevance very q=\r\nuickly. Only the teachings of rishis and gods retain their meaning and thei=\r\nr ability to influence the thinking of people forever (or for really long p=\r\neriods). Adi Shankara&#39;s words - scholarly works as well as composed prayers=\r\n - have retained their meaning and power for more than\n a couple of millenn=\r\nia. The longevity of his works is amazing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is ok to =\r\nhave strong opinions. As people&#39;s understanding evolves, their opinions evo=\r\nlve too. So, wise ones try not to offend others with their strong opinions.=\r\n In any case, insulting saints, avataras of gods and rishis, based on half-=\r\nbaked understanding of their teachings, is not good karma. I request member=\r\ns to be considerate, tolerant and respectful to others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do =\r\nIt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;no=\r\nfollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://Sarasw=\r\natiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;-----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---- silentadmirer_in &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3D=\r\nsilentadmirer_in%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;silentadmirer_in@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; Namaskar smartxpark,&lt;br&gt;&gt; What you say is correct, Sanskrit and its=\r\n grammar gives one a high that other languages do not. It is because the Be=\r\neja vibrations resonate with the astral centers. The secret lies in choosin=\r\ng the right beeja for the recitation of mantras and commune with divinities=\r\n of the creation. There is only one right beeja for one person, amongst the=\r\n 49 beejakshara\n from HaM to SaM constituting 49 Maruts or astral-life curr=\r\nents, that allows a person to contact the divinities.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; It is=\r\n always useful to progress on the most reasonable path of ones&#39; own choosin=\r\ng because that would safeguard one from failures and pitfalls created by ot=\r\nhers&#39; immature advice.&lt;br&gt;&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relativ=\r\nely few quarters around the world, does speak a lot about his immaturity in=\r\n disseminating his teachings in a useful manner.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; There are =\r\npeople who are stupid enough to call the Path/Goal of others as wrong, with=\r\nout trying to understand why they are on that path in the first place.
