Namaste Sir,\n&gt;\n&gt; In the old day=\r\ns also, there was varna system but it was different. People\n&gt; belonged to d=\r\nifferent varnas based on their aptitude and served different\n&gt; purposes in =\r\nsociety. It wasn&#39;t a rigid system, but a flexible and mobile\n&gt; system based=\r\n on aptitude rather than birth. Of course, because a child may\n&gt; get expose=\r\nd to what father does and may have a good chance of developing\n&gt; aptitude f=\r\nor such work, one would by default get father&#39;s varna at birth.\n&gt; But, as o=\r\nne grows up and one&#39;s vasanas (conditioning from past lives)\n&gt; develop, one=\r\n may develop a different aptitude and may end up with a varna\n&gt; different f=\r\nrom father&#39;s.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, Vishwamitra was born as a kshatriya, but bec=\r\name a braahmana\n&gt; and became a brahmarshi later. Valmiki was born as a shoo=\r\ndra and lived by\n&gt; hunting birds. He became a braahmana and became a mahars=\r\nhi later.\n&gt;\n&gt; No matter where one is born and how one was brought up, anyon=\r\ne who is\n&gt; interested in knowledge and liberation and not interested in mon=\r\ney or power\n&gt; over others, IS a braahmana. Even if one is born in an orthod=\r\nox brahmin\n&gt; family, if one is deeply interested in money or power and auth=\r\nority over\n&gt; others, one is NOT a braahmana. In any case, one varna is not =\r\nsuperior and\n&gt; another varna is not inferior. People of different varnas se=\r\nrve different\n&gt; purposes. It is as simple as that. What we see today - bias=\r\n, mistrust,\n&gt; fights and killings in the name of caste - are an unfortunate=\r\n consequence of\n&gt; deepening Kali.\n&gt;\n&gt; What I am saying is not accepted in m=\r\nainstream society today because we are\n&gt; deeply into Kali yuga. But, when t=\r\nhe Mother decides, social notions can\n&gt; change quickly. In fact, we are goi=\r\nng through a phase of huge global\n&gt; transformation. Political, economoic, s=\r\nocial and religious structures of the\n&gt; world will be redefined during the =\r\ncoming decades and will remain valid for\n&gt; many centuries.\n&gt;\n&gt; BTW, when th=\r\ne divine Mother appeared before my guru in March 2006 and gave\n&gt; a command =\r\nto spread a simple homam ritual in the world for the coming times,\n&gt; her cl=\r\near directive was to not differentiate based on caste, creed, class\n&gt; and r=\r\nace. We encourage anybody who desires to worship any god in fire for\n&gt; spir=\r\nitual progress to perform homam on a regular basis using the homam\n&gt; manual=\r\ns at the homam website (see below).\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also if a person born in low cast=\r\n is that mean he will receive less grace\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; GOD & a pesron who belong=\r\ns to high cast has abundance of it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rather than caste, environment in w=\r\nhich one grows up does have a role (and\n&gt; caste does sometimes influence th=\r\ne family environment in India). One born in\n&gt; a family (brahmana or otherwi=\r\nse) that worships god everyday is exposed to\n&gt; that notion. One brought up =\r\nin a family that cares a little about god or\n&gt; morality and pursues money o=\r\nr power or comforts ruthlessly is exposed that\n&gt; notion. So the religious/s=\r\npiritual aspects of the environment in which one\n&gt; grows up do play a role.=\r\n However, if one has strong vasanas, they will\n&gt; eventually take hold. One =\r\nwill meet people who make those vasanas flourish\n&gt; and those vasanas take c=\r\nontrol.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatif=\r\nilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyo=\r\ntish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- sudhir junonikar &lt;s=\r\nudhirjunonikar@...&lt;http://in.mc949.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dsud=\r\nhirjunonikar%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste all gurujanas\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nince childhood i am wandering to have answers to my question, they seems\n&gt; =\r\nto be foolish to scholars like you but as lay man I am carrying it with me.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Our society is discriminated in to various cast, does our veda sup=\r\nport\n&gt; this cast system?\n&gt; &gt;  If we consider that doshas/papam is associate=\r\nd if we make such\n&gt;  discrimination then why it is not taken in to account.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Since thousand&#39;s of years  people are treated badly even animals w=\r\nere\n&gt; treated well.
