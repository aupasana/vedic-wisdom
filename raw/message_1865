The goal of sadhana is to purify self and repay \ndebts by engaging in actions without much ego. Without repaying karmik \ndebts, one cannot realize. But the trick is that you do not know who you are \nindebted to. So, when you see some natural signals pointing to giving \nsomething to someone, do not think much and just give it. If you get an \ninstinct to give some money to someone or help someone or do something for \nsomeone or just pray for someone, just follow the instincts and do it. But \ndo it like a guileless small child and do not entertain any afterthoughts \nlike &quot;I am helping&quot; or &quot;I am a good person and so I did this&quot;. Leave out ego \nand pride to the extent possible.\n\nAs you succeed more in being a guileless small child who goes with the flow, \nyour instincts will become sharper and Nature will show you the right \nactions to repay all your blocking debts.\n\nAfter you do what you think you need to do, do not be caught in it, leave it \nand move on.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, May 25, 2009 9:14 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Can I perform homam any time?\n\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; Thankyou Sir, for so kindly clearing my doubts.\n&gt; One more sir--there seem to be no end to my questions!\n&gt; While doing  homa one evening,i remembered a friend of my husband--she is \n&gt; a dentist,when we had last met her (a year ago) she was in pain--something \n&gt; to do with her spine;As soon as i remembered her i just prayed for her \n&gt; for a moment.The next thought was whether it is all right to do this while \n&gt; doing homa?It was not planned.In fact we have not spoken to or of this \n&gt; lady in months.What should one do?\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Sunita\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I felt a papable and far stronger effect when I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; did the homa at night. The meditation too\n&gt;&gt; &gt; happened in a more focused and better way.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There may be a couple of factors behind this.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The energy of some deities is more active during night than the day. \n&gt;&gt; After\n&gt;&gt; all, night is symbolic of the primordial state of the universe. Deities\n&gt;&gt; personifying the energies and state of the universe in the initial\n&gt;&gt; primordial stages are easier to identify with during the night. Thus, if \n&gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; do homam for Mahaakaala, Kaali, Bhairava etc, night time is more apt.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; More importantly, some people doing homam in the morning before going to\n&gt;&gt; work feel some kind of time pressure in the mind (atleast \n&gt;&gt; sub-consciously).\n&gt;&gt; When you know that you have to finish and go to work in another 30 min or\n&gt;&gt; hour or whatever, that pressure may be at the back of the mind. Whereas \n&gt;&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; one does at the end of the day, when there is no pressure of any kind, \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; mind may be more relaxed and one may be able to focus better.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In any case, I suggest not worrying about all these things and starting \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; practice with some time or the other. If morning is convenient, do in the\n&gt;&gt; morning. If evening is convenient, do in the evening. If night is\n&gt;&gt; convenient, do in the night. Pick a time and do it at that time everyday \n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; every week or at whatever frequency you have chosen. After you do it for \n&gt;&gt; a\n&gt;&gt; while, then you may think of experimenting with a different time and see\n&gt;&gt; which time is working better. In the beginning, it pays to just get \n&gt;&gt; started\n&gt;&gt; with some time or the other.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I also feel some sort of activity/squeeze ai the solar\n&gt;&gt; &gt; plexus....sort of ,what one feels at the heart when\n&gt;&gt; &gt; one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When one focuses mind on a mantra, one MAY feel activity in various parts \n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; the body, like a tingling sensation or pressure or heat or coldness or\n&gt;&gt; crawling of ants etc. Such activity may be felt in various parts of the\n&gt;&gt; body, like the crown of the head or forehead or throat or heart or solar\n&gt;&gt; plexus etc. It merely shows the movement of praana vaayu in various \n&gt;&gt; chakras\n&gt;&gt; and nadis that are in need of praana (life force). For example, Manipoora\n&gt;&gt; chakra in the solar plexus area is the seat of fire element, which is the\n&gt;&gt; center of one&#39;s sense of control and pride. Any personality traits \n&gt;&gt; related\n&gt;&gt; to short temper, pride, anger etc will be linked to some deficiencies in \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; Manipoora chakra. When one is able to focus in meditation well, some \n&gt;&gt; praana\n&gt;&gt; may be moving in the Manipoora chakra area and trying to improve the\n&gt;&gt; deficiency.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Similarly, if a considerable amount of praana moves in particular nadis, \n&gt;&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; may even get a sensation of moving up ot tilting to a side or back etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But the important thing is to ignore all these and not be distracted by \n&gt;&gt; any\n&gt;&gt; of these sensations. Awareness and analysis of the sensation distracts \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; mind from its focus on the mantra. As praana moves everywhere and clears \n&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; deficiencies, one becomes ready for realization.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidhi.Can i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditate even after the fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; does not last very long after the aahutis are done.And i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; would like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, you can meditate even after the fire goes off. Homam burns some\n&gt;&gt; internal impurities and internal purity is at a maximum (local maximum)\n&gt;&gt; immediately following homam. Just sit and meditate as long as you can. \n&gt;&gt; After\n&gt;&gt; that, as the day progresses and we start thinking of various things, \n&gt;&gt; newer\n&gt;&gt; impurities may accumulate again. So meditating immediately after homam is\n&gt;&gt; helpful to maximize the effect.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, May 25, 2009 7:42 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Can I perform homam any time?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt; I too do havan in the evening,but before sunset.I do it around 6 pm.\n&gt;&gt; It always feels great.\n&gt;&gt; I also feel some sort of activity/squeeze ai the solar plexus....sort of\n&gt;&gt; ,what one feels at the heart when one sees an emotional movie.Why is \n&gt;&gt; this?\n&gt;&gt; I am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidhi.Can i meditate even \n&gt;&gt; after\n&gt;&gt; the fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it does not last very long after the\n&gt;&gt; aahutis are done.And i would like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Sunita.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have a little experience to share in this regard.
