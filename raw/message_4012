I was also\n&gt; &gt; finalizing my new book which deals specifically with Ta=\r\nmil Nadu religious\n&gt; &gt; politics, and in particular with the role of various=\r\n nexuses based overseas.\n&gt; &gt; So I decided to jump into the eye of the storm=\r\n of this scandal in order to\n&gt; &gt; investigate whether similar nexuses were a=\r\nt work in this case. Naturally, at\n&gt; &gt; one level I have seen this scandal t=\r\nhrough the framework of a civilization\n&gt; &gt; encounter in which Vedic culture=\r\n is pitted against the Dravidian\n&gt; &gt; divisiveness that is being backed by C=\r\nhristian evangelism. At another level,\n&gt; &gt; I found that the sensationalized=\r\n media reports were too one-sided, and none\n&gt; &gt; of them had a single statem=\r\nent to report from the swami himself.\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, there was chaos and =\r\nmismanagement of the crisis from Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda&#39;s inner circle. In h=\r\nindsight, things might have turned out\n&gt; &gt; differently had they managed mor=\r\ne sensibly and faster =96 which I will\n&gt; &gt; elaborate later in this article.=\r\n Given this, another interest of mine has\n&gt; &gt; been to extrapolate important=\r\n lessons from this episode for other Hindu\n&gt; &gt; organizations, which I predi=\r\nct will face similar scandals as and when their\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses become under=\r\nstood by those opposed to them. This article\n&gt; &gt; highlights my findings at =\r\nthese multiple levels and issues.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During this 2-week investigative=\r\n period, I have been loyal to my pledge to\n&gt; &gt; give Swami Nithyananda&#39;s org=\r\nanization the benefit of doubt and to report\n&gt; &gt; their side of the story. B=\r\nesides wanting to balance out the one-sided media\n&gt; &gt; depictions, I wanted =\r\naccess to the ashram&#39;s core group for my own research\n&gt; &gt; on the broader su=\r\nbject of civilization encounters. I respect the\n&gt; &gt; sensitivities of that o=\r\nrganization consisting of many decent and dedicated\n&gt; &gt; devotees who have s=\r\nacrificed a great deal and stand to lose a lot.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But I have conclud=\r\ned that the situation is now beyond repair for Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda and th=\r\nat his continued involvement can only damage the broader\n&gt; &gt; interests of d=\r\nharma as well as jeopardize the ashramites. Along with two\n&gt; &gt; other sympat=\r\nhizers who are not ashramites, I have personally recommended to\n&gt; &gt; Swami N=\r\nithyananda that the best course at this stage would be for him to\n&gt; &gt; resig=\r\nn completely from his organization. He should turn it over to a small\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\neam of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets can be used in the best\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; interests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of these mahatmas he mus=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institutional responsibili=\r\nties.\n&gt; &gt; Because the head of any organization must accept responsibility t=\r\nhat &quot;the\n&gt; &gt; buck stops here,&quot; only such a move can salvage the organizatio=\r\nn and the\n&gt; &gt; reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this resig=\r\nnation would\n&gt; &gt; hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has built up ag=\r\nainst him\n&gt; &gt; personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It =\r\nis up to him to\n&gt; &gt; accept or reject this advice. The basis for this conclu=\r\nsion becomes clearer\n&gt; &gt; once the reader has gone through the rest of this =\r\narticle.\n&gt; &gt; I want to begin by examining some principles about the relatio=\r\nnships between\n&gt; &gt; siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality, Tantra a=\r\nnd sex. This will\n&gt; &gt; provide the framework in which to interpret what has =\r\nhappened. Then I will\n&gt; &gt; turn to my initial interest in pursuing the chall=\r\nenges facing Hinduism in\n&gt; &gt; south India from a variety of forces.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) and Morality\n&gt; &gt; A few days ago,=\r\n I had the honor of having a two-hour private conversation\n&gt; &gt; with Sri Sri=\r\n Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introduced myself as\n&gt; &gt; an ind=\r\nependent researcher who is writing a series of books on Indian\n&gt; &gt; civiliza=\r\ntion in the context of the global challenges and opportunities. One\n&gt; &gt; of =\r\nmy volumes will be specifically on the major global gurus since the 1960s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri Sri\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; himself. I have been investigating what happened to such gurus, in terms=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; the shifts in their Western followers over time, their scandals, th=\r\neir\n&gt; &gt; Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru negotiated his=\r\n/her\n&gt; &gt; position sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and Weste=\r\nrn\n&gt; &gt; modernity on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Swam=\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda will become clear very soon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The first provocati=\r\nve question I asked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic\n&gt; &gt; powers: What =\r\nis the relationship between siddhis and morality? If siddhis\n&gt; &gt; are a scie=\r\nntific phenomena dealing with powers that can be harnessed by all\n&gt; &gt; human=\r\ns then one must bear in mind that science deals with truths that are\n&gt; &gt; mo=\r\nrally neutral. If Einstein was declared to have lived an immoral life it\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; would not invalidate his scientific theories. A person who designs aircra=\r\nfts\n&gt; &gt; or any other complex technological systems may or may not be moral =\r\nin order\n&gt; &gt; to be effective in his technical work. In other words, rtam (t=\r\nhe patterns of\n&gt; &gt; the cosmos), which we discover and call science, functio=\r\nns independently of\n&gt; &gt; human morality. This is why a scientific principle =\r\ncan be used either\n&gt; &gt; morally or immorally, because it is independent of m=\r\norality. There are moral\n&gt; &gt; persons who lack any siddhis or even ordinary =\r\nscientific competence.\n&gt; &gt; Conversely, there are great siddhas (like Ravana=\r\n) who lack morality. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri&#39;s pranayama techniques would also produce =\r\nresults for an immoral person.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri seemed impressed by th=\r\nis question, and agreed with my overall\n&gt; &gt; position on the independence be=\r\ntween siddhis and morality. But he pointed\n&gt; &gt; out that the moral dimension=\r\n, while not determining the siddhis, was also\n&gt; &gt; important because it led =\r\nto receiving the grace of the divine. I agree with\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So the=\r\nre are two separate phenomena involved: (i) spiritual technologies\n&gt; &gt; that=\r\n are objective and that allow anyone to harness spiritual energies, and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (ii) morality which is important in itself, not for attaining siddhis, but=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; in order to have a positive relationship with the divine. Either one c=\r\nan be\n&gt; &gt; developed without the other; however, the dharma tradition encour=\r\nages us to\n&gt; &gt; cultivate both. The reason that meditation systems prescribe=\r\n things like\n&gt; &gt; vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an inappropriate =\r\nlifestyle\n&gt; &gt; interferes with the mental tranquility required to advance. T=\r\nhis lifestyle\n&gt; &gt; change can be appreciated regardless of whether one belie=\r\nves in a personal\n&gt; &gt; God or not. This absence of a personal God is clear i=\r\nn Buddhist meditation.\n&gt; &gt; Different Hindu systems place different levels o=\r\nf emphasis upon a personal\n&gt; &gt; God for the yoga to function. This is why ma=\r\nny secular and scientifically\n&gt; &gt; minded persons are also drawn towards med=\r\nitation techniques. In other words,\n&gt; &gt; something cannot be a science if it=\r\n depends upon morality, because science\n&gt; &gt; is objective and stands indepen=\r\ndent of morality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The relevance of this question is as follows: Ma=\r\nny persons who have learned\n&gt; &gt; advanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda =\r\nwant to know if any moral\n&gt; &gt; breaches by him would invalidate the whole Hi=\r\nndu claim of achieving higher\n&gt; &gt; states of consciousness. When a far worse=\r\n sex scandal against the legendary\n&gt; &gt; Swami Muktananda emerged in the 1990=\r\ns, involving charges by a large number\n&gt; &gt; of his Western female disciples,=\r\n the Western academy rashly condemned not\n&gt; &gt; only one man&#39;s morality, but =\r\nalso the whole legitimacy of the Indian\n&gt; &gt; tradition itself. In that serie=\r\ns of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah\n&gt; &gt; Caldwell, etc.), I took the=\r\n same position then as I am taking now: that\n&gt; &gt; Muktananda&#39;s capabilities =\r\nin harnessing spiritual energies are separate and\n&gt; &gt; independent from whet=\r\nher or not he violated any code of morality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Patanjali warns again=\r\nst getting lured by siddhis which appear along the way\n&gt; &gt; when one practic=\r\nes advanced meditation persistently. One is not supposed to\n&gt; &gt; indulge in =\r\nthem. This warning is found in various Hindu systems that deal\n&gt; &gt; with the=\r\n body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution, because these energies\n&gt; &gt; are =\r\nvery powerful and can get out of control. Another point that is worth\n&gt; &gt; n=\r\noting is that the techniques taught by Swami Nithyananda are not his\n&gt; &gt; or=\r\niginal ones; he has made it clear repeatedly that they are from the Shiva\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sutras which have a long history in our civilization. I feel that he doe=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; have the siddhi of being able to transmit these techniques very effec=\r\ntively\n&gt; &gt; to others. For instance, I have never before in my life been abl=\r\ne to sit\n&gt; &gt; still and alert in meditation for the whole night, but he had =\r\na few hundred\n&gt; &gt; persons in a large hall achieving this. The point here is=\r\n similar to saying\n&gt; &gt; that the mathematics and golf I have learned from so=\r\nmeone is not invalidated\n&gt; &gt; when the teacher is found to be immoral.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued separately and\n&gt; &gt; ind=\r\nependently from whether his siddhis are genuine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is Tantra a Part =\r\nof Hinduism?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second question that I asked Sri Sri could not be=\r\n completely dealt with\n&gt; &gt; in the time available for our meeting. I hope to=\r\n pursue this some day with\n&gt; &gt; him and with various other acharyas for my o=\r\nwn benefit. Its significance in\n&gt; &gt; the present scandal becomes clear soon.=\r\n I asked whether the Shiva Sutras are\n&gt; &gt; valid, pointing out that among th=\r\ne 112 spiritual enlightenment techniques\n&gt; &gt; taught in them, about 6 deal w=\r\nith sexual contact between a male yogi and a\n&gt; &gt; female yogini. Kashmir Sha=\r\nivism as well as the Tantra traditions have\n&gt; &gt; included exemplars that pra=\r\ncticed these techniques. Recently, Osho tried to\n&gt; &gt; revive them and nowada=\r\nys Deepak Chopra has brought some elements of these\n&gt; &gt; into his repertoire=\r\n. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a US based scholar of Tantra and\n&gt; &gt; Kashmir Shaivi=\r\nsm, is one of the voices who brings out the authenticity of\n&gt; &gt; these appro=\r\naches in the tradition, despite the common rejections by society\n&gt; &gt; at lar=\r\nge. The tradition considers itself not suitable for mainstream society\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nand is meant only for a small subset of people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many popular Hindu=\r\n rituals and symbols have emerged out of the Tantra\n&gt; &gt; traditions =96 such=\r\n as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic traditions were\n&gt; &gt; not separat=\r\ne until recent times. The Vedic-Tantric integration is found in\n&gt; &gt; Adi Sha=\r\nnkara all the way to Jiva Goswami (the great integrator of\n&gt; &gt; Vaishnavism =\r\nwho took Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and even more recently in\n&gt; &gt; the life =\r\nof Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra\n&gt; &gt; practitioners, =\r\nbut they do it privately and not publicly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have an unpublished m=\r\nonograph that shows the history of this shift in\n&gt; &gt; Indian consciousness c=\r\noncerning Tantra. It was under British rule that\n&gt; &gt; certain Indian leaders=\r\n (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started to condemn (as part\n&gt; &gt; of their &quot;reform&quot; =\r\nof Hinduism) those aspects of Hinduism that bothered\n&gt; &gt; puritan Christian =\r\nvalues. It must be noted that Christianity has had a very\n&gt; &gt; negative post=\r\nure towards the human body starting with the Biblical episode\n&gt; &gt; of Origin=\r\n Sin. This is why female priests (called &quot;witches&quot;) got demonized\n&gt; &gt; by th=\r\ne Church in its very official genocide of several million practitioners\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n across Europe. This Church prosecution was called the Inquisition and was\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; widespread for a few centuries. The use of shakti and anything concerni=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; the body as a spiritual resource was considered not only immoral but=\r\n also\n&gt; &gt; demonic, and was outlawed with draconian enforcement. The term &quot;o=\r\nccult&quot; was\n&gt; &gt; used to refer to a vast assortment of such practices and was=\r\n heavily\n&gt; &gt; condemned by the Church as the work of the Devil.\n&gt; &gt; This men=\r\ntality entered India under the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of\n&gt; &gt; Indi=\r\na was passed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed several dozen\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntribes that practiced such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were officially\n&gt; &gt; =\r\npersecuted into extinction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism evolved as\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; the mark of being &quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus be proud o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; our identity, now that it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; practices of =\r\nour\n&gt; &gt; ancestors.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this history of removing Tantra out of Hindu=\r\nism, some people include\n&gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda among those who undermined T=\r\nantra. I disagree with this\n&gt; &gt; charge. He was saying a separate set of thi=\r\nngs to his Western audiences than\n&gt; &gt; to Indians. In his Western lecture to=\r\nurs, he presented a Hinduism that\n&gt; &gt; Westerners could relate to and apprec=\r\niate, but he did not ask Indians to\n&gt; &gt; shift their practice. It is unfortu=\r\nnate that after his death, the\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Mission he started has dilut=\r\ned itself into a sort of\n&gt; &gt; pseudo-Christianity. Kali and other related Ta=\r\nntra deities, symbols and\n&gt; &gt; rituals that were dear to Ramakrishna himself=\r\n, have become &quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;private&quot; use by the monks, but are marg=\r\ninalized publicly and considered as\n&gt; &gt; an embarrassment. Their lead in thi=\r\ns direction has spread across modern\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism to such an extent that Ve=\r\ndic Hinduism has become separated from\n&gt; &gt; Tantra, and Tantra is now widely=\r\n condemned by many Hindu gurus. This is also\n&gt; &gt; a factor that worked again=\r\nst Swami Nithyananda&#39;s reputation among orthodox\n&gt; &gt; Hindu leaders, for he =\r\nuses Tantric techniques that arouse body energies,\n&gt; &gt; such as kundalini.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My own feeling is that Tantra is making a big comeback. First there=\r\n was\n&gt; &gt; Western popularity of distorted versions of Tantra; but this is no=\r\nw being\n&gt; &gt; followed by more clinical experimentation by psychologists and =\r\nothers. The\n&gt; &gt; whole issue of latent human energies and potentials (both p=\r\nositive and\n&gt; &gt; dangerous) is a hot topic of serious scientific investigati=\r\non. Hindus should\n&gt; &gt; reclaim this aspect of their own tradition rather tha=\r\nn waiting for U-Turned\n&gt; &gt; (appropriated) versions to get re-exported back =\r\nto India, packaged as &quot;Made\n&gt; &gt; in USA&quot; spiritual science. This requires an=\r\n attitude of experimentation\n&gt; &gt; under the appropriate controls to prevent =\r\nabuses and quackery.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I just returned from Kumbh Mela where I walke=\r\nd amidst several tens of\n&gt; &gt; thousands of naga sadhus who were completely n=\r\naked. I did not consider them\n&gt; &gt; as either vulgar or primitive. The old gu=\r\nard of Hindu orthodoxy rejects\n&gt; &gt; Tantra at least in public, and yet lives=\r\n in contradictions because they do\n&gt; &gt; respect the naga sadhus and also the=\r\n various symbols and rituals that have\n&gt; &gt; their foundations in Tantra. The=\r\n vacuum left by avoiding the subject of\n&gt; &gt; Tantra has created opportunitie=\r\ns for the likes of Wendy Doniger to formulate\n&gt; &gt; distorted interpretations=\r\n. I feel that Hindu spiritual practitioners as well\n&gt; &gt; as intellectuals mu=\r\nst take back control over Tantra as an intrinsic part of\n&gt; &gt; our tradition.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sex and Morality\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Against this backdrop, I will address t=\r\nhe issue of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; morality. Just to recap:\n&gt; &gt; My first p=\r\noint above has been that the morality issue about Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda doe=\r\ns not impact the effectiveness of the meditation techniques\n&gt; &gt; he has taug=\r\nht very successfully. Their efficacy is best evaluated by the\n&gt; &gt; tens of t=\r\nhousands of practitioners for themselves.\n&gt; &gt; My second point was that ther=\r\ne is nothing inherent about sex that is\n&gt; &gt; rejected by Hinduism across the=\r\n board, although certain strains of Hinduism\n&gt; &gt; do reject sex seeing it as=\r\n harmful to spirituality.\n&gt; &gt; Here it must be noted that brahmacharya (invo=\r\nlving sexual abstinence) is\n&gt; &gt; just one of the spiritual paths of Hinduism=\r\n. The first half of my recent\n&gt; &gt; stay in Haridwar was as a guest of the Ga=\r\nyatri Pariwar, one of the greatest\n&gt; &gt; and largest Hindu movements, that do=\r\nes not advocate being brahmachari. Its\n&gt; &gt; founder, its present head and it=\r\ns members at large, are householders and not\n&gt; &gt; brahmacharis. But for Swam=\r\ni Nithyananda to claim moral authenticity under\n&gt; &gt; this system, he would h=\r\nave to pronounce himself as a householder and not a\n&gt; &gt; sannyasin. He has n=\r\never done that, so we must examine his morality by some\n&gt; &gt; other criteria.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another approach for him could have been to announce himself as a=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; experimenter of Tantra for modern times, thereby making himself trans=\r\nparent\n&gt; &gt; of any such charges. This would place him in the same category a=\r\ns Osho. Many\n&gt; &gt; times in his public discourses and teachings, he has prais=\r\ned Osho as his\n&gt; &gt; greatest teacher and enlightened exemplar. He even said =\r\nthat many of his own\n&gt; &gt; teachings were derived from Osho. But he failed to=\r\n publicly clarify whether\n&gt; &gt; he was practicing those techniques that invol=\r\nve sex. Privately, he explained\n&gt; &gt; to me in recent days that Shiva Sutras =\r\nhave two categories of techniques.\n&gt; &gt; Most of the sutras do not involve ph=\r\nysical contact with another person and\n&gt; &gt; only use the four senses of sigh=\r\nt, sound, taste and smell as pathways to\n&gt; &gt; spiritual experiences. Hence a=\r\nn individual practices these techniques\n&gt; &gt; entirely on his/her own. This p=\r\nath is what he has taught thus far to the\n&gt; &gt; public. The best pursuit of t=\r\nhis path is as a brahamachari according to him,\n&gt; &gt; and he has initiated ma=\r\nny followers into it. But for a small number of\n&gt; &gt; persons, he feels that =\r\nthe 6 sutras involving sexual Tantra need to be\n&gt; &gt; tested and perfected fo=\r\nr modern times, before they can be safely taught more\n&gt; &gt; widely. This he c=\r\nonsiders to be like any R & D done in a lab for developing\n&gt; &gt; a product.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; My sense is that he did practice Tantra with a very small number of pers=\r\nons,\n&gt; &gt; and I believe that he even entered into written legal contracts wi=\r\nth them to\n&gt; &gt; make sure that both parties were clear about the arrangement=\r\n. The reason for\n&gt; &gt; this &quot;Non-Disclosure Agreement&quot; was to make sure that =\r\nsomeone who willingly\n&gt; &gt; approaches him for Tantra does not later accuse h=\r\nim of inappropriate\n&gt; &gt; physical contact. On March 9 (about a week ago), I =\r\ndid a specific video\n&gt; &gt; interview with him dealing with this issue very sp=\r\necifically. But this video\n&gt; &gt; was blocked by his ashram leaders even thoug=\r\nh he personally felt that it was\n&gt; &gt; a good idea to show it. I gave up argu=\r\ning in favor of showing it, because\n&gt; &gt; his ashram management took a firm s=\r\ntand against it. I still feel that this\n&gt; &gt; was a blunder they made. Swami =\r\nNithyananda is very forthright and clear in\n&gt; &gt; that interview =96 I felt t=\r\nhat it was the best interview of all the ones I did\n&gt; &gt; with him, but it wa=\r\ns never made public.\n&gt; &gt; I surmise that Ranjitha, the Tamil actress in the =\r\nscandalous videotape, was\n&gt; &gt; practicing Tantra with him. He taught her the=\r\n self-control she had to\n&gt; &gt; achieve before any intimacy. I have tried to i=\r\nnterview her in order to get\n&gt; &gt; her side of the story, but so far I have n=\r\not succeeded in getting through to\n&gt; &gt; her. Based on third party reports fr=\r\nom some persons who are in touch with\n&gt; &gt; her, and the media reports of her=\r\n statements, her stance seems to be along\n&gt; &gt; the following lines: She took=\r\n the sexual initiative with him on the occasion\n&gt; &gt; shown in the videotape,=\r\n at a time when he was not fully alert. But this\n&gt; &gt; activity did not proce=\r\ned to intercourse. It was terminated. She has also\n&gt; &gt; said that the videos=\r\n being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what\n&gt; &gt; actually happened, =\r\nbecause they exaggerate the situation. They do not show\n&gt; &gt; portions where =\r\nhe asked her to stop. Different clips from various videos\n&gt; &gt; seem to have =\r\nbeen turned into a single video by editing. She has not filed\n&gt; &gt; any compl=\r\naint against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual sex\n&gt; &gt; between=\r\n adults, and that too backed by a formal written contract between the\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\narties. Because she has refused to give any statement against Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nit=\r\nhyananda, she feels threatened by those who set her up and who did this\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n sting operation. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her safety\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; from this mafia-like conspiracy. I have not been able to corroborate thi=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; thesis directly from her.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My concern about his morality is, =\r\ntherefore, not based on sex between\n&gt; &gt; consenting adults. Rather, my moral=\r\n issue is about the lack of transparency\n&gt; &gt; before the public. He could ha=\r\nve openly said that he wants to select a few\n&gt; &gt; yoginis to experiment Tant=\r\nra under mutual consent. At worst this would have\n&gt; &gt; upset many followers =\r\nand pushed them away. In response to my concern over\n&gt; &gt; his lack of transp=\r\narency, he could offer the argument that this was a\n&gt; &gt; private activity be=\r\ntween adults who are under no obligation to disclose it\n&gt; &gt; to the public. =\r\nAfter all, people do not go about broadcasting their sexual\n&gt; &gt; lives. So l=\r\nong as this was under mutual consent, he might say, it cannot be\n&gt; &gt; an off=\r\nense. And if it was done under the Tantra portions of the Shiva Sutra,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nit was also an act within the Hindu tradition despite the controversy\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nurrounding Tantra today.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Having given this best case argument on h=\r\nis behalf, I must say that there\n&gt; &gt; could also be the alternative scenario=\r\n, namely, that this was mere lust\n&gt; &gt; packaged as Tantric spirituality. Dav=\r\nid White, one of Wendy&#39;s Children, has\n&gt; &gt; written extensively making the c=\r\nlaim that all Tantra is &quot;hard core porn&quot;\n&gt; &gt; that gets wrapped up before th=\r\ne public in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo to appear\n&gt; &gt; to be legitimate spiritu=\r\nality, which he calls &quot;soft porn&quot; coating. White&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; latest book takes th=\r\nis allegation to the extreme, and states that all major\n&gt; &gt; yogic exemplars=\r\n in Indian history were basically not engaged in any kind of\n&gt; &gt; spirituali=\r\nty at all. Instead, he claims, they were developing personal power\n&gt; &gt; for =\r\nthe purpose of exploiting others. I am unqualified to comment on whether\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this notion of &quot;soft porn,&quot; or whether it w=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate factual data of what happe=\r\nned to\n&gt; &gt; pass judgment either way.\n&gt; &gt; This concludes what I have to say =\r\nabout his morality issue as shown in the\n&gt; &gt; sex tapes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My Impress=\r\nions of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal\n&gt; &gt; I was introduced to Swa=\r\nmi Nithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent\n&gt; &gt; Hindu leader based=\r\n in California. This man was so impressed by the young\n&gt; &gt; swami that he fr=\r\nequently called me to speak about him in glowing terms. I\n&gt; &gt; told him that=\r\n I had a guru already, and that my present interest in\n&gt; &gt; interacting with=\r\n gurus was mainly as a part of my research for my book on\n&gt; &gt; global gurus.=\r\n He arranged a private meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\n&gt; &gt; which I u=\r\nsed mostly to explain the civilization threats facing Hinduism,\n&gt; &gt; citing =\r\nnumerous examples, and questioned him on his position in this regard.\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\n found him to be very sharp, a great listener, and in agreement that we\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n must engage social issues rather than pursuing the &quot;world negating&quot; or\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;escapist&quot; paths that are typical of many gurus today.\n&gt; &gt; Later on, I att=\r\nended a weekend course in USA where he taught the Patanjali\n&gt; &gt; Yoga Sutras=\r\n. I have read several translations of this great classical work,\n&gt; &gt; but I =\r\nhad never before seen it taught experientially. Swami Nithyananda gave\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthe attendees their own personal inner experience of every one of the eight=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; limbs of Patanjali&#39;s system, right up to and including samadhi. This w=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; quite an achievement in two days.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Overall, my interactions =\r\nwith him remained centered largely on the\n&gt; &gt; geopolitics of religions. I s=\r\naw him as a prominent swami who was not running\n&gt; &gt; away from troubling iss=\r\nues, such as Christian conversions and the\n&gt; &gt; Dravidianization of Tamil id=\r\nentity. Given that I have been writing a book\n&gt; &gt; for three years (now in t=\r\nhe editing stage) on this very issue as it exists\n&gt; &gt; in Tamil Nadu, I was =\r\nespecially impressed by his experimental program of a\n&gt; &gt; Hindu temple on w=\r\nheels traveling from village to village. In each village\n&gt; &gt; this mobile te=\r\nmple stops and offers chanting, a talk by one of the leaders,\n&gt; &gt; food, med=\r\nicines, etc. So it combines religion with social service and thus\n&gt; &gt; compe=\r\ntes directly against Christian evangelism. Rather than building a\n&gt; &gt; templ=\r\ne in every village and needing a purohit in each of the thousands of\n&gt; &gt; vi=\r\nllages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was to bring to each village this\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by my own independent fact-finding =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; that wherever this temple on wheels went, the missionaries were ups=\r\net\n&gt; &gt; because it blunted their conversion efforts.\n&gt; &gt; I attended his 21-d=\r\nay meditation program in December 2009. The various\n&gt; &gt; techniques in it ar=\r\ne very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of\n&gt; &gt; this can be done=\r\n by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly\n&gt; &gt; equally between=\r\n Indians and whites from North America.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In several side conversati=\r\nons with him as well in the public forum, I\n&gt; &gt; pursued the point that I al=\r\nready have a guru since 1994, so I was not\n&gt; &gt; looking for a new guru. Sinc=\r\ne my guru had left the body a few years ago, I\n&gt; &gt; wanted to continue learn=\r\ning new techniques for my practice. I explained to\n&gt; &gt; him that I had previ=\r\nously learned and practiced meditation techniques from\n&gt; &gt; multiple sources=\r\n for over 30 years, including: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Ravi Shan=\r\nkar, Yogi Amrit Desai (who certified me as a teacher), Deepak\n&gt; &gt; Chopra, V=\r\nipassana, and more. Additionally, I had practiced numerous bhakti\n&gt; &gt; tradi=\r\ntions, as well as formal Vedanta education from Swami Chinmayananda and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Ramakrishna Mission. I went through a serious study of the writings by Sri=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo, various Madhyamika Buddhist systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Rama=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; Maharshi, etc. So I was not seeking a new guru like most others who =\r\ntook his\n&gt; &gt; courses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have to say that he never pressured me to =\r\nadopt him as my new guru, and\n&gt; &gt; even said that one must remain loyal to o=\r\nne&#39;s guru. To be classified as a\n&gt; &gt; devotee/disciple of his, there are two=\r\n criteria, neither of which applies to\n&gt; &gt; me. First, there is an optional =\r\nprogram one can sign up for, to do &quot;paada\n&gt; &gt; puja&quot; at the guru&#39;s feet, in =\r\norder to develop a special link with him. The\n&gt; &gt; second is that one can as=\r\nk to be given an initiation with a new name, in\n&gt; &gt; which case his policy i=\r\ns that the person must legally change his/her name,\n&gt; &gt; and use this new na=\r\nme publicly. I did not do either of these steps. So my\n&gt; &gt; relationship is =\r\nnot as a devotee or disciple, but more arms-length.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was a two-w=\r\nay street. While he taught me meditation, I brought to him my\n&gt; &gt; scholarsh=\r\nip on the geopolitical positioning of Hinduism which I feel the\n&gt; &gt; gurus k=\r\nnow only superficially. They do not adequately know things like:\n&gt; &gt; Wester=\r\nn philosophy, neither of the religious nor the secular variety; or\n&gt; &gt; West=\r\nern history; or Western institutions that have been set up explicitly to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; spread its civilization; or various global campaigns under way to invade\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Indian civilization through conversions, education, media, political\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; policymaking and more.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He requested that I should present him my=\r\n findings on such matters so that\n&gt; &gt; he and his senior acharyas could lear=\r\nn. I told him that most gurus have\n&gt; &gt; little time to listen attentively to=\r\n a layperson like me, because the gurus\n&gt; &gt; like to do all the talking. He =\r\nreplied that he would sit and listen to me\n&gt; &gt; seriously. I made it clear t=\r\nhat I was disinterested in giving a short talk\n&gt; &gt; of a few minutes, becaus=\r\ne my findings required considerable time to be\n&gt; &gt; examined seriously. I to=\r\nld him that I would need two full days of undivided\n&gt; &gt; attention, so that =\r\nI could present 300 Powerpoint slides.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda sent me a=\r\nn invitation when I was in Delhi to visit his\n&gt; &gt; ashram and present my res=\r\nearch. I was delighted to have such an important\n&gt; &gt; audience. I was very i=\r\nmpressed by the fact that he sat through two long days\n&gt; &gt; of my talks, abo=\r\nut 12 hours per day. He asked his 40 top acharyas and\n&gt; &gt; various thought l=\r\neaders in his ashram to sit and listen to me for both the\n&gt; &gt; days. The int=\r\neractions were intense, and I explained many points from my\n&gt; &gt; forthcoming=\r\n books. I felt that he and I had a peer relationship, each side\n&gt; &gt; being a=\r\nn expert in his domain to teach the other. After my two days of talks\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nere over, he asked me to help him incorporate my core ideas into his\n&gt; &gt; cu=\r\nrriculum, so as to make sure that his teachings helped position the Vedic\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; civilization properly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No other guru in the world has invested =\r\nso much time with me to try and\n&gt; &gt; learn these global issues so deeply. (T=\r\nhe only other prominent guru I know\n&gt; &gt; personally who understands these is=\r\nsues about the external challenges is\n&gt; &gt; Swami Dayananda Saraswati.) Most =\r\ngurus tend to either be dismissive by\n&gt; &gt; resorting to spiritual loftiness,=\r\n or imagine that they already know whatever\n&gt; &gt; there is worth knowing. Thu=\r\ns, my primary interest in Swami Nithyananda was\n&gt; &gt; as a vehicle to spread =\r\ngreater awareness of the kinds of issues that I was\n&gt; &gt; researching. (For i=\r\nnstance, he bought a couple of hundred copies of the\n&gt; &gt; book, &quot;Invading th=\r\ne Sacred&quot; at the full price, and made it required reading\n&gt; &gt; for all his a=\r\nshram residents.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I must balance this praise with criticism. In my=\r\n 2-day talks, I had\n&gt; &gt; explicitly discussed that many gurus were falling p=\r\nrey to sex scandals,\n&gt; &gt; often with women planted as part of sting operatio=\r\nns, or women in the inner\n&gt; &gt; circle who got too close and let things get o=\r\nut of control. Despite these\n&gt; &gt; warnings, it seems that nothing concrete w=\r\nas done to prevent or at least\n&gt; &gt; anticipate the crisis that was to follow=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My Approach to this Investigation\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the scandal brok=\r\ne out I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram\n&gt; &gt; management and foun=\r\nd them confident but confused. Probably they felt that\n&gt; &gt; the matter would=\r\n soon get forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite\n&gt; &gt; happened, a=\r\ns each day brought fresh allegations and sensational media\n&gt; &gt; coverage. Af=\r\nter several days had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\n&gt; &gt; study t=\r\nhe situation for myself. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra\n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\nactice with any women. Whatever I knew was based on what his followers\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntold me, because he was personally inaccessible for several days even after=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I reached Bangalore. I spent many hours daily with some of his ashram&#39;=\r\ns top\n&gt; &gt; team.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I wrote earlier in this article actually come=\r\ns later in the chronology\n&gt; &gt; of my investigation. But I presented it up fr=\r\nont because most readers are\n&gt; &gt; obsessed with getting my answer to only on=\r\ne single question: did he or did\n&gt; &gt; he not have sex? Nothing else seems to=\r\n matter to them, whereas my\n&gt; &gt; investigation&#39;s emphasis has been about iss=\r\nues broader and more\n&gt; &gt; consequential than any one man&#39;s morality.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Until I concluded my fact-finding 2-week period recently, I was unable to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; discuss the sexual acts shown in the videotapes. I had to respect the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; policies of his people as part of the trust being placed in me to gain\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; access. They also needed legal clearance on what can and cannot be said=\r\n by\n&gt; &gt; them. Their policy on the sex tapes was that Swami Nithyananda woul=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; directly explain his acts. The Tamil actress&#39; lawyer was also in cont=\r\nact\n&gt; &gt; with them and her sensitivities had to be respected. The sensitivit=\r\nies of\n&gt; &gt; the 140-strong ashramites had to be protected also. Given this s=\r\net of\n&gt; &gt; circumstances facing me, I feel that it was unfair to demand that=\r\n I should\n&gt; &gt; hound him with the one critical question. People have assumed=\r\n that it was up\n&gt; &gt; to me to decide what would be within the scope of each =\r\ninterview. As I have\n&gt; &gt; mentioned earlier, even after certain interviews w=\r\nere recorded by me, the\n&gt; &gt; ashram leadership used its discretion not to ai=\r\nr them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In response to my critics on how I conducted my interviews=\r\n, I would also\n&gt; &gt; like to explain why I chose to focus on the criminal cha=\r\nrges being made\n&gt; &gt; against Swami Nithyananda. Besides the sex-tape being o=\r\nff limits as\n&gt; &gt; mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the criminal charges=\r\n became my focus\n&gt; &gt; for two reasons. These charges could be ascertained wi=\r\nth objectivity =96 such\n&gt; &gt; as asking for documents on the land ownership, =\r\nthe medical reports on the\n&gt; &gt; death of one meditation participant 2 years =\r\nago, and so forth. The evidence\n&gt; &gt; was more clear-cut than the evidence on=\r\n what exactly happened in the\n&gt; &gt; videotapes between two persons none of wh=\r\nom were willing to talk with me\n&gt; &gt; about it. Secondly, the consequences of=\r\n criminality would be far more severe\n&gt; &gt; than mere moral fallibility. Whil=\r\ne immoral conduct is a big concern for the\n&gt; &gt; devotees, it is not enough g=\r\nrounds by itself for the state to confiscate the\n&gt; &gt; entire property that r=\r\nuns into very large sums of money. Also, as a matter\n&gt; &gt; of principle, rega=\r\nrdless of whether or not he is guilty of the morality\n&gt; &gt; charge, I felt op=\r\nposed to spurious criminal charges being piled up by the\n&gt; &gt; irresponsible =\r\nmedia just to create sensationalism.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Conspiracy against Swami =\r\nNithyananda\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since I had arrived at the scene while writing my book=\r\n on the conspiracy in\n&gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu religious politics, it was natural to =\r\nstart with that as my\n&gt; &gt; emphasis for the investigation. But in this short=\r\n article I have decided to\n&gt; &gt; focus on the matters surrounding his conduct=\r\n and his organization&#39;s conduct,\n&gt; &gt; because these have assumed a more urge=\r\nnt nature. The details of the\n&gt; &gt; conspiracy belong in my book as corrobora=\r\nting evidence for my thesis there.\n&gt; &gt; The types of parties reported to be =\r\nbehind the conspiracy, both foreign and\n&gt; &gt; India based, were remarkably si=\r\nmilar to the ones I have written about in the\n&gt; &gt; book. So for now I shall =\r\nmerely summarize some of the main points concerning\n&gt; &gt; this conspiracy.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; First one must understand why Swami Nithyananda became such a target=\r\n. He was\n&gt; &gt; virtually unknown 7 years ago, but once he appeared in public =\r\nhis popularity\n&gt; &gt; catapulted at a dramatic rate. For example, last year, Y=\r\nouTube wrote to him\n&gt; &gt; that he was the most watched of all Indian spiritua=\r\nl leaders on the Internet\n&gt; &gt; and proposed a closer collaboration for their=\r\n viewers. This letter also\n&gt; &gt; stated that among all spiritual leaders worl=\r\ndwide (not just Indian) he was\n&gt; &gt; the second most popular one, the Vatican=\r\n being first. His meditation\n&gt; &gt; programs have become very popular in USA a=\r\nnd in certain Indian states. The\n&gt; &gt; main factors are that participants alm=\r\nost invariably report experiencing\n&gt; &gt; higher states of consciousness, and =\r\nhe has healed a large number of persons\n&gt; &gt; of a variety of diseases. His h=\r\nealing powers are what brought together his\n&gt; &gt; core inner group of devotee=\r\ns from around the world =96 doctors, businessmen,\n&gt; &gt; IT professionals, cor=\r\nporate executives. Many of them have explained their\n&gt; &gt; personal healings =\r\nfrom terminal illnesses as the turning point in their\n&gt; &gt; lives. His medita=\r\ntion programs sometimes bring up to a few thousand\n&gt; &gt; attendees for period=\r\ns ranging from a few days to several weeks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While the funds come m=\r\nostly from upper strata participants in India and USA,\n&gt; &gt; a large portion =\r\nof the expenses have been allocated to develop grass-roots\n&gt; &gt; social and s=\r\npiritual programs focusing primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native\n&gt; &gt; state. T=\r\nhis is where he is seen as a threat by Dravidian as well as\n&gt; &gt; Christian f=\r\norces. For instance, in December 2009, about 600 villages across\n&gt; &gt; Tamil =\r\nNadu sent their local &quot;Nithyananda leaders&quot; for a celebration and\n&gt; &gt; plann=\r\ning session in his main ashram near Bangalore. I happened to be present\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n for the event. These common folks, mostly from the lower strata of Tamil\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; society, had walked 300 kilometers for this journey, which they saw as a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; spiritual pilgrimage. The reason for the anger of Christian and Dravid=\r\nian\n&gt; &gt; forces is that his activities have put a dampener to conversions in=\r\n many\n&gt; &gt; districts, and several Christians have returned to Hinduism by ge=\r\ntting\n&gt; &gt; initiated formally into his organization. The swami himself has s=\r\npoken\n&gt; &gt; against conversions, and has also stated that the Dravidian movem=\r\nent had\n&gt; &gt; made Tamil people unspiritual in their lives, and that this had=\r\n caused\n&gt; &gt; social decay. His Tamil language publications and courses have =\r\nbecome his\n&gt; &gt; most popular ones, far exceeding the numbers in English. Als=\r\no he is a very\n&gt; &gt; big threat because he is not a Brahmin. Because he canno=\r\nt be targeted using\n&gt; &gt; the classic attack strategies used on Brahmins, and=\r\n because the masses in\n&gt; &gt; Tamil Nadu were rising to swell his ranks, the t=\r\nhreat he posed to the\n&gt; &gt; existing political power structure had to be stop=\r\nped one way or another.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The attack against Swami Nithyananda has c=\r\nonsisted of two prongs, destroying\n&gt; &gt; his image and alleging legal misdeed=\r\ns. At first a highly sensational sexual\n&gt; &gt; charge was broadcast in order t=\r\no devastate his credibility and create an\n&gt; &gt; atmosphere in which any and a=\r\nll kinds of outlandish allegations would be\n&gt; &gt; taken at face value. Once t=\r\nhe media and popular sentiments had been turned\n&gt; &gt; against him, there was =\r\none amazing allegation after another in rapid\n&gt; &gt; sequence. It was clear th=\r\nat none of this was spontaneous but was being\n&gt; &gt; centrally orchestrated un=\r\nder a systematic plan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What became evident to me was that there wa=\r\ns &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\n&gt; &gt; unofficial ways among the media, police=\r\n and lower level judiciary. In fact,\n&gt; &gt; many third parties were aware of t=\r\nhe attack in advance and had warned his\n&gt; &gt; people before it happened with =\r\nspecific details of the plan. For instance,\n&gt; &gt; one of his top devotees got=\r\n a phone call from someone based in New York\n&gt; &gt; describing the media and p=\r\nolice attack that was to come. His predictions\n&gt; &gt; turned out to be accurat=\r\ne but at that time the ashramites did not take the\n&gt; &gt; threat literally. He=\r\n said that for the right sum of money he could be\n&gt; &gt; helpful in preventing=\r\n such an attack. He claimed that the planning for this\n&gt; &gt; attack had start=\r\ned a year ago. He mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\n&gt; &gt; was allocate=\r\nd by some overseas groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in\n&gt; &gt; south I=\r\nndia, and named two south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to\n&gt; &gt; coor=\r\ndinate this strategic plan. (I am presently pursuing these leads as part\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; of my book investigation.)\n&gt; &gt; There was another concrete extortion effor=\r\nt about eleven or twelve days\n&gt; &gt; prior to the scandal breaking out. A lawy=\r\ner contacted them and claimed that\n&gt; &gt; his client had compromising videos, =\r\nand that the client was seeking money or\n&gt; &gt; else they would get released. =\r\nThe same intermediary later sent a letter\n&gt; &gt; containing a variety of unsub=\r\nstantiated criminal allegations against Swami\n&gt; &gt; Nithyananda, and this let=\r\nter&#39;s distribution list included India&#39;s Prime\n&gt; &gt; Minister, President, Son=\r\nya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various Chief Ministers\n&gt; &gt; and police heads, v=\r\narious national criminal investigation and security\n&gt; &gt; organizations. I ha=\r\nve a copy of this letter, and it makes the Nithyananda\n&gt; &gt; organization see=\r\nm like a terrorist outfit that needs to be attacked for the\n&gt; &gt; sake of pub=\r\nlic safety. This letter along with a DVD of the sex video was\n&gt; &gt; delivered=\r\n to the Chief Minister of Karnataka state two hours before the\n&gt; &gt; videotap=\r\ne was first aired. Clearly, the attack was well planned and executed\n&gt; &gt; ac=\r\nross many locations, and was persistently carried out over several days.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; This is not the work of some isolated individuals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There were wa=\r\nrnings given to individuals in the ashram that their phones\n&gt; &gt; were being =\r\ntapped and that they better leave to save their own lives,\n&gt; &gt; because some=\r\nthing horrible was about to happen. One friendly man based in\n&gt; &gt; Pune who =\r\nruns a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nithyananda, told the\n&gt; &gt; ashram =\r\na week in advance of the attack that some such catastrophe would\n&gt; &gt; happen=\r\n. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press Club. Another\n&gt; &gt; pub=\r\nlisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda&#39;s books in Telugu,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; called three times to warn that a graphic video would be released and gav=\r\ne a\n&gt; &gt; precise time for this to happen. It was also reported that an Ameri=\r\ncan\n&gt; &gt; devotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in association=\r\n with one\n&gt; &gt; Jody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a prominent we=\r\nb site. He was\n&gt; &gt; being helped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was on=\r\nce very deeply\n&gt; &gt; involved inside the Nithyananda organization but had tur=\r\nned malicious. The\n&gt; &gt; only man who has openly come out as the main accuser=\r\n was an ashramite who\n&gt; &gt; had a falling out when he got demoted due to his =\r\nconduct. It was recently\n&gt; &gt; reported that he had a prior criminal record a=\r\ngainst him but nobody in the\n&gt; &gt; ashram had checked out his background befo=\r\nre admitting him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There were constant threats received to harass t=\r\nhe ashramites and scare them\n&gt; &gt; away, with claims that &quot;narcotics will be =\r\nplanted to cause arrest warrants.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; The actions by the police were being=\r\n leaked to the media ahead of time and\n&gt; &gt; even to the opposing side, leadi=\r\nng to numerous &quot;tips&quot; received by &quot;friends&quot;\n&gt; &gt; asking the ashram dwellers =\r\nto run away before &quot;the attack comes.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But even after a couple of =\r\nweeks since the scandal has erupted, the lawyers\n&gt; &gt; for Swami Nithyananda&#39;=\r\ns ashram have failed to get copies of any concrete\n&gt; &gt; charges filed with t=\r\nhe police, except a few trivial ones. Each time they\n&gt; &gt; approach for speci=\r\nfic details they are told that there is no formal charge,\n&gt; &gt; except relati=\r\nvely minor ones. So the intimidation has been carried out\n&gt; &gt; mainly throug=\r\nh media reports, without any legal due process starting where\n&gt; &gt; facts and=\r\n arguments could get cross-examined. This lack of formal charges\n&gt; &gt; has en=\r\nabled an atmosphere of intimidation using rumors and threats that\n&gt; &gt; canno=\r\nt be pinned down officially.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is important to contrast this with=\r\n the manner in which Indian media\n&gt; &gt; treats scandals facing Islamic or Chr=\r\nistian groups. The numerous scandals\n&gt; &gt; occurring overseas often get block=\r\ned by Indian media entirely, or are given\n&gt; &gt; mild treatment with tremendou=\r\ns sensitivity, in order to be seen as &quot;secular&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and not &quot;communal.&quot; By =\r\ncontrast every kind of allegation against any Hindu\n&gt; &gt; group gets clubbed =\r\nin one homogeneous category and treated as a social\n&gt; &gt; scourge equivalent =\r\nto terror groups.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The media&#39;s hounding mentality and mafia tactics=\r\n deserve to be condemned. In\n&gt; &gt; the Swami Nithyananda case, they have used=\r\n carrots and sticks to lure and\n&gt; &gt; threaten, using whatever would get them=\r\n more sensational footage. Several TV\n&gt; &gt; stations and journalists camped o=\r\nut in Haridwar and sent me emails\n&gt; &gt; requesting my help in arranging an in=\r\nterview. When I failed to deliver\n&gt; &gt; (because it was not up to me to deliv=\r\ner any such thing), some of them turned\n&gt; &gt; nasty against me. One TV woman =\r\npromised the swami&#39;s people &quot;positive&quot;\n&gt; &gt; coverage if she got an exclusive=\r\n. But after the interview, she betrayed them\n&gt; &gt; and turned it into more di=\r\nstortion and smut. This led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; handlers to give interv=\r\niews to more stations in order to counteract this\n&gt; &gt; distortion. But the m=\r\nore they said before TV cameras, the worse the scandal\n&gt; &gt; became. One stat=\r\nion was blatant in its threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\n&gt; &gt; you don&#39;t g=\r\nive us an interview right away, we will show you the power of the\n&gt; &gt; media=\r\n to destroy you.&quot; At one point a major TV station also wanted to drag\n&gt; &gt; i=\r\nn Ramakrishna Mission with similar allegations, but someone was able to\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n stop that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Failures of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s Organization\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHindu tradition separates three kinds of Varna (skills), each representing =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; form of social capital, and these three were never supposed to be\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n concentrated in a single person, thereby preventing too much concentration=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; of power. I use the terms Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not as birth =\r\nbased\n&gt; &gt; &quot;caste,&quot; but as merit based social capital and areas of competenc=\r\ne. The\n&gt; &gt; Brahmin job description focuses on spirituality and research; Ks=\r\nhatriya on\n&gt; &gt; governance, politics and leadership; and Vaishyas on commerc=\r\ne and financial\n&gt; &gt; capital. Swami Nithyananda had persons with Brahmin qua=\r\nlities performing\n&gt; &gt; duties that demand Kshatriya and Vaishya skills. This=\r\n was counterproductive.\n&gt; &gt; The ashram leaders were selected and trained fo=\r\nr skills and roles that are\n&gt; &gt; very different than this situation demands.=\r\n Too often their bhakti and\n&gt; &gt; spiritual practice substituted for professi=\r\nonal competence in managing a\n&gt; &gt; rapidly growing global enterprise. The so=\r\nle emphasis was placed on\n&gt; &gt; traditional Brahmin qualities, and none on wh=\r\nat would be considered\n&gt; &gt; Kshatriya qualities.\n&gt; &gt; For example, there are =\r\na large number of white devotees who do have\n&gt; &gt; Kshatriyata - leadership e=\r\nxpertise, courage and commitment. But even after\n&gt; &gt; this attack the ashram=\r\n organization has blundered in its failure to leverage\n&gt; &gt; and deploy them.=\r\n I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and found them\n&gt; &gt; remarkably =\r\nwilling to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bothered to\n&gt; &gt; organize=\r\n them and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyananda has a\n&gt; &gt; globa=\r\nl following. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the crisis, his\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nrganization was in utter chaos, reacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the other side.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Its leaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after another.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nDecisions were being made in desperation and panic. The group was\n&gt; &gt; cogni=\r\ntively disoriented and many of its members were psychologically\n&gt; &gt; breakin=\r\ng down.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The organization was too much of a one-man show with the l=\r\neaders operating\n&gt; &gt; like children dependent on the swami for every decisio=\r\nn. The swami had\n&gt; &gt; become the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inner circle.=\r\n Their proximity to\n&gt; &gt; him became their measure of personal power and iden=\r\ntity. This is classical\n&gt; &gt; cult-like behavior that cannot survive the onsl=\r\naughts that are inevitable\n&gt; &gt; nowadays. Such a concentration of all varnas=\r\n into one man not only makes an\n&gt; &gt; enterprise incompetent, but it also can=\r\n also get to the leader&#39;s head and\n&gt; &gt; make him power hungry. Especially wh=\r\nen the guru has siddhis, this power can\n&gt; &gt; easily become co-opted by his e=\r\ngo into a dangerous mixture. The result is\n&gt; &gt; that he surrounds himself wi=\r\nth sycophants who tell him what he wants to\n&gt; &gt; hear, and this feedback loo=\r\np of self glorification turns into group\n&gt; &gt; delusion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I noticed t=\r\nhis in the form of the inner circle&#39;s inability to make common\n&gt; &gt; sense ju=\r\ndgments, and their misrepresenting the facts to their leader by\n&gt; &gt; giving =\r\nhim too much &quot;good news.&quot; The result was that the honest truth did\n&gt; &gt; not =\r\ncome out fast enough to allow pragmatic and realistic planning. I had a\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n difficult time to get dependable information, and the stories kept changin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; not only over time but also between one person and another within the=\r\n group.\n&gt; &gt; I could not tell if there was a cover up and if new lies were f=\r\nabricated to\n&gt; &gt; cover prior lies. In such an atmosphere one cannot tell wh=\r\nich individuals\n&gt; &gt; might have a separate stake and vested interest from th=\r\ne group. Lacking\n&gt; &gt; competent Kshatriyas, the swami had not anticipated th=\r\nat such a crisis was\n&gt; &gt; ever possible, despite the fact that outsiders (in=\r\ncluding myself in my 2-day\n&gt; &gt; talks at his ashram) had explained to them t=\r\nhe threats facing every\n&gt; &gt; prominent Hindu mahatma today.\n&gt; &gt; While on the=\r\n one hand I blame those in positions of responsibility at the\n&gt; &gt; ashram, u=\r\nltimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibility as he selected\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\nm, defined their roles, evaluated their performance, motivated and\n&gt; &gt; supe=\r\nrvised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual capabilities had\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; failed to evaluate those very close to him as well as the external realit=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; An enlightened master must do better than this, or else he must not =\r\ntry to\n&gt; &gt; control everything so personally.\n&gt; &gt; I acknowledge that being a=\r\n global guru is very demanding today, given that\n&gt; &gt; one has to represent a=\r\n very old tradition authentically and yet in a manner\n&gt; &gt; that appeals to m=\r\nodern people. This is why Hindu leaders need a crash course\n&gt; &gt; on matters =\r\nthat are well beyond the traditional education in their own\n&gt; &gt; sampradayas=\r\n (lineages).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hindu Chaos\n&gt; &gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s own support base =\r\nin India has started to distance itself\n&gt; &gt; out of self preservation amidst=\r\n all the rumors and slander. His closest\n&gt; &gt; supporters were not approached=\r\n soon enough with his side of the story, and\n&gt; &gt; by the time they were appr=\r\noached the damage to his credibility was already\n&gt; &gt; irreversible. They did=\r\n not want to risk being associated with a &quot;fallen\n&gt; &gt; guru.&quot; Many Hindu gur=\r\nus have started to publicly lash out against the\n&gt; &gt; &quot;fallen godman&quot;; other=\r\ns became silent or neutral publicly, while offering\n&gt; &gt; private sympathy bu=\r\nt refusing to stick their necks out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One factor is that the swami&#39;=\r\ns approach was too conservative for some and\n&gt; &gt; too liberal for others. It=\r\n is too filled with deities, symbols and rituals\n&gt; &gt; of a very orthodox kin=\r\nd for the aesthetic taste of modern global gurus who\n&gt; &gt; propagate a whiten=\r\ned, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism that is abstract and\n&gt; &gt; metaphysical but =\r\ndevoid of imagery associated with &quot;primitive paganism.&quot; At\n&gt; &gt; the other en=\r\nd of the spectrum are orthodox Hindu leaders who find his idea\n&gt; &gt; of youth=\r\nful dancing, celebration, and liberal atmosphere to be not &quot;real&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Hindu=\r\nism. A couple of shankaracharyas interviewed on NDTV lashed out against\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;false&quot; gurus and claimed that only the shankaracharyas had the authority =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; certify who was qualified to be a guru. So Swami Nithyananda fits ne=\r\nither\n&gt; &gt; end of this spectrum.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many of the gurus I met have told =\r\nme in confidence that they fear that\n&gt; &gt; similar attacks are coming to more=\r\n Hindu gurus, but that there is no central\n&gt; &gt; Hindu mechanism to deal with=\r\n these episodes along the lines of various\n&gt; &gt; Church mechanisms that inter=\r\nvene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent\n&gt; &gt; feelers to the Hindu Dha=\r\nrma Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to\n&gt; &gt; step in and take ove=\r\nr the ashram and its related organizations, thereby\n&gt; &gt; bringing new manage=\r\nment to clean up matters and bring stability to the\n&gt; &gt; enterprise. I was t=\r\nold that while this was a &quot;good idea in principle,&quot; it\n&gt; &gt; was not practica=\r\nl because HDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The Way For=\r\nward\n&gt; &gt; My overriding concern throughout this investigation has been to fi=\r\nnd a way\n&gt; &gt; to do damage control in order to protect the broader interests=\r\n of dharma.\n&gt; &gt; This requires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affa=\r\nirs, it seems\n&gt; &gt; that the mess cannot be created without the swami leaving=\r\n the movement and\n&gt; &gt; going into a strictly private life of meditation and =\r\nself inquiry. I worry\n&gt; &gt; for the young ashramites who I feel are amazing i=\r\nndividuals but in need of\n&gt; &gt; proper mentoring. They have a solid commitmen=\r\nt to the cause and their\n&gt; &gt; personal spiritual paths, but they lack the so=\r\nphistication and maturity to\n&gt; &gt; deal with what they face today.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nwami Nithyananda should resign immediately and hand over all his\n&gt; &gt; organi=\r\nzations to senior spiritual masters, preferably Shaivites practicing\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne Shiva Sutras and related traditions. He told me in an interview hat I\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n recorded on March 9th that he was willing to leave everything and become a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; wandering sadhu again. I wish that interview had been aired.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe new spiritual leaders would give the ashram a new life and chance to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; revive itself. It could either remain a place for spiritual training or t=\r\nurn\n&gt; &gt; itself into a Hindu social service organization. Either way it woul=\r\nd be a\n&gt; &gt; better outcome than the likely alternative of the government ste=\r\npping in to\n&gt; &gt; take over the ashram and turn it over to administrators who=\r\n are not\n&gt; &gt; positively disposed to Hindu spirituality =96 as has happened =\r\nin numerous\n&gt; &gt; similar cases of government takeovers of Hindu temples and =\r\norganizations\n&gt; &gt; despite government claims of its actions being &quot;secular&quot;.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Besides giving up the organization, Swami Nithyananda should retu=\r\nrn to his\n&gt; &gt; personal sadhana under the guidance of these spiritual leader=\r\ns. Let them\n&gt; &gt; evaluate him and his organization, and issue their independ=\r\nent report to the\n&gt; &gt; public. Swami Nithyananda should fearlessly and humbl=\r\ny submit himself to\n&gt; &gt; their judgment of what happened and what the remedi=\r\nes ought to be.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hinduism has survived for many millennia and faced=\r\n many kinds of crises,\n&gt; &gt; just like all the other major religions of the w=\r\norld. It has its own\n&gt; &gt; internal resources and mechanisms to deal with suc=\r\nh situations. These need\n&gt; &gt; to be put to use and they need to become moder=\r\nnized. This is not the last\n&gt; &gt; such scandal Hindu groups are going to face=\r\n in the near future.\n&gt; &gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and=\r\n evil is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
