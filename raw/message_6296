It was fine but I wil=\r\nl need practice to keep the fire going as the wind made it go out twice and=\r\n I didn&#39;t bring all the materials I had planned to, so I didn&#39;t have extra =\r\ncamphor. However it was a great experience and I felt very energized after =\r\nand got a lot of work done which I had been putting off.\nI included parts o=\r\nf the manual for before and after and used the way I have seen in our commu=\r\nnity while growing up.\nI didn&#39;t do a panchopachar puja as I did a more gene=\r\nral havan with mantras to many devtas as the main part. I know for the spec=\r\nialized homam, different deity mantras may not be recommended due to their =\r\ndifferent energies but I am hoping to do a general version on most Sundays =\r\nnow.\n\nHowever, for Narasimha Chaturdashi I would like to know how we should=\r\n do prana pratishta and anganyas, karanyas, etc? I know the beej mantra is =\r\nkshraum but I am not sure if we can use that in all of anganyas and karanya=\r\ns ?\nWe should observe this vrat on Sunday in the West, correct? and would t=\r\nhe best time for homam be in the twilight when Lord Narasingha appeared?\n\n\n"}}
