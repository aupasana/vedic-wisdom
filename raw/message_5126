Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay =\r\naway from internet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year=\r\n since I interacted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forw=\r\narded a copy of the original post with my write up to my inbox, I visited t=\r\nhis forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that t=\r\nhe general atmosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of oth=\r\ner forums. Having quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought=\r\n that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an=\r\n important question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address i=\r\nt after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to un=\r\nderstand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the que=\r\nstion a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whet=\r\nher initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *m=\r\ny* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being i=\r\nnitiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =\r\n=C2=96YES.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; t=\r\nhereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arise=\r\ns the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context the=\r\nre are many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question =\r\nI will restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spi=\r\nritual)\n&gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sp=\r\niritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Trut=\r\nhs of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and=\r\n techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experi=\r\nential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques em=\r\nployed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented=\r\n to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessar=\r\ny, though one can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genui=\r\nne teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Di=\r\nscernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmi=\r\nnation of the Vaidik system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhya=\r\nya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of thes=\r\ne practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for extern=\r\nal practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by cons=\r\nistent practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu sch=\r\nools of Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself t=\r\nowards the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga =\r\nemphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;=\r\ns will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis=\r\n in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in=\r\n actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga o=\r\nf the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadh=\r\nana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the nece=\r\nssity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of cer=\r\ntain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Va=\r\nk. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereb=\r\ny certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that exce=\r\npt Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bha=\r\nkti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-=\r\nSomeeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the =\r\nfire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of aust=\r\nerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab=\r\n-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniqu=\r\nes that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhi=\r\nkara is not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a=\r\n child to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor=\r\n need experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper =\r\ntraining and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety=\r\n measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too.  However the lab is one&#39;s own=\r\n consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the indi=\r\nvidual consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not =\r\na topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussio=\r\nn on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will =\r\njust elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since we are talk=\r\ning about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tan=\r\ntric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric conte=\r\nxt. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. =\r\nHowever there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living=\r\n traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri =\r\nSri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya  sadhana belongs to=\r\n Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the B=\r\nuddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan=\r\n Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajra=\r\nyana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its =\r\napproach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not t=\r\nhat Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, =\r\nat least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yan=\r\ntra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of =\r\nsynchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is t=\r\nhe full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual linea=\r\nge of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED T=\r\nREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch =\r\nand sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the indiv=\r\nidual sadhaka.  It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another=\r\n modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the=\r\n Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary =\r\nfor the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine man=\r\ny beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires,=\r\n where there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all th=\r\ne way up till Siva himself.  It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and S=\r\nound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta =\r\nsadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through a=\r\nn integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, =\r\nJapa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly compreh=\r\nensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in t=\r\nhe One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However=\r\n it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It i=\r\ns also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The que=\r\nstion of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and=\r\n thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the t=\r\next as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have cov=\r\nered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the =\r\nAdvaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful r=\r\neflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the cro=\r\nwning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims=\r\n in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, sayi=\r\nng &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). =\r\nCompare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the c=\r\nentral truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to =\r\nread in English or any other regional language is because understanding the=\r\n meaning and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly read=\r\ns the text  in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the =\r\nwriteup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from=\r\n its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally =\r\nregarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In t=\r\nhat regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equ=\r\nally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.=\r\n Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway =\r\nidentify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worshi=\r\np of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a o=\r\nne on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jus=\r\nt as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi =\r\nsadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere t=\r\no the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is th=\r\nis particular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Ini=\r\ntiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vich=\r\nara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approa=\r\nch of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not r=\r\nequired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritu=\r\nal/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri C=\r\nhandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing tradit=\r\nions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various=\r\n parts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and =\r\nhence the importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or=\r\n Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through an=\r\ny of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichar=\r\na, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa e=\r\ntc are all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, apti=\r\ntude etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different pr=\r\nactitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods=\r\n in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIK=\r\nULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the an=\r\nswer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally one last wo=\r\nrd. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the mo=\r\nst effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of text=\r\ns followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best=\r\n done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it =\r\nis the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate =\r\nmethod (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Sats=\r\nangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spirit=\r\nual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serv=\r\ning, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in h=\r\nis younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva  and  Gorakhnath  made a quantum l=\r\neap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrish=\r\nna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who co=\r\nmplain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Si=\r\nvananda:\n&gt; &gt; QUOTE  // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that =\r\nthere are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is=\r\n a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply =\r\nwill come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really =\r\nthirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-l=\r\nucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care=\r\n a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and va=\r\nin, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and =\r\nname and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make =\r\nyourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to t=\r\nhe lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide yo=\r\nu and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are w=\r\naiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. =\r\nReal seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; =\r\nMahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Trut=\r\nh.&quot;.&quot;  //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportu=\r\nnity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too =\r\nis a potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual company of the=\r\n great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alon=\r\ngside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramaha=\r\nmsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the M=\r\nother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and as=\r\nat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes p=\r\nrogress truly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least for =\r\na while. However I might participate in some discussions on and off.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few times.

Beca=\r\nuse of this ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results =\r\nand not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives.

Similarly, a gu=\r\nru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple.=\r\n However, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank acco=\r\nunt with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work.=\r\n Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras=\r\n and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you =\r\n(not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, jus=\r\nt go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for=\r\n two purposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (ii) as tools=\r\n of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii)=\r\n, initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitf=\r\nalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherw=\r\nise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few p=\r\neople who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole system, =\r\nfor a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only =\r\nfor increasing surrender, getting whatever material results god wants to gi=\r\nve and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetti=\r\nng *specific* material results (for oneself or others or society/universe i=\r\nn general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge =\r\nof such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of =\r\n(ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any=\r\n ritual or any homam, do it  with the attitude of &quot;I have several material =\r\ndesires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god =\r\nmay give any material results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulf=\r\nil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devo=\r\ntion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiat=\r\nion is not required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. =\r\nFierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave thi=\r\ns analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from =\r\na fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good=\r\n fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and t=\r\nhe spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is=\r\n aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fr=\r\nuits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be=\r\n retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deit=\r\ny is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a goo=\r\nd fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, =\r\nVishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the spi=\r\nllage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Na=\r\nrasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations,=\r\n but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat e=\r\nach of those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; N=\r\nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is be=\r\ntter off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler de=\r\nities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru befor=\r\ne starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras with=\r\nout initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a=\r\n fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good resul=\r\nts. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) =\r\nSome people who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals=\r\n, are doing daily homam now. Some people who took several hours to read Sap=\r\ntashati for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam w=\r\nith entire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a=\r\n lot and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhan=\r\na with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past=\r\n lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, =\r\nif someone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is l=\r\nooking for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandi=\r\npath), that person obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That pe=\r\nrson has done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is o=\r\nne&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what=\r\n is what, how things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what =\r\nis more important and what is less important, that is what initiation is al=\r\nl about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;             =\r\n      http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      Films that make a differe=\r\nnce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal opi=\r\nnion that Strong and long standing urge should be considered as Initiation =\r\nat least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi=\r\n paatha regularly but was not able to almost for a year.
