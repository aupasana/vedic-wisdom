Yes, trying =\r\nto delink the kundalini experience and defining it in terms modern has seri=\r\nous problems because the modern western thought structure is NOT build to t=\r\nackle this is all its manifestations and subtlety. There are deep fundament=\r\nal differences which cannot be bridged. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I knew an person who had a =\r\nsimilar experience graph. First he sees a huge allconsuimg light, a feeling=\r\n of endless love and joy and beauty, a nice powerful state of mind and body=\r\n, then a voice starts speaking and telling him how special he is, eventuall=\r\ny the voice gives him sexual and/or murderous instructions. His state deter=\r\niorated so badly that his folks at home took him to a hundred doctors from =\r\nUS to UK to whatnot, he simply could not be cured. I don&#39;t know what happen=\r\ned later on. They also went to many spiritual God-men yet nothing happened.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is when due to sudden life experiences the ordinary min=\r\nd calms down, and some form of shakti awakens, it also opens up some part o=\r\nf the human mind-body complex to ALL influences. Herein lies the catch. The=\r\n person is as much opened up to positive influences as s/he is to negative =\r\ninfluences. The subtle world is as good or as bad as our physical world. It=\r\n will require some deep maturity to understand teh right from teh wrong in =\r\nthis world. As such this plane has no Light (prakash) of the Supreme. Each,=\r\n when they enter, must bring in his/her own Light. Many over ages have lost=\r\n their path in this world. Beyond the astral lies teh causal world. Accessi=\r\nng this is MUCH more difficult and rarely will a person experience a Kundal=\r\nini awakening which takes him/her to this plane directly. Here, nothing eve=\r\nn remotely negative in nature can survive, not even the mightest Asura.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;Coming to teh world of the sukshma jagat, to survive such a sudden openin=\r\ng into this mixed world the consciousness has to be prepared deeply with pr=\r\ne-fed conducive ideals of love, peace, purity, equanamity, non-attachment, =\r\ngreater reverence for a Devata, humility etc etc. The spiritual-cultural cu=\r\nshioning has to be ready and well integrated to survive this. This is sadha=\r\nna or bhuta-suddhi, constant self-purification. The best protection, if suc=\r\nh a thing is possible, is to open up the heart completely by going deeper i=\r\nn meditation behind the vishnu granthi. There is an inherent Light inside i=\r\nt. IF this process is done properly, then this inherent Light of the Divine=\r\n accompanies the sadhaka at all times and there is no chance of delusion ev=\r\ner. Unlike the mind, which knows very little and gets swayed by appearances=\r\n, the true heart can never be deluded. Of course, even getting to this open=\r\ning of the heart is not easy at all and may take lifetimes of\n efforts.=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0Typically when self-importance increases due to an unprovoked=\r\n K experience, it is because the manipura chakra - and the individuals sens=\r\ne of power and control and authority has not yet been made to submit to the=\r\n Divine. Sexual thoughts awaken because the instict of lust has not yet bee=\r\nn submited to the Divine. ETC ETC. The human self is not one but a composit=\r\ne of many things. Each part has to be controlled and offered to the Supreme=\r\n. THAT is the highest sadhana. Our Rishis understood the complex nature of =\r\nthe human mind-body far far better than what western medicine understands t=\r\noday.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAna=\r\nnto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt;F=\r\nrom: Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, 2 March 2013 9:21 AM\n&gt;=\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 YES=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0 homame=C2=A0=C2=A0 is=C2=A0=C2=A0 the=C2=A0 =\r\nbest .=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0But the main culprit is vat=\r\na dosha and while attending to that ,the symptoms also have to be allieviat=\r\ned .

But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini ri=\r\nses from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experien=\r\nces, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- =\r\nin other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucination=\r\ns or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. Howev=\r\ner most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; p=\r\natients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend=\r\n to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my h=\r\nead&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. About vata, most of our patients h=\r\nave severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable to sle=\r\nep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try and =\r\nhelp with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannabis an=\r\nd other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this does no\n good for v=\r\nata.The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on her behalf a=\r\ns (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient. Can anti-p=\r\nsychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalini patient? Most docto=\r\nrs label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and will advise anti-psychotics =\r\ne.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not harm them, though I do=\r\nubt it will help.Advice and thoughts from all members would be much appreci=\r\nated.Om Dum Durgayai NamahaAparna--- In mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

See all the saints. You are unlikely to see even one who lived a=\r\n life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(when looked at b=\r\ny an external\n observer). However the internal joy of Kundalini is somethin=\r\ng which fills that saint so completely that some great ones were completely=\r\n unaware of their external problems.&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens=\r\n it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini ris=\r\ne to a baby being thrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy i=\r\ns tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that =\r\nit can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&gt; &gt;T=\r\nhe problem with adults is that they have to learn surrender. This surrender=\r\ning of ego to the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painless process un=\r\nlike that of the baby.&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges=\r\n&quot; of energy may=C2=A0result=C2=A0in mental havoc.=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Secondly, m=\r\nany people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of japa.=\r\n Japa which deals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can cause s=\r\nerious instability in these\n people.&gt; &gt;Some=C2=A0of the=C2=A0people who hav=\r\ne Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a sin=\r\ngle worthwhile thing in their lives and think that the faking of Kundalini =\r\nrises may help them get some esteem in the eye of the general public.=C2=A0=\r\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, for any doctor, the separatio=\r\nn of the true from the false claims must precede any attempt at helping the=\r\n patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to =\r\nlike irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.=\r\n=C2=A0&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all=C2=A0that must be regimentalised, then appropr=\r\niate herbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Applicat=\r\nion of oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even =\r\nShiro basti in difficult real cases may be useful.&gt; &gt;Then institute small=\r\n=C2=A0Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the pati=\r\nent. That should really improve matters, as\n Ganesha is The Lord of the Mul=\r\nadhara.&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two years.&gt; &gt;In pur=\r\ne non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree R=\r\nama&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.=\r\nR.

It is just A SMALL&gt; STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limite=\r\nd identity.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One\n wanting to move from =\r\none&#39;s small dilapidated house (this&gt; body-mind complex) to a huge palace (r=\r\nealized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into it whe=\r\nn it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the pa=\r\nlace still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to K=\r\nundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The for=\r\nmer approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progr=\r\ness towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. =\r\nThese are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putti=\r\nng sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini ri=\r\nse in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may =\r\nbe getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even w=\r\nant it!) when it comes in this life.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;As you\n do sadhana, try n=\r\not to fancy too many specific&gt; desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in gra=\r\nnting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you righ=\r\nt now, arising from YOUR&gt; OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives =\r\nyou what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. =\r\nFor example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as =\r\na rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pr=\r\nay whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, =\r\nbut not have any knowledge or money. In another &gt; case, one may deeply desi=\r\nre to act in a famous film. One may be reborn &gt; as a tiger or a dog and act=\r\n in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &gt; experience. Basically, peopl=\r\ne keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something t=\r\nhey are &quot;missing&quot;.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one de=\r\neply desires an out of body experience given by a\n rising Kundalini and one=\r\n&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be bo=\r\nrn in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is=\r\n enough karmik force behind it).&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0&gt; *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepare=\r\nd in terms of attitude and detachment.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk g=\r\nlued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and starte=\r\nd to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it wa=\r\ns scared that I would kill it!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glue=\r\nd to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescu=\r\ned from a certain slow death!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (v=\r\niz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infini=\r\nte Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that at some stag=\r\ne involve stepping out of this body-mind\n complex, without being scared?&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirab=\r\nle conditioning is overcome, is far better than&gt; Kundalini rise forced when=\r\n some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what=\r\n one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spri=\r\nng to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the bo=\r\ndy&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awar=\r\neness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a=\r\n great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep d=\r\nesire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a r=\r\ne-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awarenes=\r\ns (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. T=\r\nhe person may show some\n signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and =\r\nget stuck badly.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesi=\r\nrable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavil=\r\ny and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in t=\r\nerms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your&gt; weaknesses =\r\nand improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that deta=\r\nchment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgus=\r\nt is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worr=\r\ny about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8=\r\n bondages (ashta pashas) or &gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increa=\r\nsing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you a=\r\nre still making\n progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (yo=\r\nur self-awareness) &gt; will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord=\r\n (true Self).&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrende=\r\nring to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do =\r\nnot have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may be offende=\r\nd by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I w=\r\nill pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, =\r\nI will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business dea=\r\nl. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has n=\r\no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is lo=\r\nsing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender=\r\n is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or =\r\nhighly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrende=\r\nr\n is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (=\r\nand during) Death.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many=\r\n desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be t=\r\nrapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not wan=\r\nt to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering=\r\n. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was =\r\ntrying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning make=\r\ns one *run away* from God&#39;s&gt; protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a con=\r\nditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surren=\r\nder, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary =\r\nand can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your =\r\nbest, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment\n and a ve=\r\nry light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect=\r\n one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and imp=\r\nurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and =\r\nstop Her from meeting True Self.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light you=\r\nr conditioning is.&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&gt; &gt;&gt;A=\r\nstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt; &gt;&gt;-----=\r\n---&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: L=\r\neela Sastry &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; mailto:vedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perfectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intens=\r\ne bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadh=\r\naka and remove most of the hurdles .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamar=\r\ngas with out any personal deity and\n manthra allow the other entities to en=\r\nter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Onc=\r\ne we are under the protection of=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 d=\r\nisturbances will definitely=C2=A0 be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification o=\r\nf the various elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpl=\r\ner words this translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-re=\r\nactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuin=\r\ne Kundalini awakening\n happens, one has to now self identify with the Devat=\r\na with greater force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Deva=\r\nta then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shak=\r\nti awakens - IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and =\r\nbody to various other things and entities, some of which are not postive in=\r\n nature while some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make us=\r\ne of the individual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness =\r\nin character and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-su=\r\nddhi becomes even more&gt; vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka wil=\r\nl have an experience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all m=\r\naladies of psychology are because of this. The human psychology as understo=\r\nod by west today is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. I=\r\nt is also possible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects=\r\n us from\n various subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional en=\r\ntities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconven=\r\ntional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entiti=\r\nes inside the mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since al=\r\nl these are very complex and various possiblities are there, it is not poss=\r\nible to list down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is corre=\r\nctly done, very few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. =\r\nMany who claim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelli=\r\ngent guess work.&gt; Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all th=\r\nese to be achieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as =\r\nthe ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0=\r\nRajarshi &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |p=\r\naram bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From:\n su=\r\nnrise_1080 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thur=\r\nsday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndr=\r\nome&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundali=\r\nni syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing =\r\na psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone =\r\nwho seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini s=\r\nince childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of ene=\r\nrgy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundali=\r\nni until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have =\r\nnot been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)=\r\n- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we cal=\r\nl mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwante=\r\nd spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and\n researc=\r\nh into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients ar=\r\ne not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for=\r\n deranged&gt; kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly =\r\nwaken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that=\r\n kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself=\r\n at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She fee=\r\nls it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wonde=\r\nred what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pra=\r\ny to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffe=\r\nring of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear t=\r\nhis. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for=\r\n others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitia=\r\nble. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end\n up in this situ=\r\nation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is =\r\nperhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini&gt; =\r\nrising bit to God&#39;s will.

IF this process i=\r\ns done properly, then this inherent Light of the Divine accompanies the sad=\r\nhaka at all times and there is no chance of delusion ever. Unlike the mind,=\r\n which knows very little and\n gets swayed by appearances, the true heart ca=\r\nn never be deluded. Of course, even getting to this opening of the heart is=\r\n not easy at all and may take lifetimes of efforts.&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;Typically when self-importance increases due to an unprovo=\r\nked K experience, it is because the manipura chakra - and the individuals s=\r\nense of power and control and authority has not yet been made to submit to =\r\nthe Divine. Sexual thoughts awaken because the instict of lust has not yet =\r\nbeen submited to the Divine. ETC ETC. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;The human self is not one b=\r\nut a composite of many things. Each part has to be controlled and offered t=\r\no the Supreme. THAT is the highest sadhana. Our Rishis understood the compl=\r\nex nature of the human mind-body far far better than what western medicine =\r\nunderstands today.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dyiv1=\r\n014233860MsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 16px&quot; class=3Dyiv1014233860=\r\nApple-style-span&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(153,153,153)&quot; class=3Dyiv1014=\r\n233860Apple-style-span&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif&quot; class=3Dyiv1014233860yui_3_2_0_2_134=\r\n243527249950&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;B&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv1014233860yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv1014233860yui_3_2_0_2_13424352=\r\n7249952 yiv1014233860yui_3_7_2_17_1362203573447_73&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 f=\r\nace=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttama=\r\nm ||[7:24]&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-=\r\nserif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new yo=\r\nrk, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DAr=\r\nial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px sol=\r\nid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0; MARGIN: 5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px=\r\n; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px sol=\r\nid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3Dhr contentEdita=\r\nble=3Dfalse readonly=3D&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Fr=\r\nom:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Se=\r\nnt:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Saturday, 2 March 2013 9:21 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEI=\r\nGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrom=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1014233860&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n=\r\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1014233860ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FON=\r\nT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; COLOR: #000; FONT-SIZE: =\r\n10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; YES&nbsp; ,&nbsp; homame&nbsp;&nbsp; i=\r\ns&nbsp;&nbsp; the&nbsp; best .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But=\r\n the main culprit is vata dosha and while attending to that ,the symptoms a=\r\nlso have to be allieviated .

But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from non-kunda=\r\nlini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, such as seein=\r\ng/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in other words, wh=\r\nat doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or the result of=\r\n kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;However most =\r\ndoctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; patients =\r\nwith pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories tend to be p=\r\nretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my head&quot; sch=\r\nizophrenic or kundalini patient. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;About vata, most of our patients=\r\n have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually unable to s=\r\nleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. We try an=\r\nd help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of Cannabis =\r\nand other drugs is also notoriously common-\n I&#39;m sure this does no good for=\r\n vata.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;The Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do some on =\r\nher behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any patient=\r\n. &lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Can anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundali=\r\nni patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and will a=\r\ndvise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not =\r\nharm them, though I doubt it will help.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Advice and thoughts from a=\r\nll members would be much appreciated.&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;Om Dum Durgayai Namaha&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;=\r\nWBR&gt;Aparna&lt;WBR&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3Dnofollow&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%=\r\n40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Niyama i=\r\ns very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you. in actual fact, tha=\r\nt is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;However,&nbsp;the hold of the I ness on eve=\r\nrything is so tremendous that its difficult to let go enough that you can a=\r\nllow this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t =\r\nimagine such a force, because they are conditioned to think in words, most =\r\npsychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God completely anyway.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; Th=\r\nis,&nbsp;combined with the fact that for&nbsp;most people, Kundalini is not=\r\n wanted because these people&nbsp;want the objects which God can give, not =\r\nGod Herself, means that the scope\n for misunderstanding is tremendous.&lt;WBR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but most are unable to realise that &quot;mat=\r\nerial objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely to see even on=\r\ne who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of misery(whe=\r\nn looked at by an external observer). However the internal joy of Kundalini=\r\n is something which fills that saint so completely that some great ones wer=\r\ne completely unaware of their external problems.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;When Kundalin=\r\ni (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.I sometimes&nbs=\r\np;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by the parent. T=\r\nhe baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surrender is complet=\r\ne. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mother so it&#39;s feel=\r\ning is that of joy.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that they have =\r\nto learn surrender. This\n surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother takes ti=\r\nme and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;That=\r\n results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;result&n=\r\nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Secondl=\r\ny, many people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of j=\r\napa. Japa which deals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can cau=\r\nse serious instability in these people.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;=\r\npeople who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they have=\r\nn&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and think that the faking=\r\n of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the eye of the general=\r\n public.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, for =\r\nany doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must precede a=\r\nny attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to fi=\r\nnish Vata. Vata\n tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habit=\r\ns, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp;that=\r\n must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is e=\r\nssential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totally cal=\r\nm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases ma=\r\ny be useful.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati a=\r\nnd the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should really impro=\r\nve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;The whole=\r\n process may be chalked out over one-two years.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;In pure non re=\r\nal cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013=\r\n, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao wrote:&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatric problems =\r\nmay expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be=\r\n one.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conceded though t=\r\nhat Kundalini spontaneously rising through various nadis without one having=\r\n gone through proper preparation in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s at=\r\ntitude and development of detachment) CAN create havoc!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundalini may spontaneously rise i=\r\nn a layman with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may not experience =\r\nit.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT=\r\n an achievement. It is just A SMALL&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; STEP in overcoming one&#39;s curre=\r\nnt limited identity.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give a=\r\nn analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;&gt; body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first\n constr=\r\nuct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately,=\r\n if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction =\r\n(analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achie=\r\nvement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one =\r\nloses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-real=\r\nization without any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but M=\r\naharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putting s=\r\nufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise i=\r\nn a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may be g=\r\netting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even want =\r\nit!) when it comes in this life.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;A=\r\ns you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n desires. Nat=\r\nure has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints =\r\non what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; OWN previ=\r\nous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no=\r\n longer want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great=\r\n wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next li=\r\nfe. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the li=\r\nfe after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money=\r\n. In another &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; case, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film.=\r\n One may be reborn &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; as a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, =\r\nbut not really enjoy that &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; experience. Basically, people keep goin=\r\ng in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;mi=\r\nssing&quot;.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kun=\r\ndalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience\n given by a rising =\r\nKundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS li=\r\nfe, one may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fruc=\r\ntify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-pr=\r\nepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it an=\r\nd it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it fr=\r\nom a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse=\r\n trap called this body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a cert=\r\nain slow death!&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;If our ideas abou=\r\nt who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we a=\r\nre this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of th=\r\nat at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without be=\r\ning scared?&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable con=\r\nditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; Kundalini rise forced wh=\r\nen some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;WBR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic no=\r\ntion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried de=\r\neper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one ove=\r\nrcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s bod=\r\ny-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings\n on to (e.g. a great doctor, a g=\r\nreat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if=\r\n one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the wor=\r\nld, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the worl=\r\nd now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any suc=\r\nh notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress an=\r\nd yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditionin=\r\ng may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serio=\r\nus psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The best appro=\r\nach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do=\r\n sadhana, overcome your&lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n weaknesses and improve your detachment ov=\r\ner time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or dista=\r\nste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of=\r\n attachment. It is a negative attachment.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; whether your Kundalin=\r\ni rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemi=\r\nes (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; not. If your abil=\r\nity to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF your Kun=\r\ndalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you completely o=\r\nvercome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; will automatically =\r\nascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WB=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;One =\r\nword on surrendering to a\n personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful=\r\n, most people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though peop=\r\nle may be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please giv=\r\ne it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please =\r\nprotect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you want=\r\n and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, =\r\ndemands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascinat=\r\nion for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord th=\r\nrows one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s pras=\r\nad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fas=\r\ncination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many de=\r\nsires and wrong\n notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be tra=\r\npped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want =\r\nto &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. =\r\nIf you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was tr=\r\nying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes =\r\none *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to=\r\n a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!&lt;WBR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;W=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, develop di=\r\nspassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and can be take=\r\nn away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best, but be pr=\r\nepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very light mental\n=\r\n conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s K=\r\nundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;=\r\ns nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop Her from m=\r\neeting True Self.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;The real key is =\r\nhow light your conditioning is.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Be=\r\nst regards,&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;&gt;________________________________&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: Lee=\r\nla Sastry &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;A href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3Dnofollow&gt;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&quot; &lt;A href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3Dnofollow&gt;mailto:vedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, Febru=\r\nary\n 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kund=\r\nalini syndrome&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly co=\r\nrrect&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes th=\r\ne ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and mant=\r\nhra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc=\r\n with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are under the protection of&nbsp; a =\r\nmahadevatha ,all the other&nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wipe=\r\nd off .

Co=\r\nnstant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the hum=\r\nan mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachme=\r\nnt, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed e=\r\ntc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to n=\r\now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more=\r\n intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A goo=\r\nd guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it=\r\n\n can also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, =\r\nsome of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and=\r\n given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They =\r\ntake hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes t=\r\nhe same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; vital. 4 - =\r\nWhile someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini S=\r\nhakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because o=\r\nf this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and ins=\r\nufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that t=\r\nhe aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influences =\r\nand helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to va=\r\nrious reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That =\r\ncan allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they\n have ch=\r\nances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and variou=\r\ns possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Mor=\r\neover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the ri=\r\nght knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are =\r\noften doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; Sometimes=\r\n it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the sta=\r\nrting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to =\r\nsay - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktim=\r\nApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||=\r\n[7:24]&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;WBR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;WBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to w=\r\narn people of kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient=\r\n of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in=\r\n the care of someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening=\r\n of their kundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experien=\r\nces and surges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had n=\r\never heard of kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an =\r\nexplanation. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with h=\r\ner (all tests normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalin=\r\ni. Many people we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritu=\r\nal crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening-\n this has triggered=\r\n interest and research into this topic in mainstr\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
