Though he cc&#39;ed his reply to vedic-wisdom, it was not delivere=\r\nd because he is not a member. So I am forwarding it (see below).\n \nTo membe=\r\nrs: In my limited interactions with him over the last few months, I have se=\r\nen that he is a man with good understanding and clear thinking. I usually d=\r\no not have any significant disagreement with him in spiritual matters. Any =\r\ndifference between what we say is often because we may be using different w=\r\nords or looking at things from different angles, but not because of fundame=\r\nntal differences.\n \nVinay ji summarized it beautifully:\n \n&gt; Body is primari=\r\nly a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; desires are in no =\r\nneed of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt; irony ! Those who run a=\r\nfter siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; ... Striving after siddhis is the great=\r\nest folly. Siddhis are\n&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a yo=\r\ngi to concenrrate.\n \nAll kinds of siddhi are possible. They should neither =\r\nbe avoided nor pursued. Take what comes your way, but do not desire anythin=\r\ng. There should be NOTHING that you hold as &quot;I wish I had this&quot; or &quot;I wish =\r\nI did NOT have this&quot;, for any attraction or aversion will block you! As Vin=\r\nay ji rightly says, the irony is that one running after siddhis is often de=\r\nprived of any, while one without desires may be tempted with this siddhi or=\r\n that siddhi so that desire may be reborn! Only after one passes all tests =\r\nand attraction and aversion are not born in any circumstances is one truly =\r\nfree. The above paragraph is a good summary of this discussion.\n \n*        =\r\n*        *\n \nVinay ji is wise in not wanting to talk about personal experie=\r\nnces. I share a few of them as they are useful in highlighting some notions=\r\n and some lessons and in inspiring and cautioning sadhakas. I am quoting a =\r\nportion from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:\n \n---=\r\n--------- Begin Quote ------------\nI was sleeping oneday. In the middle of =\r\nthe night, I woke up. When I was still on the bed and partially awake, my s=\r\nhakti rose. In other words, my self-awareness got refined. I first perceive=\r\nd a tremendous bolt of electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split se=\r\ncond, my perception of that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to =\r\n&quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My changed perception was that there was a tremendous am=\r\nount of shakti that was surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing ever=\r\nything that was there and that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendou=\r\ns wave. Moreover, I also &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted toge=\r\nther by millions of people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That =\r\nwave reverberated with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived that =\r\nI too was chanting that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled wit=\r\nh that sound and a kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny part=\r\nicle filled with that sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anyt=\r\nhing else. Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet=\r\n fantastic state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thou=\r\nght that can be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am =\r\nI hearing this loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mind. T=\r\nhat thought disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In othe=\r\nr words, I returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again percei=\r\nved that I was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind=\r\n was again filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n \nI mentioned this in=\r\ncident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it was the middle of=\r\n the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned the incident and=\r\n said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating in the wave in=\r\n which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew it and also =\r\nmentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you heard, righ=\r\nt?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with that beej=\r\naakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to have a mysti=\r\ncal experience with.\n\nWhen I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, M=\r\nanish shed some light: &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshar=\r\na. So and so deity came and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nic=\r\ne samadhi. Some people close to me may also have experienced that deity at =\r\nthat time. But we should realize that this is all Her play and we are just =\r\nnimittas. What she does and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are j=\r\nust dummies observing what comes our way. We neither make anything happen n=\r\nor should we desire anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attr=\r\nacted or repelled by anything.&quot;\n------------- End Quote -------------\n \nMak=\r\ning someone who is thousands of miles away (especially one who is leading a=\r\n normal mundane life and has many bad samskaras!) have a specific sublime e=\r\nxperience is not an ordinary feat. Few can do such things today. However, l=\r\nook at the attitude of the person who did it. See what he said in the last =\r\nparagraph quoted above about being just a nimitta! Rather than thinking of =\r\nsiddhis or striving for them, strive for cultivating such an attitude!\n \nTh=\r\ne important thing is not whether one gets siddhis or not. That is irrelevan=\r\nt. The important thing is whether one is fully prepared and mature enough t=\r\no handle any siddhis! If one is prepared, one may get control over the enti=\r\nre universe and yet remain detached and be liberated. If one is unprepared,=\r\n even a very very minor siddhi may make one fall and get stuck in the cycle=\r\n of birth, pursuit of desires and paybacks and death. Sadhakas should forge=\r\nt about irrelevant things and strive for the correct attitude that can take=\r\n them far.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pit=\r\nri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n \n&gt; Date: Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:05:35 +0530\n&gt; Subject: Re:=\r\n Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya (Re: On Physical Immortality)\n&gt; From: Vin=\r\nay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt;\n&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Cc=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,\nsilentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...=\r\nm&gt;, Lalit Mishra &lt;mishra.lalit@...&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; PVR is correctly=\r\n expressing the essence of Vedic philosophy, but\n&gt; physical immortality and=\r\n greater miracles are possible by siddhas.\n&gt; Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa&#39;s=\r\n guru Swami Totapuri deliberately left\n&gt; his body after completing one Divi=\r\nne Year on Earth, equal to 360 human\n&gt; years. One of his disciples whom I k=\r\nnew personally requested the guru\n&gt; not to leave his discipes, but Totapuri=\r\n ji said that though he could\n&gt; live as long as he wishes, this world is no=\r\nt for siddhas. There is\n&gt; another world for them.\n&gt; I know siddha of Nath s=\r\nampradaya now living in the Shiva Temple near\n&gt; a creamation ground in Jamm=\r\nu. He can create matter out of nothing, and\n&gt; talk from great distances tel=\r\nepathically. I know some siddhas of other\n&gt; sampradaayas too. None of them =\r\nwants physical immortality, but it is\n&gt; attainable. Even BPHS talks of Amit=\r\naayu.\n&gt; Appearing simultaneously at many places is not physical replication=\r\n.\n&gt; Brahma-sutra talks about Nirmaana-kaayaa. Sooksma Deha can be created\n&gt;=\r\n by siddhas at will and for lesser mortals these dehas are no less real\n&gt; t=\r\nhan physical body. To remove my skepticism, my late Guru ji had shown\n&gt; me =\r\nmany exaples of controllong matter from 50 kilometres away. I\n&gt; personally =\r\nknow many living Antaryaamis who are perfect clairvoyants\n&gt; and more. To mo=\r\nrtals addicted to senses, physical body or physical\n&gt; world is everything, =\r\nbut those who soar above regard the physical as\n&gt; maayaa because it can be =\r\nceeated by Kalpanaa of a siddha. The whole\n&gt; Creation is a Kalpa.\n&gt; Body is=\r\n primarily a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; desires ar=\r\ne in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt; irony ! Those w=\r\nho run after siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; I have some experience of these=\r\n things, but I do not like to talk\n&gt; about personal experiences. It is wron=\r\ng to say that Jnaana or Kriya\n&gt; yogacannot bring siddhis. All types of real=\r\n Yoga can bring siddhis.\n&gt; But as the saying goes, those who strive to beco=\r\nme saints become\n&gt; satans. Striving after siddhis is the greatest folly. Si=\r\nddhis are\n&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a yogi to concenr=\r\nrate.\n&gt;\n&gt; -vj\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please do not get carried away with this verse. Naths a=\r\nre also known as\n&gt; &gt; Mahasiddhas. These are not ordinary beings. Nath means=\r\n Lord or master.\n&gt; &gt; Depending on how you count them, there are either 64 o=\r\nr 9 of them,\n&gt; &gt; incarnated from various transcendental qualities of the Lo=\r\nrd. These are\n&gt; &gt; adept beings with perfect mastery over various aspects of=\r\n the field of\n&gt; &gt; duality. They are ever-liberated and yet are born again a=\r\nnd again to show\n&gt; &gt; the path of liberation to people.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lord Dattatr=\r\neya is the original guru of all Naths. Please read his\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Avadhoota Gita&quot;=\r\n. There is a nice English translation by Swami Asokananda (I\n&gt; &gt; think) of =\r\nRamakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is better if one\n&gt; &gt; knows Sa=\r\nnskrit and reads Sanskrit verses directly, because there is some\n&gt; &gt; specia=\r\nl power in the combinations of words used and reading them in that\n&gt; &gt; form=\r\n has a special impact. If one reads Avadhoota Gita, one will realize\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat what I&#39;ve been writing on the goal of sadhana is consistent with what\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Avadhoota Gita says. So is it with what Maharshi Vasishtha says in Yoga\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Vaasishtham!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; While Dattatreya says &quot;I am this body, I am that bo=\r\ndy and I am all bodies\n&gt; &gt; and yet I am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to think =\r\nthat Gorakshanath (from\n&gt; &gt; Dattatreya&#39;s lineage!) would set as ultimate go=\r\nal making a specific body\n&gt; &gt; immortal. This is a gross misrepresentation o=\r\nf Gorakshanath and his\n&gt; &gt; teachings. In fact, anynody who thinks one can u=\r\nnderstand the essence of a\n&gt; &gt; Nath&#39;s teaching from a book or a verse is fo=\r\noling oneself. Only those who\n&gt; &gt; are meant for it can benefit from the gui=\r\ndance of a Nath. Others can only\n&gt; &gt; see the superficial aspects of the wor=\r\nds attributed to a Nath. To say that\n&gt; &gt; Gorakhnath&#39;s path is about achievi=\r\nng &quot;Kayasiddhi&quot; is totally wrong.\n&gt; &gt; Gorakshanath&#39;s path is about liberati=\r\non while living, which is described in\n&gt; &gt; Avadhoota Gita, Yoga Vaasishtham=\r\n and several other scriptures, and that does\n&gt; &gt; NOT mean physical immortal=\r\nity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One understanding the true essence of the teachings of Goraksh=\r\nanath,\n&gt; &gt; Matsyendranath and Dattatreya and following their teachings perf=\r\nectly may\n&gt; &gt; indeed get various siddhis though one may not actively want t=\r\nhem. As\n&gt; &gt; Vasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham, various siddhis in the fiel=\r\nd of duality\n&gt; &gt; are irrelevant to a seeker of liberation and they can even=\r\n become\n&gt; &gt; hindrances. But, one truly understanding the teachings of Naths=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; Dattatreya will not succumb to them and will become like Shiva. My=\r\n point is\n&gt; &gt; that one who starts off thinking that physical immoortality o=\r\nf a specific\n&gt; &gt; physical body (or another siddhi like that) is the goal is=\r\n going to get\n&gt; &gt; stuck at some stage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Liberation is lack of attrac=\r\ntion or aversion to anything in the field of\n&gt; &gt; duality - an object or an =\r\nidea or a notion. Either rejection of everything\n&gt; &gt; as an illusion or acce=\r\nptance of everything as divine can make one eventually\n&gt; &gt; overcome all att=\r\nractions and aversions. Thinking of immortalizing one\n&gt; &gt; particular physic=\r\nal body will not help one with that. In fact, a realized\n&gt; &gt; person will no=\r\nt think &quot;I am this body&quot;, as the quote above from Dattatreya\n&gt; &gt; shows.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; In fact, the verse quoted below says one becomes like Shiva in the end=\r\n. Did\n&gt; &gt; Shiva strive for physical immortality? When Shiva came to earth a=\r\ns Adi\n&gt; &gt; Shankara, he did not teach physical immortality. Instead, he taug=\r\nht that\n&gt; &gt; body is mithya (an illusion).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As I said, siddhas like T=\r\nrilinga Swami could manifest their physical bodies\n&gt; &gt; in two places at the=\r\n same time. Why Trilinga Swami, my guru&#39;s guru (Sri\n&gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj) di=\r\nd that. Oneday, my guru Manish saw his guru standing in\n&gt; &gt; front of him in=\r\n physical body, showing hand in a blessing pose and then\n&gt; &gt; waving it as a=\r\n good bye sign. Manish later found out that other disciples of\n&gt; &gt; Nakhate =\r\nmaharaj living in various parts of the world saw a similar scene at\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n same time and that Maharaj gave up his physical body in Pune at that\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nime! If one is indeed a siddha (let alone a natha) and has some control\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n over matter, it may be possible to menifest and unmanifest perishable\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nphysical bodies at will. Where does physical immortality stand in that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncontext?!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free =\r\nJyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films=\r\n that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Just a thought on the path of Go=\r\nrakhnath.

But you are going to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nother extreme when suggesting that physical immortality is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nighest ideal. Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical psudo-vedantin of =\r\ntoday, we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical bod=\r\ny is to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the phy=\r\nsical body and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we are something else residing in a shell called =\r\nthe physical body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What we truly are, can neither be created nor=\r\n be destroyed, though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body may perish. But, if someone =\r\ncurrently thinks that one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a physical body, one cannot simply =\r\nignore the physical body. One\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has to *use* the physical body to =\r\neventually realize that one is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the physical body. A mere int=\r\nellectual statement of it is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tantamount to its realization.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maha=\r\nrshi Vasishtha clearly says that action\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (karma) and knowledge (j=\r\nnaana) are two wings with which the bird of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consc=\r\niousness flies into the sky of self-realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical body i=\r\ns not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carefully to =\r\nperform the *right actions* that can free one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I s=\r\naid earlier, one performing actions without correct knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (t=\r\nhat god is the doer of all actions!) is like a person who is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wal=\r\nking around a mountain not realizing that the goal of walking is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but not performing actions is like someone who knows that reaching\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the top of the mountain is the goal and keeps staring at the top,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without walking. Such a person will remain at the base of the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone are not able to free one an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird. Th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us to=\r\nwards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Physical bodies of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, like centuries or millennia. But, eventually, they too may\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give up physical body. Someone mentioned Vallalar, but he gave up\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, to a t=\r\nruly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immortality w=\r\nill sound silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but its m=\r\nodifications such as physical forms can be born and be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed=\r\n at will really. A siddha, as long as one does not merge in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brah=\r\nman completely, can remain in an individualized *ethereal* body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwith a subtle ego, even after giving up a physical body. One can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n then create a physical body at will, then merge back in the ethereal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a visit to Varanasi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himsel=\r\nf.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dakshineshwar and taught Tantra=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a g=\r\nrateful\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big=\r\n container\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his i=\r\nmprisonment by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was =\r\nseen by some guards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be in his cell and also walking on the pr=\r\nison compound wall at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same time. Even when he finally decide=\r\nd to give up his body and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his disciples put his body in a contai=\r\nner and threw it into Ganges,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was seen after a few minutes to=\r\n walk on the other side.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized being with a h=\r\nigh enough command over duality,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creation and destruction of phy=\r\nsical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks that a g=\r\nold coin is special and needs to be preserved\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forever will strug=\r\ngle to do so. One who realizes that a gold coin, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gold chain, a=\r\n gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all basically the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same (gold)=\r\n can melt the coin and recreate it again. Preserving the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coin fo=\r\nrever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realizes non=\r\n-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is the s=\r\name. But,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if one retains individual ego-consciousness and intera=\r\ncts with the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field of duality, different possibilities are there=\r\n. One may engage\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in various actions using a physical body and at=\r\n the end drop the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, on=\r\ne may engage in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various actions using a physical body, then give=\r\n it up and tie the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and rem=\r\nain in a higher realm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time. If so, one may re-enter a=\r\n physical body from time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to time. But, all this is governed by o=\r\nne&#39;s caliber and evolution in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the field of duality. Though, all =\r\nare the same at the non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level, different beings have differ=\r\nent caliber in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a sidd=\r\nha or a natha may not be the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same as somebody else.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am afraid he =\r\nlent himself vulnerable to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation when it comes to di=\r\nvinization of matter. I say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite emphatically that physical imm=\r\nortality as an ideal and as the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a d=\r\nangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only worthy goal is to efface indi=\r\nvidual ego, realize Self and,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if needed, engage with the world w=\r\nith a subtle ego and do whatever\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes spontaneously. Once heavi=\r\ner conditioning is overcome, Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts to show one the role =\r\none has to play. One should just play\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the role given to one well=\r\n, instead of asking for this role or that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; role.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
