Subsequently, He says that He Himself is the =E2=80=98doer=E2=\r\n=80=99, the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 and the =E2=80=98deed=E2=80=99 (karta, =\r\nkarma and karyam); though =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma) is the most impor=\r\ntant of the three, it is ineffectual by itself (jadam).=C2=A0If this is so,=\r\n then everything depends upon the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99, who is Ishwara. W=\r\nhy when He first created =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma), did He create dif=\r\nferent karmas for different people? It is said that afterwards everyone is =\r\nmade to function according to his karma. How did this difference come about=\r\n in the very beginning? How did it arise?=C2=A0Not only that, if everything=\r\n is left to the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 and to the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99 w=\r\nho is Ishwara, where does personal effort (purushakaram) come in? If there =\r\nis\n no personal effort, why is it said that we ourselves must attain Realiz=\r\nation? What does it mean?=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan said,=E2=80=9CWho is it that i=\r\ns asking? To whom has this doubt arisen? Why has it arisen? First think tha=\r\nt over and find out.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe devotee: =E2=80=9CSwami, I am only enqui=\r\nring why Lord Krishna said that.=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan: =E2=80=9CThat is what =\r\nI am referring to. What exactly did Lord Krishna tell Arjuna? He told him, =\r\nthe deed will get done according to the =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99. I am the =\r\n=E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99 watching the whole thing from above. Why do you worr=\r\ny? It is your body which does the killing of your relatives. Are you the bo=\r\ndy?\n\nNo! Why then this bondage for you?=C2=A0Renounce the idea, He said. Th=\r\nis means that He asks Arjuna to do the thing but to give up the feeling tha=\r\nt it is he that is doing it. That is personal effort.=C2=A0\n\nThe feeling th=\r\nat one is, or is not, the body, comes from one=E2=80=99s own ignorance. One=\r\n only has to give up that feeling; that which one has, one must oneself rej=\r\nect. Who=C2=A0else can do it? If by personal effort that bondage is removed=\r\n,action, under the orders of the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99, Ishwara, goes on o=\r\nf its own accord.=C2=A0\n\nEvery one has his work allotted to him and he will=\r\n do it automatically. Why should one worry? Arjuna, when he felt that it wa=\r\ns not proper to kill his relatives, was only told to give up the feeling th=\r\nat he was the =E2=80=98doer=E2=80=99, yet it was Arjuna himself who ultimat=\r\nely fought.By listening to the Gita, he lost the feeling of being the =E2=\r\n=80=98doer=E2=80=99 and the doubt he had had was no longer there.=C2=A0\n\nTh=\r\ne work had to be done with that particular body, and it was done. Even Dury=\r\nodhana was like that. Not that he was not aware of the correctness or other=\r\nwise of what he was doing. He knew that what he was doing was not right, bu=\r\nt some force was leading him on to that work. What could he do? That work h=\r\nad to be done in that way by that body, and it was done. He is reported to =\r\nhave said so at the time of his death. Hence it is clear that some Force is=\r\n making all people to do things. Getting rid of the feeling that =E2=80=98I=\r\n myself am doing=E2=80=99 is personal effort (purushakaram) . All spiritual=\r\n practices (sadhanas) are towards that end.=E2=80=9D\n\nAnother devotee: =E2=\r\n=80=9CThat is all right. For this karma there must be a beginning, but how =\r\nit began, no one has mentioned.=E2=80=9D\n\nBhagavan: =E2=80=9CYes, but it is=\r\n the same thing. If you are asked =E2=80=98how did you get this?=E2=80=99 y=\r\nou say you have got it by =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma). How were you bor=\r\nn? By =E2=80=98doing=E2=80=99 (karma) that is all that could be said. If, h=\r\nowever, you ask how was this karma born, you are told you should not ask su=\r\nch questions.=C2=A0\n\nThis is known as the Law of the seed and the tree (bij=\r\na ankura nyayam). The tree is born of the seed; again from the tree a seed =\r\nis born. Where is the origin of that seed? That is a question which you are=\r\n told is not to be asked. What can we say to that? That is why I always ask=\r\n people to find out first how they were born and where they were born.=E2=\r\n=80=9D\n\nO Arjuna, the Lord dwells in the heart of all beings who are mounte=\r\nd upon the automation of this body, causing them by His illusive power to s=\r\npin round according to their actions.\n\n-- Gita XVIII: 61\n\nSeek refuge in Hi=\r\nm alone, with all your being, O Arjuna!
