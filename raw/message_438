For example, Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa said that Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was one of the seve=\r\nn great rishis. Many people did meet him. Thus, meeting the physical manife=\r\nstation of an amsa of a rishi is not that difficult (though that also requi=\r\nres some punya).\n \nThe second thing is to meet the physical manifestation o=\r\nf the entire consciousness of a rishi. *That* is very very very difficult. =\r\nAs Vimalananda said, that may require a terrific amount of tapascharya (unl=\r\ness you are one of that rishi&#39;s people who came to do some work on earth an=\r\nd have already done a terrific amount of tapascharya in past lives).\n \n*   =\r\n     *        *\n \nOne may wonder: If rishis are so great, why do they not g=\r\net moksha and why do they remain in physical manifestation?\n \nThough the fo=\r\nllowing is essentially like a kindergartener explaining Einstein&#39;s theory o=\r\nf general relativity to fellow kindergarteners, I will nevertheless try to =\r\nexplain it.\n \nAll that our senses perceive is Maya (delusion) that is creat=\r\ned by the power of duality. If the veil of delusion is removed, there is no=\r\n duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided consciousness, known variousl=\r\ny as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva. This one uniform and undiv=\r\nided consciousness is known as &quot;unmanifested Brahman&quot;. The world of duality=\r\n, where there are many different objects, is also actually Brahman only, bu=\r\nt Brahman that went through some modification and manifestation. It is know=\r\nn as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both are Brahman only.\n \nNormally, living in the=\r\n domain of duality without being deluded by some aspect of duality or the o=\r\nther is near to impossible. Remaining in duality with a perfect understandi=\r\nng of the underlying oneness of all objects and perceiving all those object=\r\ns of duality without experiencing attraction or repulsion for any single ob=\r\nject of duality is almost impossible. Most spiritual aspirants try to reach=\r\n the state of oneness with unmanifested Brahman - a state in which there is=\r\n no duality and no objectification - and become absorbed in that state fore=\r\nver. That is the advaitic experience of &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happe=\r\nns in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n \nHowever, maharshis have described higher states. It is po=\r\nssible to be in oneness with manifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at=\r\n the same time. It is possible to remain in duality, with the senses percei=\r\nving objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying onen=\r\ness (Brahman) of all obejcts and not be deluded, i.e. not experience either=\r\n attraction or repulsion for any object of duality. Mere perception of obje=\r\ncts by the senses is not the problem. The tendency of mind to be find some =\r\nattractive and find some repulsive is the problem. It is possible to remain=\r\n in a state where there is neither attraction nor repulsion for any object =\r\nis possible.\n \nSuch a state is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa, Shirdi Sai Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda also experienced it.\n \nRishis are beings who are always in a very high s=\r\ntate. They are always alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perce=\r\nive objects of duality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. I=\r\nf one overcomes attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one ca=\r\nn pretty much do anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled=\r\n by anything, it means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do =\r\nanything for personal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakri=\r\nti) and implements the wish of nature through one&#39;s actions, which are perf=\r\normed without any attachment or personal identification. One who has a pers=\r\nonal ego can do limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do gr=\r\neat things. One who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does thin=\r\ngs that are desired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can=\r\n change the course of history of nations and planets.\n \nA rishi in this sta=\r\nte may engage in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, t=\r\nhere is no attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument=\r\n of Nature.\n \nIf one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unmani=\r\nfested Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equal=\r\n vision of unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberated=\r\n). Thus, he will freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion.=\r\n Amsa of such a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as =\r\na process running in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some =\r\nfocussed task. Even if the computer process has finished all the initializa=\r\ntion and early work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initializat=\r\nion etc again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the p=\r\nrocess of overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a V=\r\nivekananda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initia=\r\nlly and overcome the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is =\r\nthe amsa of an ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.\n =\r\n\nThus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciousness and=\r\n with the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached instrument o=\r\nf Nature performing actions of tremendous consequences without any personal=\r\n ego driving those actions.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWorshipping the rishi o=\r\nf one&#39;s gotra and getting his blessings is a very good idea. In general, ge=\r\ntting the blessings of ANY rishi is a great idea. Pursuing the rishi of one=\r\n&#39;s gotra is relatively easier for most people. But, if one has a connection=\r\n with a specific rishi (apart from the rishi of one&#39;s gotra), one can worsh=\r\nip that rishi. However, it is not easy to know that.\n \nSuppose several mant=\r\nras you find natural attraction for have the descendants of a specific Maha=\r\nrshi as the rishi. Then you may have a connection with that Maharshi. You c=\r\nan try praying to him.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyo=\r\ntish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centr=\r\ne (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------ \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  Fr=\r\nom: rajarshi nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Thursday, S=\r\neptember 25, 2008 1:30 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Anyone knows ma=\r\nntra for Kashyap Rishi?\n\n        Dear Narasimhaji\n\n        I had a question=\r\n about Rishis.
