What this namboodiri did is the co=\r\nrrect way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and worsh=\r\nip it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline i=\r\nt, depending on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger wit=\r\nh practice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it,=\r\n some karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for bur=\r\nning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas a=\r\nre anyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of co=\r\nurse, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready an=\r\nd willing to face their consequences, but a person with a strong individual=\r\nized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. Wh=\r\nen one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas=\r\n and face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flow=\r\ners and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it =\r\ngrow\n very\n&gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, u=\r\nntil you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yourse=\r\nlf from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt; \n&gt; But some pe=\r\nople use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start t=\r\nhe fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If on=\r\ne who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does such =\r\nthings, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow this=\r\n approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong identi=\r\nfication with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them and t=\r\nhey do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyone to=\r\n start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at be=\r\nst and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best approach is: You start your own f=\r\nire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, ident=\r\nify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle bo=\r\ndy. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without you=\r\nr knowledge, the internal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, thou=\r\ngh anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worry about the=\r\nse things and do what you are used to or what you are more attracted to.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. =\r\nPlacing a letter in a particular body part has a higher significance than j=\r\nust tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating =\r\nwith a specific sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progress =\r\nin purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing wh=\r\nat is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) They should be shown in the video. If you cannot get them, please=\r\n feel free to just say it and not show any mudra.

Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday.

Of course, this may not be obvious. For example, there w=\r\nas a gentleman whose last rites was performed not by his kids, but by one o=\r\nf his foreign students. Needless to say, the last rites are considered very=\r\n important ritual and is a privilege of the children, however, in this case=\r\n since there was a karmic connection, the foreign student (whom the gentlem=\r\nan also considered as one of his spiritual children) ended up performing th=\r\ne ritual. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Narayan&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc5=\r\n04.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;ved=\r\nic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, krishna Kanth\n &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Narasimha garu &amp; Narayan garu,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaskaram.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Thus, allowing everyone to=\r\n start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient at be=\r\nst and disastrous at worst&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was little taken aback=\r\n by this statement of your&#39;s,&nbsp;because when is sit to do Homam, my moth=\r\ner and my 2 yr old son would join me (90% of the times)&nbsp;and i have enc=\r\nouraged them to offer some sesame seeds along with me in the Homam while i =\r\nread the Atharvaseersham.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was always under the tho=\r\nught process that, i&#39;m doing Homam and they&nbsp;are sitting with me and do=\r\ning some seva to god along with me.

What this namboodiri did is =\r\nthe correct way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Visualize the external fire as your inter=\r\nnal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fir=\r\ne and streamline it, depending on how strong your identification is (it wil=\r\nl get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that external fire or make=\r\ns offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that person to your int=\r\nernal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for peo=\r\nple whose karmas are anyway\n intertwined, like husband and wife or parents =\r\nand children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from the entire world =\r\nif you are ready and willing to face their consequences, but a person with =\r\na strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on e=\r\nrasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to =\r\ntake on more karmas and face their consequences. After all, if you start pl=\r\nucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you g=\r\nuard it and let it grow very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to=\r\n many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working to burn you=\r\nr karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused b=\r\ny them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol i=\r\ns used. They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire=\r\n and make offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s interna=\r\nl fire with external\n fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However,=\r\n luckily, most people who follow this approach do not understand much about=\r\n fire and do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is pr=\r\nactically like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much a=\r\ns one can. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings i=\r\nnto you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. O=\r\nnly you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own inter=\r\nnal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a w=\r\nhile, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal =\r\nfire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (2) The=\r\nre are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa=\r\n and kara nyaasa are usually standard. Do not worry about these things and =\r\ndo what you\n are used to or what you are more attracted to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. P=\r\nlacing a letter in a particular body part has a higher significance than ju=\r\nst tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating w=\r\nith a specific sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progress i=\r\nn purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing wha=\r\nt is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (3) They should be shown in the video. If you cannot get t=\r\nhem, please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra.

Doing a one-off homam that=\r\n takes 3-4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hours is far less useful than doing a 30 min =\r\nhomam everyday.
