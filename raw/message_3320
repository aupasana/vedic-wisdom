Her amazing\nlife of inner visions=\r\n, spiritual yearning, surrender and bhakti inspires all\nto pursue the spiri=\r\ntual ideal, delve into the Supreme Self and not waste\neven a minute in the =\r\nprocess.\n\nBorn on July 27, 1906, the child Janaky exhibited unusual detachm=\r\nent. She\naccepted all things with a joyous heart. Janaky was full of devoti=\r\non to the\nlocal deities, Sri Viswanatha and Visalakshi, and as she grew in =\r\nyears,\nJanaky desired to be like Sita, the ever-faithful, pure and holy wif=\r\ne of Sri\nRam.\n\nIn her thirteenth year her uncle discussed with Janaky her w=\r\nillingness to\nmarry a doctor who was then thirty-two years of age. When tol=\r\nd that the\nwidower had two daughters, aged two and six, Sri Janaky replied,=\r\n &quot;What of\nthat? That doesn&#39;t make much of a difference and, after all, I li=\r\nke\nchildren.&quot; Even though her parents were not too keen on this matrimonial=\r\n\narrangement because of the extreme age difference, Janaky intuitively felt=\r\n\nthat the doctor would be helpful in the attainment of her goal of\nLiberati=\r\non. So in 1919, Sri Janaky married Dr. C. S. Ganapathy (known\nhereafter as =\r\n&#39;Doctor&#39;), in a quiet ceremony performed before Lord\nVenkataramana of Tirup=\r\nathi. The Doctor was often heard to remark: &quot;Wherever\nyou (Janaky) go, I sh=\r\nall follow you.&quot; And where else could she go, but to\nGod? Living in Tirupat=\r\nhi, Sri Matha&#39;s devotion to Sri Venkataramana grew\nsteadily.\n\nIn 1921, she =\r\ngave birth to a daughter and named her Padmavathy, after the\nconsort of Lor=\r\nd Venkataramana. Then a son, Srinivasa Subrahmanya, was born,\nand several y=\r\nears later another daughter, Sarada.\n\nThere came a point in her life when s=\r\nhe realized: &quot;To none but Him (God)\nshould true love be directed. To turn t=\r\no the Divine is the only truth in\nlife.&quot; From that day on she continued to =\r\ntake care of her family and\nresponsibilities but shifted her life&#39;s ideal t=\r\no that of total devotion to\nGod.\n\nAt the age of twenty her daily routine wa=\r\ns as follows: She read the Gita and\nother Scriptures until about 1 a.m. eve=\r\nry night. Janaky would get up at 5\na.m., finish her ablutions and meditate =\r\nuntil 7 a.m. Then she would take a\nbath, recite hymns while attending to ho=\r\nusehold work for about three hours,\nand after sending the children to schoo=\r\nl and the Doctor to work, she would\nengage herself heart and soul in worshi=\r\np until 1 p.m. From 1 to 4 p.m. she\nwas busy looking after the needs of her=\r\n husband and children. At 4:30 p.m.\nshe would go to the Ladies&#39; Club (which=\r\n did much volunteer community\nservice), attend meetings, play tennis and re=\r\nturn home at 7 p.m. Upon\nreturning home she would meditate for an hour befo=\r\nre taking her supper of\ngruel and milk. Though she took very little food, s=\r\nhe was healthy and always\ncheerful.\n\nAlthough the Doctor was then earning a=\r\n good salary, owing to various\nreasons, there was a lack of funds. One day =\r\nbefore going to bed she prayed\nto Sri Subrahmanya to keep her carefree by t=\r\naking on His shoulders the\noppressive burden of the family&#39;s welfare. The n=\r\next day, a sannyasi\n(ascetic) came to her house. She was all alone when he =\r\nsaid to her, &quot;You\nwere calling me yesterday. I have come from Palni. Leave =\r\nto me all your\nfamily worries and worship me with a carefree heart. Whateve=\r\nr is needed for\nthe family - be it money or other needs and necessities of =\r\nlife - will be\nprovided for.&quot; He asked her to give him the promise that she=\r\n would never\nforget him. After she agreed, he disappeared.\n\nAfter this she =\r\nhad many wonderful spiritual experiences and visions of\ndeities, often last=\r\ning the whole night.\n\nSri Subrahmanya came twice more in the disguise of a =\r\nsannyasi. When Janaky\nrevealed this to the Doctor, he replied with sceptici=\r\nsm, &quot;I will believe\nyour words only if He comes here when I am in.&quot; Janaky =\r\nresponded, &quot;If that\nbe your desire, let it be so.&quot;\n\nThe Doctor had just ret=\r\nurned for lunch when they both felt a presence\noutside. Seeing a sannyasi, =\r\nboth Janaky and the Doctor came out and offered\nhim a chair. He took some f=\r\nood and said, &quot;You wanted me to come when your\nhusband is in, and here I am=\r\n.&quot; To make the Doctor believe His Divinity, He\nexhibited some psychic power=\r\ns. He asked for another chair and requested\nJanaky to be seated. She felt r=\r\neluctant to sit on the same level with Him,\nbut he insisted and asked her w=\r\nhat more she desired. Janaky requested Him to\nbless her with a Sadguru in h=\r\numan form.\n\nWhat the sannyasi next said to her shocked her very much. &quot;I am=\r\n none none\nother Subrahmanya. Much pleased by your meritorious actions and =\r\ndepth of\ndevotion, I have a longing to be born as a child to you. I will pl=\r\nay with\nyou for two years and then my power will get infused in your heart.=\r\n&quot; Janaky\nexclaimed, &quot;My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of =\r\nsamsara\n(worldliness) when my desire is to ferry across it.&quot; She argued tha=\r\nt she\nwould not be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was o=\r\nn fire\nwith renunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and p=\r\nunished\nhim? What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck an=\r\nd call;\nshe would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psych=\r\nic powers\nand fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, &quot;L=\r\net me be\nblessed with a Guru.&quot;\n\nWith a smile of His face, Subrahmanya said,=\r\n &quot;Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if\nsuch be your wish, there is a Mahatma by n=\r\name Sri Ramana Maharshi in\nTiruvannamalai. You may go and have His darshan.=\r\n&quot; He showed Janaky a photo\nof Bhagavan Ramana that he was carrying. It was =\r\nthe first time that she had\nheard about Bhagavan Sri Ramana. Saying that he=\r\n would come again to discuss\nwith her His desire to be born as her child, H=\r\ne disappeared from sight.\n\nHer heart then surged with an intense love for B=\r\nhagavan Sri Ramana. She\ncontinued with her meditations, worship, household =\r\nchores and volunteer\nwork. Day by day, Janaky could feel a number of change=\r\ns happening to her\nnervous system. Her visions continued. A severe pain dev=\r\neloped in her spine\nand she became bedridden. Her nerves seemed to have bee=\r\nn shattered and often\nthe heartbeat was faint and hardly audible. In spite =\r\nof all this, her mind\nremained peaceful. Friends wanted her to be seen by s=\r\npecialists, but the\nDoctor was sure it was not a disease to be treated medi=\r\ncally and that, by\nthe grace of God, she would be all right. This state con=\r\ntinued for forty\ndays and then disappeared as mysteriously as it came.\n\nAft=\r\ner a few days, a sadhu appeared before her and again asked about\nSubrahmany=\r\na being born to her. Again she pleaded that she didn&#39;t need\nobstacles, but =\r\na helping hand. The sadhu assured her that, &quot;Begetting a son\nwill in no way=\r\n shackle you in bondage. There will be no hindrances to your\nspiritual prog=\r\nress.&quot;\n\nJanaky and the Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. H=\r\ner long\ncherished yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitti=\r\nng in the\nmeditation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and=\r\n gracious\nlook of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated w=\r\nith the\nnectar flowing through Bhagavan&#39;s eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be se=\r\nated. Her\nheart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flo=\r\nw of\nBhagavan&#39;s Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagava=\r\nn\nblessing her.\n\nTo Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the formless Aru=\r\nnachaleswara. In\nthe evening hours of their departure day, Janaky knelt bef=\r\nore Bhagavan and\nspoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri Subrahma=\r\nnya&#39;s decision to\nincarnate in her womb. She also revealed her experience o=\r\nf the all-pervasive\nnature of the Paramatma and awaited instructions from B=\r\nhagavan as to what\nshe should do next. He said, &quot;Continue doing it in just =\r\nthe same way.&quot;\n\nWith the infant Swaminathan, Janaky and the Doctor returned=\r\n to Sri\nRamanasramam for the blessings of Bhagavan in August 1936. For a lo=\r\nng time\nJanaky had been praying for her husband&#39;s spiritual awareness to be=\r\n aroused\nso that he might not, at any time, stand in the way of her spiritu=\r\nal\nprogress. Bhagavan asked both the Doctor and Janaky to come before him a=\r\nnd\nhe read aloud &quot;Upadesa Saram&quot; (Essence of Instruction) and asked them to=\r\n\nfollow it. Janaky&#39;s heart was overflowing with joy.\n\nTo quote from Janaky =\r\nMatha&#39;s biography:\n\n&quot;.From the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana=\r\n, He was her all. She\nreasoned, &#39;There is only one thing in the world worth=\r\n achieving: the root\ncause of the whole universe, the &#39;One Without a Second=\r\n&#39;. I must attain it,\nrealize it and experience it with Bhagavan&#39;s Grace.&quot;\n\n=\r\nPhysically and mentally drained by her spiritual experiences, Janaky sought=\r\n\nBhagavan&#39;s help in October 1936. At an opportune moment, she prostrated\nbe=\r\nfore Bhagavan and poured out her heart to him. She told of her spiritual\nex=\r\nperiences and begged for his protection and the removal of obstacles in\nher=\r\n quest for Liberation. She also expressed her fear of becoming deranged\nbec=\r\nause she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan replied: &quot;Who told you that\nyou=\r\n have no Guru? Don&#39;t get disheartened. I am here as your Guru; nothing\nwill=\r\n upset your mind.&quot; With that assurance, she transferred all her cares\nand w=\r\norries to Bhagavan Ramana.\n\nAbout a year later, Janaky felt something like =\r\na forceful explosion at the\nback of her head and powerful currents througho=\r\nut her spinal cord. She did\nnot think her physical body could withstand it.=\r\n She said to herself, &#39;Let\nthings take their own course. The grace of the G=\r\nuru will do what is right\nand good for me.&#39; This state continued for twenty=\r\n-six days after which she\nasked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam.=\r\n He was reluctant at first\ndue to her evident weakness, but allowed himself=\r\n to be persuaded. Sri\nBhagavan&#39;s full glance of grace poured forth blessing=\r\ns and strength on her.\nEven before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her expe=\r\nriences, he spoke to her\nabout a similar experience he had had in his early=\r\n days: &quot;Look here. Don&#39;t\nget frightened. One day while I was lying in bed I=\r\n felt as if I had been\nbombed from inside at the back of my head.&quot;\n\nThe you=\r\nng Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said to\nJanaky in a=\r\n sweet, childish voice, &quot;Mother, see here! That Bhagavan we saw\nthere in Ti=\r\nruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you wherever\nyou go.&quot; =\r\nThese words were a source of great consolation and joy as Janaky\ncontinued =\r\nto feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.\n\nIt was January of 1938 when Jana=\r\nky&#39;s body became rigid from her toes upward.\nShe thought she was nearing he=\r\nr end. Her mind withdrew into Sri Ramana in\nthe heart. She had many visions=\r\n and experiences, but the one that crowned\nall others was the experience of=\r\n the dynamic force or Sakti ascending and\nembracing the Supreme Self. The k=\r\nundalini continued to push upwards and\ntried to break through the spot in t=\r\nhe top of her head. Janaky cried out,\n&quot;What are you trying to do? Bhagavan =\r\nSri Ramana and I are inseparable!\nAgainst the downpour of the Guru&#39;s Grace,=\r\n you can do me no harm.&quot; With this,\nthe force stopped its attempts and bodi=\r\nly feeling returned. She told the\nDoctor that she had at last been set free=\r\n from the rounds of birth and death\nand had attained her long cherished goa=\r\nl. The purpose of her earthly life\nwas fulfilled. By the grace of Bhagavan =\r\nSri Ramana, Janaky became a\nJivanmukta (liberated soul) at thirty-two years=\r\n of age.\n\nJanaky had travelled between Ramanasramam and her home whenever s=\r\nhe felt the\nneed to be near Bhagavan, but on January 18, 1938, while visiti=\r\nng\nRamanasramam, she did not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor wa=\r\ns\nupset and felt as if he had now lost his second wife. The younger childre=\r\nn\nwere grief-stricken. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she =\r\nwas\nrevelling in a glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she\nre=\r\nmembered the promise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for\nf=\r\nive more years. She immediately said she would go back with them to\nKakinad=\r\na. Bhagavan gazed at her and said, &quot;Did I ask you to become a\nsannyasini? L=\r\nook at me. I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre\ncloth. You h=\r\nave only one family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all\nthese devotee=\r\ns and their families.&quot; She knew then that renunciation must be\nin the heart=\r\n.\n\nJanaky was wondering why she should be having so many visions and\nexperi=\r\nences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle of birth and\ndeath=\r\n. Bhagavan gently said, &quot;Can one get this for the mere asking? It seeks\nthe=\r\n heart where it wants to shine.&quot;\n\nAs the Doctor and Janaky were preparing t=\r\no leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor,\n&quot;You doctors say that the heart is at th=\r\ne left side of the chest. But the\nwhole body is the heart for yogis. Jnanis=\r\n have their hearts both within and\nwithout.&quot; He then gazed at Janaky and ag=\r\nain assured her: &quot;I am always with\nyou.&quot;\n\nBhagavan was her All. She desired=\r\n only to contemplate the Holy Feet of\nBhagavan. In the months and years tha=\r\nt followed, devotees were drawn to\nJanaky as bees to honey. She began to be=\r\n addressed as Sri Matha. She took a\nfew of them to Sri Ramanasramam and sai=\r\nd to Bhagavan, &quot;All these people seek\nme as their Guru.I have never wished =\r\nto be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan,\nin all humility, to kindly accept t=\r\nhese devotees as Bhagavan&#39;s disciples.&quot;\n\nBhagavan said, &quot;When you are above=\r\n likes and dislikes, desires and\naversions, let things take their own shape=\r\n. To the extent they believe in\nyou, they will reap results. I will protect=\r\n those who, with full faith,\ntrust in you.&quot;\n\nAnother incident that happened=\r\n at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil lamp\nwent out and the hall was in dar=\r\nkness for a few minutes. When the light came\nback, three-year-old Swaminath=\r\nan exclaimed, &quot;The light failed and Bhagavan\nwas not visible; the light cam=\r\ne back and Bhagavan is seen!&quot; Bhagavan turned\nto the boy and said, &quot;What yo=\r\nu say is precisely correct. When there is\najnana (ignorance), God is not re=\r\nalized. With the dawn of jnana (wisdom), He\nis seen.&quot; As it was Bhagavan wh=\r\no gave Sri Matha her light of wisdom, she\ndecided to pay for the electrific=\r\nation of the Ashram.\n\nEven after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her=\r\n domestic and social\nactivities. She was elected President of the Child Wel=\r\nfare Centre and Vice\nPresident of the Ladies&#39; Club. She performed all her a=\r\nctions for God&#39;s sake\nin a supremely detached manner. With equanimity of mi=\r\nnd, she saw the Lord in\nall of the world.\n\nTo some people she would advise,=\r\n &quot;Lead a righteous life and discharge your\nduties to the family, conduct fa=\r\nmily worship, practise charity, have an\nabundant life and learn to graduall=\r\ny still the waves of passion.&quot; To others\nwho wanted to know more about Libe=\r\nration, she taught, &quot;Always nurture Divine\nthoughts, obliterate likes and p=\r\nassions and surrender to the Guru.&quot;\n\nThere were times when Sri Matha was lo=\r\nst in samadhi, oblivious to her\nsurroundings. Food had to be forced into he=\r\nr mouth for sustenance and she\nhad to be bathed by others, as she was obliv=\r\nious of her body. At other times\nshe attended to her routine work and conce=\r\naled her exalted state.\n\nAfter the marriage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Ma=\r\ntha was making final\narrangements for a permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam.=\r\n After bowing before\nBhagavan, the ten-year-old Swaminathan poured out his =\r\nsorrow, weeping\nbitterly and rolling on the ground. He sobbed, &quot;Pray give u=\r\ns back my mother\nand order her to come with us to Thanjavur.&quot;\n\nBhagavan, wi=\r\nth a voice choked with emotion said to Sri Matha, &quot;What can I\ndo?&quot; Then tur=\r\nning to Swaminathan said affectionately, &quot;Take your mother and\ngo back to T=\r\nhanjavur.&quot; Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan&#39;s request and\nreturned with the =\r\nDoctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandran.\n\nAt Sri Matha&#39;s re=\r\nquest the southern portion of the family house remain as an\nashram and spir=\r\nitual centre with Sri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main\nobjective of the ce=\r\nntre is to spread the teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.\n\nMoments before her pas=\r\nsing away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives\nchanted Bhagavan&#39;s hymn Ak=\r\nsharamanamalai, with the refrain of &quot;Arunachala\nShiva, Arunachala Shiva.&quot;\n\n=\r\nSri Matha&#39;s life stands as a shining example of perseverance to the ideal o=\r\nf\nLiberation and devotion to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her devote=\r\nes\nwere having a lengthy discussion of Bhagavan&#39;s &#39;Who am I?&#39; enquiry, she\n=\r\nhalted them saying, &quot;Enough of this discussion! My head begins to swim with=\r\n\nsuch dry and useless discussions. Amma knows only one thing - to show\ndevo=\r\ntion to Sri Bhagavan.&quot; It was through such steadfast devotion that Sri\nMath=\r\na achieved Liberation.\n\n&quot;A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of th=\r\ne fact that he is not the\nbody. But there is one thing more. Unless one loo=\r\nks upon death as a thing\nthat is very near and might happen at any moment, =\r\none will not be aware of\nthe Self. This means that the ego must die, must v=\r\nanish, along with the\ninherent vasanas.&quot; - Letters from Sri Ramanasramam\n\nS=\r\nource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2006/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd100aab9a071047b61e148\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nThe following article, which describes the life of a unique devo=\r\ntee of Bhagavan Ramana, was written by Darlene Delisi Karamanos, using Dr. =\r\nG.

Janaky was full of devotion to the local deities, Sri Viswanatha a=\r\nnd Visalakshi, and as she grew in years, Janaky desired to be like Sita, th=\r\ne ever-faithful, pure and holy wife of Sri Ram.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In her thirteenth =\r\nyear her uncle discussed with Janaky her willingness to marry a doctor who =\r\nwas then thirty-two years of age. When told that the widower had two daught=\r\ners, aged two and six, Sri Janaky replied, &quot;What of that? That doesn&#=\r\n39;t make much of a difference and, after all, I like children.&quot; Even =\r\nthough her parents were not too keen on this matrimonial arrangement becaus=\r\ne of the extreme age difference, Janaky intuitively felt that the doctor wo=\r\nuld be helpful in the attainment of her goal of Liberation. So in 1919, Sri=\r\n Janaky married Dr. C. S. Ganapathy (known hereafter as &#39;Doctor&#39;), =\r\nin a quiet ceremony performed before Lord Venkataramana of Tirupathi. The D=\r\noctor was often heard to remark: &quot;Wherever you (Janaky) go, I shall fo=\r\nllow you.&quot; And where else could she go, but to God? Living in Tirupath=\r\ni, Sri Matha&#39;s devotion to Sri Venkataramana grew steadily.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In=\r\n 1921, she gave birth to a daughter and named her Padmavathy, after the con=\r\nsort of Lord Venkataramana. Then a son, Srinivasa Subrahmanya, was born, an=\r\nd several years later another daughter, Sarada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There came a point i=\r\nn her life when she realized: &quot;To none but Him (God) should true love =\r\nbe directed. To turn to the Divine is the only truth in life.&quot; From th=\r\nat day on she continued to take care of her family and responsibilities but=\r\n shifted her life&#39;s ideal to that of total devotion to God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At the age of twenty her daily routine was a=\r\ns follows: She read the Gita and other Scriptures until about 1 a.m. every =\r\nnight. Janaky would get up at 5 a.m., finish her ablutions and meditate unt=\r\nil 7 a.m. Then she would take a bath, recite hymns while attending to house=\r\nhold work for about three hours, and after sending the children to school a=\r\nnd the Doctor to work, she would engage herself heart and soul in worship u=\r\nntil 1 p.m. From 1 to 4 p.m. she was busy looking after the needs of her hu=\r\nsband and children. At 4:30 p.m. she would go to the Ladies&#39; Club (whic=\r\nh did much volunteer community service), attend meetings, play tennis and r=\r\neturn home at 7 p.m. Upon returning home she would meditate for an hour bef=\r\nore taking her supper of gruel and milk. Though she took very little food, =\r\nshe was healthy and always cheerful.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Although the Doctor wa=\r\ns then earning a good salary, owing to various reasons, there was a lack of=\r\n funds. One day before going to bed she prayed to Sri Subrahmanya to keep h=\r\ner carefree by taking on His shoulders the oppressive burden of the family&=\r\n#39;s welfare. The next day, a sannyasi (ascetic) came to her house. She wa=\r\ns all alone when he said to her, &quot;You were calling me yesterday. I hav=\r\ne come from Palni. Leave to me all your family worries and worship me with =\r\na carefree heart. Whatever is needed for the family - be it money or other =\r\nneeds and necessities of life - will be provided for.&quot; He asked her to=\r\n give him the promise that she would never forget him. After she agreed, he=\r\n disappeared.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;After this she had many wonderful spiritual experien=\r\nces and visions of deities, often lasting the whole night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Subra=\r\nhmanya came twice more in the disguise of a sannyasi. When Janaky revealed =\r\nthis to the Doctor, he replied with scepticism, &quot;I will believe your w=\r\nords only if He comes here when I am in.&quot; Janaky responded, &quot;If t=\r\nhat be your desire, let it be so.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Doctor had just return=\r\ned for lunch when they both felt a presence outside. Seeing a sannyasi, bot=\r\nh Janaky and the Doctor came out and offered him a chair. He took some food=\r\n and said, &quot;You wanted me to come when your husband is in, and here I =\r\nam.&quot; To make the Doctor believe His Divinity, He exhibited some psychi=\r\nc powers. He asked for another chair and requested Janaky to be seated. She=\r\n felt reluctant to sit on the same level with Him, but he insisted and aske=\r\nd her what more she desired. Janaky requested Him to bless her with a Sadgu=\r\nru in human form.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;What the sannya=\r\nsi next said to her shocked her very much. &quot;I am none none other Subra=\r\nhmanya. Much pleased by your meritorious actions and depth of devotion, I h=\r\nave a longing to be born as a child to you. I will play with you for two ye=\r\nars and then my power will get infused in your heart.&quot; Janaky exclaime=\r\nd, &quot;My Lord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of samsara (wor=\r\nldliness) when my desire is to ferry across it.&quot; She argued that she w=\r\nould not be a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was on fire =\r\nwith renunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and punished=\r\n him? What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck and call;=\r\n she would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psychic powe=\r\nrs and fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, &quot;Let=\r\n me be blessed with a Guru.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;With a smile of His face,=\r\n Subrahmanya said, &quot;Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if such be your wish, =\r\nthere is a Mahatma by name Sri Ramana Maharshi in Tiruvannamalai. You may g=\r\no and have His darshan.&quot; He showed Janaky a photo of Bhagavan Ramana t=\r\nhat he was carrying. It was the first time that she had heard about Bhagava=\r\nn Sri Ramana. Saying that he would come again to discuss with her His desir=\r\ne to be born as her child, He disappeared from sight.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Her heart th=\r\nen surged with an intense love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana. She continued with =\r\nher meditations, worship, household chores and volunteer work. Day by day, =\r\nJanaky could feel a number of changes happening to her nervous system. Her =\r\nvisions continued. A severe pain developed in her spine and she became bedr=\r\nidden. Her nerves seemed to have been shattered and often the heartbeat was=\r\n faint and hardly audible. In spite of all this, her mind remained peaceful=\r\n. Friends wanted her to be seen by specialists, but the Doctor was sure it =\r\nwas not a disease to be treated medically and that, by the grace of God, sh=\r\ne would be all right. This state continued for forty days and then disappea=\r\nred as mysteriously as it came.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;After a few days, a sadhu appeared=\r\n before her and again asked about Subrahmanya being born to her. Again she =\r\npleaded that she didn&#39;t need obstacles, but a helping hand. The sadhu a=\r\nssured her that, &quot;Begetting a son will in no way shackle you in bondag=\r\ne. There will be no hindrances to your spiritual progress.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;J=\r\nanaky and the Doctor went to Sri Ramanasramam on April 20, 1935. Her long c=\r\nherished yearning was now going to materialize. Bhagavan was sitting in the=\r\n meditation hall. The moment Janaky entered the hall, the full and gracious=\r\n look of Bhagavan fell on her. She stood motionless, intoxicated with the n=\r\nectar flowing through Bhagavan&#39;s eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be seated.=\r\n Her heart swelled with joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flow of =\r\nBhagavan&#39;s Grace. Throughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagavan=\r\n blessing her.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the forml=\r\ness Arunachaleswara. In the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky kn=\r\nelt before Bhagavan and spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri S=\r\nubrahmanya&#39;s decision to incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her e=\r\nxperience of the all-pervasive nature of the Paramatma and awaited instruct=\r\nions from Bhagavan as to what she should do next. He said, &quot;Continue d=\r\noing it in just the same way.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;With the infant Swaminathan, J=\r\nanaky and the Doctor returned to Sri Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bhag=\r\navan in August 1936. For a long time Janaky had been praying for her husban=\r\nd&#39;s spiritual awareness to be aroused so that he might not, at any time=\r\n, stand in the way of her spiritual progress. Bhagavan asked both the Docto=\r\nr and Janaky to come before him and he read aloud &quot;Upadesa Saram&quot;=\r\n (Essence of Instruction) and asked them to follow it. Janaky&#39;s heart w=\r\nas overflowing with joy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;To quote from Janaky Matha&#39;s biograph=\r\ny:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;.From the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana, He =\r\nwas her all. She reasoned, &#39;There is only one thing in the world worth =\r\nachieving: the root cause of the whole universe, the &#39;One Without a Sec=\r\nond&#39;. I must attain it, realize it and experience it with Bhagavan&#39;=\r\ns Grace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Physically and mentally drained by her spiritual ex=\r\nperiences, Janaky sought Bhagavan&#39;s help in October 1936. At an opportu=\r\nne moment, she prostrated before Bhagavan and poured out her heart to him. =\r\nShe told of her spiritual experiences and begged for his protection and the=\r\n removal of obstacles in her quest for Liberation. She also expressed her f=\r\near of becoming deranged because she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan rep=\r\nlied: &quot;Who told you that you have no Guru? Don&#39;t get disheartened.=\r\n I am here as your Guru; nothing will upset your mind.&quot; With that assu=\r\nrance, she transferred all her cares and worries to Bhagavan Ramana.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;About a year later, Janaky felt something like a forceful explosion at t=\r\nhe back of her head and powerful currents throughout her spinal cord. She d=\r\nid not think her physical body could withstand it. She said to herself, &#3=\r\n9;Let things take their own course. The grace of the Guru will do what is r=\r\night and good for me.&#39; This state continued for twenty-six days after w=\r\nhich she asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam. He was reluctant=\r\n at first due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself to be persuaded.=\r\n Sri Bhagavan&#39;s full glance of grace poured forth blessings and strengt=\r\nh on her. Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her experiences, he s=\r\npoke to her about a similar experience he had had in his early days: &quot;=\r\nLook here. Don&#39;t get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed I fel=\r\nt as if I had been bombed from inside at the back of my head.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;The young Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said to Ja=\r\nnaky in a sweet, childish voice, &quot;Mother, see here! That Bhagavan we s=\r\naw there in Tiruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows you wher=\r\never you go.&quot; These words were a source of great consolation and joy a=\r\ns Janaky continued to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It wa=\r\ns January of 1938 when Janaky&#39;s body became rigid from her toes upward.=\r\n She thought she was nearing her end. Her mind withdrew into Sri Ramana in =\r\nthe heart. She had many visions and experiences, but the one that crowned a=\r\nll others was the experience of the dynamic force or Sakti ascending and em=\r\nbracing the Supreme Self. The kundalini continued to push upwards and tried=\r\n to break through the spot in the top of her head. Janaky cried out, &quot;=\r\nWhat are you trying to do? Bhagavan Sri Ramana and I are inseparable! Again=\r\nst the downpour of the Guru&#39;s Grace, you can do me no harm.&quot; With =\r\nthis, the force stopped its attempts and bodily feeling returned. She told =\r\nthe Doctor that she had at last been set free from the rounds of birth and =\r\ndeath and had attained her long cherished goal. The purpose of her earthly =\r\nlife was fulfilled.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;By the grace of B=\r\nhagavan Sri Ramana, Janaky became a Jivanmukta (liberated soul) at thirty-t=\r\nwo years of age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Janaky had travelled between Ramanasramam =\r\nand her home whenever she felt the need to be near Bhagavan,=C2=A0&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;but on January 18, 1938, while visiting Ramanasrama=\r\nm, she did not feel like continuing in family life. Doctor was upset and fe=\r\nlt as if he had now lost his second wife. The younger children were grief-s=\r\ntricken. Their appeals and tears did not dissuade her as she was revelling =\r\nin a glorious spiritual realm. Then, the next morning, she remembered the p=\r\nromise she had made to Bhagavan to remain in the family for five more years=\r\n. She immediately said she would go back with them to Kakinada. Bhagavan ga=\r\nzed at her and said, &quot;Did I ask you to become a sannyasini? Look at me=\r\n. I have not taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre cloth. You have only =\r\none family, but I have to shoulder the burden of all these devotees and the=\r\nir families.&quot; She knew then that renunciation must be in the heart.&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many visions=\r\n and experiences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle of birt=\r\nh and death. Bhagavan gently said, &quot;Can one get this for the mere aski=\r\nng? It seeks the heart where it wants to shine.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As the Docto=\r\nr and Janaky were preparing to leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor, &quot;You d=\r\noctors say that the heart is at the left side of the chest. But the whole b=\r\nody is the heart for yogis. Jnanis have their hearts both within and withou=\r\nt.&quot; He then gazed at Janaky and again assured her: &quot;I am always w=\r\nith you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was her All. She desired only to contempla=\r\nte the Holy Feet of Bhagavan.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;In the=\r\n months and years that followed, devotees were drawn to Janaky as bees to h=\r\noney. She began to be addressed as Sri Matha. She took a few of them to Sri=\r\n Ramanasramam and said to Bhagavan, &quot;All these people seek me as their=\r\n Guru.I have never wished to be a Guru. I would request Bhagavan, in all hu=\r\nmility, to kindly accept these devotees as Bhagavan&#39;s disciples.&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan said, &quot;When you are above likes and dislikes, desire=\r\ns and aversions, let things take their own shape. To the extent they believ=\r\ne in you, they will reap results. I will protect those who, with full faith=\r\n, trust in you.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Anot=\r\nher incident that happened at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil lamp went o=\r\nut and the hall was in darkness for a few minutes. When the light came back=\r\n, three-year-old Swaminathan exclaimed, &quot;The light failed and Bhagavan=\r\n was not visible; the light came back and Bhagavan is seen!&quot; Bhagavan =\r\nturned to the boy and said, &quot;What you say is precisely correct. When t=\r\nhere is ajnana (ignorance), God is not realized. With the dawn of jnana (wi=\r\nsdom), He is seen.&quot; As it was Bhagavan who gave Sri Matha her light of=\r\n wisdom, she decided to pay for the electrification of the Ashram.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even after realization, Sri Matha carried on with her domestic and =\r\nsocial activities. She was elected President of the Child Welfare Centre an=\r\nd Vice President of the Ladies&#39; Club. She performed all her actions for=\r\n God&#39;s sake in a supremely detached manner. With equanimity of mind, sh=\r\ne saw the Lord in all of the world.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;To some people she would advise, &quot;Lead a righteous life and dischar=\r\nge your duties to the family, conduct family worship, practise charity, hav=\r\ne an abundant life and learn to gradually still the waves of passion.&quot;=\r\n To others who wanted to know more about Liberation, she taught, &quot;Alwa=\r\nys nurture Divine thoughts, obliterate likes and passions and surrender to =\r\nthe Guru.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There were times when Sri Matha was lost in=\r\n samadhi, oblivious to her surroundings. Food had to be forced into her mou=\r\nth for sustenance and she had to be bathed by others, as she was oblivious =\r\nof her body. At other times she attended to her routine work and concealed =\r\nher exalted state.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;After the mar=\r\nriage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Matha was making final arrangements for =\r\na permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam. After bowing before Bhagavan, the ten=\r\n-year-old Swaminathan poured out his sorrow, weeping bitterly and rolling o=\r\nn the ground. He sobbed, &quot;Pray give us back my mother and order her to=\r\n come with us to Thanjavur.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan, with a voice choked wi=\r\nth emotion said to Sri Matha, &quot;What can I do?&quot; Then turning to Sw=\r\naminathan said affectionately, &quot;Take your mother and go back to Thanja=\r\nvur.&quot; Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan&#39;s request and returned with =\r\nthe Doctor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandran.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At Sri Matha&#39;s request the southern =\r\nportion of the family house remain as an ashram and spiritual centre with S=\r\nri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main objective of the centre is to spread t=\r\nhe teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Moments before her passing=\r\n away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives chanted Bhagavan&#39;s hymn Ak=\r\nsharamanamalai, with the refrain of &quot;Arunachala Shiva, Arunachala Shiv=\r\na.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Sri Matha&#39;s life stan=\r\nds as a shining example of perseverance to the ideal of Liberation and devo=\r\ntion to Bhagavan Ramana. Once, when some of her devotees were having a leng=\r\nthy discussion of Bhagavan&#39;s &#39;Who am I?&#39; enquiry, she halted th=\r\nem saying, &quot;Enough of this discussion! My head begins to swim with suc=\r\nh dry and useless discussions. Amma knows only one thing - to show devotion=\r\n to Sri Bhagavan.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0It was through such steadfast devotion =\r\nthat Sri Matha achieved Liberation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;&quot;A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of the fact that he i=\r\ns not the body. But there is one thing more. Unless one looks upon death as=\r\n a thing that is very near and might happen at any moment, one will not be =\r\naware of the Self. This means that the ego must die, must vanish, along wit=\r\nh the inherent vasanas.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;- Letters from Sri Ramanasramam&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.arunachala.org/newsletters/2006/?pg=3Dmay-jun&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://=\r\nwww.arunachala.org/newsletters/2006/?pg=3Dmay-jun&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:bo=\r\nth;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;lin=\r\ne-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size=\r\n:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;l=\r\nine-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n=C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=\r\n=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd100aab9a071047b61e148--\r\n\n"}}
