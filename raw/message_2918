I shall use it as my reference and try to c=\r\nlarify your doubt. Learned members in this group, please correct me if I am=\r\n wrong. \n=A0\n&gt;&gt; also the mental conditioning represented by chitta influenc=\r\nes what entity one\ncan identify with. \n(Mental conditioning are our habits =\r\nand in karma theory, unless chitta is overwritten with and made it into a d=\r\niamond (die-mind) state, spiritual evolution is difficult to achieve)\n\n&gt;&gt; A=\r\n regular person&#39;s free will is not strong enough to bend the curve of habit=\r\n resulting from previous actions and change the course.\n=A0\nAnd all the spi=\r\nritual sadhanas (japa, homam, satsanga, kriya yoga etc)=A0that one undertak=\r\nes are to increase the free will. \n=A0\ne.g, Costant Satsanga(singing devoti=\r\nonal songs in groups, where in you forget who are you...i.e.,=A0ego dies do=\r\nwn for a moment)=A0leads to detachment, which inturn leads to removal of de=\r\nlusion and hence gain in wisdom. That is why Nagara Sankirtana, Singing son=\r\ngs in praise of lord had been part of village culture in India=A0for a long=\r\n time. \n=A0\nJapa causes chitta to be written into a die-mind state and henc=\r\ne change in habits. \n=A0\nSpiritualists say that in any sadhana(s), self-dis=\r\ncipline, detachment with vichara (with regard to permanence and impermanenc=\r\ne)=A0 are necessary to evolve (i.e., to change habits) oneself. \n=A0\nAnd no=\r\nw coming to Kriya yoga, it&#39;s also one of spiritual sadhanas. Scriptures say=\r\n that there are seven layers of existence. Body, Breath, Mind, Buddhi, Chit=\r\nta, Ego, Self.(refer to=A0Narasimha&#39;s mail on antahkaranas)=A0Breath connec=\r\nts body to the mind, like when one is angry, the breath is fast. When one i=\r\ns happy, the breath is different and when one is normal, breath is normal. =\r\nSo breath reflects your state of mind. \nKriya yoga works on breath. With th=\r\ne rhythmic control of breath, the mind is controlled(quite reverse of the e=\r\nxamples that were mentioned earlier, where-in if X is the state of mind, Y =\r\nis the breath pattern. So what if Y is the breath pattern, can we get X sta=\r\nte of mind??), hence the thoughts that originate in mind.\n=A0\nFor any sadha=\r\nna to work, it has to become an habit, ofcourse Bhava/Contempation is a mus=\r\nt during the course of Sadhana, without which it&#39;s just a waste of time. Th=\r\nat&#39;s why you have 40 day sadhana for Ayyappa devotees, that&#39;s why Sri Naras=\r\nimha suggested recitation of 2 malas of Savitur Gayatri for 100 days, with =\r\nthe reason being=A0they become=A0into a habit during the course of time and=\r\n hence benefits are=A0felt.=A0(When one is a child learning numbers, we nev=\r\ner understood the benefit of learning numbers until the mind is matured eno=\r\nugh=A0to use=A0them and by then, numbers have become an habit for us)=A0\n=\r\n=A0\nAnd as for complimenting of different sadhanas, All I can say is it&#39;s i=\r\nndividual&#39;s choice. Some do japa+satsanga, some homam+satsanga, some yoga+h=\r\nomam and some any other combination or just japa or homam alone and which e=\r\nver may be the case, right effort and self-discipline is a must from sadhak=\r\na to make progress. \n\n=A0\nThanks & Regards,\n--Murahari\n=A0\n\n--- On Wed, 10/=\r\n21/09, dahiyajiten &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: dahiyajiten &lt;da=\r\nhiyajiten@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: AOL\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\nDate: Wednesday, October 21, 2009, 12:45 PM\n\n\nNamaste,\ni have =\r\nalways faced problem in combining my japa with breath control.\nSo,i don&#39;t k=\r\nnow whether it will be useful or not.\nMoreover i am doing homam on weekly b=\r\nasis.Will it complement it ?\nIf somebody has more idea than Laxmiji then pl=\r\nease share with us.\nRegards\nJitender \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello, \n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 I did this course some years back in London.
