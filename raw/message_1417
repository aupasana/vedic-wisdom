For example if VSNS takes around 1 hour, =\r\nthen start is approximately at the time during travel when an hour is left =\r\nto reach the destination.\n\nIf still not finished due to some wrong time cal=\r\nculations, then sit for some time in you car and hear the stotra completely=\r\n :). We can surely do that if we really like listening to that. But that wi=\r\nll be too much for asking.\n\nPeople like you need to be congratulated who li=\r\nsten to Rudram and Sahastranam instead of listening to all the other stuff.=\r\n\n\nYou surely know what I recommended. Kindly bear with me.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\n=\r\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Narasimha Garu, Namaskaram.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have one another question to thi=\r\ns list, kindly clarify;\n&gt; \n&gt; Typically, i travel 1.5 hrs each side from my =\r\nhome to office, so i generally prefer to listen to Rudra Namakam chamakam, =\r\nvishnu sahsasranamam etc during this travel time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Manay times, since =\r\ni reach my destination i had to cut short the playing audio in my car, i&#39;m =\r\nnot sure if that is a good practise or not, or do i have to necessarily com=\r\nplete the entire audio thing? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Krishna Kanth \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste =\r\nVenkat garu,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This IS the purpose of the group and not at all a mi=\r\nsuse.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) It is perfectly ok. In fact, even if the original exper=\r\nt recorded it mechanically and without much devotion, you will still get go=\r\nod punya from it if you listen to it with focus and devotion.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The=\r\n purpose of mantra is to control the mind and its thoughts and tap some spi=\r\nritual energy that the mind has access to but does not get because of its v=\r\narious pre-occupations. If you hear something with focus, it still helps in=\r\n controlling the mind, tapping some spiritual energy. It is still beneficia=\r\nl.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, as you become comfortable with it, try to chant it yo=\r\nurself at some stage. That is a little better.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) Yes. As you he=\r\nar, a part of your mind is repeating that sound while you do the actions. I=\r\nt will still be beneficial. In fact, I know that some people who are now do=\r\ning homam quite well started out in that manner!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (3) You will ben=\r\nefit mainly. But various people who enabled you will also get some small po=\r\nrtions of it. But most of the benefit for this specific action is yours.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hello =\r\nPVR gaaru: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have couple of dumb questions; please don&#39;t laug=\r\nh get a chance can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you please clarify the same for me, hope I&#39;m not =\r\nmisusing the group \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with my silly questions: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.\tWill th=\r\nere be any effect of playing Audio Mantras read/rendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by experts?=\r\n (as layman like me, who do not know how to pronounce the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit m=\r\nantras correctly, is it OK to take help of the CD&#39;s or Audio \n&gt; &gt; &gt; MP3 man=\r\ntras available?). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.\tYou have provided Audio and Video of Ganapathi =\r\nHomam, will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there be the same effect if one plays and mimic (imitati=\r\nng the actions \n&gt; &gt; &gt; without any self voice and your original voice in pla=\r\nce)? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3.\tIf the answers to the above is `Yes&#39;, who will get benefitte=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (I mean will I get benefited or the originators who rendered the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras or performed Homam?)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
