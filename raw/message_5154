One mostly cannot go into samadhi while chanting them (though there ca=\r\nn be exceptions). On the other hand, when one chants Gayatri mantra or asht=\r\nakshari mantra or dwadasakshari mantra or panchakshari mantra or navarna ma=\r\nntra or various beeja mantras or other small mantras, it requires a minimal=\r\n amount of conscious mental activity. With repetitive and minimal mental ac=\r\ntivity, there is a possibility of momentary cessation of mental activity an=\r\nd entering samadhi OR awakening of Kundalini and progress towards samadhi.\n=\r\n \nIf one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things are fine. =\r\nBut, that may not happen. Kundalini can take many different paths and go to=\r\n different places. Depending on the impurities in various nadis, various ex=\r\nperiences are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to handle the experience=\r\n, it can create problems. One can experience something nice and become prou=\r\nd and egoistic and get stuck there. One can experience a very fierce form o=\r\nf divine and get scared to death or go mad. Many possibilities are there.\n =\r\n\nThus, practices that can truly awaken one were kept limited to the initiat=\r\ned. Guru would assess the progress and readiness of a sadhaka and initiate =\r\none when one is ready.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHowever, there are a few thi=\r\nngs that are different in today&#39;s times:\n \n(1) There are very few people wh=\r\no are ready to experience something. Most people will just do sadhana, burn=\r\n some basic blocking karmas and not really experience much. At most, some p=\r\neople will experience an awakening and just a little movement of Kundalini.=\r\n\n(2) There are very few gurus who are indeed capable of assessing and guidi=\r\nng a sadhaka well. Most initiations are a mere formality.\n(3) With the insi=\r\nstence on initiation etc, we may be blocking, in the coming years, the very=\r\n few sadhakas who MAY actually achieve some progress with a mantra, from ev=\r\nen trying it.\n(4) If a sadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of &quot;I do not=\r\n know the right way. I am just doing what I am capable of. Please take care=\r\n of me Mother&quot;, none of the risks I mentioned above will really apply.\n(5) =\r\nEspecially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga practices that ar=\r\ne meant to forcefully awaken and raise Kundalini and if one does not consci=\r\nously think in terms of raising Kundalini, one is safe.\n(6) If one is not l=\r\nooking for any specific results and doing a mantra just for spiritual progr=\r\ness with a sense of surrender, one is safe.\n \n*        *        *\n \nApart f=\r\nrom assessing the readiness, there are some more functions performed by an =\r\ninitiating guru:\n \n(1) A guru can jumpstart one&#39;s sadhana with a mantra and=\r\n results can come faster.\n \nHowever, this expects a guru of some caliber an=\r\nd achievement with the mantra. After all, if one wants a one-on-one audienc=\r\ne with Sachin Tendulkar or Roger Federer or Barack Obama, being introduced =\r\nto them by someone they know and someone that had a one-on-one audience wit=\r\nh them earlier can be helpful (instead of introducing by oneself). If someo=\r\nne who merely read more about them but is not any closer to them tries to i=\r\nntroduce you to them, will it even get their attention?\n \nNow-a-days, most =\r\npeople do not have access to gurus who have experienced the divine with a m=\r\nantra. Such people are very rare. One&#39;s best bet is to do sadhana by onesel=\r\nf, using all the tools given by rishis and various spiritual masters. When =\r\none is ready (and if it is needed), a guru may come and take one&#39;s sadhana =\r\nto the next level.\n \n(2) A guru can mould the correct attitude in sadhaka b=\r\nefore a sadhana is taken up.\n \nHowever, there are sadhakas initiated in pow=\r\nerful mantras and not having the right attitude. For example, I know people=\r\n initiated into Bagalamukhi mantra and trying to use it to win litigation. =\r\nIf one does not know that a &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (supreme knowledge) is for overcomi=\r\nng conditioning and realizing self and not for winning court cases, one&#39;s i=\r\nnitiation is no good.\n \nOn the other hand, I know some people not formally =\r\ninitiated into Chandipath, but doing Chandi homam daily with saptashati and=\r\n also navarna mantra. I know that they do not have any specific material go=\r\nals and are overcoming the few desires that were originally there at the ba=\r\nck of the mind. The are making quick progress spiritually and their thinkin=\r\ng is getting transformed nicely. Despite having no formal initiation, aren&#39;=\r\nt they worshipping Chandi as a Mahavidya?\n \nBottomline is that one can moul=\r\nd one&#39;s own attitude through a formal initiation or through reading scriptu=\r\nres, satsanga and constant contemplation. One thing may work better in one =\r\ncase and another thing in another case.\n \n(3) A guru can teach the correct =\r\nprocedure of a sadhana.\n \nHowever, role of procedural correctness in succes=\r\ns is a higher in sadhanas for specific results than sadhana for spiritual p=\r\nrogress. I maintain that the art of getting specific results from sadhanas =\r\nis being hidden more and more as Kali progresses, for a reason. I suggest t=\r\nhat it is useless to even think in those terms and pursue it.\n \nMantras lik=\r\ne navarna mantra can just be meditated on, without any specific procedure. =\r\nWhen one is ready and pure enough, they can give one an experience of the d=\r\nivine. Mantras like Siddha Kunjika stotra, that codify several specific sad=\r\nhanas to get specific results, are anyway inaccessible to most people of th=\r\nis age! They are only available in codified form and gurus who can decode t=\r\nhem will keep disappearing more and more.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; For tho=\r\nse who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is\n&gt;=\r\n no need to worry or be confused. ... Please keep doing whatever you are do=\r\ning.\n \nGiven this statement, the difference of opinion between us are very =\r\nsubtle.\n \nOne word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels =\r\na sense of guilt, it blocks the practice from working effectively. Please d=\r\no whatever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If you have the sense =\r\nof guilt, work on overcoming it. If you cannot overcome it, it may be a goo=\r\nd idea to find a sadhana with which you feel comfortable and have no sense =\r\nof guilt.\n \n&gt; Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. L=\r\neave the rest to\n&gt; the compassionate Goddess.\n \nThat&#39;s the bottomline. Even=\r\n if one were initiated, it would be quite difficult to not leave things to =\r\nthe Goddess and make things happen as one wanted. Start sadhana with some l=\r\nevel of surrender. Then, sadhana will help increase the level of surrender.=\r\n \n \n*        *        *\n \nNagraj garu,\n \nThe opinion referred to in your qu=\r\nestion 2 is not without basis. But again, we need to understand the motivat=\r\nion to put it in the right perspective.\n \nIf one experiences divine through=\r\n sadhana with Gayatri mantra (or any mantra), then it is easy for one to ex=\r\nperience divine with another mantra. One can just pick up a mantra, do it a=\r\nnd experience relatively quickly.\n \nHowever, if one was merely initiated in=\r\n Gayatri mantra (or any mantra) and did not really make much spiritual prog=\r\nress with it, that does not place one in any kind of advantage when it come=\r\ns to sadhana with another mantra. That is my opinion.\n \nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---=\r\n- Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Dr. Satya Prakash, \n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; I do see your points and do understand that Sankara peethams discourage t=\r\nhe practise of mahavidyas without the Initiation.

The only major point where I disagre=\r\ne is whether one can do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest =\r\nof the confusion on translation of mantras needs some clarification as ther=\r\ne seems to be some unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.\tThere are=\r\n various sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broa=\r\ndly speaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kav=\r\nachas, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and m=\r\nantras.  The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; 2.\tUndoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original. =\r\nReading a translation is not even comparable to chanting the original chant=\r\n. So far it is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.\tWhilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all base=\r\nd on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between them.\n&gt;      \n&gt; 4.\tAs=\r\n per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant a stotr=\r\na or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras containin=\r\ng bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need initiation. T=\r\nhis is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not the same=\r\n as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generally referred =\r\nto as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the actual id=\r\nea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct spiritua=\r\nl specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as K=\r\nali or Sri.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 5.\tVishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc=\r\n do not need initiation as they fall under stotra category only. Lalitasaha=\r\nsranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras o=\r\nr parts of puranas. They have a larger status as integral parts of a Mahavi=\r\ndya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is not recommended especially=\r\n when the reader combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as an integra=\r\nl part of the chanting.\n&gt;            \n&gt; 6.\tI know from personal interaction=\r\n that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas reco=\r\nmmend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya alon=\r\ng with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are trea=\r\nted as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these tradi=\r\ntions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navarna as well as s=\r\nhodashakshari mantras.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 7.\tRecapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam=\r\n is a great text that has an independent status by itself as part of a Maha=\r\nvidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaiti=\r\nc text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is=\r\n an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one =\r\nneeds to be initiated to chant it. However if one wishes to benefit from th=\r\ne Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the =\r\nsacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chant=\r\ning the original along with the navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadha=\r\nna of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and go th=\r\nrough the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 8.\tArguably i=\r\nf an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit a=\r\ns part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inheren=\r\nt problem in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana of De=\r\nvi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers ina=\r\ndvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the S=\r\niddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 9.\tI you care=\r\nfully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, nowhere=\r\n do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I attempted=\r\n to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have the power=\r\n of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended to know =\r\nthe essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while chanting =\r\nit. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a translation! =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 10.\tFor those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initi=\r\nation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There has to be a certain =\r\nlevel of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all hav=\r\ne it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or no initiation). Ple=\r\nase keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious not to do sakama sa=\r\ndhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is better to just do th=\r\ne sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude itself w=\r\nill reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will happen on their own =\r\naccord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compassionate Goddess.   =\r\n           \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope the above pointers help in clearing any confusion.  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Satya Prakash                \n&gt; \n&gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste everybody\n&gt; &gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi =\r\nMaha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; &gt; When Swamig=\r\nal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the\n&gt; &gt; learn=\r\ned persons male and female alike\n&gt; &gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vi=\r\nshnu SahasraNamam in kannada language\n&gt; &gt; so that they can chant knowing th=\r\ne meaning fully.\n&gt; &gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made e=\r\narly in the morning.\n&gt; &gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were ove=\r\nr as usual Postman came to\n&gt; &gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mut=\r\nt Swamigal. Swamigal was\n&gt; &gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; &gt; in front of=\r\n the learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; &gt; Code an=\r\nd followed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; &gt; explain=\r\n the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; &gt; under=\r\nstood the significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; &gt; mem=\r\nber to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and read\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that even the meanin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; of PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves the purpose=\r\n and\n&gt; &gt; people are using it in day to day work. Similarly not knowing the =\r\nmeaning of\n&gt; &gt; Vishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benefits of chanti=\r\nng the stothsram\n&gt; &gt; was he told the group. Hope the above incidence bring =\r\nsome clue to our\n&gt; &gt; discussion forum\n&gt; &gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Tue, Oct=\r\n 26, 2010 at 9:10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n Girish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not at all against knowing the meaning, so that o=\r\nne can immerse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; oneself in what one is chanting. That is definitely th=\r\ne ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If that is not possible, what I am saying is=\r\n that reading something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; composed by an elevated being even without un=\r\nderstanding the meaning is very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not unde=\r\nrstand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that i=\r\nt extols Ganapathi as the source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a s=\r\nense of surrender to Ganapathi. One can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If o=\r\nne is not experiencing anything, it is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one does n=\r\not have the correct attitude and surrender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; probably not because o=\r\nne does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many =\r\npeople knowing the meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many laye=\r\nrs and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important =\r\nlayers are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of meaning =\r\nare never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a c=\r\nalm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people kee=\r\np a target\n&gt; &gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sen=\r\nse of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrende=\r\nr to the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra=\r\n is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thoug=\r\nhts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one of those thousand activiti=\r\nes, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subside and mind is essenti=\r\nally reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mant=\r\nra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physic=\r\nal vibration is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the min=\r\nd, the thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind=\r\n etc. Some mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (e=\r\nssentially beings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such =\r\nthat the physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can eventually cause the co=\r\nrresponding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when other mental activ=\r\nity subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; calming the mind d=\r\nown, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in your mi=\r\nnd.

When I floated the idea, Manish disc=\r\nouraged me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it =\r\ncould be considered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for th=\r\nen.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, me=\r\nditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual u=\r\nnderstanding of what they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean. They are tools to silence the mind an=\r\nd channel its energy. They are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by ris=\r\nhis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nn intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, right\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra that was\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n In fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a norma=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I=\r\n suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying about whether one understands or not and readin=\r\ng Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playi=\r\nng cricket, a batsman may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to =\r\nplay shots, how to see the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to m=\r\nove feet, how get into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a st=\r\nraight bat, when to play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. B=\r\nut that does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; batsman. If one practice=\r\ns, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basic understandi=\r\nng of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more importa=\r\nnt than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual under=\r\nstanding is important in spirituality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana i=\r\ns more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantra=\r\ns, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should overc=\r\nome the notions that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things and realize that the divine =\r\nacts through all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through each being based on o=\r\nne&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through=\r\n the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is =\r\nmine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the essen=\r\nce of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and a=\r\ngain. There is no magic formula to internalize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that one does not intellectually=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understand, that is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures i=\r\ns at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watc=\r\nhing over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable t=\r\nhoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to=\r\n read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people=\r\n (physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But th=\r\nat will only create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical understanding. For it to be interna=\r\nlized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one=\r\n needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic the=\r\noretical understanding of what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a bl=\r\nind person running around a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not=\r\n doing sadhana, but having an excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is=\r\n like a person who knows that he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mountain, but kee=\r\nps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation is important in tantr=\r\nic path but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;=\r\ns attitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material re=\r\nsults needs to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangemen=\r\nt of karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires su=\r\npervision of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other h=\r\nand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and is looki=\r\nng for spiritual progress, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path =\r\nis for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic path is for self=\r\n-realization. That is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may=\r\n chant Manyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for=\r\n longevity, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a g=\r\nross substance in an elaborate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;a=\r\nll is Brahman&quot; and to remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some object=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are l=\r\nooking for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and su=\r\npervision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if yo=\r\nu want spiritual progress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your surrender, you can =\r\njust keep doing sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep com=\r\npany of scriptures and other like-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all,=\r\n if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; directions=\r\n and some supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can =\r\nkeep walking towards north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n too, but you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@... &lt;vedic_pathak%40y=\r\nahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or an=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language is because understanding the meaning and &gt;=\r\nconstant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;=\r\ntext in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes =\r\nSir, if this is the reason then its understandable.

Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nlast 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an int=\r\nernet\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the ori=\r\nginal post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and qui=\r\nckly browsed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; through some posts. I am happy to note that the general =\r\natmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; far better and more sincere than a lot of other fo=\r\nrums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; browsed through this particular thread, I though=\r\nt that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the=\r\n necessity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big=\r\n picture that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE ques=\r\ntion and the MANY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the question a general=\r\n or specific one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question is whether initi=\r\nation is an absolute\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* =\r\nanswer is- NO. However if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the question is about the necessity of bein=\r\ng initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the ans=\r\nwer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde=\r\n matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; necessity for m=\r\nultiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inevitability =\r\nof multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many pa=\r\nths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; r=\r\nestrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nc. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devot=\r\nion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfl=\r\ness Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is =\r\nnothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; abstract Truths of the =\r\nCosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; methods and tec=\r\nhniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an expe=\r\nriential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techn=\r\niques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who =\r\nare predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speaking even t=\r\nhe external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; benefit fro=\r\nm the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of =\r\nAdvaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (s=\r\nelf-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nself-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external prac=\r\ntices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Ab=\r\nhyasa (self-coaching by consistent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reacti=\r\nvity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise=\r\n &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) to=\r\no while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasise only the firs=\r\nt two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptanc=\r\ne of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the con=\r\ntrary the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bh=\r\nagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is=\r\n the mainstay of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana =\r\nwhere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the ne=\r\ncessity of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalizatio=\r\nn of certain occult\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truths via the energetics of Sabda through the em=\r\nployment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab e=\r\nxperiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain regulations and safe practices. It shou=\r\nld be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or A=\r\ngni at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; predominantly invokes Soma (the r=\r\neference here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths tha=\r\nt invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the fire of the intellect, an=\r\nother the fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; austerity, and yet anot=\r\nher the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak=\r\n through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs hi=\r\nghly powerful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; techniques that bring results more quickly it lays grea=\r\nt emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more abou=\r\nt qualification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Would you allow a child to experiment with fire with=\r\nout any supervision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experience and training=\r\n or not? Like any other lab\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment proper training and experience=\r\n are part of the procedure apart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in the=\r\n Tantric lab experiment too. However the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousne=\r\nss whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the individual=\r\n consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As this is not =\r\na topic for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; further dis=\r\ncussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other needless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; details h=\r\nere, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, on=\r\ne has to contextualise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakt=\r\ni sadhana is one major river\n&gt; &gt; &gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Ma=\r\nha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However th=\r\nere are actually three major schools\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living tra=\r\nditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vidya sadhana bel=\r\nongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vajrayana=\r\ns among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fa=\r\nmiliar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma =\r\nis not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at =\r\nleast at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The =\r\nyantra, mantra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particula=\r\nr set of synchronistic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these three lineages. =\r\nInitiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; entry of the practitioner into a parti=\r\ncular spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru parampara can b=\r\ne compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself at the root from whe=\r\nre the trunk arises. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sub-branches and twigs spread ou=\r\nt progressively downward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka. It is a beautif=\r\nul metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; &gt; &gt; metaphor that one=\r\n can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advocate t=\r\nhat initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; condu=\r\nit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beaut=\r\niful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires=\r\n, where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice=\r\n all the way up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Pr=\r\nakasa) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awake=\r\nn Sakti within the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual consciousness through an integrated app=\r\nroach that combines the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and M=\r\nantra. Both Kalikula and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensi=\r\nve and integrated approaches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many in=\r\n the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic approach.=\r\n However it is also a full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Up=\r\nanishads. It is also simultaneously a text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Yogasastra as well as M=\r\nantrasastra. The question of initiation is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevant only to those fol=\r\nlowing the Tantramarga and thus employing the text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a mantramaya te=\r\nxt . For those who explore the text as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; esoteric mea=\r\nning is more relevant which I have covered extensively in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; write-up=\r\n. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ch=\r\nandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory=\r\n in the text is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in f=\r\null-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fashion that She is one without a second, say=\r\ning &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (=\r\n10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and ref=\r\nlect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; other regional language is because understanding the meaning and constant=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the text in a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its=\r\n obvious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equall=\r\ny regarded as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hym=\r\nns. In that regard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda S=\r\namhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practic=\r\ne of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic=\r\n method will straightaway\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic p=\r\nractice. In fact even the worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple =\r\nis fully based on and DERIVED from a one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic =\r\nYagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiation as per i=\r\nts own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Veda=\r\nntic path of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vai=\r\nragya, or even the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as =\r\nSacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one is not incline=\r\nd to the predominantly Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may bene=\r\nfit from any or all of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However on=\r\ne has to bear in mind that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; living and breathing traditions of bot=\r\nh Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practiced originally in various part=\r\ns of the subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to Tantra marga and=\r\n hence the importance of initiation for those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In s=\r\nummary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merthods/p=\r\nractices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Iswarapran=\r\nidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are =\r\nall effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approa=\r\nch of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture aga=\r\ninst which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective =\r\nof the method and path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effectiv=\r\ne methods for all of us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts fol=\r\nlowed by reflection on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is bes=\r\nt done in a language that one is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSAN=\r\nGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; &gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is t=\r\nhe alternate method (though not as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not p=\r\nossible. It is Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; alone that enables one to make=\r\n rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare =\r\nexalted state by virtue of serving, listening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to and spending time in=\r\n the company of sadhus and sants in his younger days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda , J=\r\nnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual lives =\r\nafter they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Ma=\r\ntsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For =\r\nthose who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will j=\r\nust quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a compl=\r\naint by householders nowadays that there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are no good Mahatmas.

Thi=\r\ns is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thirsty, you wil=\r\nl find your Master at your threshold.

If you bring =\r\na charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious=\r\n charge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is=\r\n an opportunity for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satsangha.

However, one without a rich father is still bett=\r\ner off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up =\r\nslowly with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru ca=\r\nn still do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual =\r\naccount. If you find a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but =\r\ntruly initiate you), get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do i=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rit=\r\nuals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; getting specific material re=\r\nsults and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and making spiritual =\r\nprogress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important. But,=\r\n in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prepare one su=\r\nfficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few=\r\n people who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole =\r\nsystem, for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and=\r\n rituals only for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever material res=\r\nults god wants to give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. If one is meant=\r\n to do rituals for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *specific* material results (for oneself=\r\n or others or society/universe in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; general), Nature will make arrangem=\r\nents for one to get correct knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one st=\r\narts, one should start with the attitude of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any ma=\r\nntra or any ritual or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have s=\r\neveral material desires, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil them. Becaus=\r\ne of this ritual, god may give any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; material results or spiritual resu=\r\nlts and not necessarily fulfil my desires.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will accept whatever god=\r\n gives. I want to increase my devotion and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrender and make spiritu=\r\nal progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; required. That att=\r\nitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fe=\r\nwer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and tr=\r\nying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gen=\r\ntle, one may do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the fl=\r\noor will be minimal. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one may do it fast =\r\nand there may be more spillage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on the floor. But the=\r\n good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits will be retrieved faster. S=\r\nimilarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basket. The deity is trying to=\r\n take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; give you a good fruit =\r\nto eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like Ganapathi, Vi=\r\nshnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruit, but the=\r\n spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava o=\r\nr Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes =\r\nout faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end,=\r\n remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of =\r\nyour own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to eat each of th=\r\nose rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spil=\r\nlage of rotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as C=\r\nhandi and staying with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation if made mandato=\r\nry, one can be assessed by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru before starting a practice. If you =\r\nrealize the above, you can start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantras without initiation. If some =\r\nbad results occut, you have to realize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that it is a fruit of your own=\r\n actions and the deity is trying to accelerate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; good results. If you a=\r\nre weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and =\r\nwere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who =\r\ntook several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 yea=\r\nrs back are now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I=\r\n know that some of them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and have experienced s=\r\nome things too. Obviously, they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have done sadhana with fire and sadha=\r\nna of the Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance a=\r\nnd rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has even a faint idea that spiritual =\r\nprogress is important, is looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; god and is attracted to a speci=\r\nfic advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person obviously has som=\r\ne good karmas and good vasanas. That person has done\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that sadhana in =\r\nthe past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding o=\r\nf what is what, how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; things work, why one should do something, how to =\r\ndo it, what is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; important and what is less important, that is wha=\r\nt initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
