In purusha \nsuktam also it mentions God alone is Prabhu(lord=\r\n) of bhoot(past) and \nbhavya(future)..\n&gt; So with these statements in mind c=\r\nan&#39;t we conclude that \neverybody&#39;s destiny is fixed by God according to his=\r\n karmas? Now if \nmy destiny is fixed why should I bother if a particular da=\r\ny is \nauspicious or not, or the girl will be my perfect match or no. \n&gt; Can=\r\n&#39;t I just concentrate on my Karmas and leave the rest to God?  \nWhat is the=\r\n relevance of Jyotish Shastra in this point view? Why \nshould I bother abou=\r\nt Jyotish at all?\n&gt; I am convinced that you are the best person to answer t=\r\nhese \nquestions. Please find for me some time in your busy schedule to \nans=\r\nwer this burning question of mine.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a good question. It is a=\r\n loaded philosophical question and \none that many may have. Though I addres=\r\nsed such questions in the \npast, I sense that I may be able to give an insp=\r\nired answer on this \nauspicious day. I will hence spend a little time tryin=\r\ng to put my \nthoughts into elaborate words and cover various aspects relate=\r\nd to \nthis question. At the end, I may not answer your question fully or \ns=\r\natisfactorily, but I will hopefully have penned some useful \nthoughts. Hopi=\r\nng you won&#39;t mind, I am cc&#39;ing this mail to a few \nyahoogroups related to J=\r\nyotisha and spirituality.\n&gt; \n&gt; This mail is a little long, as I will cover =\r\na few different things \nand try to put them in perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Brief Answer\n&gt; \n&gt; First let me give the brief answer. If you=\r\n can indeed concentrate \non your Karmas (actions) and leave the rest to God=\r\n and if you can \naccept with an equal vision any results (fruits) that your=\r\n karmas \nmay bring, then you are a liberated soul. Jyotisha shastra is inde=\r\ned \nirrelavent to you. But there are very few people who are like that. \nFo=\r\nr others, it is still relevant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now let me give the long-winded answer=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Nature of Self\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone has a drea=\r\nm, one may experience many objects of \nvarious attributes and qualities in =\r\nthe dream. Do those objects \nexist in reality? No. All those objects and va=\r\nrious interactions \nbetween those objects are unreal - they exist fictional=\r\nly within the \nmind. Only the mind exists in reality and no other objects. =\r\nStill, \nduring the course of a dream, the mind is under the illusion that \n=\r\nall these objects exist outside of it. All those objects obey the \nrules co=\r\nnjured by the mind that is dreaming.\n&gt; \n&gt; This whole creation is basically =\r\nlike that. All beings are but \nBrahman. Upanishads and vedanta teach that t=\r\nhere is Brahman and \nnothing or nobody else in this universe. There is no &quot;=\r\nself&quot; \nand &quot;other&quot;. All is self. However, a part of Brahman becomes deluded=\r\n \nand forms a self-identity and entertains an illusion that there is \nan &quot;I=\r\n&quot; and the &quot;other&quot;. This first being is the supreme being (known \nby various=\r\n names such as Sadashiva, Narayana, Krishna, \nMahaganapathi, Savita etc).\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; When the supreme being imagines the existence of Brahma, Vishnu, \nShiva=\r\n etc to play various roles in this universe and imagines \nvarious beings th=\r\nat make this universe up, all those beings come \ninto being (just like the =\r\nobjects in someone&#39;s dream). Just as the \nobjects in a dream obey the rules=\r\n conjured up by the dreamer in his \ndream, the beings of this universe obey=\r\n the rules of the game \nimagined by the supreme being. Each being experienc=\r\nes various other \nbeings and other objects in this universe because of the =\r\nspell of \ndelusion that he/she is under. When one realizes the delusionary =\r\n\nnature of this spell, one can break free from it.\n&gt; \n&gt; But a normal person=\r\n is not aware of all this. One&#39;s senses simply \nperceive so many different =\r\nobjects and one entertains various \nnotions with respect to those objects. =\r\nAll these notions become very \nfirmly established in one&#39;s consciousness af=\r\nter many births and it \nis difficult to overcome those notions. Some object=\r\ns give pleasure \nand some give pain, some are found attractive and some are=\r\n \nrepulsive, some are considered good and some bad. And so on. The \nfield t=\r\nhat is experienced by one, i.e. the field in which all these \nobjects of op=\r\nposite qualities exist, is known as the &quot;field of \nduality&quot; or &quot;maayaa&quot; (de=\r\nlusion).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Overcoming the Delusion\n&gt; \n&gt; Overcom=\r\ning this delusion and rising above the limited perception \nof the senses an=\r\nd realizing that all the beings that seem to exist \nare like dream objects =\r\nimagined by the supreme being, i.e. that \nthere is nothing but the supreme =\r\nbeing in this universe, is not easy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Saying &quot;all is Brahman and the ob=\r\njects we perceive are all Brahman \nonly&quot; is easy. Even understanding it at =\r\nan intellectual level may be \neasy. But a perfect and unshakable understand=\r\ning of it is not \ndifficult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us see an analogy. Suppose one goes t=\r\no a movie. Some events \nunfold on the movie screen and they seem to really =\r\nhappen. However, \nthey are not real events. It is just fake and manipulated=\r\n. The \ncharacters in the movie are not real. However, some people take the =\r\n\nevents on the screen seriously and react strongly. Good happenings \non the=\r\n screen make them elated and scary moments on the screen shake \nthem up. Th=\r\nere may be someone with an intellectual understanding \nthat the movie is no=\r\nt real and yet one specific scene that may get \nhim/her. For example, one m=\r\nay shiver with shock in a scene despite \nthe intellectual understanding tha=\r\nt it is not real. Intellectual \nunderstanding does not give full control ov=\r\ner instincts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, one with only an intellectual understanding t=\r\nhat all is \nBrahman does not have full control over the mind. The instincts=\r\n, \nsense organs and various aspects of mind sometimes run like a mad \nmonke=\r\ny, away from the understanding that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. One may \nfeel happy a=\r\nbout some things, feel sad about some things, become \nattracted to some thi=\r\nngs and become repelled by some things. A \nperfect, permanent and unshakabl=\r\ne understanding that all is Brahman \nis much more difficult to obtain than =\r\na mere intellectual \nunderstanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; It requires dismantling the formid=\r\nable fort of delusion made of \nthe walls of mental conditioning formed by t=\r\nhe bricks of sense \nexperiences that are joined by the cement of logic and =\r\nanalysis. \nThese walls are fortified over many many lives and make the fort=\r\n \nquite formidable.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is a long process involving many steps. There=\r\n are different \npractices designed to facilitate this in different \nreligio=\r\nus/spiritual paths. There is no foolproof algorithm to ensure \nthis process=\r\n. There are only guidelines.\n&gt; \n&gt; All is Brahman and all the duality is ari=\r\nsing from the Supreme \nBeing. All of one&#39;s actions are actually occurring d=\r\nue to the will \nof Supreme Being only. The results/fruits (good or bad) of =\r\none&#39;s \nactions may be viewed as the reactions by Nature to one&#39;s actions \na=\r\nnd they too are due to the will of Supreme Being. Thus, everything \nthat ha=\r\nppens is due to the will of Supreme Being. If one person \nremains in ignora=\r\nnce, keeps on taking a rebirth and keeps going \nthrough good and terrible e=\r\nxperiences, it is all the will of Supreme \nBeing. If one says &quot;it is all th=\r\ne will of Supreme Being. I am doing \nnothing&quot; just for the heck of it and y=\r\net continues to have an \negotism (self-identication with a body or name or =\r\npersonality or \nsome object), continues various actions through that ego an=\r\nd \ncontinues to receive their fruits and becomes elated by some and \ndepres=\r\nsed by some, it is all through the will of Supreme Being. \nThough the perso=\r\nn is saying &quot;Supreme Being does all&quot;, he continues \nto think of an &quot;I&quot; and =\r\nthinks deeply that &quot;I am doing&quot;. That is why \nSupreme Being wills the perso=\r\nns to receive the appropriate fruits of \nthat action. If another person tru=\r\nly understands that Supreme Being \nknows, wills and does all things, kills =\r\n&quot;I&quot; completely at the mental \nlevel, then that person may seem to engage in=\r\n various actions, but \nhe does not really perform any actions. When there i=\r\ns no &quot;I&quot;, there \nis action and no reaction. Despite moving in the material =\r\nworld and \ndoing various actions, that person&#39;s mind is always established =\r\nin \nbliss. Again, this person has no &quot;I-ness&quot; and hence Supreme Being \nwill=\r\ns the person to be in supreme bliss always.\n&gt; \n&gt; The subtle lesson I am try=\r\ning to drive at is: As long as there is \nan &quot;I-ness&quot; to a person, actions t=\r\nake place and their reactions \nhappen. &quot;All is Brahman. I do not do anythin=\r\ng&quot; is for one who has \nkilled &quot;I-ness&quot; completely. It is not an excuse to d=\r\no anything and \nget away. Until one completely kills &quot;I-ness&quot;, one has to w=\r\natch \none&#39;s actions to produce good reactions that are conducive to making =\r\n\nmore progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Two Types of Knowledge\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe teachings of maharshis in Veda and allied subjects like \nVedangas and Ve=\r\ndanta cover essentially two types of knowledge:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Understanding the =\r\nrules of engagement of the field of duality \n(maayaa)\n&gt; (2) Understanding h=\r\now the field of duality is delusionary and how \nall is Brahman only\n&gt; \n&gt; Kn=\r\nowledge of type (2) is essential because eventually the goal of \neach being=\r\n is to overcome the delusionary nature of the field of \nduality and see Bra=\r\nhman in all. However, the problem with 2 is that \nthis knowledge is only re=\r\nalized and not imparted in a step-by-step \nprocess. One may read reams abou=\r\nt how all is Brahman and seemingly \ndifferent objects of this universe are =\r\na delusion and one may even \nunderstand and appreciate it to some extent in=\r\ntellectually. But it \nis of not much use! Until the realization comes from =\r\nwithin and \nexperienced, one continues to be deluded by duality. One may kn=\r\now \nall the theory, but the mind continues to be deluded and swayed by \ndua=\r\nlity. When somebody praises one, one may feel elated. When \nsomebody attack=\r\ns one, one may feel unhappy. When one finds something \nnice, one may be att=\r\nracted. When one finds something disgusting, one \nmay be repelled. And so o=\r\nn. Please see my previous analogy of a \nmovie.\n&gt; \n&gt; While knowledge of type=\r\n (2) elaborates why the above behavior is \nsilly and describes the thinking=\r\n and approach of a liberated soul, \nit is very very difficult to imbibe suc=\r\nh thinking and attitude and \nbecome liberated. Even reading works imparting=\r\n knowledge of type 2 \nfor a long time does not guarantee liberation.\n&gt; \n&gt; V=\r\nedangas such as Jyotisha belong to type (1). When one does not \nrealize tha=\r\nt the field of duality is a delusion and is swayed by the \nopposites, then =\r\none needs tools to navigate the ocean of opposites. \nJyotish is one such to=\r\nol. When one&#39;s mind is deeply stuck in duality \nand has unsurmountable &quot;I-n=\r\ness&quot; and &quot;other-ness&quot; deeply imprinted on \nit, &quot;all is Brahman. Parama Puru=\r\nsha knows, wills and does all&quot; is a \nuseless concept. From the perspective =\r\nof that person, one&#39;s &quot;I-ness&quot; \ndoes all actions and begets the fruits of t=\r\nhose actions based on \norder set by Parama Purusha. This gives happiness an=\r\nd sadness of \ngreat proportions. This cycle of actions and fruits may go on=\r\n \nforever, until one&#39;s &quot;I-ness&quot; is killed completely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some spiritual s=\r\nadhana is necessary to kill the &quot;I-ness&quot;. This \nspiritual sadhana is happen=\r\ning within the field of duality where the \nmind has a clear &quot;I-ness&quot; and &quot;o=\r\nther-ness&quot;. Thus, the rules of \nengagement in the field duality apply. Subj=\r\nects like Jyotisha throw \nlight on these rules and they can be helpful. For=\r\n example, one may \nstart sadhana at a particular time and make swift progre=\r\nss. One may \nstart sadhana at a particular time and encounter many obstacle=\r\ns and \nstop the sadhana without much progress. One may find the right \nsadh=\r\nana based on previous samskaras and vasanas from the horoscope. \nOne may fi=\r\nnd out that impending material problem (e.g. job loss or \nloss of a close r=\r\nelative or a divorce etc) may derail one&#39;s sadhana \nand take some measures =\r\nto stop it and reduce its magnitude. Thus, \nJyotisha can be used to manipul=\r\nate the field of duality to one&#39;s \nadvantage, as one wades it trying to kil=\r\nl one&#39;s &quot;I-ness&quot; and \nindividual will.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *         *\n&gt; \n&gt; One&#39;s=\r\n Will vs Other&#39;s Will\n&gt; \n&gt; When a scripture says that everything that happe=\r\nns is God&#39;s will, \nit is essentially referring to the supreme being (Parama=\r\n Purusha) \nmentioned earlier as the God. This Being is the first Being aris=\r\ning \nfrom non-dual Brahman and the one who conjures up the entire \nduality.=\r\n Thus, we are at the border of non-duality and duality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Deities who op=\r\nerate completely within duality have their own wills \nwhich may clash with =\r\neach other and clash with our will. For \nexample, the will of Yamadharmaraj=\r\na (yama=3Ddisplicine, dharma =3D \nrighteousness, raja =3D ruler) compelled =\r\nhim to kill Markandeya and \ncollided with the will of Markandeyaq who wante=\r\nd to remain alive and \nthe will of Lord Shiva who wanted to save Markendeya=\r\n. There are many \nstories where the will of one deity/being clashed with an=\r\nother&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, all these deities are different forms of the same =\r\n\nBrahman (or, loosely speaking, of Parama purusha). The will of \nParama Pur=\r\nusha is that one deity&#39;s will should compel the deity to \ndo X and another =\r\ndeity&#39;s will should compel that deity to do Y and \nsomething should happen =\r\nas a result. Everything is indeed the leelaa \n(play) of the will of Parama =\r\nPurusha. But we are not at the stage of \nfathoming the play of Parama Purus=\r\nha (and his Shakti). All we can \nsay is that Parama Purusha&#39;s will is a com=\r\nplex thing. It is in fact \nthe sum total of the individual wills of all bei=\r\nngs of this universe!\n&gt; \n&gt; As long as there is &quot;I-ness&quot; and individual self=\r\n-identity left in \nthe mind, there is an individual will. As long as that i=\r\ns the case, \none is not liberated. One&#39;s individual will facilitates variou=\r\ns \nactions that clash with the wills of various other beings. It causes \nva=\r\nrious probelms. Basically one acting based on &quot;individual will&quot; is \nin tune=\r\n with only a small subset of &quot;God&#39;s will&quot;. That person is not \nin tune with=\r\n the *entire* God&#39;s will.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus saying &quot;all is God&#39;s will. I need to do=\r\n nothing&quot; is not \nconducive to liberation. It continues bondage. Directed e=\r\nffort to \nkill &quot;I-ness&quot; makes one truly understand that &quot;all is God&#39;s will&quot;=\r\n \nand drop off one&#39;s individual will.\n&gt; \n&gt; Only when &quot;I-ness&quot; is killed and=\r\n &quot;individual will&quot; is completely \nevaporated can one be in tune with the en=\r\ntire &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; (as \nopposed to a small subset). Then alone can one remai=\r\nn in constant \nbliss, as an unbound observer of the play of this universe w=\r\nithout \nany individual agenda or will. THAT is liberation. Such a liberated=\r\n \nsoul may seem to engage in various actions, but the mind is stable, \nhas =\r\nno &quot;I-ness&quot; or individual will and is established in constant \nbliss. Like =\r\na fan may continue to turn for a while after the \nelectricity supply is sto=\r\npped, such a liberated soul may continue to \nengage in actions based on the=\r\n previous flow, but without any \negotism (supply of electricity in the anal=\r\nogy).\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I wanted to write a little bit, but e=\r\nnded up writing too much.
