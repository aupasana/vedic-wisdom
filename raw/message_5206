I will reply to them together.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding mail 1 below on priest=\r\ns:\n\nDoing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for ot=\r\nhers is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one i=\r\ns forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty pl=\r\nace and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is=\r\n not protected, one may be affected.\n\nAs I keep saying, results of one&#39;s pr=\r\nevious karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit af=\r\nter another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rott=\r\nen. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw aw=\r\nay some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier th=\r\nan otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown awa=\r\ny. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage=\r\n.\n\nIn the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity=\r\n to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. The=\r\ny are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n\nS=\r\necondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas.=\r\n Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for on=\r\ne to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have t=\r\no be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over =\r\nothers or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge =\r\nand liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very=\r\n few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be p=\r\nerformed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous o=\r\nf power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for othe=\r\nrs.\n\n&gt; is there any remedy for this?\n\nWell, stop doing rituals for others. =\r\nOr, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others.=\r\n Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavata=\r\nm chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the ten=\r\ndencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding ma=\r\nil 2 below on astrologers:\n\nThis is not an immature comment and there is an=\r\n element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n\nEver=\r\ny action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equa=\r\nl reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted =\r\nin that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing =\r\nZ instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the ast=\r\nrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experienc=\r\ne the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come to=\r\no.\n\nMessing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n\nWhat is=\r\n the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahman=\r\na lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to trul=\r\ny become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatri=\r\nyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one wil=\r\nl become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to pl=\r\nay with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conductin=\r\ng rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, b=\r\nut about brahmanas by conduct.\n\nThe above will become clear, if you look at=\r\n the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught=\r\n Jyotish!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jy=\r\notish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nMail 1:\n\n---- &quot;aksh=\r\na.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering =\r\nfrom any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and gen=\r\neral condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and i=\r\nnvolved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n=\r\n&gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I =\r\nam posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n\nMail 2:\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaj=\r\ni and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have just started listening to your (=\r\nNarasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own cha=\r\nrt. \n&gt; \n&gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through fri=\r\nends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yo=\r\nurself (astrologer) and yrou family.
