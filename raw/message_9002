I know only these two names where we have\nsucces=\r\nsfully (at least - upto certain level) related the good and bad\nkarmas (kno=\r\nwn to us) or life events and corresponding planetary positions\n(modern worl=\r\nd term would be : reverse engg). I am more curious to know, if\nthere would =\r\nbe any one coming to earth who will be having all the possible\npositive ene=\r\nrgies AND will not have anything in negative (in vedic term I\nthink we can =\r\nsay Supreme Lord). I hope we would be able to draw something\nwith the astro=\r\nlogical tools we have now, the best possible horoscope, which\nwill have the=\r\n planets placed at their best and further finding out that\npossible date fo=\r\nr the planetary position through the planetarium tools we\nhave. I think tha=\r\nt can support the date we have for the actual SAT YUG, it\nwill support our =\r\nvedic calculations of YUG&#39;s timings.(let it be thousand\nand thousands of ye=\r\nars from now).\n\n2) I was following this group from last 5/6 years, but not =\r\nable to speak up\n- though I had the above mentioned thought. it happens a l=\r\not to me, may be\ndue to my Lagnesh mercury is in 6th house, i find bit diff=\r\nicult to convey\nmy thoughts. However when it comes and I convey the thought=\r\ns, it becomes\nargument - may be due to my second house has Rahu there.
