Even if one does not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; think\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in those terms, it still =\r\nhappens. It is incorrect to say that one can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize the highest trut=\r\nhs without Kundalini awakened. A more accurate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; statement would be tha=\r\nt one can realize the highest truths without \n&gt; &gt; &gt; engaging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in any s=\r\npecific practices geared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Som=\r\ne people following the so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n yoga paths specifically try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not at all needed for awakening Kundalini. People belonging=\r\n to various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; traditions and paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can e=\r\nxperience \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening, without knowing anything about =\r\nthe name or the symbolism. There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Ku=\r\nndalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini is essential=\r\nly the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raised kundalini i=\r\nmplies a more refined and higher self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the lowest =\r\nlevel, we bind our selves to specific bodies and our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-awareness i=\r\ns limited to a body, a name and other things associated \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe body and name. This experience of self as a body corresponds to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ku=\r\nndalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; undi=\r\nfferentiated Self, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;exp=\r\nerience&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As\n&gt; &gt; &gt; self-aware=\r\nness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many=\r\n stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can when=\r\n it awakens for the first time, like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a=\r\n long time. However, it comes down again and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process of rise from=\r\n then onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way up while th=\r\ne nadis are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning of mi=\r\nnd is cleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the time of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening, i=\r\nt may encounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the imp=\r\nurities. This may manifest physically as a powerful experience\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simila=\r\nr to heavy electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are thousands=\r\n of nadis in the sookshma sareera. The exact path taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; by Kundalini =\r\nas it rises for the first time is not fixed. It may change \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; person to person, based on the impurities in various nadis. The exact\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will vary depending on the path traversed and the final poi=\r\nnt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I actually know one person who had kundalini awakening, rise to Sahasra=\r\nra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all happening at the same time. His nadis =\r\nhad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; already been purified. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went =\r\ninto\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed there for 7 days and came back as a fully realiz=\r\ned person.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is a much longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sayi=\r\nng &quot;this is what happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nexact experience changes from person to person, depending on the path\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n traversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, one wi=\r\nll not have any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confusion about what happened. But, until kundalini a=\r\nwakening occurs, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may confuse various other experiences (such as s=\r\nome movement of vayu in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; various nadis) for kundalini movement and wro=\r\nngly think that kundalini is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in t=\r\nhe head are \n&gt; &gt; &gt; NOT\n&gt; &gt; &gt; due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can b=\r\ne due to a little vaayu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a premo=\r\nnitory sign (but not a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. Same thing =\r\ncan be said about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (back or left=\r\n or right) or the sensation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of having completely fallen back (even th=\r\nough one is sitting normally in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality). There are several such prem=\r\nonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a reference, =\r\nI can narrate the experience of ONE person. He was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meditating with a =\r\nVeda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few months\n&gt; &gt; &gt; earlier that=\r\n his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, he had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; absolutel=\r\ny no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninformed about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nadis, =\r\nchakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specific raja/hatha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; y=\r\noga practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect and eyes closed\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini awakenin=\r\ng, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru =\r\ntold him not to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distracted by them and to keep the focus on the ma=\r\nntra and try to forget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on =\r\nan experience, it gets stuck\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfocused\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the mantra and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly=\r\n he became\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aware of his body. It felt like there was a really tremend=\r\nous explosion at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the base of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amou=\r\nnt of electric current\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was going up his spine from the base. Then it =\r\nfelt like he was not a body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he w=\r\nas going up like a rocket at a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like th=\r\nere was a tremendously bright white\n&gt; &gt; &gt; light and there was nothing else.=\r\n It felt like he was not a small point in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that light, but he was the =\r\nlight itself. There was an undescribable sense \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; peace and ha=\r\nppiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what is this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What h=\r\nappened to my body? I have responsibilities still.&quot; Then he became\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aw=\r\nare of himself as a body sitting in pooja room. When he left pooja room\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and went out, he felt great love for everyone and happiness. For example=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; serial was coming on TV and characters in the serial that =\r\nhe normally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disliked for their shallow personalities suddenly felt li=\r\nke real people \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he had great love and compassion for those =\r\nTV serial characters (and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; real people too). That state of love =\r\nand compassion lasted a while and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; This short experience was only the beginning of a journey. He experienc=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many things later on. These experiences were different from each o=\r\nther. As \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said earlier, the experience varies based on the pa=\r\nth traversed and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point reached by the self-awareness (kundalini).=\r\n On various occasions,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kundalini rose and he saw several sights and s=\r\neveral beings within and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; heard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; several sounds, including veda =\r\nmantras and beejaaksharas, again within.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He realized the transi=\r\nentness of a lot that we cling on to and the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; existence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of some=\r\nthing far higher and more permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All this slowly started to=\r\n change his attitude. His senses turned inwards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and he critically sta=\r\nrted to analyze his own thoughts and motives and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; worked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on cor=\r\nrecting his attitude. The impact of what was happening around him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wh=\r\nat others did and said started to make lesser and lesser impact on him.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in perspective and said that \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; awakening was just a beginning and the real work was ahea=\r\nd. Depending on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real work can take many many ye=\r\nars or even lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kundalini aw=\r\nakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the rise \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of people\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara itself. Ve=\r\nry \n&gt; &gt; &gt; few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after, but end up=\r\n getting stuck \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Very very few make it to higher chakras.=\r\n And a very small minority \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realise self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nComplete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether yo=\r\nu are into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; raja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yoga or karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yo=\r\nga. Thinking of a mystical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience can only distract one from this=\r\n goal. I urge sadhakas, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; especially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; those who respect my advice=\r\n, to forget about kundalini and chakras and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keep doing ho=\r\nmam and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purifying the=\r\nmselves with sadhana, keep working on their attitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought proc=\r\ness and keep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; purifi=\r\ned and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen with kundalini \n&gt; &gt; &gt; WI=\r\nLL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of kundalini and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mystical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather than a boost, =\r\nin one&#39;s spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kundalini=\r\n, try to manipulate the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; way your mind works and perfect your self-con=\r\ntrol. Kundalini will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; automatically follow. One will do well to rememb=\r\ner these words.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------ \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;=\r\nutpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ur=\r\ndhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Relevant to this on going=\r\n subject, i remember reading autobiography of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji=\r\n (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned that Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Awakenin=\r\ng is not mandatory for realization.

After praana and apaana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen praana and apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like an\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the body and one does not exist. This is simi=\r\nlar to death, except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that there is fear and confusion at death an=\r\nd one may feel a kind of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditatio=\r\nn. However, if one&#39;s focus on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;awar=\r\ne of&quot; the experience and starts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mi=\r\nnd, there is a chance of one becoming\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused. So on=\r\ne should sustain the state where there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full focus on mantra an=\r\nd no other distractions, for as long as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These things happen automatically without thinking about them and=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in any specific practicies. In fact, thinking about the=\r\nm,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific practices may become an obsta=\r\ncle and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delay things. If you surrender to a deity and do a mantra=\r\n with a high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT run after any=\r\n experience and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think of an experience as an end result.

How can i\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Belo=\r\nved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correc=\r\ntly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There then arises no difference in=\r\n the sadhak or the deity commanding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain thing to=\r\n happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which appear=\r\ns to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas m=\r\nake the person care almost for nothing himself, so self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identific=\r\nation is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me which is b=\r\nlack magic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity i=\r\ns a higher shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chin=\r\nnamasta, then your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( =\r\nProvided you have Vijnana). After the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; death\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the bod=\r\ny, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; origi=\r\nnally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full bear=\r\ning of karma onto the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the attackers and some =\r\npeople may realise this to their detriment(\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jala=\r\nndhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an e=\r\narthquake). Some people may even equate this with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. He=\r\nre there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few ka=\r\nrmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your att=\r\nack is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or t=\r\nhe universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a=\r\n small Pisacha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which c=\r\nan be used, moreover=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will not =\r\nbe free of identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their a=\r\nctions are those which are generally termed as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These=\r\n people usually join the same spirits which they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbeen using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imag=\r\nine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra =\r\nonly in this lifetime may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind ever=\r\ny mantra are crucial and may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifet=\r\nime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, s=\r\no let me\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined=\r\n, then starting on some good day, do 1000\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savit=\r\nri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidd=\r\nen) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sa=\r\nme place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As =\r\nlittle movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is you=\r\nr inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the bo=\r\ndy, not just the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this who=\r\nle procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personality befo=\r\nre and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life may=\r\n be short, so do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that s=\r\nadhana for as long as is physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope th=\r\nis clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may post th=\r\nis on the list as a clarification from me if you feel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this i=\r\ns suitable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
