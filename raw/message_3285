Thought of mailing them to you. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0Jumping on conclusio=\r\nn without properly studying/thinking about Thakur&#39;s life, just on literal m=\r\neaning of those 2 words would be a sure blasphemy.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You are right=\r\n. But since this is a debate and just a debate, =C2=A0let me put forth some=\r\n logical points.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 1) Two wrongs never make a right. This i=\r\ns one mistake we Indians do when we try to debate over something. When we a=\r\nre discussing Tulasidasji, it does not matter whether Ramakrishna - who liv=\r\ned in a different century - was right or now. That would be a different deb=\r\nate. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 2) Ramakrishna did not write anything -:). He only=C2=A0wo=\r\nke up=C2=A0people to what ever degree was necessary and gave general talks =\r\non spirituality. So, one can always contend that a mistake maybe the biogra=\r\nphers mistake. M or Saradananda=C2=A0could very well have been mistaken in =\r\nwhat he quoted. Giving a freewheeling talk is different from creating a com=\r\nposition. When one writes, one has more time and energy to indulge in think=\r\ning, and checking up possibilities of different shades of meanings for the =\r\nsimple reason that the audience is large, unknown and spread out=C2=A0over =\r\nhuge spans of time.=C2=A0When one talks, and that too talking to friends, o=\r\nr close people, one does not need to be careful of every word or sentence o=\r\nne speaks. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; To understand this better,=C2=A0=C2=A0we have to thi=\r\nnk - scientifically speaking - how communication happens in three levels. A=\r\nround 33 percent of the communication is through the words, 64 percent thro=\r\nugh body language and a solid 3 percent is &#39;unknown&#39; or sub conscious commu=\r\nnication. This last three percent is the most powerful. When a person can u=\r\nse this 3 percent of sub conscious communication - he can move masses of pe=\r\nople. All great leaders do so. All rock stars also do so (IMO). If you list=\r\nen to the lyrics of an average rock music, you may find it uninspiring. But=\r\n if you were to be present in a live rock concert, you will definitely feel=\r\n an energy and get swayed.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Then comes body language which=\r\n is so important.=C2=A0For example,=C2=A0if you enter a Govt office in Indi=\r\na, you may find that the babus there will be sitting relaxed in their chair=\r\n with their spine reclining. Whatever you say will hardly make any impact o=\r\nn them. That is why the files in Govt. of India offices move at a=C2=A0snai=\r\nl&#39;s pace.=C2=A0If you find that someone whom you are talking to=C2=A0is sit=\r\nting cross legged on a chair, with left leg crossing the right, even if the=\r\n person may hang on eagerly to every word you speak, know it for the sure t=\r\nhat there is a strong change he is listening through one ear and throwing o=\r\nut the words through the other. In short, pretending to listen. In effect, =\r\nonce you leave his presence he probably=C2=A0won&#39;t bother about what you sa=\r\nid.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; And last is spoken word. When two people speak with each oth=\r\ner, both words and body language come into picture. Sometimes sub conscious=\r\n communication too can happen. Therefore there is a LOT of the energy excha=\r\nnged/communica tion not through words but through other means. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\nWhen you write down something, body languages gets negated. Therefore, one =\r\nneeds to be extra cautious while writing something in order to convey the c=\r\norrect sense. That is why there are so many more rules to be followed=C2=A0=\r\nfor writing anything.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; So therefore, if Ramakrishna is &quot;talking&quot; =\r\nto someone he is probably communicating using all means possible. But if he=\r\n were to write a book and mention &quot;Kamini and Kanchan&quot; without further expl=\r\nanation of what he intends to mean, then he too can be called to question. =\r\nBut he never wrote any books, and the authors who did, made sure they expla=\r\nined the sense. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Contrast this to that line from Ramacharit Mana=\r\ns, without any qualifications, that implies &quot;women&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot; are w=\r\northy of &quot;tadan&quot;.=C2=A0 If I were a woman, I would take offense=C2=A0to tha=\r\nt line.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 3) Whenever I am doing a critic of a religious li=\r\nterature, I keep the Koran as a standard. By this I mean, whenever I am jud=\r\nging a book of religious nature, I follow the same parameters of judgement =\r\nthat I use when I judge the Koran as a book.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The Koran contains =\r\na verse, translated correctly in the M.A. Shakir and Dawood translations, w=\r\nhich recommend husbands to beat their wives if the wives are disobedient. \n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some=\r\n of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the =\r\ngood women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded=\r\n; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and le=\r\nave them alone in their sleeping places and beat them; then if they obey yo=\r\nu, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great. (Shakir&#39;s v=\r\nersion of the Koran, Quran, 4:34) \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A lot of muslims I have talke=\r\nd to, defend the above=C2=A0giving various reasons one of which is &#39;misunde=\r\nrstanding context&#39;. I find it inexcusable. Same way a line in a religious b=\r\nook bracketing &quot;nari&quot;, &quot;pashu&quot;, &quot;sudra&quot; together, I find=C2=A0to be equally=\r\n inexcusable. That is the sense that comes out from a normal reading of tha=\r\nt line. I am not commenting on the whole of Ramcharit Manas, but that one v=\r\nital line.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; [Prem, Ahinsa], Satya Vachan aur=C2=A0Par-stri Matusa=\r\nmaan|\n&gt; Inase agar prabhu na mile to Tulasi Juth Jabaan ||\n&gt; (I have given=\r\n=C2=A0this doha =C2=A0out of memory and its quite possible that first two=\r\n=C2=A0wrods are wrong in the doha )=C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Interesting doha. Mayb=\r\ne you are right, maybe you are not. But that line (pashu/naari etc)=C2=A0de=\r\nfinitely conveys a simple meaning. If=C2=A0Tulasidasji ment what you are sa=\r\nying, he should have used some appropiate punctuation marks. Since he did n=\r\not, I have to reject your explanation. Or I can say, Tulasidasji respects w=\r\nomen a lot, but that line is simply a bad composition. One way or the other=\r\n, I cannot absolve the composer of that specific line.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; BTW,=C2=\r\n=A0 were you refering to the Gita verse 1.41 where Arjuna talks about women=\r\n of the family getting corrupted?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You and I&#39;ve notably common As=\r\ntrological factors in our chart.

The highlighting is done by you, not in the actual text. If =\r\nhe ment pashu-nari he should have used some basic grammer to remove confusi=\r\non. He did not.

There are more Naaras of Pashu nature than Naaris in the world.=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0This explanation=C3=82=C2=A0 that you found looks more like a back=\r\n engineering job to bail out.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Regardi=\r\nng Rama self realization, I think I was unable to express the ideas of my f=\r\nriend clearly. Let me try again. He is not really saying that Sri Rama was =\r\nnot a self realized man. Infact he quite agrees that Sri Rama was an Avatar=\r\n of God. What he says is that, (his opinion)=C3=82=C2=A0God did not descend=\r\n as Sri Rama in order to be worshipped. He descended in order to lead by ex=\r\nample. That is why the text is called Rama+ayana. A path that an ordinary m=\r\nan can and should follow. One of principles.=C3=82=C2=A0 Compare this to th=\r\ne name of the other great epic, Mahabharata, which was not named &quot;Krishna+a=\r\nyana&quot; . One cannot follow Krishna&#39;s path. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Whenever, a=\r\nccording to him, we attribute Godhood to Sri Rama, our subcsious mind will =\r\ncreate a blockage, a divide between the worshipper and the worshipped and t=\r\nhus make it impossible to lead a life like Rama did.

Mind you, these are all theoritical/ =\r\ntheological debates - nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he st=\r\nopped the debate because I was getting agitated and it would have affected =\r\nour friendship. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever his opini=\r\non is asked on anything, he will only mention that what he can support usin=\r\ng logic.

He said, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He=\r\n could have destroyed Ravana and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right=\r\n from the place where he was=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0located when he firs=\r\nt heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and instead ch=\r\nose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per my friend,=\r\n it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from=\r\n a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi=\r\n to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has be=\r\nen flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which e=\r\nquates women with animals or something similar. He believes that was introd=\r\nuces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. =\r\nTherefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, h=\r\ne argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Ava=\r\ntarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna=\r\n was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on t=\r\nhis plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he th=\r\ninks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The above are merely his opin=\r\nions, feel free to disagree. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food ha=\r\nbits, it&#39;ll be great.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been o=\r\nut of touch with him since August, been busy myself.

I mean, he is a maniac=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0when it comes to=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0honestly.=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to j=\r\nust say a simple, harmless=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in=\r\n the west, he would not say it. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! H=\r\ne has actually never ever=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0spoken even a single li=\r\ne in his whole life, big or small. When he was in his school, once his teac=\r\nher told him that Indian languages are richer than English, he believed his=\r\n teacher. Later someone else told him English is more comprehensive languag=\r\ne and the world cannot do with it. He got confused. Since that day, he boug=\r\nht himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English, one Hindi and for ten\n&gt;=\r\n  years every day he spend one hour reading the\n&gt; &gt; English dictionary and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A=C3=82=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0When I asked him why, he just said it is because he wanted to b=\r\ne=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0equally adept at both the languages so that one=\r\n day he can take a really detached view to judge the truth about=C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has a=\r\nn uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anyt=\r\nhing. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different =\r\nfields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long i=\r\nn most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu=\r\n, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes =\r\npoetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered hi=\r\nmself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered fo=\r\nr religion as blank. When the clerk who was supposed to take the forms\n&gt;  s=\r\naw that blank space,\n&gt; &gt; he asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu n=\r\name, the clerk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from=\r\n the clerk and tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an at=\r\nheist and writing Hindu in the form would have been a lie. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speakin=\r\ng of. All his friends, whoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day, long back, he was going to offi=\r\nce for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. A=\r\ns he was passing by in=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he f=\r\nelt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he still does not know wh=\r\ny he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morni=\r\nng. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no kn=\r\nowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest, the priest said tha=\r\nt he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole =\r\ntime without any movement. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. B=\r\nut my friend had no idea why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he=\r\n was in deep sleep.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then he started=\r\n meditating at home, and it was there=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0that he got=\r\n visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most peop=\r\nle who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi f=\r\nor 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place a=\r\nnd same position for 3 days continuously.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0 Only h=\r\nis wife and close relatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays wh=\r\nen ever he sits for meditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When s=\r\nomeone asked him how he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if th=\r\ne whole universe orginates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the =\r\nplanets, the animals, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space,=\r\n smaller than the atom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately =\r\ndesribed.=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0He considers Sri Krishna to be God and=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he doe=\r\ns not like the Ramacharit Manas because he\n&gt;  thinks it elevated\n&gt; &gt; Sri=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0Rama to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; level of a God whereas the aim of=\r\n the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0not a God.The difference he says is that, an ideal man=\r\n is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man can and should aim to beco=\r\nme like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated by ordinary men. One cannot=\r\n become Krishna, but one=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0can try to lead his life=\r\n like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating his i=\r\ndea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises peop=\r\nle to not trust most Gurus these days.

Then prasdam all around??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My curious questions are not against your acceptance of his exexperie=\r\nnceut to learn more.After all he is part of hidden violence.
