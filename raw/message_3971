If 45 minute is long time, sometimes, and you=\r\n wish to do Homam in 25 minutes then it is a good idea to use Mantras (Poor=\r\nvaangam, Aahvaahan, Main Homam, Uttarangam etc...) given in Super short.\n&gt; =\r\nIn any Homam, Most Important parts are Specific Aahutis offered with Mantra=\r\ns of the relevant deities AND Meditation. So i suggest removing that though=\r\nt of &#39;Lack of Satisfaction&#39; from your mind. For improving the feeling of Co=\r\nntentment, It may be a good idea to select one mantra in particular and off=\r\ner it say for 21 or 54 or 108 times.
