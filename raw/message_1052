It has six words - shava, \nvasha, shav, vash, shiva and shiv. Each word is written in Devanagari script \nand then in English.\n\nThough the first word in that picture is &quot;shava&quot;, YOU will pronounce it as \n&quot;shav&quot;. Please note that the second symbol in &quot;shava&quot; is identical to the \nfirst symbol in &quot;vasha&quot;. However, YOU end up pronouncing that symbol as &quot;v&quot; \nin the first word and as &quot;va&quot; in the second word. You pronounce the same \nsymbol as &quot;va&quot; in some cases and as &quot;v&quot; in some cases. But please note that \nSanskrit is not like English and each symbol has a unique pronunciation. If \nyou pronounce correctly, that symbol is pronounced identically (as &quot;va&quot;) in \nboth words. If you really want it to be &quot;v&quot; (without a), it should be \nwritten differently (as at the end of 3rd and 6th words in the picture).\n\nPlease go through the six examples carefully to know how to write things in \nDevanagari correctly.\n\nBottomline: Things like &quot;Raam&quot; or &quot;Shiv Uvaach&quot; are wrong and mean nothing \nin Sanskrit. The Arabic influence on some modern Indian languages (e.g. \nHindi) that use the same script as Sanskrit corrupted people &#39;s \npronunciation of Sanskrit. What are pronounced by people as &quot;Raam&quot; and &quot;Shiv \nUvaach&quot; should actually be &quot;Raama&quot; and &quot;Shiva Uvaacha&quot;. South Indians have \ntheir own corruptions, but this is a place where south Indians are correct.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, January 29, 2009 8:13 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Kuja (Mars) homam manual available now\n\n\n&gt; Rao Garu!!!\n&gt;\n&gt; I was always thinking that it is due to South Indian Accent, people\n&gt; of that part of india say Raama instead of Raam. Krishna instead of\n&gt; Krishna.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;ve a explanation for that. In devanagari script, (Take instance of\n&gt; Gita) it id written Krishn and not Krishna. another example is Durga\n&gt; Saptashati where it says &quot;Shiv Uvvach&quot; and not &quot;Shiva Uvvach&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; please clear my doubts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

So you may do either.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, some combinations tried by others successfully in the past\n&gt; are better and faster.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regarding the specific mantra below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot;\n&gt; (or &quot;jai&quot;) have no meaning in Sanskrit. They should be &quot;raama&quot;\n&gt; and &quot;jaya&quot; respectively. Arabic has words mostly ending in consonants\n&gt; (i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word). That Arabic influence\n&gt; made Indians change Sanskrit words to remove &quot;a&quot; at the end of\n&gt; words. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay Raam&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please\n&gt; restore &quot;a&quot; at the end of words. The correct version of the mantra\n&gt; is &quot;Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at the\n&gt; beginning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my guru went to many\n&gt; temples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka that had a nice\n&gt; level of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and\n&gt; Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) together. Apparently some yogi did\n&gt; intense sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with the mantra\n&gt; you mentioned). The mantra above is written all over the walls of the\n&gt; temple.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Though that yogi is not there now, the vibrations created by his\n&gt; sadhana are still there. We were quite impressed when we spent some\n&gt; time there. You have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to\n&gt; BrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village (a few km from the\n&gt; main Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small temple\n&gt; without any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than many famous\n&gt; temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I\n&gt; recommend visiting that temple and spending a couple of hours there.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The mantra you gave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya\n&gt;&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n&gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available now\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   |om|\n&gt;&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   All this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve had\n&gt; for quite sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to\n&gt; any Hanuman temple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my\n&gt; natal chart which suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha\n&gt; in navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha\n&gt; Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked the priest about\n&gt; a mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on the walls of\n&gt; the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to be a 7\n&gt; word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th house\n&gt; with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra\n&gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My question\n&gt; is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? Is it\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   or\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   |om sri rama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Some say it should be 13 aksharas....\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   Sorry for astrological content in this mail.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   best regards\n&gt;&gt;   Hari\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005E_01C98260.A5094810\r\nContent-Type: image/jpeg;\n\tname=&quot;devanagari.jpg&quot;\r\nContent-Disposition: attachment;\n\tfilename=&quot;devanagari.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\n[ Attachment content not displayed ]\r\n------=_NextPart_000_005E_01C98260.A5094810--\r\n\n"}}
