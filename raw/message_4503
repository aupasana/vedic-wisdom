Mine follows.\n=C2=A0\n&quot;M=\r\nugging up of vedas&quot; - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an engineerin=\r\ng text book for the exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0=\r\naday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma lik=\r\ne sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed in the =\r\nmorning and evening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha and avru=\r\ntis. The sadhana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas=\r\n) and thereafter for the rest of the life time. I have come across a schola=\r\nr whose fingers keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the rythm of t=\r\nhe mantra. He has transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is installe=\r\nd inside him. This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking about.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nYou see, the reason why I mentioned this is again because of a document=\r\nary film that was made by Sri Staal regarding the Agnicayana he (and his te=\r\nam) had sponsered in Kerala. He showed some &quot;vedic&quot; priests who chant vario=\r\nus mantra from the Vedas for hours everyday for almost all their lives. Whe=\r\nn he asked them some pertinent queries about what these mantras might mean =\r\netc, the priests simply shook their head and came up with a very tame reply=\r\n that this is how they have been taught to do things. No wonder Sri Staal c=\r\name up with the fancy=C2=A0birds and bees theory from such inputs. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\nI agree that chanting of the Vedas for hours on end is surely a sadhana. Fo=\r\nr that matter, any focused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana in=\r\n it&#39;s own rights. But my point is, to understand the real import of the Ved=\r\nas, one must do sadhana for spiritual realization and then and only then ca=\r\nn one really claim to say what is truely Vedic and what is not. Sadhana for=\r\n God realization is the path, and when the realization dawns in sufficient =\r\ndegrees, one maybe able to get a really clear perspective of what exactly t=\r\nhe Vedas talk about. Not with energy flowing through Ida nadi, nor with ene=\r\nrgy flowing through pingla nadi can one understand what the Vedas truely ar=\r\ne. But with energy flowing through the susumna nadi, there is hope! That is=\r\n experiential and a result of sadhana aimed at realizing the Self.\n=C2=A0\nF=\r\nor this transformed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even =\r\nbeforehand what is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nMy view is that, Vedas are absolute uncorruptable knowledge, and t=\r\nherefore before the above transformation happens, ones understanding of the=\r\n Vedas and what=C2=A0really constitues the ambit of Vedic knowledge will be=\r\n questionable, if not outright incorrect. Hence, I see no value in statemen=\r\nts like such and such ritual is what Vedas is all about and such and such i=\r\ns not. Most people who make such statements are nowhere close to any states=\r\n of realization. Mere intellectual assessements are not really of much valu=\r\ne.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIf we call Sayana&#39;s commentary a distortion, we will have =\r\nto disown Yaska as well.\n=C2=A0\nWell, if you like Sayanacharya&#39;s commentari=\r\nes, so be it. I do not consider it sacroscant. So we have to=C2=A0just resp=\r\nectfully disagree with each other:). Hope that is fine with you. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n2. &quot;Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham&quot;\n=C2=A0\nWho is the real author=\r\n of yoga vasishtam Vasishta or Valmiki ?\n=C2=A0\nValmiki notes what Vasistha=\r\n speaks to Rama.\n=C2=A0\n3. &quot;The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborat=\r\ne yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not=\r\n believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagya=\r\ns?&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAdvaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six dar=\r\nsanas (or ways of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have d=\r\nifferent views. \n=C2=A0\nTrue. Yes there were have been philosophical fights=\r\n, but that was mostly in the Upanishadic and Pouranik periods and not reall=\r\ny in the=C2=A0 original Vedic period. Infact, people (indologists)=C2=A0are=\r\n not even sure of what constitues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurat=\r\ne description is a far cry. \n=C2=A0\nSri Ramakrishna and most of his discipl=\r\nes - who were all self-realized saints - would often comment that from the =\r\nperspective of a sadhaka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be i=\r\nn contradiction to one another but supplementary to each other. They explai=\r\nned in many of their writings how each of them (philosophies)=C2=A0had a pl=\r\nace and a stage and how each were essentially supportive of the different s=\r\ntages and paths leading one to the=C2=A0realization of the absolute non-dif=\r\nferentiated Brahman. I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nI was talking about the ones who composed the Veda mantras. They wer=\r\ne all knowing, and all knowledgebale seers. The Upanishats and various eman=\r\nating philosophies within the ambit of our Sanatana Dharma, all undeniably=\r\n=C2=A0trace their roots to the Vedas. That means, the satha darshanas are n=\r\not outside of the realm of the core Vedas. Therefore, the ones who composed=\r\n the vedic hymns were both jyanis, vigyanis as well as performers of elabor=\r\nate fire rituals, all combined together. There is no conflict here. \n=C2=A0=\r\n\nJust like Vasistha says in the Yoga Vasistham, God realization is a bird w=\r\nith two wings -right action with the right knowledge. Either of the wings n=\r\not functioning, makes the bird come crashing down. \n=C2=A0\n\n4. &quot;Can you kin=\r\ndly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nNo surpi=\r\nrse, That is the essence of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, s=\r\ninivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intell=\r\nect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are accorded elevated s=\r\ntatus. That&#39;s how veda is.\n=C2=A0\nSorry but that is not really an answer at=\r\n all! It is not at all the essence of the Vedas, unless you belong to the s=\r\nect of west influenced spurious indologists who believe that the vedic hymn=\r\ns were battle cries and=C2=A0general poetry composed by a group of ravaging=\r\n barbarians who were too awed by the wind and the sun and the dawn and othe=\r\nr natural phenomenon.\n=C2=A0\nLet me repeat the question I had asked in my p=\r\nrevious mail. If this is the essence of the Vedas, can you explain in a log=\r\nical coherent manner, how exactly does these simple natural phenomenons lea=\r\nd to the elevated Upanishatic philosophies, when every school of thought in=\r\nside Hinduism traced its roots to the core Vedas? How does one explain this=\r\n so called=C2=A0jump without taking an allegorical view of the Vedic hymns?=\r\n \n=C2=A0\n5. &quot;The way one can learn is different based on the different mode=\r\nls of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIf one has flying =\r\nexperience on a cessana alone he will not be allowed to fly a boeing. This =\r\nis why I said I am only against mixing up.\n=C2=A0\nOne who has learnt flying=\r\n a cessana can very well learn to fly a boeing if he so wishes. It can remo=\r\nve his inhibitions about flying and in future, if God will, can learn other=\r\ns as well. What harm therefore in learning to fly, with any model what so e=\r\nver? None absolutely.\n=C2=A0\n6. &quot;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39;=\r\n these artifically created boundaried and achived and experienced higher st=\r\nates. Anything that leads to God is good.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nThey have been lucky. For=\r\n each succesful one there may be many who have also failed miserably.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n=C2=A0I consider this to be an unfounded fear. Real sadhana for God rea=\r\nlization often does not follow such aritificial boundaries. Realization God=\r\n is never a matter of luck, but a product of intense sadhana and patience. =\r\nAnd doing a daily homam of any deity is a=C2=A0furiously beautiful sadhana.=\r\n Many are already doing it, many more will do in future. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0If o=\r\nne with all purity and best of intentions=C2=A0gives ahutis =C2=A0water on =\r\nagni instead of ghee, what will be the outcome ? Intention can not justify =\r\nflouting of rules. Rules only support and promote intention.\n=C2=A0\nRules=\r\n=C2=A0prohibiting a person from even trying the ritual is far detremental t=\r\nhan making a flawed=C2=A0attempt and learning in the course of it. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\nFurther=C2=A0more, the manuals given by Narasimha is definitely not incorre=\r\nct. Otherwise, so many would not have been able to do various homas of=C2=\r\n=A0different deities=C2=A0for so long on a regular basis and experience=C2=\r\n=A0things. This is not an empty claim, but one that is very, very=C2=A0real=\r\n.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n&quot;NamaschandikayaI Namaschandi=\r\nkayaI NamaschandikayaI!!!&quot;\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n--- On Sun, 20/6/10, Sindhu Sarasw=\r\nathi &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Sindhu Saraswathi &lt;moulamag=\r\namagguru@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Homa procedure\nTo: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, 20 June, 2010, 7:25 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\nDear Shri.Rajarshi,\n=C2=A0\n1.&quot;Thank you for the interesting example abo=\r\nve.

Anything else is dispensable and therefore n=\r\not eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eter=\r\nnal truths, nothing short. \n=C2=A0\nIt will be interesting here to point out=\r\n that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do th=\r\ne=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Ev=\r\nen the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahmana=\r\nsya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right han=\r\nd of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right han=\r\nd of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect her=\r\ne. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be per=\r\nfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nThank you for the interesting example above.

Never! \n=C2=A0\nA real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has realized the =\r\nAatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;may have&quot;=\r\n spiritual abilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespective of wh=\r\nether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a blind t=\r\nradition without having experienced anything and thus violating the essence=\r\n of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual=\r\n consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at all they =\r\ncan be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty s=\r\nhell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. \n=C2=A0\nTher=\r\nefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare palms or=\r\n a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Both, are i=\r\nn clear violation of the Vedic essence.\n=C2=A0\nHomam is a ritualistic form =\r\nof worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=C2=A0\nT=\r\nhis is definitely incorrect!

Therefore, the only w=\r\nay to judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this =\r\nis why there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. =\r\nSome have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merel=\r\ny rivets one&#39;s mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper an=\r\nd deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be exp=\r\nerienced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, no=\r\nt just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadha=\r\nka. \n=C2=A0\n\n2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know an=\r\ny.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAre there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane =\r\ndepending on what he knows and what he does ?\n=C2=A0\nThe flying of the aero=\r\nplane is the same.

And if the average word by by word=\r\n translations or a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is to the Vedas,=\r\n pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure betwe=\r\nen the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic period=\r\n? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the=\r\n Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts be=\r\n bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of=C2=A0 t=\r\nhe Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and the=\r\nir later day derivatives?\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\nAny path, vedic, agamic, yogic, ta=\r\nntrik, aghori,=C2=A0if rightly followed exclusively and fully can lead to t=\r\nhe desired objective=C2=A0.

If so, which authoritativ=\r\ne text have you relied upon? Or is it one designed by yourself keeping the =\r\nconvenience factor in mind ?\n=C2=A0\nThere are many procedures even within t=\r\nhe vedic system for performing homam. Each established procedure given by a=\r\ncharyas=C2=A0 is complete=C2=A0in itself and do not violate the fundamental=\r\n principles of vedic rituals.\n=C2=A0\nIt will be interesting here to point o=\r\nut that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=A0do =\r\nthe=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. =\r\nEven the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahma=\r\nnasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right h=\r\nand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right h=\r\nand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect h=\r\nere. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be p=\r\nerfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nAs you have said, any system of worship is acceptable. There are so man=\r\ny religions and cults all around the world. Nobody objects. If you call som=\r\nething vedic, please make sure that it conforms to the vedic tenets.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nHomam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in=\r\n it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=C2=A0\nIt is not a question of whether it is more elab=\r\norate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a =\r\nquestion of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you=\r\n are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no o=\r\nbjection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for =\r\nit, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts a=\r\nre raised.\n=C2=A0\nThe apprehension is that in the year 2000 you said,\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n&quot;I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep grati=\r\ntude for my \nguru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of enligh=\r\ntenment, \nencouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nand now you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got so=\r\nme specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, li=\r\nke with all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and =\r\nformed his understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of a=\r\ndulation for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the ad=\r\nulation and started to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial ru=\r\nn. Slowly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampa=\r\nra knowledge&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nYes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophizati=\r\non, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His t=\r\nheories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji=\r\n always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is conv=\r\nenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not make=\r\n sense, it could be because you have to learn more!\n=C2=A0\nAs he started ex=\r\nploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the =\r\nname of a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and disho=\r\nnesty. After expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I s=\r\ntarted to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashes,=\r\n I was kicked out of SJC.\n=C2=A0\nWith basic concepts like houses, arudha pa=\r\ndas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imp=\r\nerfect. He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do n=\r\not work consistently.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some s=\r\npecific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are =\r\nimperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily creat=\r\ned a body of knowledge which he sells now.

It is a phalita d=\r\nasa. It shows general\n\n\n\nresults. Narayana dasa is computed differently for=\r\n different divisional charts and we \ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional =\r\nchart to predict matters related to that \ndivisional chart. \n=C2=A0 \nNaraya=\r\nna dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one =\r\ndasa ends \nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna an=\r\nd another rasi \nbecomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progresse=\r\nd lagna as the reference, we \nfind out the events that happen in that dasa.=\r\n Thus we get twelve charts for each \nperson, with each chart applicable in =\r\none dasa. \n=C2=A0 \nThis is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould p=\r\nay attention to the details of \ncalculation. &quot;\n=C2=A0\nnow you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;N=\r\narayana dasa may be based on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does =\r\nnot work with any level of consistency.

Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot d=\r\no it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few months.\n\nI=\r\ns that better or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it l=\r\ness formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; 21. I suggest tha=\r\nt we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity.\n&gt; Hybrids may not=\r\n always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve\n&gt; knowledge uncor=\r\nrupted.\n\nThe only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corr=\r\nuption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperisha=\r\nble Self, alone is absolute knowledge.\n\nKnowledge of *external rituals* is =\r\nrelative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. =\r\nThere is nothing impure or corrupt about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the ke=\r\ny is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, =\r\nwhether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it=\r\n helps in one&#39;s spiritual progress or not.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me cut & paste a sec=\r\ntion from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analog=\r\ny given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.\n\n------------ ---------=\r\n --------\nDo Vedas Describe External Rituals\n\nSome people believe that Veda=\r\n describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to=\r\n be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-ka=\r\nala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by=\r\n desa-kaala-paatra?\n\nThough Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on=\r\n RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in =\r\nhis =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about=\r\n absolute truths about the inner self and not relative truths about externa=\r\nl matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the i=\r\nmmortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable an=\r\nd purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, vario=\r\nus offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning =\r\nand the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n\nMetaphor: Ved=\r\nic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n\nNotions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctione=\r\nd by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by V=\r\neda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.\n\nOnce there were many peopl=\r\ne who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoye=\r\nd the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. The=\r\ny described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\nAs people started l=\r\niving a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to=\r\n put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep wal=\r\nking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully f=\r\nollowed the instructions [rituals].\n\nPeople started moving further and furt=\r\nher inland and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea.=\r\n This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a se=\r\na. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did no=\r\nt find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two =\r\nmiles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked t=\r\nheir chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object=\r\n and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n\nThen came some great person,=\r\n whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for=\r\n a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few mont=\r\nhs. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included rid=\r\ning a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n\nPeople performing the old rituals=\r\n objected to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the=\r\n book of sea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; =\r\n[pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the crypti=\r\nc poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that t=\r\nhose poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They w=\r\nere blissfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someon=\r\ne already close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who act=\r\nually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the=\r\n sea from there!\n\nSlowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, ch=\r\nariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead =\r\nof just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra=\r\n/ yantras].\n\nOne particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and =\r\nother dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though=\r\n the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too =\r\ndangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were crue=\r\nl dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many we=\r\nak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew =\r\nthe entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged=\r\n people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enou=\r\ngh to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.\n\nAs time progress=\r\ned, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They we=\r\nre foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either =\r\nthe so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variatio=\r\nns, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instruct=\r\nions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know =\r\nthat &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They onl=\r\ny thought they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and ther=\r\ne was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They=\r\n even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated =\r\ndirections for their place and time, for violating tradition.\n\nIn case the =\r\nanalogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about =\r\nrealizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, B=\r\nrihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes vari=\r\nous aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered =\r\nthe highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible w=\r\nays to reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be ma=\r\nde on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements=\r\n can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based=\r\n on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n\nGreat m=\r\nen in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came,=\r\n experienced that state, understood the current state of people around them=\r\n and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current=\r\n state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some inst=\r\nead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n\nStop Arguing and =\r\nDo Sadhana\n\nAs the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various path=\r\ns are irrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and f=\r\nollow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary=\r\n issue. The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused o=\r\nne is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transforme=\r\nd internally.\n\nJust as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months doe=\r\ns not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another rit=\r\nual done once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiri=\r\ntual or material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eat=\r\nen everyday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done every=\r\nday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n\nWise Tradeoffs\n\nSu=\r\nppose the president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 assoc=\r\niates. One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and s=\r\neat them in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one ca=\r\nn exchange long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n\nSupp=\r\nose one is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all th=\r\ne 100 associates by name and seats them in the room individually following =\r\nthe protocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch i=\r\nn the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 asso=\r\nciates together and seat them together by violating the protocol and use th=\r\nat time to let the President eat in peace?\n\nSimilarly, is it wise if one ex=\r\nchanges long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one =\r\ncut short on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?\n\nIn a fire ritual,=\r\n making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas =\r\ndone to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preli=\r\nminary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If =\r\none has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scr=\r\niptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tr=\r\nadeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n\n&lt;se=\r\nctions deleted&gt;\n\nProof of the Pudding\n\nAt this time, more than hundred peop=\r\nle are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time wo=\r\nrshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of=\r\n surrender and with some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute t=\r\nruths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=\r\n=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can=\r\n try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself=\r\n if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of t=\r\nhinking.\n------------ --------- --------\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\n\n---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote:=\r\n \n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for gui=\r\nding me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a f=\r\norward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that =\r\njHora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone =\r\nthrough the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a hom=\r\nam being performed and have the following observations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As =\r\nper rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedur=\r\nes for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the dars=\r\napoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in dar=\r\nsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee=\r\n or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which a=\r\nre essential and which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and l=\r\nater elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in =\r\nthe different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana su=\r\ntra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire woo=\r\nd, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divin=\r\nised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Ot=\r\nherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volum=\r\nnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of the=\r\nse steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of =\r\nthe sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix o=\r\nf vedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbh=\r\na aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succee=\r\nding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The=\r\n direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva =\r\nsavita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This ca=\r\nn not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting f=\r\nrom NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasa=\r\ndanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is =\r\nmissing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the=\r\n utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is=\r\n missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna =\r\npoojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya=\r\n samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa drav=\r\nya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purification of =\r\nladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruks=\r\nruvou) .\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16=\r\n. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis m=\r\nissing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladl=\r\ne in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity =\r\nof ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; and many more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic proc=\r\nedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda an=\r\nd he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the na=\r\nme of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the par=\r\nticular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not ne=\r\ncessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the k=\r\nunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni it=\r\nself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agn=\r\ni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are ava=\r\nilable in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for =\r\nsadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggl=\r\ne to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed =\r\nfor mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adap=\r\nted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a=\r\n 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involve=\r\ns learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perf=\r\nection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its=\r\n own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help t=\r\no preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1264274624-1277057308=:53785\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Sindhu ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for your response. Mine follows.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&quot;Mugging up of vedas&quot; - mugging of vedas is not like mugging up an en=\r\ngineering text book for the exam. It is a sadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hou=\r\nrs&nbsp;aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 years coupled with one&#39;s nitya k=\r\narma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, samidadhanam (the homa performed=\r\n in the morning and evening by the student). It involves santha, anusantha =\r\nand avrutis. The sadhana continues until brahma (mantra) becomes his power =\r\n(varchas) and thereafter for the rest of the life time. I have come across =\r\na scholar whose fingers keep moving even in sleep in accordance with the ry=\r\nthm of the mantra. He has transformed himself into the mantra. The veda is =\r\ninstalled inside him. This is no less than any sadhana we are speaking abou=\r\nt.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;You see, the reason why I men=\r\ntioned this is again because of a documentary film that was made by Sri Sta=\r\nal regarding the Agnicayana he (and his team) had sponsered in Kerala. He s=\r\nhowed some &quot;vedic&quot; priests who chant various mantra from the Vedas for hour=\r\ns everyday for almost all their lives. When he asked them some pertinent qu=\r\neries about what these mantras might mean etc, the priests simply shook the=\r\nir head and came up with a very tame reply that this is how they have been =\r\ntaught to do things. No wonder Sri Staal came up with the fancy&nbsp;birds =\r\nand bees theory from such inputs. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I agree tha=\r\nt chanting of the Vedas for hours on end is surely a sadhana. For that matt=\r\ner, any focused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana in it&#39;s own r=\r\nights. But my point is, to understand the real import of the Vedas, one mus=\r\nt do sadhana for spiritual realization and then and only then can one reall=\r\ny claim to say what is truely Vedic and what is not. Sadhana for God realiz=\r\nation is the path, and when the realization dawns in sufficient degrees, on=\r\ne maybe able to get a really clear perspective of what exactly the Vedas ta=\r\nlk about. Not with energy flowing through Ida nadi, nor with energy flowing=\r\n through pingla nadi can one understand what the Vedas truely are. But with=\r\n energy flowing through the susumna nadi, there is hope! That is experienti=\r\nal and a result of sadhana aimed at realizing the Self.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;For this transformed being learning bhashya is not necessary.=\r\n He knows even beforehand what is there in the bhashya and what it means in=\r\n various planes.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;My view is that=\r\n, Vedas are absolute uncorruptable knowledge, and therefore before the abov=\r\ne transformation happens, ones understanding of the Vedas and what&nbsp;rea=\r\nlly constitues the ambit of Vedic knowledge will be questionable, if not ou=\r\ntright incorrect. Hence, I see no value in statements like such and such ri=\r\ntual is what Vedas is all about and such and such is not. Most people who m=\r\nake such statements are nowhere close to any states of realization. Mere in=\r\ntellectual assessements are not really of much value.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If we call Sayana&#39;s commentary a dis=\r\ntortion, we will have to disown Yaska as well.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Well, if you like Sayanacharya&#39;s commentaries, so be it. I d=\r\no not consider it sacroscant. So we have to&nbsp;just respectfully disagree=\r\n with each other:). Hope that is fine with you. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2. &quot;Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Who is the real author of yoga vasishta=\r\nm Vasishta or Valmiki ?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Valmiki =\r\nnotes what Vasistha speaks to Rama.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;3. &quot;Th=\r\ne vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extensi=\r\non of your above logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita since they=\r\n used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Advaita ( or for that matter vedanta) is only one of t=\r\nhe six darsanas (or ways of looking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meema=\r\nmsa have different views. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;True.=\r\n Yes there were have been philosophical fights, but that was mostly in the =\r\nUpanishadic and Pouranik periods and not really in the&nbsp; original Vedic=\r\n period. Infact, people (indologists)&nbsp;are not even sure of what consti=\r\ntues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurate description is a far cry. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sri Ramakrishna and most of his disciples - wh=\r\no were all self-realized saints - would often comment that from the perspec=\r\ntive of a sadhaka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be in contr=\r\nadiction to one another but supplementary to each other. They explained in =\r\nmany of their writings how each of them (philosophies)&nbsp;had a place and=\r\n a stage and how each were essentially supportive of the different stages a=\r\nnd paths leading one to the&nbsp;realization of the absolute non-differenti=\r\nated Brahman. I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I was talking about the ones who composed th=\r\ne Veda mantras. They were all knowing, and all knowledgebale seers. The Upa=\r\nnishats and various emanating philosophies within the ambit of our Sanatana=\r\n Dharma, all undeniably&nbsp;trace their roots to the Vedas. That means, th=\r\ne satha darshanas are not outside of the realm of the core Vedas. Therefore=\r\n, the ones who composed the vedic hymns were both jyanis, vigyanis as well =\r\nas performers of elaborate fire rituals, all combined together. There is no=\r\n conflict here. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Just like Vasistha says in th=\r\ne Yoga Vasistham, God realization is a bird with two wings -right action wi=\r\nth the right knowledge. Either of the wings not functioning, makes the bird=\r\n come crashing down. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;4. &quot;Can you ki=\r\nndly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status&quot;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;No surpirse, That is the essence of veda. =\r\nNot only usha, amavasya, purnima. kuhu, sinivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut=\r\n,earth, fire, storm, water, medha (intellect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis=\r\n, nakshatras, all are accorded elevated status. That&#39;s how veda is.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Sorry but that is not really an answer =\r\nat all! It is not at all the essence of the Vedas, unless you belong to the=\r\n sect of west influenced spurious indologists who believe that the vedic hy=\r\nmns were battle cries and&nbsp;general poetry composed by a group of ravagi=\r\nng barbarians who were too awed by the wind and the sun and the dawn and ot=\r\nher natural phenomenon.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Let me repeat the ques=\r\ntion I had asked in my previous mail. If this is the essence of the Vedas, =\r\ncan you explain in a logical coherent manner, how exactly does these simple=\r\n natural phenomenons lead to the elevated Upanishatic philosophies, when ev=\r\nery school of thought inside Hinduism traced its roots to the core Vedas? H=\r\now does one explain this so called&nbsp;jump without taking an allegorical =\r\nview of the Vedic hymns? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;5. &quot;The way one =\r\ncan learn is different based on the different models of the aeroplanes in w=\r\nhich one learns to fly!&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;If =\r\none has flying experience on a cessana alone he will not be allowed to fly =\r\na boeing. This is why I said I am only against mixing up.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nEM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;One who has learnt flying a cessana can very well=\r\n learn to fly a boeing if he so wishes. It can remove his inhibitions about=\r\n flying and in future, if God will, can learn others as well. What harm the=\r\nrefore in learning to fly, with any model what so ever? None absolutely.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;6. &quot;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixe=\r\nd&#39; these artifically created boundaried and achived and experienced higher =\r\nstates. Anything that leads to God is good.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;They have been lucky. For each succesful one there may be =\r\nmany who have also failed miserably.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;I consider this to be an unfounded fear. Real sadhana for God re=\r\nalization often does not follow such aritificial boundaries. Realization Go=\r\nd is never a matter of luck, but a product of intense sadhana and patience.=\r\n And doing a daily homam of any deity is a&nbsp;furiously beautiful sadhana=\r\n. Many are already doing it, many more will do in future. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;=\r\n/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;If one with all purity and best of intentio=\r\nns&nbsp;gives ahutis &nbsp;water on agni instead of ghee, what will be the =\r\noutcome ? Intention can not justify flouting of rules. Rules only support a=\r\nnd promote intention.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rules&nbsp=\r\n;prohibiting a person from even trying the ritual is far detremental than m=\r\naking a flawed&nbsp;attempt and learning in the course of it. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Further&nbsp;more, the manuals given by Narasimha is defin=\r\nitely not incorrect. Otherwise, so many would not have been able to do vari=\r\nous homas of&nbsp;different deities&nbsp;for so long on a regular basis and=\r\n &lt;EM&gt;experience&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;things. This is not an empty claim, but one that =\r\nis very, very&nbsp;real.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&quot;Namaschandika=\r\nyaI NamaschandikayaI NamaschandikayaI!!!&quot;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 20/6/10, Sindhu Saraswathi &lt;I&gt;&l=\r\nt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-L=\r\nEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Sindhu Saraswathi &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Homa procedure&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Sunday, 20 June, 2010, 7:25 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv365501=\r\n163&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;TABLE border=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=\r\n=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Shri.Rajarshi,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1.&quot;Thank you =\r\nfor the interesting example above. But I have a very pertinent question reg=\r\narding this.&nbsp; And what exactly does it mean by saying one learned in t=\r\nhe Vedas? Can one, who&nbsp;has mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries =\r\nof the same, without experiencing any sort of self-realization, be called a=\r\n &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? =\r\nNever! &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Mugging up of vedas&quot; - mugging of ve=\r\ndas is not like mugging up an engineering text book for the exam. It is a s=\r\nadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours&nbsp;aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 =\r\nyears coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, =\r\nsamidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and evening by the student)=\r\n. It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana continues until br=\r\nahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter for the rest of th=\r\ne life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in=\r\n sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has transformed himse=\r\nlf into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. This is no less than =\r\nany sadhana we are speaking about.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For this tr=\r\nansformed being learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand=\r\n what is there in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;For information, Sayana&#39;s commentaries are based on th=\r\ne nirukta (meaning of vedic terms) of Yaska. Nirukta is one of the vedangas=\r\n. If we call Sayana&#39;s commentary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska=\r\n as well.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. &quot;Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistha=\r\nm&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Who is the real author of yoga vasishtam Va=\r\nsishta or Valmiki ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;3. &quot;The vedic rishis were =\r\nfamous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above log=\r\nic, it means they did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage them=\r\nselves in homas and yagyas?&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Advaita ( or for =\r\nthat matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas (or ways of looking at=\r\n it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have different views. By Vedic ris=\r\nhis do you mean the&nbsp;rishis who composed the veda mantras or the later =\r\nones also&nbsp;who philosphized on them. The views are not homogenous. The =\r\nadvaita vada is the most propagated one among the general public and has gr=\r\neat appeal . The other views also appear to be equally valid if you read th=\r\nem. There were rishis who subscribed to the advaita vada, and others who di=\r\nd not.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yajno hi mantaeirdevatamuddi sya=\r\n dravyasya daanam - Yajna is providing dravya to the devata with the mantra=\r\n. This is another view.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;4. &quot;Can you kindly enl=\r\nighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No surpirse, That is the essence of veda. Not only usha, amavasya, p=\r\nurnima. kuhu, sinivali, wind, rain, cloud, vidyut,earth, fire, storm, water=\r\n, medha (intellect), pranas,oushadhis, vanaspatis, nakshatras, all are acco=\r\nrded elevated status. That&#39;s how veda is.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;5. &quot;=\r\nThe way one can learn is different based on the different models of the aer=\r\noplanes in which one learns to fly!&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If one ha=\r\ns flying experience on a cessana alone he will not be allowed to fly a boei=\r\nng. This is why I said I am only against mixing up.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;6. &quot;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39; these artifically crea=\r\nted boundaried and achived and experienced higher states. Anything that lea=\r\nds to God is good.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;They have been lucky. For =\r\neach succesful one there may be many who have also failed miserably. If one=\r\n with all purity and best of intentions&nbsp;gives ahutis &nbsp;water on ag=\r\nni instead of ghee, what will be the outcome ? Intention can not justify fl=\r\nouting of rules. Rules only support and promote intention.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;My only contention is that if you are performing a vedic ritua=\r\nl follow the rules laid down by the rishis and acharyas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;God bless you.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 20/6/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEF=\r\nT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo.=\r\n co.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Homa procedure&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Sunday, 20 June, 2010, 11:42 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV id=3Dyiv2056030501&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABL=\r\nE border=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv129442715&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Sindhu ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Although this mail is addressed to Narasimha, I had a few points to mak=\r\ne since the mail is in the forum.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;and do n=\r\not violate the fundamental principles of vedic rituals.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM=\r\n&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;What exactly is the &quot;fundamental principles&quot; of a v=\r\nedic ritual?
