Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; have written off the wrongs o=\r\nf the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to ta=\r\nke up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of k=\r\narma are too intricate and complex and delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; comprehended unle=\r\nss one has reached certain very very high levels of\n&gt; &gt; spiritual attainmen=\r\nt, and even then, it will only be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; &gt; S/He who is un=\r\nlimited (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; knows bes=\r\nt how to dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and others,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; Arjun was a great sa=\r\ndhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He did so much sadhana o=\r\nf a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. This deity=\r\n was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of rare opportun=\r\nity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; the time of the battle, because Shiva is the =\r\ngreatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; one who knows how to worship Krishna prope=\r\nrly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; yourself can you worship Krishna perfectly.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but w=\r\nhen he saw\n&gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna was w=\r\nithin him. Of\n&gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, but Arjun could n=\r\not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, be=\r\ncause otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a friend ever??!!(slapp=\r\ning Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the Lord loves to play =\r\nwith His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ok, now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personalit=\r\ny was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Visw=\r\nharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; This is why at the end of the battle when all the Pandavas went to ask th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; person who had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was s=\r\ntill\n&gt; &gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible =\r\nfor the\n&gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory.........\n&gt; &gt; All that man said was that at th=\r\ne beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one e=\r\nnd of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; that destruction, it would =\r\nreturn to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; And the blood which was=\r\n being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky,=\r\n He had God incarnate at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; so fortunate=\r\n. For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; blood =\r\nand pus (I left my thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; year=\r\ns ago).\n&gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I=\r\n think he was\n&gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Easiest=\r\n thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; freely =\r\nadmitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n&gt; &gt; fool=\r\n and knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know because of this.\n&gt; &gt; Wha=\r\ntever you ever do in life, just try and be straight in every dealing\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat you have with anybody, give whatever you can, turn away nobody from\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nyour door, who knows when God will come to test you?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This does not=\r\n mean that one is fatalistic and does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt; that terrif=\r\nic sadhana is useful, nay even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sadhana and a real Guru =\r\n(Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; cha Teja Uchayte- b=\r\nrings light into the being), are essential.

It i=\r\ns dependent on what nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based=\r\n on who you have been in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past=\r\n while identifying with the action, who you affected in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated unt=\r\nil\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and ka=\r\nrmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that =\r\nbecomes one&#39;s dharma.

The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some we=\r\night.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilizati=\r\non destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set =\r\nthe tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dha=\r\nrma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected w=\r\nere on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material life=\r\n despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a =\r\nmonk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental det=\r\nachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has =\r\nto, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and=\r\n place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tri=\r\ncky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSome people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Thou=\r\ngh the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism fo=\r\nr a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much th=\r\nere. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a b=\r\nrahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and=\r\n a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Ba=\r\nsically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells=\r\n you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, =\r\nthere are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has in=\r\ndividual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very =\r\nvery difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma=\r\n. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us wh=\r\nat our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other=\r\n parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination =\r\nand intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sin=\r\ncerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that =\r\nwe can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost im=\r\nportance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alo=\r\nne ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increa=\r\nsing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to wha=\r\nt we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (base=\r\nd on our best judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situat=\r\nion is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen n=\r\now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unf=\r\nication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify o=\r\nur consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will wo=\r\nrk sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive f=\r\needback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly =\r\nand follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: E=\r\nven if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;thi=\r\ns is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;=\r\ns dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another ext=\r\nernal input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can t=\r\nake the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and fol=\r\nlow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his d=\r\nharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dha=\r\nrma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narend=\r\nranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nwanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, wh=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err i=\r\nn the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an e=\r\nlevated soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such=\r\n a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bo=\r\nttomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no =\r\nthumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can ref=\r\nine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing interna=\r\nl purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, =\r\njapam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can=\r\n slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Dist=\r\ninction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one does =\r\nnot realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, =\r\n2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

A true=C3=82 Aghora (aghori) does not see anythin=\r\ng as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestat=\r\nions of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is pe=\r\nrmanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies=\r\n, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead =\r\nbody to the funeral.

The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that =\r\nlife and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate tru=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly g=\r\nreat thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can=\r\n&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the=\r\n praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind=\r\n not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to somethi=\r\nng beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam =\r\nsatya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem=\r\n not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real.

His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (i=\r\nnstead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifying them as pure and impure, =\r\ngood and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) a=\r\nnd tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permanent.

The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues=\r\n it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; illusions an=\r\nd the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions wh=\r\ny he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feces =\r\nis eaten.=C3=82 But, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main poin=\r\nt. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such=\r\n a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self=\r\n (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, =\r\nbut the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;fece=\r\ns&quot; with certain properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He =\r\nwill be thinking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also ha=\r\ns the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, w=\r\nhich essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Neverthele=\r\nss, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be fully absorbed in=\r\n one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant ma=\r\nnifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;=\r\n, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perma=\r\nnent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thu=\r\ns, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; truth and=\r\n trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agho=\r\nra is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forc=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Ve=\r\ndic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tast=\r\ny laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the=\r\n mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the =\r\nnice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or other food, what is th=\r\ne big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absorb in Self an=\r\nd dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the f=\r\nact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an =\r\nincentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplish=\r\ned by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Ag=\r\nhora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing =\r\na lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for=\r\n sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thought=\r\ns in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one=\r\n&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A re=\r\ngular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; away from=\r\n sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thoug=\r\nhts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascinati=\r\non\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to ov=\r\nercome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extr=\r\neme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascination from th=\r\ne mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activitie=\r\ns (one pure and the other impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one witho=\r\nut such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits naked =\r\nwith his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In=\r\n the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; think th=\r\nat his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; j=\r\napam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; repr=\r\nogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nnakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the=\r\n head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much=\r\n time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction an=\r\nd thrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. =\r\nOverall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex may be gone la=\r\nrgely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has =\r\na lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts we =\r\nare exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these st=\r\nructures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; struct=\r\nures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, i=\r\ns this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the =\r\nperson keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks of=\r\n sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; meditat=\r\nion everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Botto=\r\nmline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on and set=\r\ns up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; push =\r\nthe problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nuch a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta a=\r\nnd what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand an=\r\nd absorb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stake=\r\ns war plan.

The basic tenets of Aghora and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but=\r\n Aghora tries to accelerates how one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thi=\r\nnking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for v=\r\narious spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; paths and explains the basic reality.

As Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in one place rather t=\r\nhan dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; One possibility is to do a homa=\r\nm and then meditate at the end after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; poornaahuti with various mantras=\r\n one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeabl=\r\ne about Sri Vidya. However, from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little I have been exposed to, S=\r\nree chakra is a symblic representation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the layers of duality surro=\r\nunding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; layer of duality and=\r\n realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Lalita m=\r\neans gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a mother=\r\n who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother =\r\nwho is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe strictness). Both are valid paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; F=\r\nilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil&lt;http://saraswatifil/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.=\r\n yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yah=\r\noo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; From: nagraj@sbcglobal. n=\r\net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am very much in awe after I learnt that you do=\r\n chandi homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours=\r\n to 1.5 hours to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that fe=\r\nat with 700 ahutis in such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandh=\r\nyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 t=\r\nimes(10 minutes), a short rudra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deepar=\r\nadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about 35 - 40 minutes daily r=\r\nitual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals\n&gt; &gt; &gt; several times a week, that=\r\n takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; integrate these along with=\r\n homam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam? Could you ple=\r\nase explain what is sri Vidya and how it is to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learnt? I am very m=\r\notivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but I also ha=\r\nve keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician also and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learn=\r\nt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
