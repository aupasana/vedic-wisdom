Dakshinamurt=\r\ni sat under a banyan tree and taught them jnana by silence. They imbibed wi=\r\nsdom through silence and got rid of their doubts.\n\nDattatreya is the father=\r\n of all men of renunciation. We are all the children of Dattatreya. Adorati=\r\nons to Him at all times! Dattatreya=E2=80=99s Avadhuta Gita and his instruc=\r\ntions to king Yadu mark out his Supreme wisdom of Brahman. He lived in Brah=\r\nman and he breathed Brahman. It is rare to find a sage like Dattatreya. \n\n\n"}}
