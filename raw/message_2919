If the pranp=\r\nratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some other language and used, w=\r\nill it be equally potent, assuming that spiritual power of the person doing=\r\n the prasnpratistha to be a constant?\n=C2=A0\nI mean, let us leave aside the=\r\n case of a Ramakrishna doing a pranpratistha of an idol because someone lik=\r\ne Him does not need language to call the deity into an idol.

While different places and times have some =\r\ndifference in the nature and degree of spiritual energy, one can experience=\r\n anything anywhere anytime, if the internal factors are conducive.\n=C2=A0\n(=\r\n2)=C2=A0What I said about Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observatio=\r\nn. Please bear in mind that any observation is fallible! It is possible tha=\r\nt Kalighat has similar or higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar=\r\n and I simply failed to perceive it. What we are able to perceive and obser=\r\nve is also based on our own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. T=\r\nhe Mother is capable of deluding *anyone*.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; But then, what ever the=\r\n idol may contain, postive/negative/ creative/\n&gt; destruction, if someone pr=\r\nays to it with devotion, assuming that it is\n&gt; reaching God, is it=C2=A0not=\r\n enough?\n=C2=A0\nThe purpose of an=C2=A0idol is to evoke certain imagery or =\r\nthought in you. If a spiritual person imagines a particular energy or form =\r\nof god in a particular object on a continuous basis, slowly that form gets =\r\n&quot;established&quot; in that idol. As time goes on, his mind=C2=A0can be focused o=\r\nn that specific form faster and easier by simply looking at the idol. Thoug=\r\nh we think that our minds are separate entities, they are all connected fee=\r\nbly and all of us are able to perceive in some vague form other people&#39;s st=\r\nrong thoughts that are present in the ether. Thus, if an idol is working as=\r\n a repository of several spiritual thoughts of a person trying to focus on =\r\na form of god, seeing that idol can evoke some similar thoughts in another =\r\nperson too.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, there is some translation involved when thought=\r\ns of one mind are vaguely perceived and interpreted by another mind. This t=\r\nranslation is dependent on one&#39;s mental conditioning. Thus, what we perceiv=\r\ne at the end is conformant to our own mental conditioning!\n=C2=A0\nSuppose a=\r\n foolish person thought while praying to an idol everyday of a fierce godde=\r\nss who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brings people under one&#39;s control=C2=A0a=\r\nnd makes one successful. Suppose you focus on that idol. Then you are susce=\r\nptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if you see her as someone who hel=\r\nps you overcome your weaknesses and become dispassionate, nothing bad is go=\r\ning to happen to you. But the fact that someone used that idol as a reposit=\r\nory of negative thoughts becomes a minor obstruction.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, pleas=\r\ne note that this principle works without an idol too. Suppose someone goes =\r\nto a particular place (e.g. a church bench) and prays to god with certain d=\r\nesires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are present in the air there. Anyo=\r\nne praying there later may be a little susceptible to such thoughts. The co=\r\nncentration of thoughts may be a=C2=A0little higher when an idol serves as =\r\na repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, please not=\r\ne that most people have some devotion, some surrender, some love and some f=\r\near of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, within or without an idol.=\r\n Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also accompanied by a lot of d=\r\nesirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned is not a big deal. This d=\r\nownside becomes considerable only in rare cases of really taamasik sadhakas=\r\n indulging in terrible practices without understanding what they are doing.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n&gt; is Idol worship risky?\n=C2=A0\nBottomline is that I do not see any=\r\n risk in idol worship.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Does Man create God, =\r\nor God creates man?\n=C2=A0\nGod created man as his replica. But the replica =\r\ngot corrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreate god in his mind and fil=\r\nl the mind with god, so that he can go back to the source and become free f=\r\nrom this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/ conditioning of the mind, he i=\r\ns not able to create god correctly. He ends up creating god as a replica of=\r\n his current corrupt state! The goal is to keep creating god in mind and ke=\r\nep refining him and hence keep refining oneself and eventually become pure.=\r\n When one is pure and creates god as a replica of oneself, that god will ma=\r\ntch the god that created man in the first place. When that god fills one&#39;s =\r\nmind, one is free from the cycle.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nI saw people=\r\n deviating and speaking disrespectfully about respected spiritual leaders o=\r\nf other religions.\n=C2=A0\nIn general, please remember that saying negative =\r\nthings about people that one may not have understood fully or correctly is =\r\nunwise.\n=C2=A0\nFrom time to time, the Lord may send someone to a part of th=\r\ne world to maintain the correct balance of dharma and adhrama that is requi=\r\nred in that part of the world at that time. One cannot judge a yogi or spir=\r\nitual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done by people claiming to fo=\r\nllow that person. Worse things may have happened if god did not send that p=\r\nerson! If some people following a yogi or spiritual teacher attained some l=\r\nevel of realization, it means something.

However, eventually the smell wil=\r\nl be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends on how strong the smell w=\r\nas when the stick was burnt.\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, when a great saint meditates=\r\n in a place, the air there will be filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energ=\r\ny.

At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples see=\r\nm to have a powerful divine presence.\n=C2=A0\nI was very impressed with the=\r\n=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills=\r\n in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s plac=\r\ne). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places. There=\r\n are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example, even=\r\n 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshinesh=\r\nwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat te=\r\nmple which is also in Calcutta.\n=C2=A0\nThere was one small temple in Tamil =\r\nNadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples =\r\nall over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006=\r\n. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. Th=\r\ne name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil=\r\n language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name=\r\n now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in f=\r\nront of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose =\r\nface was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence t=\r\nhere. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess=\r\n, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roo=\r\nf over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident e=\r\nach time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no ro=\r\nof. Though we spent only 5 min and left\n in a hurry, I was very pleased wit=\r\nh that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the templ=\r\ne and goddess.\n=C2=A0\nLike this, I am sure there are many temples with a po=\r\nwerful divine presence across India.\n=C2=A0\nApart from the Kaali temple at =\r\nDakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishn=\r\na/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is=\r\n still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nEven the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating tha=\r\nn a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tam=\r\nas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there=\r\n. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view i=\r\ns that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are reall=\r\ny good.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sa=\r\ndhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n=C2=A0\nMayapur, Dakshineshwar=\r\n, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam h=\r\nills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shi=\r\nrdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, V=\r\naranasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantrala=\r\nyam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n=C2=A0\nThere are many other good plac=\r\nes, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and =\r\nstaying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and d=\r\noing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nJyotish writings: http:/=\r\n/groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Astro=\r\n Seeker \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \nSent: Wednesday, October 07, 2=\r\n009 9:11 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n\n\n\n\n\nRespected Narsimhaji, =\r\n\n\n\nI would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in=\r\n today&#39;s time.

Suppose you focus on that idol. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1) My question is, so eventually some thoughts/emotions of the worsh=\r\nipper gets lodged in the idol, both positive and negative. What is the rele=\r\nvance of doing a pranpratistha in an idol? Will not the ritual of pranprati=\r\nstha bring the energy of the deity into the idol? If it does, then how can =\r\nthe emotions/thoughts of the worshipper get lodged in the idol since it alr=\r\neady contains the energy of the deity?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Or does=\r\n it mean that the energy/emotions of the worshipper get lodged in an idol w=\r\nhere the pranpratistha ritual has been incorrectly/incompletely done, which=\r\n happens so often in the case of idols at home.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;2) What is the relevance of the Sanskrit language in pranpratistha ritual=\r\n.&nbsp; Or rather, the significance of Sanskrit when it comes to spirituali=\r\nty in general. If the pranpratistha mantras/slokas are translated into some=\r\n other language and used, will it be equally potent, assuming that spiritua=\r\nl power of the person doing the prasnpratistha to be a constant?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I mean, let us leave aside the case of a Ramakrishna doi=\r\nng a pranpratistha of an idol because someone like Him does not need langua=\r\nge to call the deity into an idol. But for others, how important is Sanskri=\r\nt?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.....................=\r\n...........................................................................=\r\n.....................&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;.................................=\r\n...........................................................................=\r\n.........&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On a different issue about judging&nbsp;so =\r\ncalled holy men from history&nbsp;-&nbsp;a deviation - I would like to make=\r\n one point. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;Let u=\r\ns not be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise&lt;/E=\r\nM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While what you say is correct, there can always be some rational=\r\n judgement passed on figures from history based on incontrovertible evidenc=\r\ne. And I don&#39;t mean the actions of their followers but the very own lives o=\r\nf these people as recorded by their contemporaries. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thakur Sri Ramakrishna had once told one of his disciples that alway=\r\ns judge a holy man not just by his words but by his conduct as well. That i=\r\ns really the BEST way to form some opinion about people who claim to be spi=\r\nritual. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Therefore, if a&nbsp;historically aut=\r\nhentic biography of a spiritual person is read and compared with standard&n=\r\nbsp;models of spirtuality/spiritual life along with the words/saying of the=\r\n person,&nbsp;one can make a fair judgement. It is using these tools that o=\r\nne can very easily question the spiritual realizations of&nbsp;some so call=\r\ned prophets in history. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If the seed is questi=\r\nonable, the fruits&nbsp;are bound to&nbsp;be rotten.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (o=\r\nf consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sat, 10/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R.
