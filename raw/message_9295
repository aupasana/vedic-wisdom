It means a completely divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be =\r\nmore than one poornavataras. They are not necessarily &quot;equal&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To =\r\ngive a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount=\r\n of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it contains=\r\n all the gold in the\n world. It only means it has nothing other than gold. =\r\nSimilarly, the four poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and=\r\n do not contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; i=\r\nn cosmos.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;In fact, the very notion that =\r\nany one form can be &quot;the most complete or perfect avatara&quot; or &quot;one that per=\r\nsonifies entire divinity of Supreme Being&quot; or &quot;one equal to Supreme Being&quot; =\r\nis unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY for=\r\nm of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like =\r\nthe sky containing all possible clouds.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Supreme Being is endowed w=\r\nith infinite qualities. Any form contains a finite number of those qualitie=\r\ns. So no form can be &quot;equal to&quot; Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in tha=\r\nt regard.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If one form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and others are\n =\r\nnot, you can conclude that that form is &quot;the best&quot;. If neither form is &quot;equ=\r\nal to&quot; supreme being, how can you really compare the different qualities of=\r\n two forms?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Anyway, this renders your (3) =\r\na meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Krishna alone or not is ir=\r\nrelevant, for, in either case, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; cannot mean &quot;a personifica=\r\ntion of the entirety of supreme being&quot;. Before you wonder whether it refers=\r\n to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; actually =\r\nmeans, in a way that is not inconsistent with verses that follow! If no for=\r\nm is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is a &quot;subset&quot; of supreme being=\r\n (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot;???\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Regarding (4), Parasara\n identified 4 avataras a=\r\ns 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the source of divinity in ea=\r\nch of them. He only gave objective information and did not give any subject=\r\nive judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently did.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I have=\r\n not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before and after, I can c=\r\nomment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be under some subjecti=\r\nve context. I don&#39;t know the context of Suta&#39;s statement you allude to.\n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;Though any comparison is subjective, I will be surprised if someone=\r\n considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the &quot;best&quot; avataras. Bu=\r\nt, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama and Krishna as=\r\n the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries and show soul a=\r\nnd mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to other aspect=\r\ns of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen as the best by=\r\n different people. However, what Suta\n apparently said can only be a subjec=\r\ntive view under some context.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Regarding =\r\n(2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing 16 tith=\r\nis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - he is al=\r\nways full and bright!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Just like Moon, mind has many moods, even a =\r\nperfected one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awarenes=\r\ns of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them under d=\r\nelusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/soul OTO=\r\nH has no such variations.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Krishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run=\r\n away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles o=\r\nneday and play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to hi=\r\ns personality than Rama&#39;s. Now, does that make him better or worse than Ram=\r\na? Well, that is\n a *subjective* matter.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;R=\r\negarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings =\r\nsuch a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the worl=\r\nd appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they s=\r\ntand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. S=\r\no Vishnu&#39;s avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that ava=\r\ntaras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e.=\r\ng. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre unde=\r\nrstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creati=\r\nng, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. People=\r\n talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any understa=\r\nnding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of\n supe=\r\nrficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in consciou=\r\nsness.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Naraya=\r\nna were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don&#39;t kn=\r\now about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incar=\r\nnation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serp=\r\nent Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;We need to go deeper into what the=\r\ny all stand for esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of =\r\nconsciousness, to understand this more. Hopefully another day..\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Adwaitins who are skeptical about notions taught by=\r\n Parasara (paramatmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of paramtmamsa etc) =\r\nshould realize one thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not come from Brah=\r\nman in one step. It all evolved in many steps\n and correspondingly there ar=\r\ne some steps in the process of liberation!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If a character in my dr=\r\neam tonight overcomes its conditioning in the dream, it will simply merge b=\r\nack into my mind and not into Brahman yet. Of course, it cannot do even tha=\r\nt until I actually will it. It is after all a character created and sustain=\r\ned in my mind!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Same thing applies to us!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Vedanta is not w=\r\nrong. But it is relevant and applicable at &quot;anta&quot;, i.e. the end.

All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supreme Being in SB=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2. What is your opinion about the general stated idea that only Krsh=\r\nna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3. That the SB mentions Krshn=\r\na as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka where it says t=\r\nhat all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpretation, and not=\r\n too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and they were n=\r\no less in their spiritual merit\n or intellectual prowess have taken that sp=\r\necific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The verse itse=\r\nlf does not mention that it is with respect to the previous verse, or with =\r\nrespect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Avataras. So =\r\nit boils down to interpretation based on individual conditioning. It seems =\r\nChaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a similar con=\r\nditioning which made them read that verse to mean that only Krshna is Swaya=\r\nm Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;4. Apparently in th=\r\ne Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya that Krshn=\r\na is greatest Avatara of them all. So, how do we resolve this apparent conf=\r\nlict between what Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana states?

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagree :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=\r\n=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyond what any =\r\nnormal human being can achieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava scho=\r\nols of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. I=\r\nt is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata=\r\n and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contempl=\r\nation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas -=\r\n Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=\r\n=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskr=\r\nit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuances on the=C2=\r\n=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultima=\r\nte conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the d=\r\nelcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that =\r\nKrshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one=\r\n step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as t=\r\nhe Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as=\r\n merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this K=\r\nrshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a sepa=\r\nrate Divity in himself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatever the case maybe, each school=\r\n had its own set of established saints and scholars to vouch for their view=\r\ns. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, as you rightly poin=\r\nted out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We=C2=A0human =\r\nbeings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avatar appears on the eart=\r\nh,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after the Avatara, remain=C2=\r\n=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0because invariab=\r\nle in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, the life of the Av=\r\natara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0imagination fo=\r\nr *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next Avatara comes on=\r\n earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krshna, of which we =\r\nhave very little written record, the world at large remained entirely overa=\r\nwed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avat=\r\nara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a=\r\n set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis wh=\r\no explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to the general mas=\r\nses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as th=\r\ne crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara bec=\r\nause I find no other reason why these set of Avatara, from the whole list o=\r\nf possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular imagination. I mean Dat=\r\ntatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no less than that =\r\nof any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in =\r\nthe Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, which was b=\r\nasically exploring=C2=A0cronologically all these nine chakras one after the=\r\n other by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are 9 basic =\r\ngrahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=C2=A0represent the essential =\r\nnature of each chakra. All these make me more sanguine that there must be N=\r\nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth A=\r\nvatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a treme=\r\nndous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why n=\r\not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes down to=\r\n us from his followers, but it cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=\r\n=C2=A0arguable one of the sharpest and most logical of spiritual philospher=\r\ns. His intellectual and logical mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that S=\r\nhankara=C2=A0never claimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddh=\r\nartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and the former came possibl=\r\ny in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is =\r\nno less than that of the=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today i=\r\ns, could not have been, had it not been for the invaluable contribution of =\r\nAdi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of =\r\nVishnu, Shankara would not have been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddh=\r\na into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip on India. Buddhism\n barely e=\r\nxists in land of its birth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All this taken together, make me=\r\n more and more convinced that there are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th=\r\n is yet to come.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A little b=\r\nit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-servic=\r\ne. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, ed=\r\nucative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean.=\r\n Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used hi=\r\ns Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat i=\r\nn silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe =\r\npassage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, =\r\nand it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama too=\r\nk up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful warrior,=C2=A0who knows=\r\n=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, not letting that sens=\r\ne of power pervert his mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. Thi=\r\ns kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by an=\r\nyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or inf=\r\nluence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. No=\r\nt even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was the very personificat=\r\nion of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he has learnt all h=\r\nis life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what Rama =\r\ndid, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemently. If one reads=\r\n entire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krs=\r\nhna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the =\r\nGita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita,=C2=A0Krs=\r\nhna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all through his life at=\r\n every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all circumstances =\r\nof life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes me wonder, was t=\r\nhis a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is a=\r\ns if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and =\r\nsilently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single =\r\npersonal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for =\r\nhim to start a war against\n Ravana. But Krshna had zero=C2=A0personal stake=\r\n in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soo=\r\nn he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himself i=\r\nnto the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cleans=\r\ne the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the=\r\n Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0Balarama in his n=\r\next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshna. There are so m=\r\nany occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all the=\r\nse kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their village in Vrndava=\r\nna. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand everyt=\r\nhing. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect deta=\r\nchement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong acc=\r\nusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even coun=\r\nting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine\n Child. So I worship Krshna, bec=\r\nause I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single sadhaka or saint =\r\nor ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected de=\r\ntachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or acti=\r\nvely performing a larger dharma.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I started appreciating Swam=\r\ni Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara.

If invoked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to being e=\r\nstablished in Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser, being established in Sel=\r\nf became less natural and more effort was needed.

So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mercury) became relevant. =\r\nAn avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to explain being est=\r\nablished in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational minds of that=\r\n age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras o=\r\nccur based on the needs of collective consciousness.

It does not focus on the idea of=\r\n 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link =\r\nto grahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in com=\r\nbination, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else i=\r\nn this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corre=\r\nsponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is=\r\n not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that =\r\nuntil an Avatara actually descends on the earth, his energy and his force c=\r\nannot be attributed to any graha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures =\r\nthings completely? We can only know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars from the point of gr=\r\nahas/jyotish at all.

In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explici=\r\ntly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; =\r\n(used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivat=\r\nmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sec=\r\nondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innume=\r\nrable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras=\r\n of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say=\r\n &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if=\r\n the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accu=\r\nrate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are p=\r\nartial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krish=\r\nna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental=\r\n question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being=\r\n &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, =\r\nwho is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure consciousness=\r\n (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse=\r\n, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just =\r\nas sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* form=\r\ns and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form tha=\r\nt descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misint=\r\nerpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jiva=\r\ntma (living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is re=\r\nsponsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher por=\r\ntion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma wit=\r\nhout ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by P=\r\narasara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsu=\r\nlate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire\n divinity&quot; cannot be encaps=\r\nulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take p=\r\nart in the drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it.=\r\n This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do =\r\nnot\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; re=\r\nalization, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in =\r\na void.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as w=\r\nell as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionar=\r\ny Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps no=\r\nt &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, as per Parasar=\r\na, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spir=\r\nit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n and its spirit of comp=\r\nrehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension=\r\n is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyo=\r\nnd comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an at=\r\ntempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical m=\r\nind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Bu=\r\nddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s li=\r\nnking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely s=\r\nure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;=\r\ns a different matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring s=\r\nome as\n I\n showed!.)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottomline as far as I am concern=\r\ned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sens=\r\ne. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comp=\r\nrehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of hap=\r\npiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meani=\r\nngful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you=\r\n really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided concl=\r\nusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deiti=\r\nes are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and =\r\nother deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aad=\r\nyaa, is superior\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have =\r\ndeclared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibite=\r\nd differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference between them is=\r\n too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some signi=\r\nficant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their ow=\r\nn conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfe=\r\nctly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think ab=\r\nout it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (par=\r\namatma aspect represented by Sun) are not really that different.

If someon=\r\ne truly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or =\r\nvice versa!), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for =\r\nthe sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of unders=\r\ntanding in the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run=\r\n. In the end, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of va=\r\nrious tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts g=\r\nrasping some fistfuls of Reality.

Let me write down as I se=\r\ne it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Pura=\r\nna, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha A=\r\nvatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara=\r\n-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Puran=\r\na goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th=\r\n Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of =\r\nthe Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2.=\r\n Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have=\r\n been accorded special mention and significance across various Hindu spirit=\r\nual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namel=\r\ny the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical pre=\r\nsence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali sta=\r\nrted in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are sc=\r\nriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/=\r\n9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Nara=\r\nsimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an u=\r\nnmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with=\r\n the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the=\r\n land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human li=\r\nfe form who immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vaman=\r\na&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an =\r\naxe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. =\r\nAlso, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another =\r\nworld, but is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and po=\r\ntentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through=\r\n various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in =\r\nhand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on\n earth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these mai=\r\nn 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Ava=\r\ntara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the n=\r\nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to a=\r\nny depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-rea=\r\nlized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna a=\r\nre most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as =\r\nwell as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama=\r\n represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in con=\r\ntrol of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and =\r\nwithout - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. Howeve=\r\nr, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though=\r\n few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when ci=\r\nrcumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejecte=\r\nd while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before=\r\n the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later=\r\n revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Ra=\r\nma tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to=\r\n rescue her, but it\n was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family hono=\r\nur. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The wa=\r\ny I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmi=\r\nki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an o=\r\nbserver, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years=\r\n of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, h=\r\ne changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal conside=\r\nration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a l=\r\nesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate deta=\r\nchment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into =\r\naccount. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from p=\r\neople, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age =\r\nof eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his =\r\nfoster parents,\n his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that =\r\nit would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of hi=\r\ns happy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destinat=\r\nion. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t u=\r\nnderstand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over=\r\n. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking h=\r\nim to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them s=\r\ntarted getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly=\r\n from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has =\r\nany special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely=\r\n kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 1=\r\n00th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into=\r\n his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolut=\r\nionist\n and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used t=\r\no think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna s=\r\nhowed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish th=\r\ne enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. N=\r\never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard,=\r\n never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in=\r\n his actions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then rig=\r\nht in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to delive=\r\nr the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the b=\r\nest ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be d=\r\nejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the=\r\n instrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yav=\r\nana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n=\r\n to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Kr=\r\nshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must =\r\nbe lined up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of=\r\n knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is co=\r\nnstantly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find t=\r\nhese kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmik=\r\ni Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilli=\r\nary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayan=\r\na we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and the=\r\nn Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama=\r\n worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the pi=\r\ncture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. T=\r\nherefore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief\n of whic=\r\nh is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separati=\r\non from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved v=\r\nery dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief =\r\nwhen the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to =\r\nanything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and ther=\r\nefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never=\r\n left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual=\r\n force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionar=\r\ny Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, =\r\nan end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I f=\r\nind this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them=\r\n negated this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, t=\r\nhen why send so many avatars at crucial stages of\n evolutionary development=\r\n? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avata=\r\nra, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that =\r\nsense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avatara=\r\ns of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava=\r\n traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Rea=\r\nlization, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, out=\r\nside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed thei=\r\nr own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and ther=\r\nefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of=\r\n the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychologic=\r\nal functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in=\r\n most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - e=\r\nxcluding Buddha - correspond to the full\n power and force of one of these 9=\r\n Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness o=\r\nr allow the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possibli=\r\nties, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Ther=\r\nefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in =\r\nnumber. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment o=\r\nn which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the B=\r\nPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one =\r\ncannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual mis=\r\nrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has n=\r\not yet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Ag=\r\nhora books, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which =\r\nis perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes l=\r\niving in the full and complete\n purity and might and force and strength of =\r\nthe Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away =\r\nopposing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Kr=\r\nshna used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends=\r\n. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that s=\r\nword is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the v=\r\narious errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look =\r\nat the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, bu=\r\nt I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regar=\r\nds =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmab=\r\nuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

For examp=\r\nle, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=\r\n=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rah=\r\nu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, lea=\r\nrning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy,\n pati=\r\nence/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (res=\r\npectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that a=\r\nspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that =\r\naspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how sou=\r\nl operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operate=\r\ns. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination =\r\noperates.
