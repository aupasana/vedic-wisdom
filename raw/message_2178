Rao&quot;=\r\n &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; The actual Narayana kavacha is from the=\r\n verse that starts with \n&gt; &quot;harirvidadhyaanmama sarva rakShaam&quot; and till th=\r\ne verse that ends with \n&gt; &quot;svatejasaa grasta samasta tejaaH&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; The vers=\r\nes before it are instructions (nyaasa etc). The verses after it are \n&gt; resu=\r\nlts (phalasruti etc). The exact kavacha is the verses above.\n&gt; \n&gt; What Robe=\r\nrt Koch mentioned are three very good mantras for Narayana, but \n&gt; they are=\r\n NOT Narayana kavacha. They are used in the nyasa (placement) before \n&gt; rec=\r\niting Narayana kavacha. With each of the three mantras, there is a way to \n=\r\n&gt; place each letter of the mantra in a body part and create the environment=\r\n \n&gt; for the kavacha to work optimally. You say the three mantras while focu=\r\nsing \n&gt; mind fully on different body parts while saying different letters o=\r\nf the \n&gt; mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, like I said before, the nyasa done by peopl=\r\ne before mantras is just \n&gt; a formality and people do not know how to place=\r\n a letter in a body part. I \n&gt; am not saying it is a secret that needs to b=\r\ne learnt. It is not a matter of \n&gt; &quot;technique&quot;. It is a matter of mental fo=\r\ncus. Placement of letters in several \n&gt; body parts is an act of mental focu=\r\ns. These days, people cannot focus their \n&gt; mind on anything. Thus, nyasa i=\r\ns just a formality with no real meaning.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, my advice is: Do what y=\r\nou feel like or are taught, before and after \n&gt; the above verses, but make =\r\nsure you read the verses I identified above. That \n&gt; is the real kavacha.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Any kavacha works over long time. If you chant it regularly with good m=\r\nental \n&gt; focus, it forms an invisible protective shield around your subtle =\r\nbody. \n&gt; Narayana kavacha is a very powerful mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Ashutosh&quot; &lt;asro_1=\r\n@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, July 17, 2009 7:=\r\n51 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Guidance abtout Narayan Kavach recita\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Resp Guru Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sire, for long  have been following your=\r\n lectures provided online. So for \n&gt; &gt; me your are my Guru (least adrishya =\r\nguru) from whom I receive (derive) \n&gt; &gt; guidance\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lately i have deci=\r\nded to start reciting Narayan Kavach. As usual i am in \n&gt; &gt; doubt as can i =\r\nstart such a practice with an initiation from a Guru.?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also my sear=\r\nch through the webpages to get a copy of Naryan Kavach lead me \n&gt; &gt; to conf=\r\nusion.\n&gt; &gt; On one site I got a version which is completely different from a=\r\nn sanskrit \n&gt; &gt; version available on site : http://sanskritdocuments.org/do=\r\nc_1_index.html.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also this Sanskrit version mentions the whole dialo=\r\ngue between the Rishi \n&gt; &gt; and the King. My confusion is for a sadhana shal=\r\nl i recite the Narayan \n&gt; &gt; Kavach as some dialogue between Rishi and King =\r\nor is there a complete \n&gt; &gt; separate prayer as Kavach?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To add to my=\r\n confusion i found a paper by Robert Koch from a SJC conferece \n&gt; &gt; on Nara=\r\nyan dasa. In this he mentions about this kavach and  quotes three \n&gt; &gt; mant=\r\nras viz 1. om vi&#7779;&#7751;ave nama&#7717;\n&gt; &gt;                          =\r\n2. om namo n&#257;r&#257;ya&#7751;&#257;ya\n&gt; &gt;                          3. =\r\nom namo bhagavate v&#257;sudev&#257;ya\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and says that reciting them =\r\nas daily sadhana will help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So i request you to please guide me as =\r\nwhat is Narayan Kavach, how shall \n&gt; &gt; one put it into sadhana and if possi=\r\nble could share a copy of this Kavach \n&gt; &gt; in the form it is to be recited.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sincerely\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
