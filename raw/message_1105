It is funny that I should be typing this email on an Eka=\r\ndashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Here is my point and view about the question raised. 2nd bhava is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; th=\r\ne bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day of UL in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd h=\r\nouse, we bring insult to Vishnu who provides the food for us.\n\nMy dear Zora=\r\nn, please allow me to express my disagreement.\n\nAusterities can never be se=\r\nen as an insult to Vishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as fo=\r\nod (fasting) or speech (mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Givi=\r\nng up food or speech is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e.=\r\n brahmacharya) is not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n\nVarious gods besto=\r\nw various things on us, some at the gross physical level and some at the su=\r\nbtle spiritual level. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things, we =\r\nmake progress at the subtle level.\n\nIf one eats food, a good amount of inte=\r\nrnal fire (and subtle internal energy associated with it) is used for diges=\r\nting it and for generating physical energy from it. If one fasts, that subt=\r\nle energy is unused and available for other things. This is a tremendous be=\r\nnefit. As a result, one can better digest mantras and spiritual food availa=\r\nble all around one.\n\nThe mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fa=\r\nsting is far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy=\r\n otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mant=\r\nra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to ma=\r\nximize the effect of the mantra.\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not he=\r\nard this about 2nd lord and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is =\r\na rashi and carries energy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day rule=\r\nd by tithi of the 2nd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, =\r\nand gandanta may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is=\r\n the way out.\n\nWhy does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that=\r\n of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n\nAfter all, Rudra=\r\n rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of water a=\r\nnd one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is t=\r\nhe karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represent=\r\ned by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of wa=\r\nter (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say =\r\nthat fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings th=\r\ne fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandan=\r\nta&quot;!\n\nSeriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts is q=\r\nuite illogical.\n\nNow one more thing: Marriage is a yoga between two souls a=\r\nnd why not suggest fasting on the yoga day of the UL lord?\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Now su=\r\nppose instead of 11th house if Mercury goes to 12th house or 4 \n&gt; house the=\r\nn you cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi for the same \n&gt; because these thi=\r\nthis are ruled by Mercury only and fasting on these \n&gt; tithis will create s=\r\nerious doshas.\n\nPicking tithi based on house (12th house - Dwadashi, 4th ho=\r\nuse - Chaturthi) is illogical as there are 12 houses only and more tithis.\n=\r\n\nI have realized one thing over the years - If something is not structurall=\r\ny sound, it is most likely false knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\nI can categorically dec=\r\nlare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and ta=\r\nke a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi=\r\n and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can=\r\n take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say, a fe=\r\nw months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata fo=\r\nr the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, =\r\nthere is nothing like it!\n\nIf you keep such a vrata sincerely, you will mak=\r\ne positive progress towards achieving your purpose and definitely not go ba=\r\nckwards, irrespective of what is said by technical calculations based on ou=\r\nr half-baked Jyotish knowledge.\n\n* * *\n\nMy friends, use the Jyotish knowled=\r\nge available, but do realize that it is imperfect and corrupted. Why is onl=\r\ny the UL lord important? So many planets may have so many kinds of influenc=\r\ne on UL in a chart. And UL is one of several factors showing marriage. Ther=\r\ne may be various influences in a chart showing marriage. Is our thumb rule =\r\nof using UL lord&#39;s weekday missing some important factors? Quite possible!\n=\r\n\nBut, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection, if a thumb rule allows y=\r\nou to pick an austerity with confidence and create the mental feeling that =\r\nyou are doing the best possible thing for your situation, it is good. After=\r\n all, what is critical is to do *some* austerity to burn the blocking karma=\r\n, with a positive frame of mind about what you are doing.\n\nBut, if endless =\r\ntheorization and complicated technicalities evolving from the thumb rule ar=\r\ne creating doubts and confusion in the minds of people as they consider an =\r\nausterity, that is useless and totally missing the point.\n\nSome people tend=\r\n to resort to heavy theorization based on very shaky grounds. I suggest goi=\r\nng back to the basics, thinking clearly and keeping things simple.\n\nGem sto=\r\nnes may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fasting,=\r\n mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your body can =\r\ntake fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too many calcul=\r\nations.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\ntarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- - \n\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups .com, Ajay Zharoti=\r\na &lt;ajayzharotia@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; ||Om Gurave Namah||\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Swee, & jyotis=\r\nhis\n&gt; \n&gt; What Zoran is saying is right.

If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is not=\r\nhing like it!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you keep such a vrata sincerely, you will make posi=\r\ntive progress towards achieving your purpose and definitely not go backward=\r\ns, irrespective of what is said by technical calculations based on our half=\r\n-baked Jyotish knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My friends, use the Jyotish k=\r\nnowledge available, but do realize that it is imperfect and corrupted. Why =\r\nis only the UL lord important? So many planets may have so many kinds of in=\r\nfluence on UL in a chart. And UL is one of several factors showing marriage=\r\n. There may be various influences in a chart showing marriage. Is our thumb=\r\n rule of using UL lord&#39;s weekday missing some important factors? Quite\n pos=\r\nsible!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection, if a thumb =\r\nrule allows you to pick an austerity with confidence and create the mental =\r\nfeeling that you are doing the best possible thing for your situation, it i=\r\ns good. After all, what is critical is to do *some* austerity to burn the b=\r\nlocking karma, with a positive frame of mind about what you are doing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;But, if endless theorization and complicated technicalities evolving fro=\r\nm the thumb rule are creating doubts and confusion in the minds of people a=\r\ns they consider an austerity, that is useless and totally missing the point=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people tend to resort to heavy theorization based on very sha=\r\nky grounds. I suggest going back to the basics, thinking clearly and keepin=\r\ng things simple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, aus=\r\nterities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do =\r\nyou any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on\n any weekday =\r\nor tithi without too many calculations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comc=\r\nast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. n=\r\net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastro=\r\nloger.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijaganna=\r\nth.org/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:sohamsa%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow&gt;sohamsa@yahoogroups .com&lt;/A&gt;, Ajay Zharotia &lt;ajayzharotia@ ...&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ||Om Gurave Namah||&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Swee, &amp; jyo=\r\ntishis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; What Zoran is saying is right.

So lord of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the UL is the Mercury. Since fasting is prohibited f=\r\nor UL in 2nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; house see where the lord of the UL has gone. In your =\r\ncase mercury has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; gone to the 11th house hence it is Ekadashi. So r=\r\nule is to\n choose the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tithi is based on the placement of the UL lo=\r\nrd.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now suppose instead of 11th house if Mercury goes to 1=\r\n2th house or 4 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; house then you cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi =\r\nfor the same &lt;BR&gt;&gt; because these thithis are ruled by Mercury only and f=\r\nasting on these &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tithis will create serious doshas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; If you are doing fasting on the basis of tithis it should be done in &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; sukla paksha only.

The basic point is that Upap=\r\nada is a rashi and carries energy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or\n day. If you =\r\nfast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are br=\r\ninging the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; occur, an=\r\nd spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nThe simple solution is to do vrata which do not conflict with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; rejection of food. So a person may observe the fast on UL in 2nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; day, however, adequate food should be offered as a prasad and ea=\r\nten&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; before the Sunrise (not complete fast).In this way, re=\r\nsults may come&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a bit later, but will certainly come, while=\r\n a person will not bring&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; insult to Shri Vishnu by rejectin=\r\ng the food.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This is the way I was taught, and ofcourse oth=\r\ners may agree or not.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best wishes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Zoran R=\r\nadosavljevic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; www.siva-edu. info&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; www.ahims=\r\nazr1. wordpress.\n com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tab=\r\nle&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--8--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Share files, take polls, and make =\r\nnew friends - all under one roof. &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline=\r\n_groups_8/*http://in.promos.yahoo.com/groups/&quot;&gt; Click here.&lt;/a&gt;\r\n--0-1692974873-1233892377=:4278--\r\n\n"}}
