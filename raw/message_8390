Let me narrate\n&gt; the same here.\n&gt;\n&gt; On his way=\r\n to Gangotri, an individual named &quot;P&quot; reached a small,\n&gt; less-populated vil=\r\nlage. It was evening and a slight drizzle poured on the\n&gt; backdrop of a ora=\r\nnge colored setting sun. He was wondering where to spend\n&gt; the night, when =\r\nhe suddenly found a Bhairavi standing infront of him. He\n&gt; was surprised. S=\r\nhakti sadhana is not that popular in these parts of India,\n&gt; neither are Ta=\r\nntriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari, had a jata on her\n&gt; head and a t=\r\nrishul in one hand and small cloth tied into a knot in her\n&gt; other hand. Sh=\r\ne looked about 32-34 years of age and was strikingly\n&gt; beautiful looking.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Before he could open his mouth, she started speaking and speaking. First=\r\n\n&gt; she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marathi. Because of his travel=\r\ns\n&gt; across India, the author was familiar with the sound of different India=\r\nn\n&gt; languages but could not understand them. Then she spoke in Bengali whic=\r\nh\n&gt; was the P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Are you going to Gangotri? Have you found a=\r\n\n&gt; place to stay for the night?&quot;. P was not too pleased seeing her. He love=\r\nd\n&gt; his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. So to avoid he=\r\nr,\n&gt; he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it is extremely=\r\n\n&gt; dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested with snakes =\r\nand\n&gt; scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and it was af=\r\nterall\n&gt; only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the staying pl=\r\nace was\n&gt; reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a tre=\r\ne, laid\n&gt; out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. Th=\r\nen she\n&gt; asked him if had any food. P replied he did not, plus all the shop=\r\ns in the\n&gt; area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and sa=\r\nid she has\n&gt; to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. A=\r\nfter about\n&gt; half and hour she returned back with a something tied in a clo=\r\nth. She\n&gt; opened the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it =\r\nto the\n&gt; author to eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was =\r\ntold that\n&gt; near the bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she =\r\ngot the food\n&gt; from there. She herself did not eat anything but gave the fo=\r\nod to the him,\n&gt; saying she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food an=\r\nd confessed that\n&gt; he would have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for h=\r\ner, because he did\n&gt; not have money to buy food.\n&gt;\n&gt; She asked with surpris=\r\ne, &quot;You have come so far with any money? Where is\n&gt; your home? ETC ETC.&quot; On=\r\n hearing his answers, she asked, &quot;So do you believe\n&gt; that your meeting me =\r\nis due to the will of Jagadamba?&quot;.\n&gt; He replied, &quot;Well at least on regardin=\r\ng the food, definitely!&quot;\n&gt; Bhairavi, &quot;You people have petty minds, without =\r\nany gains you don&#39;t listen\n&gt; to anything, you don&#39;t interact freely with ot=\r\nhers&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; He asked,&quot; Are you a Tantrik?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes. What is your b=\r\nhava?&quot;\n&gt; P, &quot;I do not have fixed path, but I am very curious about Tantra a=\r\nnd\n&gt; Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you some questions about Tantra? Can a per=\r\nson\n&gt; attain God through the path of Tantra?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; She sat down crosslegged =\r\nin padmasana and replied, &quot; The word God means\n&gt; different things to differ=\r\nent people. Then attaining God has even more\n&gt; different and complex meanin=\r\ngs to everyone based on their own ideas. This\n&gt; is not like attaining some =\r\nproperty or money. It can be attained by various\n&gt; path, and then again it =\r\ncan attained by no-path at all. And the most\n&gt; complex thing in all this is=\r\n what you refer to as God is not something that\n&gt; is to be possessed at all=\r\n! Are you satisfied with the answer?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; P: &quot;What is the aim of Tantrik sa=\r\ndhanas? What is the tangible benefit?\n&gt; Those who are Tantriks or Siddha Ka=\r\nulacharis, what do they gain?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with wha=\r\ntever intention, they will achieve\n&gt; that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which i=\r\ns vira-chara, is about becoming free\n&gt; from chains (pashas). Only when the =\r\nchains have been broken that divine\n&gt; Shakti is awakened in the body. Now i=\r\nf someone then uses this Divine Shakti\n&gt; for personal gains, then they head=\r\n towards great calamity. Those who use it\n&gt; for the good of humanity, they =\r\nbecome really divine&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, &quot;=\r\nBut the answer that you\n&gt; gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to=\r\n imply that man cannot\n&gt; attain God through Tantra?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Bhairavi:&quot;If you h=\r\nad been intelligent, you would not have asked this\n&gt; question. Forget about=\r\n attaining God for the moment, first learn to acquire\n&gt; shakti. Have you do=\r\nne that? Start immediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s grace you\n&gt; will accomplish. =\r\nThis I can guarantee.  First become a Shaktiman,\n&gt; understand what is Shakt=\r\ni and how much Shakti you are capable of holding in\n&gt; your body and mind. U=\r\nnderstood? Don&#39;t waste your time in useless debates.\n&gt; Did you understand w=\r\nhat I am saying?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; The Bhairavi looked angry, the color of her face has =\r\nsuddenly changed and\n&gt; her eyes become still and unblinking. P felt scared.=\r\n He kept quite. She\n&gt; continued:&quot; All these idiots having read a few books =\r\nhere and there have\n&gt; only learnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debatin=\r\ng on God and shastra.\n&gt; Hah! Shaktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intell=\r\nect), virjahin (sans\n&gt; ojas), you guys get kicked from your bosses in offic=\r\ne, and the come home\n&gt; and show off your impotency on your wives and mother=\r\ns. And you want to\n&gt; debate on Shakti sadhana! This is ridiculous!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; P g=\r\not unnerved and was certain that she is a mad woman. The moment this\n&gt; thou=\r\nght came in his mind, she stood up at a lightning pace and screamed\n&gt; back,=\r\n &quot; Oh you think I am mad? You don&#39;t know who I am. I can destroy you\n&gt; comp=\r\nletely, or I can make you into a real Shaktiman. Do you want to see?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; H=\r\nis mind became stunned into silence. He did not know what to say. In\n&gt; fear=\r\n, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any conversation and\n&gt; star=\r\nted chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wondered if he should\n&gt; no=\r\nw get up and run away from that place. Immediate she came over to where\n&gt; h=\r\ne was sitting and held his shoulders, &quot;Where will you run? Do you think\n&gt; y=\r\nou have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it? I consider\n&gt; =\r\npeople like you nothing more than insects. You&#39;ve left your wife and son\n&gt; =\r\nand gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don&#39;t even know what Dharma\n&gt; me=\r\nans. An idiot of the first order. People like you are sheep, not men.\n&gt; Esc=\r\napists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha into the\n&gt; Ganges.=\r\n It&#39;s nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do you know\n&gt; what is=\r\n yoga, running away from life and believing that by escaping one\n&gt; attains =\r\nto renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dead\n&gt; decayed in=\r\ndividuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to\n&gt; reproduce some m=\r\nore sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; In fear and shame the P =\r\nfelt like he would faint any moment. For the first\n&gt; time in his wanderings=\r\n he felt so depressed about himself that he did not\n&gt; know what to say. Lik=\r\ne in a trance he felt his\n&gt; vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was abo=\r\nut to fall down on the\n&gt; floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, hold=\r\ning his shoulders and\n&gt; said, &quot;There is no renunciation or detachment from =\r\nlife in your heart and\n&gt; mind. How dare you argue and dabble in Yoga. Your =\r\nprarabdha awaits you and\n&gt; you think you can escape? Look at yourself and s=\r\npeak honestly. Are you free\n&gt; from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for =\r\nI can see through you&quot;. He\n&gt; could not lift his eyes from his feet and look=\r\n at her. He felt ashamed of\n&gt; himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadn=\r\ness, he touched her feet and\n&gt; started crying, &quot;Ma please save me.  You are=\r\n right. I am an idiot, I am a\n&gt; coward, I am an escapist. And I have run aw=\r\nay leaving my wife and children\n&gt; at home. I am weak of mind and heart.&quot; Hi=\r\ns voice became choked with tears.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hearing this the Bhairavi became sile=\r\nnt. She held his chin with her\n&gt; right-hand and lifted up his face to the l=\r\night. Her eyes had changed color\n&gt; and there was a tremendous compassion on=\r\n her face. &quot;What do you think I am?\n&gt; An evil spirit, a pisachi descended f=\r\nrom hell to torment you, a raving mad\n&gt; woman?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; And P replied, &quot;But I h=\r\nave not said anything to you like that, have I?&quot;.\n&gt; Hearing this she became=\r\n furious with anger, &quot;Will you people never become\n&gt; real men? You think so=\r\nmething in your heart and you lie through your teeth\n&gt; when asked. Don&#39;t yo=\r\nu have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lying to escape\n&gt; situations? Is th=\r\nis the character of real purush? Soft like mud who can be\n&gt; molded into any=\r\n obnoxious character when challenged by situations? And you\n&gt; think you can=\r\n learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you do in life?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; P replied=\r\n he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this her eyes\n&gt; widened in a=\r\n childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely and\n&gt; asked,&quot; Can you =\r\ndraw me a picture? I have been searching for a good artist?\n&gt; Can you draw =\r\na picture of Chinnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone who can draw\n&gt; her properly=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; P, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available in the mark=\r\net for\n&gt; a very little price&quot;. Hearing this she started roaring with laught=\r\ner,\n&gt; &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta?\n&gt; Have you gone ma=\r\nd? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; P, &quot;I find her image very violent and terrifying&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a hum=\r\nkar,\n&gt; &quot;Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natur=\r\nal that\n&gt; Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared=\r\n at the\n&gt; first sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Th=\r\nose who\n&gt; remain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs =\r\nnaraka,\n&gt; good vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of=\r\n\n&gt; Chinnamasta. You will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her be=\r\nena\n&gt; and live trying to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the =\r\ndeath\n&gt; and the decay and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you=\r\n and\n&gt; your ilk, a woman is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run sc=\r\nared\n&gt; when you see the first woman approaching, you run away from your own=\r\n wife,\n&gt; how on earth can you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Then she pushed him with her hand. He fell on the floor. She continued,\n=\r\n&gt; &quot;Go drown yourself in the Ganges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba\n&gt; =\r\nDurga that She may make you fit to hold shakti in your next life. Or at\n&gt; l=\r\neast beg Her, implore Her, that She may grant you intelligence to\n&gt; underst=\r\nand what is Shakti-tattwa.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hearing these words, P was so depressed tha=\r\nt his mind plunged into chaos\n&gt; and darkness. Like in a state of debilitati=\r\nng trance, he got up from the\n&gt; floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was not th=\r\nere in the room. He looked all\n&gt; around him. Then he saw her on the road ou=\r\ntside, walking towards the\n&gt; ganges. He cried out to her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me h=\r\nere, I must know who you are.\n&gt; I am confused about life and everything els=\r\ne&quot;. As soon as he uttered these\n&gt; words, the room started reverberating wit=\r\nh a attahasa, though there was not\n&gt; a soul present there apart from him. A=\r\n laughter so loud that he left his\n&gt; ear drums will split. He rushed out in=\r\nto the rain to follow the moving\n&gt; figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ra=\r\nn, the more did the distance keep\n&gt; increasing between him and the Bhairavi=\r\n. Then he could see clearly, the\n&gt; Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water,=\r\n and kept moving deeper until she\n&gt; was drowned completely in the water. Th=\r\ne author sat near the banks,\n&gt; shouting out to her, asking her to come out =\r\nand help him. But there was no\n&gt; response. Just the regular lapping sound o=\r\nf waves hitting the shore and a\n&gt; very dark night.\n&gt;\n&gt; He sat there till su=\r\nnrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next\n&gt; morning he went and ask=\r\ned around the village, but no one had seen the\n&gt; Bhairavi and neither was t=\r\nhere any shop near the banks which sold food.\n&gt; Because of the heavy rains,=\r\n everything was shut down last night with not a\n&gt; soul in the open.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Y=\r\nears later, P went back home to his wife and son and lead a full and\n&gt; comp=\r\nlete family life.

Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji is one o=\r\nf\n&gt; Dash MahaVidya and Her Swroop is very difficult to look at for me. Her\n=\r\n&gt; Appearence Day Tithi has just gone by few weeks ago.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many years ago w=\r\nhen I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one late\n&gt; evening to my ashra=\r\nm. After some time he took me to a quite corner and told\n&gt; me certain thing=\r\n about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his face\n&gt; and had certain=\r\n powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave me a\n&gt; Mantra of Sr=\r\ni Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the morning\n&gt; and I never =\r\nsaw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happen and\n&gt; this tith=\r\ni became very upsetting for me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some years back here in London I was co=\r\nming home in the afternoon. I was\n&gt; in a crowded bus and holding on to rail=\r\nings.Suddenly I rememberd that it\n&gt; was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji.=\r\n I started to recite Her mantra&#92;name\n&gt; and try to meditate on Her in that c=\r\nrowded bus. I even smiled myself on the\n&gt; strangeness of that situation. Af=\r\nter few more minutes I reached home and\n&gt; opened my front door and went ins=\r\nide. After going through my Puja room and\n&gt; telling my mother that I was ba=\r\nck, I flopped on sofa in front room which is\n&gt; very near to front gate. The=\r\nn I heard some noises but I did not get up and\n&gt; slept for nearly one hour.=\r\n After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my\n&gt; front door although nob=\r\nody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house\n&gt; was covered in Polic=\r\ne lines and tapes. I could not believe it.\n&gt;\n&gt; I asked a policeman who was =\r\nnear my door and he said that Turkish gunmen\n&gt; were shooting at each other =\r\nand then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body.\n&gt; On that day I was clearly =\r\nsaved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in\n&gt; my inner sky several minu=\r\ntes before the incident and I started Her prayers\n&gt; although there was no r=\r\neasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time\n&gt; without knowing a single =\r\nthing as load of armed policemen were there after\n&gt; those gunman.and whole =\r\nnoises and drama.\n&gt; What else is this but Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri Ch=\r\ninnmastaji\n&gt;\n&gt; GoodLuck  and Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *rom:* Pri=\r\nya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48\n&gt; *Subject:* Re:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material\n&gt; sadhana&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;  Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; Aparna ji, a few of us whom you consider are blessed with th=\r\ne desire to\n&gt; pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail.

The  m=\r\nail that nobody\n&gt; ji has written is for those who already pray him not for =\r\nnewcomers who\n&gt; have to yet develop love/affection/trust for god...\n&gt;\n&gt; As =\r\nI write this I show no hatred towards you or those people who talk in\n&gt; sim=\r\nilar fashion. It is their ignorance and the soul transformation doesn&#39;t\n&gt; h=\r\nappen easily. Hence I will definitely pray for your inner growth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Nobod=\r\ny ji has spoken thousand words of wisdom hats off to his thoughts.\n&gt; When I=\r\n went to learn car driving the teacher saw me driving with no\n&gt; attention. =\r\nHe yelled at me and I learnt driving in one day. Some students\n&gt; don&#39;t list=\r\nen when explained gently, some students listen only when the\n&gt; teacher yell=\r\ns so no offences should be taken by anyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another thing I always noti=\r\nced is that for some reason most of them in\n&gt; this forum talk with great re=\r\nspect to Narsimha ji and don&#39;t even consider\n&gt; taking advices given by any =\r\nother devotees. We all know Narsimha ji but we\n&gt; don&#39;t know which other hig=\r\nh raised souls we are talking to. Please talk\n&gt; with respect and considerat=\r\nion towards other devotees also otherwise our\n&gt; prayers are a complete wast=\r\ne....\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Priya &lt;Priya@yahoogroups.com&gt; Shaantih Shaantih Shaant=\r\nih ||\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Your email settings: Individual Email|Traditional\n&gt; Change =\r\nsettings via the Web&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/join;_ylc=\r\n=3DX3oDMTJnYTJxM2h2BF9TAzk3NDc2NTkwBGdycElkAzE5MDI5MDE1BGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA3=\r\nNTk5MQRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNzdG5ncwRzdGltZQMxMzM5ODExMzIz&gt;(Yahoo!

Let me narrate the same here.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On his way to Gangotri, an i=\r\nndividual named &quot;P&quot; reached a small, less-populated village. It w=\r\nas evening and a slight drizzle poured on the backdrop of a orange colored =\r\nsetting sun. He was wondering where to spend the night, when he suddenly fo=\r\nund a Bhairavi standing infront of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is=\r\n not that popular in these parts of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairav=\r\nis. She wore a red sari, had a jata on her head and a trishul in one hand a=\r\nnd small cloth tied into a knot in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 y=\r\nears of age and was strikingly beautiful looking.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Before he could\n open his mouth, she started speaking and speaking. Fi=\r\nrst she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marathi. Because of his trave=\r\nls across India, the author was familiar with the sound of different Indian=\r\n languages but could not understand them. Then she spoke in Bengali which w=\r\nas the P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Are you going to Gangotri? Have you fou=\r\nnd a place to stay for the night?&quot;. P was not too pleased seeing her. =\r\nHe loved his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. So to avo=\r\nid her, he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it is extrem=\r\nely dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested with snakes=\r\n and scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and it was aft=\r\nerall only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the staying place=\r\n was reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a tree, la=\r\nid out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. Then she =\r\nasked him if had any food. P\n replied he did not, plus all the shops in the=\r\n area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and said she has=\r\n to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. After about h=\r\nalf and hour she returned back with a something tied in a cloth. She opened=\r\n the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the author to=\r\n eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that near the=\r\n bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she got the food from th=\r\nere. She herself did not eat anything but gave the food to the him, saying =\r\nshe was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food and confessed that he woul=\r\nd have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for her, because he did not hav=\r\ne money to buy food. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She asked with surprise=\r\n, &quot;You have come so far with any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC.&q=\r\nuot; On hearing his answers, she asked, &quot;So do you believe that your m=\r\neeting me is due to the will of\n Jagadamba?&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; He replied, &=\r\nquot;Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bhair=\r\navi, &quot;You people have petty minds, without any gains you don&#39;t lis=\r\nten to anything, you don&#39;t interact freely with others&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He asked,&quot; Are you a Tantrik?&quot; She replied, &quo=\r\nt;Yes. What is your bhava?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;I do not have fixed pat=\r\nh, but I am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you s=\r\nome questions about Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tan=\r\ntra?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She sat down crosslegged in padmas=\r\nana and replied, &quot; The word God means different things to different pe=\r\nople. Then attaining God has even more different and complex meanings to ev=\r\neryone based on their own ideas. This is not like attaining some property o=\r\nr money. It can be attained by various path, and then again it can attained=\r\n by no-path at all. And the most complex thing in all this is what you refe=\r\nr to as God is not\n something that is to be possessed at all! Are you satis=\r\nfied with the answer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P: &quot;What is the a=\r\nim of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who are Tantrik=\r\ns or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with whatever intention, they will ac=\r\nhieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which is vira-chara, is about becoming=\r\n free from chains (pashas). Only when the chains have been broken that divi=\r\nne Shakti is awakened in the body. Now if someone then uses this Divine Sha=\r\nkti for personal gains, then they head towards great calamity. Those who us=\r\ne it for the good of humanity, they become really divine&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, &quot;But the=\r\n answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply th=\r\nat man cannot attain God through Tantra?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Bh=\r\nairavi:&quot;If you had been intelligent, you would not\n have asked this qu=\r\nestion. Forget about attaining God for the moment, first learn to acquire s=\r\nhakti. Have you done that? Start immediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s grace y=\r\nou will accomplish. This I can guarantee.=A0 First become a Shaktiman, unde=\r\nrstand what is Shakti and how much Shakti you are capable of holding in you=\r\nr body and mind. Understood? Don&#39;t waste your time in useless debates. =\r\nDid you understand what I am saying?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Bh=\r\nairavi looked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and her eye=\r\ns become still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She continued:=\r\n&quot; All these idiots having read a few books here and there have only le=\r\narnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Sh=\r\naktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you=\r\n guys get kicked from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off=\r\n your impotency on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate\n on Shakt=\r\ni sadhana! This is ridiculous!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P got unnerve=\r\nd and was certain that she is a mad woman. The moment this thought came in =\r\nhis mind, she stood up at a lightning pace and screamed back, &quot; Oh you=\r\n think I am mad? You don&#39;t know who I am. I can destroy you completely,=\r\n or I can make you into a real Shaktiman. Do you want to see?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His mind became stunned into silence. He did not know wh=\r\nat to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any conve=\r\nrsation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wondered i=\r\nf he should now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she came ove=\r\nr to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, &quot;Where will you run?=\r\n Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it=\r\n? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You&#39;ve left you=\r\nr wife and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don&#39;t even kn=\r\now what Dharma\n means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are she=\r\nep, not men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha in=\r\nto the Ganges. It&#39;s nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do =\r\nyou know what is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escapin=\r\ng one attains to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dea=\r\nd decayed individuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to reprod=\r\nuce some more sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In fear and shame the P felt like he would faint any moment. F=\r\nor the first time in his wanderings he felt so depressed about himself that=\r\n he did not know what to say. Like in a trance he felt his &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\nvision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall down on the floor=\r\n, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoulders and said, &q=\r\nuot;There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your heart and mind=\r\n. How dare you argue and\n dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits you and you=\r\n think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are you free fr=\r\nom desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through you&quot;. He =\r\ncould not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt ashamed of h=\r\nimself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet and st=\r\narted crying, &quot;Ma please save me.=A0 You are right. I am an idiot, I a=\r\nm a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and child=\r\nren at home. I am weak of mind and heart.&quot; His voice became choked wit=\r\nh tears.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent.=\r\n She held his chin with her right-hand and lifted up his face to the light.=\r\n Her eyes had changed color and there was a tremendous compassion on her fa=\r\nce. &quot;What do you think I am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from =\r\nhell to torment you, a raving mad woman?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;And P replied, &quot;But I have not said\n anything to you like that, have=\r\n I?&quot;. Hearing this she became furious with anger, &quot;Will you peopl=\r\ne never become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie thro=\r\nugh your teeth when asked. Don&#39;t you have any tej, shakti anything at a=\r\nll? Lying to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft =\r\nlike mud who can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by =\r\nsituations? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What =\r\ndo you do in life?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P replied he was a paint=\r\ner before he left home. Hearing this her eyes widened in a childlike excite=\r\nment. She lost her anger completely and asked,&quot; Can you draw me a pict=\r\nure? I have been searching for a good artist? Can you draw a picture of Chi=\r\nnnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone who can draw her properly&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily ava=\r\nilable in the market for a very little price&quot;. Hearing this she starte=\r\nd\n roaring with laughter, &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinna=\r\nmasta? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have you gone mad? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;I find her image very violent and terrifying&=\r\nquot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud=\r\n that it sounded like a humkar, &quot;Fool! For people like you who are wor=\r\nst than women, it is but natural that Chinnamasta will look scary and terri=\r\nfying. People who are scared at the first sight of blood and death will not=\r\n appreciate her beauty! Those who remain trapped in conditioned thinking of=\r\n pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot und=\r\nerstand the madness of Chinnamasta. You will only be able to draw a white S=\r\naraswati with her beena and live trying to deny the other aspects and reali=\r\nties of life, the death and the decay and never see the grand play of the U=\r\nniverse. For you and your ilk, a woman is an object of subconscious revulsi=\r\non, you run scared\n when you see the first woman approaching, you run away =\r\nfrom your own wife, how on earth can you handle the terrible beauty of Chin=\r\nnamasta?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then she pushed him with her hand. =\r\nHe fell on the floor. She continued, &quot;Go drown yourself in the Ganges =\r\nand before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you fit to ho=\r\nld shakti in your next life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, that She may=\r\n grant you intelligence to understand what is Shakti-tattwa.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hearing these words, P was so depressed that his mind plu=\r\nnged into chaos and darkness. Like in a state of debilitating trance, he go=\r\nt up from the floor and sat down. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. H=\r\ne looked all around him. Then he saw her on the road outside, walking towar=\r\nds the ganges. He cried out to her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me here, I must k=\r\nnow who you are. I am confused about life and everything else&quot;. As soo=\r\nn as he uttered these words, the room\n started reverberating with a attahas=\r\na, though there was not a soul present there apart from him. A laughter so =\r\nloud that he left his ear drums will split. He rushed out into the rain to =\r\nfollow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. The faster he ran, the more did t=\r\nhe distance keep increasing between him and the Bhairavi. Then he could see=\r\n clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ganges water, and kept moving deep=\r\ner until she was drowned completely in the water. The author sat near the b=\r\nanks, shouting out to her, asking her to come out and help him. But there w=\r\nas no response. Just the regular lapping sound of waves hitting the shore a=\r\nnd a very dark night. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He sat there till sunr=\r\nise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and asked a=\r\nround the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was there a=\r\nny shop near the banks which sold food.

Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji is one of Dash MahaVidya and =\r\nHer Swroop is very difficult to look at for me. Her Appearence Day Tithi ha=\r\ns just gone by few weeks ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one la=\r\nte evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite corner and t=\r\nold me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his fa=\r\nce and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave m=\r\ne a Mantra of=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the morn=\r\ning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happen=\r\n and this tithi became very upsetting for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some years back here in London I was coming home in=\r\n the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus and holding on to railings.Suddenly =\r\nI rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to re=\r\ncite Her mantra&#92;name and try to meditate on Her in that crowded bus. I even=\r\n smiled myself on the strangeness of that situation. After few more minutes=\r\n I reached home and opened my front door and went inside. After going throu=\r\ngh my Puja room and telling my mother that I was back, I flopped on sofa in=\r\n front room which is very near to front gate. Then I heard some noises but =\r\nI did not get up and slept for nearly one hour. After I got up I got a srro=\r\nng feeling to open my front door although nobody had knocked. The whole are=\r\na in front of my house was covered in Police lines and tapes. I could not b=\r\nelieve it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I asked a =\r\npoliceman who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shootin=\r\ng at each other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day =\r\nI was clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky =\r\nseveral minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers although ther=\r\ne was no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without knowing a=\r\n single thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunman.and =\r\nwhole noises and drama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;What else is this but Pers=\r\nonal Grace of Bhagvati Sri=A0Chinnmastaji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;GoodLuck=A0 and Thanks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;LaxmiNa=\r\nrayan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;rom:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Priya M &lt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:prm7782@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;prm7782@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-W=\r\nEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic lia=\r\nbility for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;F=\r\nONT-FAMILY:times new roman,new york,times,serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;font-family:arial,helvetica,sa=\r\nns-serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aparna ji, a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; few of us whom you consider are bles=\r\nsed with the desire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your mail. =\r\nThe ways of god are very mysterious and we humans especially in this yug ha=\r\nve no right to ask her ruling.
