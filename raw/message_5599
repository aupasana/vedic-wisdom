Both are justified for different reasons.\n \nBefore we answer this question, we need to understand who is guru.\n \nAs I said earlier, guru literally means dispeller of darkness, as per Guru Gita.\n \nHowever, there are different levels of darkness everywhere. When several lights are placed in a room, you may see several shadows that are at varying levels of darkness.\n \nSimilarly, different concepts of goodness in the field of duality exist (like lights in a room). Their lack shows different kinds of darkness. A mathematics teacher throws one kind of light from one angle and removes some level of darkness. A Sanskrit teacher throws one kind of light from one angle and removes some level of darkness. A scholar teaching scriptures throws one kind of light and removes some level of darkness. But, none may remove darkness *completely*. Thus, most teachers are darkness reducers and not darkness dispellers.\n \nAs long as the delusion of individualized self-awareness (aka &quot;egosense&quot; or ahamkara or asmita) persists and, through it, one experiences dualities such as likes and dislikes, pleasures and pains etc, one is in *some* level of darkness! Only a self-realized and liberated person is free from darkness, as the light of Self is the only light that illuminates every point of the universe, whereas beacons of light in the field of duality light up some parts of and keep some parts of dark. Any person who improves our understanding of things through his teaching is *reducing* darkness, but not *dispelling* it completely. For this reason, most spiritual gurus of today are not really gurus in the correct sense of the word. They are darkness reducers but not darkness dispellers.\n \nAfter all, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa vehemently protested whenever someone called him a guru and declared firmly that only Parabrahma (supreme being) could be called a guru and nobody else was qualified to be called a guru. This from a man who sent a highly rational being (young Narendranath) into samadhi by merely touching him!\n \nIf one accepts Ramakrishna&#39;s word, then Parabrahma is the only qualified guru. ParaBrahma is worshippable. So guru is worshippable!\n \nIf you accept someone as guru knowing that he is a limited being, then you hope to reach ParaBrahma through that person. One approach is to start seeing that person as ParaBrahma (that is why we say &quot;gurur brahmaa gurur viShnuH gurur devo maheshwaraH&quot;). If you really see guru as ParaBrahma, then there is meaning in worshipping guru. But, if you do not and you merely see guru as a limited being and an instrument in reaching ParaBrahma, then any worship is just a ritual and does not mean much. So Swami Rama&#39;s words are not wrong.\n \nIn the end, whether you worship guru or not is not the real thing that decides your progress. After all, there are those who ban any idol worship, while there are those who realize God through idols! Whatever practices you follow, the goal is to read union with the divine. One may be worshipping guru with a still and firm mind that views guru as the epitome of divinity and one may progress. One may be worshipping guru with a wavering mind that is fluctuating between the polarities and confusions and one may not make progress. One may not be worshipping guru and yet one&#39;s mind may be still and firm and see divinity in all things, those that are worshipped and those that are looked down upon, and one may make progress. I never emphasize specific actions or specific rituals, because that depends on the vaasanaas of the sadhaka.\n \nBTW, communion with the divine is not an external pursuit, i.e. you do not go somewhere or accumulate something or take some action to experience union with the divine. Jagat or universe is the moving one (literally). ParaBrahma is &quot;experienced&quot; when all movement ceases. All actions and rituals actually involve movement of consciousness! Ironically, we use well-designed movements of consciousness to facilitate stillness of consciousness oneday. This is the irony of spiritual sadhana!\n \nMy guru never asked me to worship him. He in fact declared to me that he is incapable of doing anything and Devi does whatever I may feel that he is doing. He only emphasized the need to experience oneness with the divine and did not tell me to worship him.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Narasimha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. In Living with Himalayan Masters book, Swami Rama compare Guru with a boat that helps one crossing the river, also says that we need to respect the guru and need not or rather not worship the guru, logical!!?? In the Contrast we all do worship the gurus such as Rama Krishna, Shirdi Saibaba etc. Confused :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n\n\n"}}
