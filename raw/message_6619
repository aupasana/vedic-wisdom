He started \n&gt; homam and japam a=\r\nnd got two offers within 15 days. He calls it a \n&gt; &quot;miracle&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; He sent =\r\nme several mails earlier asking for an astrological advice. It \n&gt; did not f=\r\neel like there was anything I could do and I ignored. He \n&gt; discovered the =\r\nfree homam manuals  and the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, \n&gt; derived inspiration=\r\n from the mails there and used the free resources on \n&gt; the homam website. =\r\nHe saw immediate results.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I know some other p=\r\neople whose problems were solved after they started \n&gt; doing homam or inten=\r\nse meditation. Exactly how much effort is needed \n&gt; depends on the individu=\r\nal case and the karmas involved. But, things like \n&gt; homam and intense medi=\r\ntation can only help. God either solves one&#39;s \n&gt; problems or creates a situ=\r\nation where one rises above the problems, i.e. \n&gt; does not get affected by =\r\nthe problems. If one surrenders and worships \n&gt; god in fire, one&#39;s life wil=\r\nl be steered by god in the correct direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though people pay too mu=\r\nch attention to many technical details and get \n&gt; worried that they may mak=\r\ne mistakes, the most important thing is \n&gt; devotion and surrender and many =\r\ntechnical aspects are negotiable. Many \n&gt; people who never even lit a light=\r\n in their life before are now doing \n&gt; daily homam and making brisk progres=\r\ns!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of people in serious problems send m=\r\ne their horoscope and ask for \n&gt; help. Sadly, I or any astrologer cannot so=\r\nlve their problems. Solving \n&gt; their problems is in their own hands!! Irres=\r\npective of the exact nature \n&gt; of blocking karmas, doing homam or intense m=\r\neditation can only benefit \n&gt; one. Though people may think that they need a=\r\nn astrologer to tell them \n&gt; which deity to worship and otherwise bad thing=\r\ns can happen, this is an \n&gt; unfounded fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have studied and experim=\r\nented with astrology (still do) as well as \n&gt; anybody alive today. I can de=\r\nclare with utmost confidence that our \n&gt; understanding is half-baked at bes=\r\nt and one cannot rely on astrology for \n&gt; life-changing decisions. On the o=\r\nther hand, one can rely on god. Gods \n&gt; like Ganesha, Kartikeya, Vishnu, Kr=\r\nishna, Lakshmi, Shiva, Hanuman, Durga \n&gt; etc can give any material or spiri=\r\ntual results, including moksha. \n&gt; Worshipping any of them is perfectly saf=\r\ne. Each deity puts a surrendered \n&gt; devotee on the correct path, in one&#39;s o=\r\nwn way. Each of them is far \n&gt; better than me or any astrologer alive today=\r\n, for changing your life for \n&gt; the better! Picking a deity based on taste =\r\nand doing homam or intense \n&gt; meditation is faaaaaaar better than approachi=\r\nng astrologers like me for \n&gt; astrological advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are unsure which deity to worship, worship Ganesha with Ganapa=\r\nthi \n&gt; homam. It is a superb sadhana to set one&#39;s life on the correct path,=\r\n \n&gt; both materially and spiritually. You don&#39;t have to take my word for it.=\r\n \n&gt; The proof of the pudding is in eating it. Try it yourself for a few \n&gt; =\r\nmonths and see what happens. Your main problem will either be solved or \n&gt; =\r\nyour mental state will start to change so that the problem&#39;s impact on \n&gt; y=\r\nou is reduced. You yourself will see how you are benefiting!\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, the=\r\nre are many insightful and inspiring mails on spiritual sadhana \n&gt; on vedic=\r\n-wisdom yahoogroup, which have inspired many people to do homam \n&gt; and othe=\r\nr sadhanas. A few mails organized in a PDF book form by some \n&gt; seekers can=\r\n be downloaded freely at:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/vedicwisdom\n&gt; \n&gt; Links to=\r\n homam websites again are:\n&gt; \n&gt; Specific Hindu homam rituals:  http://tinyu=\r\nrl.com/homam\n&gt; Generic fire ritual for Hindus and non-Hindus: \n&gt; http://tin=\r\nyurl.com/fireritual\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t wait till Mahakala =\r\nstares in the face. Do some sadhana while this \n&gt; body still has some juice=\r\n in it. If you are in problems, you have an \n&gt; added incentive to do sadhan=\r\na. But, even otherwise, consider sadhana. A \n&gt; homam can be done in just 20=\r\n-30 minutes. Spending 20-30 min worshipping \n&gt; god in fire everyday can cha=\r\nnge your life for the better and transform \n&gt; your personality completely.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, it is Mother&#39;s wish that several people should regularly \n&gt; w=\r\norship various deities in fire again and progress. World is going to be \n&gt; =\r\ntransformed drastically in the coming decades, at many levels. One of \n&gt; th=\r\ne changes is that thousands of simple people will actually find &quot;god&quot; \n&gt; us=\r\ning fire as the medium and show direction to many people around them. \n&gt; I =\r\nam fool and don&#39;t know much, but I know this one thing with utmost \n&gt; confi=\r\ndence.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;  =\r\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitte=\r\nr ID: @homam108\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; Hello Narsimha ji.\n&gt; Pranam.\n&gt; Homams and japams started an=\r\nd the miracle happened. Yes, I started doing \n&gt; homams and japams by follow=\r\ning guidelines from your homam website and \n&gt; from your emails on Vedic-wis=\r\ndom list and a real life miracle happened \n&gt; for me. Narsimhaji I bow in fr=\r\nont of you. I feel we, whoever, know you, \n&gt; are so fortunate that we got a=\r\n Guru like you in this world. You are a \n&gt; Modern Age Guru who is enlighten=\r\ning us, showing us direction with all \n&gt; the vedic knowledge you got. I had=\r\n known you for your Astrology wisdom \n&gt; but not that much for Vedic knowled=\r\nge and wisdom. But now I know that in \n&gt; this facebook and iphone era we ha=\r\nve a Guru who can share Vedas \n&gt; knowledge with us and show us right path i=\r\nn this life sitting here in \n&gt; the US.\n&gt; ... This dates back to last year w=\r\nhen my wife found your website over \n&gt; the internet and came to me saying s=\r\nhe found a very easy way of doing \n&gt; homam by ourselves. She always thought=\r\n that for all our day to day \n&gt; problems that we were facing in our life, w=\r\ne should perform some \n&gt; homam/pooja, but we didn=E2=80=99t know how to do =\r\nthat. So when I looked at the \n&gt; link she sent to me I told the gentleman w=\r\nho had written this was our \n&gt; Narsimha guru, and If he was recommending to=\r\n do homams and written \n&gt; something for it, then we should go for it, and f=\r\nor the first time we \n&gt; did homam at our home during navratri 2010.\n&gt; As yo=\r\nu know I was searching for full time job for last 2 yrs, and had \n&gt; failed =\r\n17-18 interviews thus far- I think I had sent you emails a couple \n&gt; of tim=\r\nes seeking some remedies- but you were busy. In 6 or 7 such \n&gt; interviews I=\r\n reached close enough to think that I was going to get an \n&gt; offer letter b=\r\nut never got any. ...\n&gt; I started searching Vedic astrology mailing list ..=\r\n. I found one of your \n&gt; postings where you had written about hanuman chali=\r\nsa and then given a \n&gt; link for vedic-wisdom list. I started looking at tha=\r\nt list and read \n&gt; about your experience with Manish Pandit, that made me r=\r\nead me many of \n&gt; your postings on that list. ... why couldn=E2=80=99t I do=\r\n intense pooja and \n&gt; homams and nullify that effect. I read your comment t=\r\no surrender to one \n&gt; god and worship him same time everyday with full surr=\r\nender and do \n&gt; homams. I discussed this with my wife and we decided to tak=\r\ne the route \n&gt; of homam and japams. We performed one homam and I started ch=\r\nanting \n&gt; Hanuman Chalisa everyday with full devotion, attention and Surren=\r\nder. \n&gt; ...\n&gt; I started doing daily Hanuman Chalisa. Everyday I do Hanuman =\r\nChalisa 5/7 \n&gt; times daily, and before starting I think about you, Manish P=\r\nandit and Pt \n&gt; XX=E2=80&quot;all three as my gurus. I start my japam by telling=\r\n god that if I am \n&gt; honest and sincere, haven=E2=80=99t committed anything=\r\n wrong, then god should \n&gt; come and l help me out. To my surprise just with=\r\nin 15 days, I got 2 \n&gt; interview calls. I went and attended interviews. The=\r\n Interviews went \n&gt; well as always, but this time I got the JOB OFFERs. Yea=\r\nh, job offers at \n&gt; 2 places. It ended my 2 years of struggle, I couldn=E2=\r\n=80=99t believe it. I am \n&gt; planning to join one of them next Monday 20 th =\r\nJune. Hence this time it \n&gt; was not your Astrology wisdom, it is your vedic=\r\n wisdom that has helped \n&gt; me. I couldn=E2=80=99t believe what god has give=\r\nn. It was like a miracle.\n&gt; Now I am determined that I would keep doing hom=\r\nams as and when possible \n&gt; but japam daily for sure for my rest of the lif=\r\ne. I am a novice for \n&gt; homams so I am learning these things. I often see y=\r\nour youtube video on \n&gt; homams and try to follow this. I hope someday I wil=\r\nl get some mastery \n&gt; over this and do homams regularly without errors. You=\r\nr experiences and \n&gt; stories with Manish Pandit were very inspiring through=\r\nout this journey. \n&gt; Your those real time experiences with Manish were grea=\r\nt, they gave me \n&gt; credentials that if Narsimha guru is writing these thing=\r\ns then there \n&gt; should be some truth behind this. That inspired me that if =\r\nI surrender \n&gt; to god, god can help me too and he really helped me.\n&gt; This =\r\ntime I had a material motive behind my homams and japams as I \n&gt; wanted to =\r\nget a full time, but I am sure this route will take me more \n&gt; towards spir=\r\nituality and some day I would be able to help society and to \n&gt; this world =\r\nin some way.  ...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
