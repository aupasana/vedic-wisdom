The=\r\n manual says, go with Akshats in that case. But, while I am offering the wa=\r\nter with akshats (ideally seasame seeds) to Pitris in second last section, =\r\nthe mantras use the word &quot;Tilodakam&quot;. If I am right, this refers to the sea=\r\nsame seeds being offered. Is it fine to continue with these mantras only ti=\r\nll I find the seasame seeds, or shall I modify it mysylf with say &quot;Akshatod=\r\nakam&quot;.\nFor today, I will go with as suggested, but it would be nice if you =\r\ncan guide the right way in absence of such things.\nAlso, is it OK to to put=\r\n a paper sheet and a vessel in front of one, and to leave the akshats and w=\r\nater after the offerings into them, than on tiled floors? And then later pu=\r\nt these water and akshats in some garden (or soil), from where they are abs=\r\norbed into the five elements easily. From fllor it will either be wiped off=\r\n or will get dried up there to be mopped off later. I think that is not goo=\r\nd thing to do.\nAgain for today I will do the same way.
