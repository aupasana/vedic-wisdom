Her amazing\n&gt; &gt; life of inner visions, spiritual yearning, surrender=\r\n and bhakti inspires all\n&gt; &gt; to pursue the spiritual ideal, delve into the =\r\nSupreme Self and not waste\n&gt; &gt; even a minute in the process.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Born o=\r\nn July 27, 1906, the child Janaky exhibited unusual detachment. She\n&gt; &gt; acc=\r\nepted all things with a joyous heart. Janaky was full of devotion to the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; local deities, Sri Viswanatha and Visalakshi, and as she grew in years,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Janaky desired to be like Sita, the ever-faithful, pure and holy wife of=\r\n Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ram.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In her thirteenth year her uncle discussed with Janak=\r\ny her willingness to\n&gt; &gt; marry a doctor who was then thirty-two years of ag=\r\ne. When told that the\n&gt; &gt; widower had two daughters, aged two and six, Sri =\r\nJanaky replied, &quot;What of\n&gt; &gt; that? That doesn&#39;t make much of a difference a=\r\nnd, after all, I like\n&gt; &gt; children.&quot; Even though her parents were not too k=\r\neen on this matrimonial\n&gt; &gt; arrangement because of the extreme age differen=\r\nce, Janaky intuitively felt\n&gt; &gt; that the doctor would be helpful in the att=\r\nainment of her goal of\n&gt; &gt; Liberation. So in 1919, Sri Janaky married Dr. C=\r\n. S. Ganapathy (known\n&gt; &gt; hereafter as &#39;Doctor&#39;), in a quiet ceremony perfo=\r\nrmed before Lord\n&gt; &gt; Venkataramana of Tirupathi. The Doctor was often heard=\r\n to remark: &quot;Wherever\n&gt; &gt; you (Janaky) go, I shall follow you.&quot; And where e=\r\nlse could she go, but to\n&gt; &gt; God? Living in Tirupathi, Sri Matha&#39;s devotion=\r\n to Sri Venkataramana grew\n&gt; &gt; steadily.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In 1921, she gave birth to=\r\n a daughter and named her Padmavathy, after the\n&gt; &gt; consort of Lord Venkata=\r\nramana. Then a son, Srinivasa Subrahmanya, was born,\n&gt; &gt; and several years =\r\nlater another daughter, Sarada.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There came a point in her life when=\r\n she realized: &quot;To none but Him (God)\n&gt; &gt; should true love be directed. To =\r\nturn to the Divine is the only truth in\n&gt; &gt; life.&quot; From that day on she con=\r\ntinued to take care of her family and\n&gt; &gt; responsibilities but shifted her =\r\nlife&#39;s ideal to that of total devotion to\n&gt; &gt; God.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At the age of tw=\r\nenty her daily routine was as follows: She read the Gita\n&gt; &gt; and other Scri=\r\nptures until about 1 a.m. every night. Janaky would get up at\n&gt; &gt; 5 a.m., f=\r\ninish her ablutions and meditate until 7 a.m. Then she would take a\n&gt; &gt; bat=\r\nh, recite hymns while attending to household work for about three hours,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and after sending the children to school and the Doctor to work, she woul=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; engage herself heart and soul in worship until 1 p.m. From 1 to 4 p.m=\r\n. she\n&gt; &gt; was busy looking after the needs of her husband and children. At =\r\n4:30 p.m.\n&gt; &gt; she would go to the Ladies&#39; Club (which did much volunteer co=\r\nmmunity\n&gt; &gt; service), attend meetings, play tennis and return home at 7 p.m=\r\n. Upon\n&gt; &gt; returning home she would meditate for an hour before taking her =\r\nsupper of\n&gt; &gt; gruel and milk. Though she took very little food, she was hea=\r\nlthy and always\n&gt; &gt; cheerful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although the Doctor was then earning =\r\na good salary, owing to various\n&gt; &gt; reasons, there was a lack of funds. One=\r\n day before going to bed she prayed\n&gt; &gt; to Sri Subrahmanya to keep her care=\r\nfree by taking on His shoulders the\n&gt; &gt; oppressive burden of the family&#39;s w=\r\nelfare. The next day, a sannyasi\n&gt; &gt; (ascetic) came to her house. She was a=\r\nll alone when he said to her, &quot;You\n&gt; &gt; were calling me yesterday. I have co=\r\nme from Palni. Leave to me all your\n&gt; &gt; family worries and worship me with =\r\na carefree heart. Whatever is needed for\n&gt; &gt; the family - be it money or ot=\r\nher needs and necessities of life - will be\n&gt; &gt; provided for.&quot; He asked her=\r\n to give him the promise that she would never\n&gt; &gt; forget him. After she agr=\r\need, he disappeared.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After this she had many wonderful spiritual ex=\r\nperiences and visions of\n&gt; &gt; deities, often lasting the whole night.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sri Subrahmanya came twice more in the disguise of a sannyasi. When Janak=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; revealed this to the Doctor, he replied with scepticism, &quot;I will beli=\r\neve\n&gt; &gt; your words only if He comes here when I am in.&quot; Janaky responded, &quot;=\r\nIf that\n&gt; &gt; be your desire, let it be so.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Doctor had just retu=\r\nrned for lunch when they both felt a presence\n&gt; &gt; outside. Seeing a sannyas=\r\ni, both Janaky and the Doctor came out and offered\n&gt; &gt; him a chair. He took=\r\n some food and said, &quot;You wanted me to come when your\n&gt; &gt; husband is in, an=\r\nd here I am.&quot; To make the Doctor believe His Divinity, He\n&gt; &gt; exhibited som=\r\ne psychic powers. He asked for another chair and requested\n&gt; &gt; Janaky to be=\r\n seated. She felt reluctant to sit on the same level with Him,\n&gt; &gt; but he i=\r\nnsisted and asked her what more she desired. Janaky requested Him to\n&gt; &gt; bl=\r\ness her with a Sadguru in human form.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What the sannyasi next said t=\r\no her shocked her very much. &quot;I am none none\n&gt; &gt; other Subrahmanya. Much pl=\r\neased by your meritorious actions and depth of\n&gt; &gt; devotion, I have a longi=\r\nng to be born as a child to you. I will play with\n&gt; &gt; you for two years and=\r\n then my power will get infused in your heart.&quot; Janaky\n&gt; &gt; exclaimed, &quot;My L=\r\nord! You want me to plunge deep into the ocean of samsara\n&gt; &gt; (worldliness)=\r\n when my desire is to ferry across it.&quot; She argued that she\n&gt; &gt; would not b=\r\ne a good person to bring up an incarnation since she was on fire\n&gt; &gt; with r=\r\nenunciation. What if she forgot His Divinity and scolded and punished\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nim? What if she took pride that she had Subrahmanya at her beck and call;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; she would be in the depths of delusion. What if she turned to psychic po=\r\nwers\n&gt; &gt; and fell short of her goal of realization? Lastly, she begged, &quot;Le=\r\nt me be\n&gt; &gt; blessed with a Guru.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With a smile of His face, Subrahm=\r\nanya said, &quot;Am I not your Guru? Anyhow, if\n&gt; &gt; such be your wish, there is =\r\na Mahatma by name Sri Ramana Maharshi in\n&gt; &gt; Tiruvannamalai. You may go and=\r\n have His darshan.&quot; He showed Janaky a photo\n&gt; &gt; of Bhagavan Ramana that he=\r\n was carrying. It was the first time that she had\n&gt; &gt; heard about Bhagavan =\r\nSri Ramana. Saying that he would come again to discuss\n&gt; &gt; with her His des=\r\nire to be born as her child, He disappeared from sight.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Her heart t=\r\nhen surged with an intense love for Bhagavan Sri Ramana. She\n&gt; &gt; continued =\r\nwith her meditations, worship, household chores and volunteer\n&gt; &gt; work. Day=\r\n by day, Janaky could feel a number of changes happening to her\n&gt; &gt; nervous=\r\n system. Her visions continued. A severe pain developed in her spine\n&gt; &gt; an=\r\nd she became bedridden. Her nerves seemed to have been shattered and often\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the heartbeat was faint and hardly audible. In spite of all this, her m=\r\nind\n&gt; &gt; remained peaceful. Friends wanted her to be seen by specialists, bu=\r\nt the\n&gt; &gt; Doctor was sure it was not a disease to be treated medically and =\r\nthat, by\n&gt; &gt; the grace of God, she would be all right. This state continued=\r\n for forty\n&gt; &gt; days and then disappeared as mysteriously as it came.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; After a few days, a sadhu appeared before her and again asked about\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\nubrahmanya being born to her. Again she pleaded that she didn&#39;t need\n&gt; &gt; ob=\r\nstacles, but a helping hand. The sadhu assured her that, &quot;Begetting a son\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; will in no way shackle you in bondage. There will be no hindrances to yo=\r\nur\n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Janaky and the Doctor went to Sri Raman=\r\nasramam on April 20, 1935. Her long\n&gt; &gt; cherished yearning was now going to=\r\n materialize. Bhagavan was sitting in the\n&gt; &gt; meditation hall. The moment J=\r\nanaky entered the hall, the full and gracious\n&gt; &gt; look of Bhagavan fell on =\r\nher. She stood motionless, intoxicated with the\n&gt; &gt; nectar flowing through =\r\nBhagavan&#39;s eyes. Bhagavan asked her to be seated. Her\n&gt; &gt; heart swelled wit=\r\nh joy. Her mind was ready to absorb the full flow of\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan&#39;s Grace. =\r\nThroughout that night she enjoyed visions of Bhagavan\n&gt; &gt; blessing her.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; To Janaky, Bhagavan was no different from the formless Arunachaleswara=\r\n. In\n&gt; &gt; the evening hours of their departure day, Janaky knelt before Bhag=\r\navan and\n&gt; &gt; spoke to Him of her desire for liberation and Sri Subrahmanya&#39;=\r\ns decision to\n&gt; &gt; incarnate in her womb. She also revealed her experience o=\r\nf the all-pervasive\n&gt; &gt; nature of the Paramatma and awaited instructions fr=\r\nom Bhagavan as to what\n&gt; &gt; she should do next. He said, &quot;Continue doing it =\r\nin just the same way.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With the infant Swaminathan, Janaky and the =\r\nDoctor returned to Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramanasramam for the blessings of Bhagavan in Au=\r\ngust 1936. For a long time\n&gt; &gt; Janaky had been praying for her husband&#39;s sp=\r\niritual awareness to be aroused\n&gt; &gt; so that he might not, at any time, stan=\r\nd in the way of her spiritual\n&gt; &gt; progress. Bhagavan asked both the Doctor =\r\nand Janaky to come before him and\n&gt; &gt; he read aloud &quot;Upadesa Saram&quot; (Essenc=\r\ne of Instruction) and asked them to\n&gt; &gt; follow it. Janaky&#39;s heart was overf=\r\nlowing with joy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To quote from Janaky Matha&#39;s biography:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;.=\r\nFrom the moment she first came to Bhagavan Sri Ramana, He was her all.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nShe reasoned, &#39;There is only one thing in the world worth achieving: the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; root cause of the whole universe, the &#39;One Without a Second&#39;. I must atta=\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; it, realize it and experience it with Bhagavan&#39;s Grace.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Phy=\r\nsically and mentally drained by her spiritual experiences, Janaky sought\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Bhagavan&#39;s help in October 1936. At an opportune moment, she prostrated\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; before Bhagavan and poured out her heart to him. She told of her spiritu=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; experiences and begged for his protection and the removal of obstacl=\r\nes in\n&gt; &gt; her quest for Liberation. She also expressed her fear of becoming=\r\n deranged\n&gt; &gt; because she had no Guru to guide her. Bhagavan replied: &quot;Who =\r\ntold you that\n&gt; &gt; you have no Guru? Don&#39;t get disheartened. I am here as yo=\r\nur Guru; nothing\n&gt; &gt; will upset your mind.&quot; With that assurance, she transf=\r\nerred all her cares\n&gt; &gt; and worries to Bhagavan Ramana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; About a yea=\r\nr later, Janaky felt something like a forceful explosion at the\n&gt; &gt; back of=\r\n her head and powerful currents throughout her spinal cord. She did\n&gt; &gt; not=\r\n think her physical body could withstand it. She said to herself, &#39;Let\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthings take their own course. The grace of the Guru will do what is right\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and good for me.&#39; This state continued for twenty-six days after which s=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; asked the Doctor to take her to Sri Ramanasramam. He was reluctant a=\r\nt first\n&gt; &gt; due to her evident weakness, but allowed himself to be persuade=\r\nd. Sri\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan&#39;s full glance of grace poured forth blessings and stren=\r\ngth on her.\n&gt; &gt; Even before Janaky had informed Bhagavan of her experiences=\r\n, he spoke to her\n&gt; &gt; about a similar experience he had had in his early da=\r\nys: &quot;Look here. Don&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; get frightened. One day while I was lying in bed =\r\nI felt as if I had been\n&gt; &gt; bombed from inside at the back of my head.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; The young Swaminathan, who had just completed his second year, said to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Janaky in a sweet, childish voice, &quot;Mother, see here! That Bhagavan we=\r\n saw\n&gt; &gt; there in Tiruvannamalai is always standing near you. He follows yo=\r\nu wherever\n&gt; &gt; you go.&quot; These words were a source of great consolation and =\r\njoy as Janaky\n&gt; &gt; continued to feel the protecting grace of Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; It was January of 1938 when Janaky&#39;s body became rigid from her toes\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n upward. She thought she was nearing her end. Her mind withdrew into Sri\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Ramana in the heart. She had many visions and experiences, but the one th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; crowned all others was the experience of the dynamic force or Sakti\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ascending and embracing the Supreme Self. The kundalini continued to pu=\r\nsh\n&gt; &gt; upwards and tried to break through the spot in the top of her head. =\r\nJanaky\n&gt; &gt; cried out, &quot;What are you trying to do? Bhagavan Sri Ramana and I=\r\n are\n&gt; &gt; inseparable! Against the downpour of the Guru&#39;s Grace, you can do =\r\nme no\n&gt; &gt; harm.&quot; With this, the force stopped its attempts and bodily feeli=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; returned. She told the Doctor that she had at last been set free fro=\r\nm the\n&gt; &gt; rounds of birth and death and had attained her long cherished goa=\r\nl. The\n&gt; &gt; purpose of her earthly life was fulfilled. By the grace of Bhaga=\r\nvan Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramana, Janaky became a Jivanmukta (liberated soul) at thirty-t=\r\nwo years of\n&gt; &gt; age.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Janaky had travelled between Ramanasramam and =\r\nher home whenever she felt\n&gt; &gt; the need to be near Bhagavan, but on January=\r\n 18, 1938, while visiting\n&gt; &gt; Ramanasramam, she did not feel like continuin=\r\ng in family life. Doctor was\n&gt; &gt; upset and felt as if he had now lost his s=\r\necond wife. The younger children\n&gt; &gt; were grief-stricken. Their appeals and=\r\n tears did not dissuade her as she was\n&gt; &gt; revelling in a glorious spiritua=\r\nl realm. Then, the next morning, she\n&gt; &gt; remembered the promise she had mad=\r\ne to Bhagavan to remain in the family for\n&gt; &gt; five more years. She immediat=\r\nely said she would go back with them to\n&gt; &gt; Kakinada. Bhagavan gazed at her=\r\n and said, &quot;Did I ask you to become a\n&gt; &gt; sannyasini? Look at me. I have no=\r\nt taken sannyasa and do not wear the ochre\n&gt; &gt; cloth. You have only one fam=\r\nily, but I have to shoulder the burden of all\n&gt; &gt; these devotees and their =\r\nfamilies.&quot; She knew then that renunciation must be\n&gt; &gt; in the heart.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Janaky was wondering why she should be having so many visions and\n&gt; &gt; exp=\r\neriences when her only desire was to be free from the cycle of birth and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; death. Bhagavan gently said, &quot;Can one get this for the mere asking? It se=\r\neks\n&gt; &gt; the heart where it wants to shine.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As the Doctor and Janak=\r\ny were preparing to leave, Bhagavan told the Doctor,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;You doctors say t=\r\nhat the heart is at the left side of the chest. But the\n&gt; &gt; whole body is t=\r\nhe heart for yogis. Jnanis have their hearts both within and\n&gt; &gt; without.&quot; =\r\nHe then gazed at Janaky and again assured her: &quot;I am always with\n&gt; &gt; you.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan was her All. She desired only to contemplate the Holy Feet=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan. In the months and years that followed, devotees were draw=\r\nn to\n&gt; &gt; Janaky as bees to honey. She began to be addressed as Sri Matha. S=\r\nhe took a\n&gt; &gt; few of them to Sri Ramanasramam and said to Bhagavan, &quot;All th=\r\nese people seek\n&gt; &gt; me as their Guru.I have never wished to be a Guru. I wo=\r\nuld request Bhagavan,\n&gt; &gt; in all humility, to kindly accept these devotees =\r\nas Bhagavan&#39;s disciples.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan said, &quot;When you are above likes =\r\nand dislikes, desires and\n&gt; &gt; aversions, let things take their own shape. T=\r\no the extent they believe in\n&gt; &gt; you, they will reap results. I will protec=\r\nt those who, with full faith,\n&gt; &gt; trust in you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another incident t=\r\nhat happened at Ramanasramam occurred when an oil lamp\n&gt; &gt; went out and the=\r\n hall was in darkness for a few minutes. When the light came\n&gt; &gt; back, thre=\r\ne-year-old Swaminathan exclaimed, &quot;The light failed and Bhagavan\n&gt; &gt; was no=\r\nt visible; the light came back and Bhagavan is seen!&quot; Bhagavan turned\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\no the boy and said, &quot;What you say is precisely correct. When there is\n&gt; &gt; a=\r\njnana (ignorance), God is not realized. With the dawn of jnana (wisdom), He=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; is seen.&quot; As it was Bhagavan who gave Sri Matha her light of wisdom, s=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; decided to pay for the electrification of the Ashram.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even a=\r\nfter realization, Sri Matha carried on with her domestic and social\n&gt; &gt; act=\r\nivities. She was elected President of the Child Welfare Centre and Vice\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n President of the Ladies&#39; Club. She performed all her actions for God&#39;s sak=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; in a supremely detached manner. With equanimity of mind, she saw the =\r\nLord in\n&gt; &gt; all of the world.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To some people she would advise, &quot;Lea=\r\nd a righteous life and discharge your\n&gt; &gt; duties to the family, conduct fam=\r\nily worship, practise charity, have an\n&gt; &gt; abundant life and learn to gradu=\r\nally still the waves of passion.&quot; To others\n&gt; &gt; who wanted to know more abo=\r\nut Liberation, she taught, &quot;Always nurture Divine\n&gt; &gt; thoughts, obliterate =\r\nlikes and passions and surrender to the Guru.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There were times whe=\r\nn Sri Matha was lost in samadhi, oblivious to her\n&gt; &gt; surroundings. Food ha=\r\nd to be forced into her mouth for sustenance and she\n&gt; &gt; had to be bathed b=\r\ny others, as she was oblivious of her body. At other times\n&gt; &gt; she attended=\r\n to her routine work and concealed her exalted state.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After the mar=\r\nriage of her daughter, Sarada, Sri Matha was making final\n&gt; &gt; arrangements =\r\nfor a permanent stay at Sri Ramanasramam. After bowing before\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan,=\r\n the ten-year-old Swaminathan poured out his sorrow, weeping\n&gt; &gt; bitterly a=\r\nnd rolling on the ground. He sobbed, &quot;Pray give us back my mother\n&gt; &gt; and o=\r\nrder her to come with us to Thanjavur.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan, with a voice chok=\r\ned with emotion said to Sri Matha, &quot;What can I\n&gt; &gt; do?&quot; Then turning to Swa=\r\nminathan said affectionately, &quot;Take your mother and\n&gt; &gt; go back to Thanjavu=\r\nr.&quot; Sri Matha submitted to Bhagavan&#39;s request and\n&gt; &gt; returned with the Doc=\r\ntor, Swaminathan and the three-year-old Ramachandran.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At Sri Matha&#39;=\r\ns request the southern portion of the family house remain as\n&gt; &gt; an ashram =\r\nand spiritual centre with Sri Bhagavan as the Sadguru. The main\n&gt; &gt; objecti=\r\nve of the centre is to spread the teachings of Bhagavan Ramana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mom=\r\nents before her passing away, in April 1969, devotees and relatives\n&gt; &gt; cha=\r\nnted Bhagavan&#39;s hymn Aksharamanamalai, with the refrain of &quot;Arunachala\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nShiva, Arunachala Shiva.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Matha&#39;s life stands as a shining exam=\r\nple of perseverance to the ideal\n&gt; &gt; of Liberation and devotion to Bhagavan=\r\n Ramana. Once, when some of her\n&gt; &gt; devotees were having a lengthy discussi=\r\non of Bhagavan&#39;s &#39;Who am I?&#39; enquiry,\n&gt; &gt; she halted them saying, &quot;Enough o=\r\nf this discussion! My head begins to swim\n&gt; &gt; with such dry and useless dis=\r\ncussions. Amma knows only one thing - to show\n&gt; &gt; devotion to Sri Bhagavan.=\r\n&quot; It was through such steadfast devotion that Sri\n&gt; &gt; Matha achieved Libera=\r\ntion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;A Realized Soul who knows the truth is aware of the fact tha=\r\nt he is not\n&gt; &gt; the body. But there is one thing more. Unless one looks upo=\r\nn death as a\n&gt; &gt; thing that is very near and might happen at any moment, on=\r\ne will not be\n&gt; &gt; aware of the Self. This means that the ego must die, must=\r\n vanish, along with\n&gt; &gt; the inherent vasanas.&quot; - Letters from Sri Ramanasra=\r\nmam\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Source: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2006/?pg=3Dmay-ju=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --\n&gt; &gt; =E0=B0&quot;=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =\r\n =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n&gt; &gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=\r\n=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n&gt; &gt; =E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
