Vasishtha reveals =\r\nthe true nature\n&gt; of Rama then and \n&gt; Rama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha ha=\r\ns to finally enter the\n&gt; Sushumna nadi of \n&gt; Rama to disturb his samadhi an=\r\nd bring him back to senses.\n&gt; After that, Rama \n&gt; knows who he is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ram=\r\na and Krishna were both avataras of Vishnu. Krishna knew\n&gt; it from the \n&gt; b=\r\neginning. In the case of Rama, sages like Vasishtha,\n&gt; Vishwamitra knew it =\r\n\n&gt; even before Rama&#39;s birth, but Rama himself did not know it\n&gt; in the begi=\r\nnning. \n&gt; But he too knew it later.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Krishna had complete mast=\r\nery over the duality,\n&gt; while Rama did not. \n&gt; Rama had to wade the dual wo=\r\nrld like normal people. Krishna\n&gt; could do any \n&gt; manipulation of the dual =\r\nworld that he wanted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 03, 2009 3:45 AM\n&gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Rama as God\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In a discussion w=\r\nith another very learned individual,\n&gt; I was told this \n&gt; &gt; following state=\r\nment:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Valmiki had projected Ram as a person who tried his\n&gt; level =\r\nbest to live by \n&gt; &gt; principles.
