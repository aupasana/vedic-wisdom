It \nall boils down to\n&gt;           the amount of fire that =\r\nis present in the homa kunda. If \nthere is good\n&gt;           amount of fire,=\r\n even if you do not offer ghee, offering \nmarmara , havan\n&gt;           samag=\r\nri etc will be easily consumed. But if the fire is \nsmall, then you\n&gt;      =\r\n     do need to offer ghee drops to keep the fire alive.\n&gt;           There =\r\nwere days when I used about 8-10 coconut halves for \n1\n&gt;           chandi h=\r\nomam, ie started with 2 pieces of 1 coconut half, \nadding half\n&gt;           =\r\npiece of coconut half for each chapter and finally a \npiece for\n&gt;          =\r\n purnahuti. Now, I am able to manage 1 chandi homa with \nabout 2-3 coconut\n=\r\n&gt;           halves. Others out there might be able to do with much \nless. I=\r\nt also\n&gt;           depends on the coconut pieces itself, some pieces burn \n=\r\nslow and some\n&gt;           fast, so the quantity you may need may vary.\n&gt;   =\r\n        Most importantly I suggest you follow an important advice \nof\n&gt;    =\r\n       Narasimhaji. Pouring ghee drops around the corners of the \ncoconut p=\r\niece,\n&gt;           making sure the piece catches fire from all the corners. =\r\n\nDoing this way,\n&gt;           at the end of the homa, all the coconut pieces=\r\n are \ncompletely burnt,\n&gt;           almost like powder.\n&gt;           So, my =\r\nsuggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings \nat your\n&gt;           dispo=\r\nsal, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does \nnot matter). \n&gt;       =\r\n    Make sure the offerings that you put with each swaha \n(sloka) catch fir=\r\ne.\n&gt;           Hold your offerings ie havan samagri, marmara, poha etc \njoi=\r\nning your\n&gt;           ring finger, middle finger and thumb. This way, you w=\r\nill \nbe offering\n&gt;           decent amount with each swaha.\n&gt;           Lik=\r\ne Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, \nblack and\n&gt;          =\r\n white sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and \nused the\n&gt;       =\r\n    combination as offering.\n&gt;           I am sure within first few days of=\r\n your homa, you will \nhave very\n&gt;           good idea of how much ghee and =\r\nother offerings you need \nto make.\n&gt; \n&gt;           All the Best.\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n    Ravi\n&gt; \n&gt;           --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHO=\r\nSLA&quot;\n&gt;           &lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;           &gt;\n&gt;           &gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&gt;           &gt; khoslad=\r\nheeraj@ wrote:\n&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and othe=\r\nrs,\n&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; I want to do homam for chandi devi.I\n&gt; =\r\n          &gt; &gt; had arranged a copper tray in square shape.Almost 1 \nfeet by =\r\n1\n&gt;           &gt; feet.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; So is it good measurement or not ?
