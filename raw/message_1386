It takes a lifetime to ma=\r\nster this. \n \nSome may be fascinated by the texture, color and volume of th=\r\ne chaff and miss the grain.\n \nMost people who talk about mantra shastra foc=\r\nus on the chaff and not on the grain.\n \n&gt; You talk of begging God vs comman=\r\nding God? Now where did that come from?\n&gt; How is it related to what is unde=\r\nr discussion. Perhaps I have missed many\n&gt; mails and am not able to get the=\r\n context. Trying to command God is\n&gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable t=\r\no say the least. The attitude should\n&gt; always be that of a beggar in front =\r\nof God. If anyone has said otherwise, I\n&gt; also disagee with him/her.\n \nI me=\r\nntioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mantras and tech=\r\nnicalities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be a beggar wh=\r\no will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras an=\r\nd all the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of mantras and umpteen te=\r\nchnicalities are for commanding thousands of different results from god. Th=\r\nat is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works=\r\n slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.\n \nAlso, comma=\r\nnding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, w=\r\nhich can be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually an=\r\nd suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as god=\r\ns is possible only for a spiritually elevated person with no or extremely s=\r\nmall ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achieve=\r\nment. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in com=\r\npletely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat =\r\nsomething from the previous mail to clarify:\n \nThe universe has many lokas =\r\n(planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite=\r\n karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite=\r\n possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill=\r\n it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mi=\r\nnd constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of=\r\n self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of e=\r\nnergy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes =\r\ncorresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding karmic int=\r\neractions between various objects.\n \nEach set of &quot;karmic interactions betwe=\r\nen various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results=\r\n&quot;. One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a spec=\r\nific result from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the=\r\n term or not, it is essentially that.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBut the botto=\r\nmline is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command s=\r\npecific results from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but=\r\n acting as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set b=\r\ny Nature). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by r=\r\nishis are meant for such sadhakas.\n \nThose are hardly of use to so many peo=\r\nple out there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot=\r\n command specific results from god (because of their heavy attachment to th=\r\ne result, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), e=\r\nven if they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated=\r\n rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalitie=\r\ns, they will be better off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n \nJus=\r\nt pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worr=\r\nying about so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to =\r\nthe Lord. Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, =\r\ntake whatever and whenever he gives.\n \nKeep praying every day or every seco=\r\nnd when you are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all=\r\n of your actions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell your=\r\nself that it is his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the=\r\n time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing =\r\nof attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra,=\r\n right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge com=\r\ning from questionable sources!).\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere may be a mou=\r\nntain with thousands of paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead =\r\nto a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a different =\r\nscenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a speci=\r\nfic path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is us=\r\neless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego=\r\n). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy=\r\n, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person wit=\r\nh very little ego).\n \nEven when you encounter a person who has legs and can=\r\n actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the moun=\r\ntain and traverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrol=\r\nogers who are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take cus=\r\ntomized mantra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a resul=\r\nt quickly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The =\r\npower of a powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obt=\r\nained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra=\r\n is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view show=\r\ns a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have =\r\nto survive the climb along the long path.\n \nWe need to emphasize the attitu=\r\nde and approach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choi=\r\nce of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great sp=\r\niritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize pick=\r\ning the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized havin=\r\ng the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persist=\r\nence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and usefu=\r\nl than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impres=\r\ns god.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; when should the worship of a graha be done=\r\n? Let us say someone\n&gt; wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you =\r\nthink this\n&gt; worship should be done?\n \nYou can do anyday. Parasara does not=\r\n mention any day for doing homam to a graha.\n \nIn fact, if one wants, one c=\r\nan do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every day. It is even bett=\r\ner that way.\n \nIf an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is fine.=\r\n But saying that doing it on so and so day will bring serious dangers becau=\r\nse Mars is an enemy of so and so planet would be stretching things.\n \n&gt; [Sa=\r\nnjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his\n&gt; k=\r\nnowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did they get it f=\r\nrom?\n \nFrom Self - from within. That is the source of all knowledge. A sadg=\r\nuru need not specifically teach thousand things, but needs to open the door=\r\n inside.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; OK, just spell it out. What is the reaso=\r\nn for Gandanta being in 0 deg,\n&gt; 120 deg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is=\r\n not a junction between agni\n&gt; and jala...I want to her your words if you h=\r\nave any.\n \nParasara&#39;s definition of gandanta is restricted to two neighbori=\r\nng areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of fire and water elem=\r\nents. &quot;I see fire and I see water. So there is gandanta&quot; is a wrong approac=\r\nh. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars,=\r\n a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *t=\r\nransition* in a contiguous space.\n \nIn your example of upapada lord&#39;s tithi=\r\n, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition.\n \n&gt; =\r\nNow somewhere you talked of wasting time!!! Look what you are doing.\n&gt; You =\r\nwere asked to work on Parashara by your Spiritual Master, and\n&gt; are you doi=\r\nng that? Me10, Ve7, Ve6...good research but is that from\n&gt; Parashara? \n \nWe=\r\nll, Me10, Ve7 etc theory is based on marrying two different teachings of Pa=\r\nrasara (bhava karakas and special lagnas). I do not really consider it as m=\r\ny creation but as understanding Parasara&#39;s teachings only.\n \nBest regards,\n=\r\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri =\r\nTarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannat=\r\nh.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n =\r\n\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sjrath@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; om p=\r\naramesthi gurave namah\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; I read this mail twice. OK=\r\n, just spell it out. What is the reason for Gandanta being in 0 deg, 120 de=\r\ng and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is not a junction between agni and jala..=\r\n.I want to her your words if you have any. You keep saying Parasara says so=\r\n and yet there is nothing forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rashi is associated with th=\r\ne Aditya as the rashi come into existence because of the Sun, which is the =\r\nagni tattva. Vara is also agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That=\r\n is why Vaara is related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the vaara of t=\r\nhe lords of the rashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi related to a bh=\r\naava and for this reason, fasting and other such karma related to rashi are=\r\n also based on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n&gt; \n&gt; Moon is the sign=\r\nificator of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya =\r\nmanifestation of everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fatho=\r\nm the karma associated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means =\r\nof self punishment and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha i=\r\ns. Just as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara re=\r\nlated to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the suf=\r\nfering in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* con=\r\ntent has not been addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs =\r\nand people find their partners, get married and get along with life. Proof =\r\nlies in the pudding and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL d=\r\nays and have got result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced.=\r\n Why fast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated wi=\r\nth the raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related to the material=\r\n effects of the bhava and that is what people are looking for when they com=\r\ne to th astrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men s=\r\nhould worship a female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the U=\r\nL fasting. I wonder if they really follow this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not give fasting a=\r\nt night instead of day? Sun is always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) an=\r\nd that is why we have limited this to day fasting and not night fasting as =\r\nwell or 24 hour fast. This is my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders woul=\r\nd have given long periods of fast starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 =\r\ndays fast for the birth of child! You think I should be doing that! You thi=\r\nnk anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself before asking me to advise those har=\r\nd penance kind of fasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the =\r\narudha. It is the sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when they are look=\r\ning for getting married and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolo=\r\nnging marriage. Either they want to get into one or get out of one and into=\r\n another...astrologers these days are relegated to helping people make thes=\r\ne transitions painless and fast. Of course some have come and I have not fa=\r\niled them. I have a ready shloka for this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C start fr=\r\nom Taurus in Hamsa gati:\n&gt; \n&gt; Gouri, Kaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Durga, Kanti, Sar=\r\naswati\n&gt; \n&gt; Mangalaa, Vaishnavi, Lakshmi, Shivaa, Naraayani\n&gt; \n&gt; See I have=\r\n them ready for the 12 signs in Hamsa Gati from the mool trikona of Moon in=\r\n hamsa gati\n&gt; \n&gt; Mantra Shastra is a very detailed work and includes mantra=\r\n dosha etc. It is very scientific and accurate. It takes a lifetime to mast=\r\ner this. \n&gt; \n&gt; You talk of begging God vs commanding God? Now where did tha=\r\nt come from? How is it related to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have =\r\nmissed many mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to command God=\r\n is *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the least. The attitude sho=\r\nuld always be that of a beggar in front of God. If anyone has said otherwis=\r\ne, I also disagee with him/her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prasiddha mantras always give result, =\r\neven without initiation and who knows how ready a person is for initation. =\r\nSo I prefer sticking to prasiddha mantras with people who do not have initi=\r\nations.

His section on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not d=\r\nismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly=\r\n preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n[Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you gone through the Navagraha =\r\nmantras given in the Garuda Purana and other puranic literature?\n&gt; \n&gt; Paras=\r\nara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. pl=\r\nanetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dos=\r\nha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and =\r\nthe deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya dosha is to be performed on Amavasya, when =\r\nshould the worship of a graha be done? Let us say someone wishes to worship=\r\n Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this worship should be done?\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nThus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay=\r\n Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his knowled=\r\nge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did they get it from?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning compli=\r\ncated principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis and scar=\r\ning people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days caus=\r\ne &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on ho=\r\nroscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. The=\r\nre may be a little difference between doing an austerity on different days,=\r\n but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doin=\r\ng and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause da=\r\nnger as being suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I missed the conte=\r\nxt and just saw some mails that were forwarded to me amidst my writing. But=\r\n them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in that many many have benefi=\r\ntted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, our shastras primarily talk=\r\n about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the energy of =\r\nthe *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or n=\r\nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irrespective=\r\n of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out=\r\n with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better o=\r\nff going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is more im=\r\nportant.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s not right...at l=\r\neast people who read this will think. Let=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s say Shiv=\r\na worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the Sun and is not w=\r\norshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C a day af=\r\nter Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devata of Mercury and is wo=\r\nrshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C =\r\nagain a day after! So what happened to the energy equation? J\n&gt; \n&gt; Choosing=\r\n the day of a remedy based on the deity is more important and the variation=\r\ns based on individual horoscope are less important. I am not saying there a=\r\nre no horoscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I =\r\nquestion if they are actually well-understood by astrologers today to apply=\r\n *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable princi=\r\nples of questionable origin and scaring people on that basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay =\r\nRath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood even the basics of S=\r\nanatana dharma! Some behave as if there is a battle going on between Shiva =\r\nand Vishnu =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C it=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s hilarious t=\r\no see how these are just attempts to convert Hinduism into a religion they =\r\nhave left rather than trying to learn what Hinduism means. Being newly conv=\r\nerted there is a bellicose patriotism in them to prove their faith to the *=\r\nnew god* they have found and every other God must be the devil in disguise!=\r\n! It will take years for many to learn that there is no devil. It=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=84=A2s a figment of their imagination and whatever is devilish is=\r\n the dark side of mankind himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Statemen=\r\nt 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; and th=\r\ne Rishi=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=A2=E2=80=9E=C2=A2s were wasting=\r\n time in giving so many mantras for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the same devata, like say thousa=\r\nnds of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; when any one mantra would suffi=\r\nce.

I got into this thread because statements =\r\nwere made that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart can caus=\r\ne &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot; and &quot;danger to spouse&quot;, based on the=\r\nse far-fetched extrapolations of gandanta.\n\n&gt; Which is perfectly in line wi=\r\nth everything I have learnt.\n\nWell, you once taught that houses represent S=\r\nun/Shiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meanin=\r\ngful. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a hous=\r\ne, with Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is re=\r\nally in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).\n\nBTW, I specific=\r\nally asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your own thinki=\r\nng or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full context).=\r\n Like so many times with similar questions I asked privately and recently p=\r\nublicly, you did not respond.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Statement 1 is an arr=\r\nogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus\n&gt; and has no relevance as =\r\nthe remedial measures prescribed by\n&gt; Parasara and others to be done on spe=\r\ncific days are irrlevant and\n&gt; not of much consequence.\n\nFirst of all, Para=\r\nsara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis based on an=\r\ny arudhas or houses in a chart.\n\nFor doshas in birth chart or to get relief=\r\n from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings of planets, he suggeste=\r\nd various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to perform them. His sec=\r\ntion on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not dismissing tho=\r\nse remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly preparing ma=\r\nnuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.\n\nParasara did *not=\r\n* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homa=\r\ns). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola =\r\ndosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. B=\r\nut the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.\n\nThus, the p=\r\nrinciples I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n\nSecond, I said what I =\r\nsaid in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated principles that are =\r\nnot found in classics or works of rishis and scaring people that performing=\r\n austerities such as fasting on certain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;s=\r\nerious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I find these prin=\r\nciples illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may be a little differe=\r\nnce between doing an austerity on different days, but my point is that it i=\r\ns smaller compared to the difference between doing and not doing at all and=\r\n that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause danger as being suggested.\n\n=\r\nThird, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping various deities on var=\r\nious days, based on the energy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain de=\r\nity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better than others. This is b=\r\nased on the deity and irrespective of the person worshipping. Let me give a=\r\nn analogy. If a rich man comes out with more money to give to beggars on a =\r\nspecific day, a beggar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedul=\r\ne and mood of the giver is more important.\n\nChoosing the day of a remedy ba=\r\nsed on the deity is more important and the variations based on individual h=\r\noroscope are less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variat=\r\nions. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are ac=\r\ntually well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question=\r\n over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable or=\r\nigin and scaring people on that basis.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Statement 2 =\r\nis an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless\n&gt; and the Rishi=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for\n&gt;=\r\n the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman\n&gt; whe=\r\nn any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can\n&gt; take par=\r\nacetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to\n&gt; write a boo=\r\nk on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic\n&gt; seers.\n\nI did =\r\nnot say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is l=\r\nimited and we should take our limitations into consideration.\n\nThe universe=\r\n has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects. Th=\r\nere are infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, th=\r\nere are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control th=\r\ne mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverbe=\r\nrating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfe=\r\nct absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes =\r\nby the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) =\r\nand that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and correspo=\r\nnding karmic interactions between various objects.\n\nHowever, this variety o=\r\nf mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not have s=\r\nuch perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It =\r\nis relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hence =\r\ncontrol over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare today=\r\n. Most people are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do not work f=\r\nor them as they are supposed to.\n\n*        *        *\n\nJust repeating a com=\r\nbination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may think that =\r\ncertain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of times. Tha=\r\nt is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickly and anot=\r\nher may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption=\r\n of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to really work and=\r\n it is much more difficult than one may think.\n\n*        *        *\n\nA high=\r\nly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to command the king a=\r\nnd get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is better off begging =\r\nthe king, rather than trying to command (and failing for sure).\n\nSimilarly,=\r\n most people are better off begging god for what they want rather than tryi=\r\nng to use the right mantra to command what they want. A beggar does not nee=\r\nd a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility =\r\nand helplessness, surrender, patience and persistence are what help a begga=\r\nr succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this=\r\n age and time, best bet for most people is to learn to be a good beggar at =\r\ngod&#39;s door.\n\nWhat people today need for material and spiritual progress thr=\r\nough remedial measures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a be=\r\ntter choice of tools such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, t=\r\nithi etc to command a specific result from god.\n\nIt is worth noting that so=\r\n many great spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not =\r\nemphasize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they em=\r\nphasized having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, pat=\r\nience, persistence, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more importan=\r\nt and useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc=\r\n and impress god.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOne more thing. We have many mantra=\r\ns given by rishis, but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to p=\r\nick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do =\r\nnot operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming =\r\nfrom various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection=\r\n. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irrespect=\r\nive of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th =\r\nlord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt=\r\n control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrolog=\r\ners, way beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n\nIf one has a sadguru, =\r\nI recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology =\r\ntheoretician.\n\nIf not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path. Pi=\r\nck any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) inst=\r\nead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter is t=\r\nhe key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. Choic=\r\ne of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in being a=\r\n really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great scho=\r\nlars.\n\nAny prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari,=\r\n navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipa=\r\nth, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can help one make pr=\r\nogress if one develops the right attitude. Without the right attitude, even=\r\n an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI hope=\r\n this sufficiently clarifies my stand. I discuss these matters related to s=\r\npiritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.

Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.=\r\n\n\n  Two statements you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and M=\r\nantra Shastra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well out her=\r\ne -\n\n  1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as=\r\n the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results m=\r\naybe a bit delayed but will be there.\n  2. Statement 2: *reciting any praye=\r\nr* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy\n\n  Is th=\r\nis what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?\n\n  Statement 1 is an a=\r\nrrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no relevance as =\r\nthe remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be done on speci=\r\nfic days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sounds like anothe=\r\nr astrologer I had known some time back whose statements like this coerced =\r\nme to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misled but s=\r\nuch pretexts to knowledge.\n\n  Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire m=\r\nantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wastin=\r\ng time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, like say thousands of=\r\n mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is =\r\nlike saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I t=\r\nhink I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings=\r\n of the vedic seers.\n\n  I think there is something wrong in the way you are=\r\n saying what you want to say. Please rethink and correct your statements fo=\r\nr the sake of good record in this list.\n\n  With Warm Regards\n  Sanjay Rath\n=\r\n  http://srath.com http://sohamsa.com http://srijagannath.org\n  15B Gangara=\r\nm Hospital Road, New Delhi, 110060, India\n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\n  From: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao \n  To: sohamsa@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday=\r\n, February 08, 2009 12:03 PM\n  Subject: Re: ALTERNATIVE TO UPAPADA FASTING\n=\r\n\n\n  Namaste Sanjay and friends,\n\n  My answers are in red and prefixed with =\r\n&quot;[Narasimha]&quot;.\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic poin=\r\nt is that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If=\r\n you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bring=\r\ning the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse ma=\r\ny come into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Why does a rashi ca=\r\nrry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi r=\r\nepresent vaara or fire?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created=\r\n by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...=\r\nNarasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; After all, Rudra rules=\r\n over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and one=\r\n worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the kar=\r\naka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by =\r\nwater element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (p=\r\nrosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that f=\r\nasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire=\r\n element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n =\r\n &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Nar=\r\nasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother G=\r\nouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are=\r\n created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tith=\r\ni lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quo=\r\nte &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented =\r\nby Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n\n  Thus, 12th house=\r\n is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of maya.=\r\n Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (=\r\nand not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be associat=\r\ned with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod =\r\nmethod in dasa judgment.\n\n  Thus, it is actually more logical to say that 1=\r\n2th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord im=\r\nbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n\n  Is the above &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based=\r\n on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradition?\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; =\r\nBegin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s=\r\n fasting is far more effective than at other times. The conservation of ene=\r\nrgy otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective m=\r\nantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to=\r\n maximize the effect of the mantra.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree =\r\nwith this. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On=\r\n days when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to =\r\nburn and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara)=\r\n is many many times better than complete fasting.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to expend s=\r\nome energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the mantra. B=\r\nut the bottomline is that shastras say that one should meditate either with=\r\nout or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope w=\r\ne agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are heavily restrained =\r\nin effectiveness.\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; Seriously, however, thi=\r\ns kind of stretching of gandanta concepts is quite illogical.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [San=\r\njay Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burnin=\r\ng match in a glass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra gan=\r\nda between Kanya and Tula.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha] Puttin=\r\ng a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fire. But the questi=\r\non is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in wat=\r\ner, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.\n\n  My point is that the=\r\n examples given have no real identifiable contact between water and fire.\n\n=\r\n  One can be creative and come up with a lot of theories. For example, one =\r\ncan say that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva =\r\n(then why are some rasis marked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) =\r\nand hence the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause contact between water a=\r\nnd fire. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moo=\r\nn and Venus causes gandanta and serious danger.\n\n  It is not enough to show=\r\n some fire and some water. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will =\r\nengage in illogical extrapolations.\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; Three=\r\n years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two =\r\nyears back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getti=\r\nng very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is =\r\nPERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different levels =\r\nof their understanding and intelligence. \n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Na=\r\nrasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be taken away. And one =\r\ncannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when it seems like somet=\r\nhing comes and cry when it seems like something leaves. Some impassionately=\r\n observe as things seem to come and go and do what they see as their dharma=\r\n with the things they seem to have.\n\n  Just a factual correction though: I =\r\nnever said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after my spiritual master=\r\n entered my life, my interest in other things went down (though I continued=\r\n to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensified. So I sa=\r\nid that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru gave me a tas=\r\nk later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasara independently, med=\r\nitate on them and share my interpretations with the world. He said I was ve=\r\nry passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and he wanted me to do the =\r\nsame now but dispassionately and without an attachment. He felt that I stil=\r\nl have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me to do it as an unatta=\r\nched karma. His word is everything for me.\n\n  What I told you recently is n=\r\not that I was leaving Jyotish but what I said above.\n\n  However, if your ju=\r\ndgment is correct and if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiri=\r\ntual guru will realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.\n\n  =\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; I can categorically declare one thing with u=\r\ntmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or d=\r\no mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a =\r\nparticular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep t=\r\nhat practice for a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) fo=\r\nr a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If br=\r\nahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like=\r\n it!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you seem to=\r\n be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not much=\r\n relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually beneficial. F=\r\nor example, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and should=\r\n choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the sam=\r\ne) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days,=\r\n or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did =\r\nnot say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you are w=\r\nrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  =\r\n[Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n\n  Is all that is being taught an=\r\nd practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the seers&quot;?\n\n=\r\n  I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, there is some =\r\ndifference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n\n  To make khoa, whet=\r\nher one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a black cow=\r\n or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some difference. But it is second=\r\nary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see the quoted mails for su=\r\nch claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say that a wrong ch=\r\noice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross exaggeration.\n\n=\r\n  The main thing is that you need milk and sugar. If one is confused by end=\r\nless claims of khoa making consultants and ends up not making khoa at all, =\r\nthat will be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick some milk or the othe=\r\nr, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take an extra half hour, but =\r\nthe job will be done.\n\n  I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humb=\r\nly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fas=\r\nting on a specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;ser=\r\nious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and =\r\ndismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importance from us does not h=\r\nelp our cause!\n\n  Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversell it or ov=\r\nerplay the importance...\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; Gem stones may h=\r\narm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vr=\r\nata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your body can take fast=\r\ning, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too many calculations.\n =\r\n &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya is good for someone planning to have a =\r\nbaby or one who cannot conceive and this is kept for some period before the=\r\n appointed date of nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you=\r\n are mistaking abstinence from physical union as Brahmacharya.

It is funny that I shoul=\r\nd be typing this email on an Ekadashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irresp=\r\nective of their horoscopes.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I write on dvadasi when=\r\n so many vasihnava also fast and keep great austerities. J Any difference?\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the question raised. 2nd bhav=\r\na is\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day of =\r\nUL in\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu who provides the food f=\r\nor us.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my disagreement.\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to Vishnu. Self-depriva=\r\ntion of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or speech (mouna vrata - v=\r\now of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or speech is not an insult t=\r\no Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is not an insult to Sukr=\r\nacharya (Venus).\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though Brahma was very angry tha=\r\nt his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed celibate. So He created o=\r\nthers. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remained celibate? Why should Suk=\r\nracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is it an insult or not an ins=\r\nult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signification of Venus for 7H ...=\r\nand linking this to creation process...which is wrong Narasimha. Brahma is =\r\nseen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna or 7th which is....you k=\r\nnow this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th house as it is necessary for p=\r\nrocreation. It is only the link of this with the Brahma graha that causes i=\r\nt to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people are as eligible for moksha =\r\nas unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on the following of dharma and =\r\nashrama.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Various gods bestow various things on us, some at the gro=\r\nss physical level and some at the subtle spiritual level. As we overcome ou=\r\nr dependendency on gross things, we make progress at the subtle level.\n  &gt; =\r\n\n  &gt; If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal =\r\nenergy associated with it) is used for digesting it and for generating phys=\r\nical energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused and availab=\r\nle for other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result, one can bet=\r\nter digest mantras and spiritual food available all around one.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Th=\r\ne mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effec=\r\ntive than at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on dig=\r\nestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast =\r\nor keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of th=\r\ne mantra.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating =\r\nis the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the m=\r\nind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this di=\r\nsturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better=\r\n than complete fasting.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not hea=\r\nrd this about 2nd lord and\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada =\r\nis a rashi and carries energy\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the d=\r\nay ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energ=\r\ny to vara, and gandanta may\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a dang=\r\ner. So, what is the way out.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of =\r\nvaara only and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or =\r\nfire?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for =\r\ndoing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask =\r\nthis?? What is happening?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element =\r\nof fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and one worships Gouri at=\r\n the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. =\r\nSo one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by water element and =\r\nfasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity and well=\r\n-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the week=\r\nday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire element represent=\r\ned by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Ra=\r\nth:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the =\r\n12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates every=\r\nthing through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her du=\r\ne to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12=\r\nth lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Seriously, however, this =\r\nkind of stretching of gandanta concepts is quite illogical.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanja=\r\ny Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burning m=\r\natch in a glass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda =\r\nbetween Kanya and Tula.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Now one more thing: Marriage is a yoga bet=\r\nween two souls and why not suggest fasting on the yoga day of the UL lord?\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What! What a brilliant suggestion...why don=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you start it?  \n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Now suppose i=\r\nnstead of 11th house if Mercury goes to 12th house or 4 \n  &gt; &gt; house then y=\r\nou cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi for the same \n  &gt; &gt; because these th=\r\nithis are ruled by Mercury only and fasting on these \n  &gt; &gt; tithis will cre=\r\nate serious doshas.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Picking tithi based on house (12th house - Dwa=\r\ndashi, 4th house - Chaturthi) is illogical as there are 12 houses only and =\r\nmore tithis.\n  &gt; I have realized one thing over the years - If something is=\r\n not structurally sound, it is most likely false knowledge.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanja=\r\ny Rath:] J No comments\n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I can categorically declare =\r\none thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a =\r\nvow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and =\r\nmeditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take=\r\n a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say, a few mon=\r\nths or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the=\r\n duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there=\r\n is nothing like it!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but =\r\nthen you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seer=\r\ns is of not much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritual=\r\nly beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL=\r\n days and should choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all t=\r\nithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and the=\r\nn in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or mayb=\r\ne (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cann=\r\not say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If yo=\r\nu keep such a vrata sincerely, you will make positive progress towards achi=\r\neving your purpose and definitely not go backwards, irrespective of what is=\r\n said by technical calculations based on our half-baked Jyotish knowledge.\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; My friends, use the Jyotish knowledge available, bu=\r\nt do realize that it is imperfect and corrupted. Why is only the UL lord im=\r\nportant? So many planets may have so many kinds of influence on UL in a cha=\r\nrt. And UL is one of several factors showing marriage. There may be various=\r\n influences in a chart showing marriage. Is our thumb rule of using UL lord=\r\n&#39;s weekday missing some important factors? Quite possible!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay=\r\n Rath:] That is a very nasty statement. Once again you have used adjectives=\r\n (*imperfect, corrupted*) which is not becoming of you. Why must you use na=\r\nsty statements? Can=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you say things nicely? \n  &gt; \n =\r\n &gt; Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told=\r\n me two years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it =\r\nis getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyo=\r\ntish is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different=\r\n levels of their understanding and intelligence. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; If you have the =\r\ntime to listen to the Jaimini Lectures at http://sohamsa.com/js/ do so as i=\r\nt will show you the depths of this knowledge you cannot imagine exists in j=\r\nyotish. The derivation of the chnhandas and what not all. Thumb rules are m=\r\neant for beginners. The day you decided to give up jyotish, you got stuck i=\r\nn the thumb rules but then its ok with me. I always wished you the best in =\r\nwhatever you do.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; But, despite some arbitrariness and imperfection,=\r\n if a thumb rule allows you to pick an austerity with confidence and create=\r\n the mental feeling that you are doing the best possible thing for your sit=\r\nuation, it is good. After all, what is critical is to do *some* austerity t=\r\no burn the blocking karma, with a positive frame of mind about what you are=\r\n doing.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] No Narasimha, very happy marriages can happ=\r\nen, without austerities as well.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; But, if endless theorization and =\r\ncomplicated technicalities evolving from the thumb rule are creating doubts=\r\n and confusion in the minds of people as they consider an austerity, that i=\r\ns useless and totally missing the point.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Some people tend to resor=\r\nt to heavy theorization based on very shaky grounds. I suggest going back t=\r\no the basics, thinking clearly and keeping things simple.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay =\r\nRath:] Human brains work differently in seeking the truth and means to reme=\r\ndy the errors. Life is too complicated to keep everything simple. For examp=\r\nle, a heavily cursed Venus can block everything and UL fast may not be able=\r\n to solve the problem. Now would you say that heavy thoerization and compli=\r\ncation is happening and we should ignore the other factors completely?\n  &gt; =\r\n\n  &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like praye=\r\nrs, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If yo=\r\nur body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too=\r\n many calculations.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya is good for someon=\r\ne planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive and this is kept for s=\r\nome period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for m=\r\narriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from physical union as Brahm=\r\nacharya.

The basic point i=\r\ns that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If yo=\r\nu fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing=\r\n the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may c=\r\nome into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The simple solution is=\r\n to do vrata which do not conflict with\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rejection of food. So a pe=\r\nrson may observe the fast on UL in 2nd\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; day, however, adequate food=\r\n should be offered as a prasad and eaten\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before the Sunrise (not c=\r\nomplete fast).In this way, results may come\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a bit later, but will =\r\ncertainly come, while a person will not bring\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insult to Shri Vishn=\r\nu by rejecting the food.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This is the way I was taught, and ofcours=\r\ne others may agree or not.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best wishes\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Zoran Radosavljevi=\r\nc\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; www.siva-edu.info\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; www.ahimsazr1.wordpress.com\r\n------=_NextPart_000_03FE_01C99A90.F0539F30\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/S=\r\nTYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dea=\r\nr Sanjay,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; Mantra Shastra is a very detailed wo=\r\nrk and \nincludes mantra dosha etc.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&gt; It is very scientific and accurate.
