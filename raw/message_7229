We have set up the pooja sthaan in one of the rooms. My question is abou=\r\nt the deities that we have placed in our pooja sthaan. For some deities, we=\r\n have many idols of them (like Ganesha in 5 idol forms, 1 form with family,=\r\n 1 as a Lakshmi-Ganesha form in coin and one in a picture form) and we have=\r\n placed them in our pooja sthaan in this house and earlier houses and praye=\r\nd before them. Now we wish to keep only one form of each deity in our pooja=\r\n sthaan (as while praying to Lord Ganesha I am tempted to look at/face all =\r\nthe different forms in the pooja pedestal and hence I am not able to mainta=\r\nin focus) Could you please suggest if it is fine to do this (that is have o=\r\nnly one form in the pooja sthaan)? What should we do with the remaining ido=\r\nls/forms of the same deity? Is it ok to donate them at a nearby temple or i=\r\nmmerse them in a nearby river/ocean? \n&gt; \n&gt; Please provide your kind guidanc=\r\ne. If it is not right to do this or even think like this, I apologize since=\r\nrely. But if it is ok, kindly advise. \n&gt; \n&gt; On the same note, I also wanted=\r\n to ask you if someone gifts an idol/picture of a deity, should we keep the=\r\nm also in the pooja sthaan, and if we do, then it brings us back to the ori=\r\nginal question of having more than one idol for each deity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Awaiting =\r\nyour view/advise to get more clarity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
