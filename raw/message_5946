I am sure lo=\r\nt of people &gt;would like\n&gt;to know substance we can offer in homam and their =\r\npossible benefits.\n\nI am reporducing interesting paragraph from Aghora-2 (K=\r\nundalini). This is said by Vimalananda regrading the Samagri used for offer=\r\ning in Homam.\n\n[&quot;The Choice of offerings in a Homa depends on the work, bot=\r\nh spiritual and mundane, that you have for the fire to do. In the Homas i d=\r\no with my children we always offer clarified butter, barley, wheat, rice, s=\r\nesame seeds, dry & fresh fruits, honey and sugar, combined together in a sp=\r\necific proportion. All are sweet becuase we want the fire to give us mundan=\r\ne prosperity as well as spiritual advancement&quot;]\n\nThe above gives us a fair =\r\nidea that generally sweet Items such as Sugar, Honey, Kishmish, fruits as w=\r\nell as Kurmura etc...are likely to provide good results in mundane matters.=\r\n\nNarasimha Garu has earlier stated that White Til is very good for spiritua=\r\nl progress while black til (sesame seeds) are good for good physical health=\r\n. Kurmura are good for Financial gain..\n\nSo it is good to use mixure of all=\r\n these stuff if one wants to do spiritual progress along with material pros=\r\nperity.\nIf one is dying to do spiritual progress, one should use White til =\r\nalone and use Sopari, Coconut (which contains water inside).\n\nFinally, abov=\r\ne all, attitude of surrender is the main thing. this message is probably to=\r\no technical in nature. but wanted to give some ideas.\n\nBest Reagrds,\n\nUtpal=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Akshaya&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nHello Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; you wrote \n&gt; &quot;Supari is Symbolical of our false Ego and P=\r\nride. our patterns & Habits. However one caution! If one starts offering it=\r\n as purnaahuti then one may need to be ready to face situations where in Eg=\r\no is hurt, Insults are mounted, feathers are ruffled. One may be tested bad=\r\nly so that ultimately pride for anything is crushed.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; After reading=\r\n your advise as to watch out after offering supari, i am a puzzeled. It wil=\r\nl be nice if you can substantiate your statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing homam for gods=\r\n will bring only good. All prevading god is not waiting for a chance to bre=\r\nak your ego. He will guide you by providing better sense of dicrimination a=\r\nnd wisdom. \n&gt; \n&gt; As per my limited knowledge.\n&gt; Betel leaves and betel nuts=\r\n are good for digestion and thats why we offer it to god also in the Shodas=\r\nha Upachara after Naivedyam offering as we want God to feel comfortable aft=\r\ner eating.\n&gt; \n&gt; I think at best it should improve one&#39;s digestion. Supari i=\r\ns considered auspious otherwise also.\n&gt; \n&gt; Would request Narasimha to guide=\r\n us on this. I am sure lot of people would like to know substance we can of=\r\nfer in homam and their possible benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Akshaya\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just finished a pleasant Maha Ganapati Homam. Sinc=\r\ne it is relevant to the topic, wish to add my 2 cent...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Sopari&quot; (=\r\nBetel Nut) is one good item to offer as a Purnaahuti. Especially for those,=\r\n who are doing homam in close apartment with dry coconut pieces. Somebody s=\r\nuggested me to offer it in Homam long back and since then I usually offer i=\r\nt every time along with a Dry Coconut Half. I did not realize initially the=\r\n purport of the suggestion but after more than a year of offering, i unders=\r\ntood the meaning. Sopari is an extremely hard substance-Very difficult to b=\r\nreak. Symbolical of our false Ego and Pride. our patterns & Habits. However=\r\n one caution! If one starts offering it as purnaahuti then one may need to =\r\nbe ready to face situations where in Ego is hurt, Insults are mounted, feat=\r\nhers are ruffled.
