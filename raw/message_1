For astrologers among=\r\n you, the muhurta when the group is formed is:\n \n2006 November 7\n2:31:22 pm=\r\n (EST)\nSouth Grafton, MA, USA\n \nThe muhurta for the first post (this one) i=\r\ns:\n \n2006 November 7\n3:02 pm (EST)\nSouth Grafton, MA, USA\n \nI am sending an=\r\n old mail I sent to some friends a while back, for your reading pleasure.\n =\r\n\nMay the light of Brahman shine within,\nNarasimha\n \n-----------------------=\r\n----------------\nNamaste,\n\nSome of you guys were discussing Raktabeeja stor=\r\ny after the homam. I am sending excerpts from a few mails I sent sometime b=\r\nack to our astrology yahoogroups. They give a different perspective on Rakt=\r\nabeeja story and Madhukaitabha story. The purpose of these mails was to pro=\r\nvoke thinking in those who were ready. This mail is a little long and read =\r\nit at leisure.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n\nSome people mistakenly think that Chandi Saptashati is =\r\nmerely an account of the exploits of Durgaa and her slaying of demons Mahis=\r\nha, Chanda, Munda, Raktabeeja, Shumbha, Nishumbha etc. They view it as a co=\r\nllection of stories. But, IMHO, that is a very limited view. Devi mahatmyam=\r\n is much more than a collection of stories. After all, Vedas are its swaroo=\r\npam! Rigveda, Yajurveda and Saamaveda are the swaroopam (form/essence/a dif=\r\nferent manifestation) of the three parts of Chandi Saptashati. The purpose =\r\nof Vedas is self-knowledge. How can something with Vedas as its swaroopam b=\r\ne about something other than self-knowledge? \n\n*        *        *\n\nThough =\r\nDevi Mahatmyam looks like stories, there are very valuable lessons on Her n=\r\nature in it. The deeper you go, the more you can understand and appreciate =\r\nthe lessons in the stories. Let me give a couple of examples.\n\n(1) When var=\r\nious Mothers are going to war with demons, this is how it is described (8-1=\r\n4): &quot;Whatever form, decoration, weapons and vehicle each god has, his shakt=\r\ni (energy) came in the same form, decoration, weapons and vehicle.&quot; The nex=\r\nt 9 verses describe how Brahmaani etc came. For example, Brahmaani came on =\r\na swan with aksha sutra and kamandalu (worn by Brahma), Maaheswari came on =\r\na great bull with a Trishoola and She wore a big snake and Moon. And so on.=\r\n\n\nWhat is the message hidden in the above description? The normal imagery p=\r\nainted elsewhere is of female deities with a separate form. Here, they are =\r\ndepicted differently.\n\nThe fact that these female deities are identical to =\r\nthe male counterparts in form, decoration, weapons and vehicles suggests, t=\r\no me, that they are not really separate from the male counterparts. Brahma =\r\nand Brahmaani are not separate. Maheswara and Maaheswari are not separate. =\r\nVishnu and Vaishnavi are not separate. And so on. Brahmaani is simply the s=\r\nhakti (vitality/energy) of Brahma. Maaheswari is simply the shakti (vitalit=\r\ny/energy) of Maheswara. And so on.\n\nIf Vaishnavi went on Garuda vehicle and=\r\n killed a demon, it actually means that Vishnu went on a Garuda vehicle and=\r\n killed the demon. Vaishanvi is the personification of Vishnu&#39;s energy, whi=\r\nch makes Vishnu be, think, desire, move and act. Vaishnavi is not separate =\r\nfrom Vishnu.\n\nOf course, if you imagine Vaishnavi (Lakshmi) as a separate p=\r\nerson with certain attributes, She may manifest limited by your imagination=\r\n and even give you a darshan in that form. However, that is a limited form =\r\nand Her true nature is beyond that. Her true and highest nature is that She=\r\n is an inseparable part of Vishnu and represents the energy of Vishnu. She =\r\nis the part of Vishnu that makes Vishnu think, desire, act etc. Vaishnavi i=\r\ns basically Chetana (animated consciousness) of Vishnu.\n\nThus, contemplatio=\r\nn on these verses will make you understand the true nature of male devatas =\r\nand female devatas and their relationship better. It will enable you to app=\r\nreciate the highest nature of Shakti.\n\nPuranas personify everything to make=\r\n things interesting and understandable by laymen. However, it is more fun t=\r\no explore the deeper meanings.\n\n(2) Take Raktabeeja&#39;s slaying. Raktabeeja i=\r\ns a demon with a special ability. If a drop of blood falls from his body on=\r\n the ground, another demon will be born from it and will be of the same siz=\r\ne, age and strength as the original Raktabeeja even at birth. As Vaishnavi,=\r\n Maaheswari, Aindri etc were hurting Raktabeeja in the fight, more and more=\r\n demons were being born and all the gods were scared. Then Chandikaa told K=\r\naali to expand her face and eat all the demons as they are born. Chandika g=\r\noes around the war ground eating all the demons as they are born and eventu=\r\nally Raktabeeja runs out of blood.\n\nThis looks like a nice story. But, is t=\r\nhere is a deeper meaning in it that helps you in self-realization? Why was =\r\nKaali the chosen one and not Vaishnavi or Naarasimhi or Aindri?\n\nThe word r=\r\nakta means blood. Another meaning is &quot;desire/passion&quot;. The word comes from =\r\nthe root ranj/rang, which means &quot;to color&quot;. Desire/passion/attachment color=\r\ns and conditions the mind. Beeja means seed.\n\nRaktabeeja means &quot;the seed of=\r\n desire&quot;. Raktabeeja fighting with gods symbolizes desires taking the bette=\r\nr of our good judgment and good qualities. Each human being is a microcosm =\r\nof the macrocosm that the universe is. All devatas reside in us as various =\r\ngood qualities and all demons reside in us as various undesirable qualities=\r\n. When we are overcome by desires and do bad deeds, the Raktabeeja within u=\r\ns is defeating the gods within us.\n\nThe thing is that desires are difficult=\r\n to get rid of. You get rid of one desire and another desire is born. That =\r\nis what Raktabeeja&#39;s special ability means. The &quot;seed of desires&quot; (i.e. bas=\r\nic attachment that is the nature of mind) within us will keep producing mor=\r\ne and more desires. It is very resourceful.\n\nThen, why Kaali to destroy Him=\r\n?\n\nIn astrology, we associate Mahaakaala and Mahaakaali with Saturn. Kaali =\r\nshows detachment and vairaagyam. She wears a garland of skulls, symbolizing=\r\n that there is an endless cycle (garland) of births a material form (skull)=\r\n goes thru. The way Kaali shows to overcome the cycle is vairaagyam and det=\r\nachment. She shows meaningful and highest level of vairaagyam that comes wi=\r\nth a deep understanding of the cycle of material forms.\n\nTo fully cut off t=\r\nhe &quot;seed of desires&quot; so that one does not get any more desires, one needs t=\r\no develop vairaagyam and detachment and keep on destroying desires as they =\r\nare born and persist like that. After persisting for a long time, the &quot;seed=\r\n of desires&quot; will run out of desires and the basic attachment of mind will =\r\nvanish.\n\nThus, simple stories have deep meanings. This particular story cel=\r\nebrates the value of detachment, vairaagyam and persistence - Saturnine qua=\r\nlities.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMerely chanting Chandi saptashati without und=\r\nerstanding the meaning is also excellent and produces results. Understandin=\r\ng the meaning and marvelling at the power of the Mother makes one fearless =\r\nand energetic and also give material benefits. Understanding the deeper mea=\r\nnings and appreciating the True Nature of the Mother makes one realize one&#39;=\r\ns own true nature. It has various benefits at various levels of sadhana. It=\r\n is tough to exactly say what benefit it gives, as that depends on the evol=\r\nution level of sadhaka and his attitude. But, there is something in Chandip=\r\nath for everyone!\n\nHowever, the highest purpose is self-knowledge and that =\r\nis why Vedas are its swaroopam.\n\n*        *        *\n\nTowards the end, the =\r\n11th chapter (titled &quot;Naaraayani Stuti&quot;) describes gods praying to the Divi=\r\nne Mother after slaying all the demons. They address Her as &quot;Naaraayani&quot;. T=\r\nrimurthis symbolize the purest aspects of the three gunas. Vishnu is one of=\r\n them. He is of Sattva guna and sustains the creation. However, Narayana is=\r\n different. He is not Vishnu (contrast Narayana sooktam with Vishnu sooktam=\r\n!). He is gunaateeta (above gunas/attributes). He is the Sahasraseersha and=\r\n Parama Purusha (Supreme Cosmic Being). Some people may validly describe th=\r\ne same as Samba Sada Shiva also, but let us not argue about names. When we =\r\nare essentially speaking about an entity that is beyond attributes, it is f=\r\noolish to argue about the name. After all, name too is an attribute that in=\r\ntends to describe other attributes! Though great people gave different name=\r\ns to Parama Purusha, the names essentially capture the nature of the *path*=\r\n those people took to experience the Parama Purusha rather than the nature =\r\nof Parama Purusha, which is beyond names and attributes.\n\nThe bottomline is=\r\n that there is a Parama Purusha above the Trimurthis (Brahma, Vishnu and Sh=\r\niva). IF we call him Narayana, then Narayani is His energy and She is the r=\r\noot cause of all manifested creation.\n\nSaptashati is about Narayani. It is =\r\nabout the inseparable root energy of the Supreme Cosmic Being who is the so=\r\nurce of this entire universe. A small part of that root energy lies within =\r\nus too. Because I said &quot;small part&quot;, don&#39;t think it is small. Even a small =\r\npercentage of infinity is still infinity. Though each of us is a microcosm =\r\nof the macrocosm that the entire universe is, each of us is a complete and =\r\naccurate replica of the entire universe. Think &quot;poornamadah poornamidam&quot; in=\r\n Vedic spirit! The purpose of all spiritual sadhana is realizing the true n=\r\nature of self. Chandipath can also be viewed from that perspective.\n\n------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n \n\nSomeone queried a while =\r\nback on the meaning behind the story of Madhu Kaitabha. Here is a quick rep=\r\nly based on my limited understanding.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMadhu means hon=\r\ney. &quot;Madhu keeta&quot; means an insect of honey, i.e. honey bee. Madhu kaita mea=\r\nns belonging to honey bees. It can be the qualities or nature of honey bees=\r\n. One of the meanings of &quot;bha&quot; is &quot;having a similarity to&quot;. Thus, in my jud=\r\ngment, &quot;Madhu Kaitabha&quot; means &quot;having a semblance to the nature of honey be=\r\nes&quot;.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLike I keep saying, Sanskrit is a fantastic lang=\r\nuage. Sanskrit names selected by Rishis for expressing various concepts and=\r\n stories are very thoughtful. Depending on how deep one goes, there are man=\r\ny meanings of the same word. Thus, Rishis expressed concepts that may have =\r\none meaning to a layman and a different meaning to one who is ready to unde=\r\nrstand the deeper meaning! I salute to the wisdom of our Rishis!\n\nI was say=\r\ning the same thing at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam last weekend. When somebody sai=\r\nd at an open discussion that the idea is important and not the name, as the=\r\nre are many names of the same thing in many languages, I made a quick point=\r\n about the value of Sanskrit names. I said that Sanskrit names have not one=\r\n meaning, but layers of meanings that can be understood based on the capabi=\r\nlity of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some special meanings and to k=\r\neep some higher knowledge as secret, even though it is very much out there!=\r\n The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasara described bhavas (house=\r\ns) and how to find their respective padas (arudha padas of houses) and said=\r\n that a bhava and its pada should be judged to see the matters of a house. =\r\nThough he did not explain the difference between a bhava and its pada furth=\r\ner and did not elucidate when to use which one, I said that the very choice=\r\n of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is usually translated as a house, al=\r\nso means &quot;a thought/concept/feeling&quot; and pada means &quot;a symbol/word&quot; used to=\r\n express a thought/concept. Thus, houses are to their arudha padas what tho=\r\nughts (bhavas) are to the words (padas) that attempt to express them. For e=\r\nxample, if the 4th house shows one&#39;s happiness from vehicles, the pada of 4=\r\nth house shows the tangible articles that attempt to throw light on one&#39;s h=\r\nappiness from vehicles (e.g. the physical vehicle owned by one). Houses (bh=\r\navas) show intangible/internal aspects of a matter (just like thoughts insi=\r\nde one&#39;s head), while their arudha padas show tangible/external aspects of =\r\na matter (just like the external words spoken that attempt to express the t=\r\nhoughts in the head). If you use the English words to translate Parasara, t=\r\nhis hidden meaning may be lost! So, I argued that Sanskrit names used by Ri=\r\nshis are not like words in any language.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAnyway, let =\r\nus come back to the Madhu Kaitabha story. As I said, Madhu Kaitabha means &quot;=\r\nhaving a semblance to the quality of honeybees&quot;. What is the quality of hon=\r\ney bees? Well, they keep working hard to accumulate the sweet honey! They a=\r\nre not intelligent enough to think about any higher things in life. Thus, M=\r\nadhu Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality within us which makes us work =\r\nhard, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus on accumulating material c=\r\nomforts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we accumulate material objects an=\r\nd spend whole life working hard doing just that.\n\nVishnu is a personificati=\r\non of the sattwa guna of the Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being). Wit=\r\nhin us, Vishnu is an allegory to the sattwa guna within us. Madhu Kaitabha =\r\nwere born from Vishnu&#39;s earwax when He was alseep. The ability to work hard=\r\n like a bee is not really a terrible thing. This ability is essentially bor=\r\nn from the sattwa guna within us, when it is in deep slumber (i.e. sattwa g=\r\nuna covered by taamasi shakti, i.e. sattwa guna that &quot;manifests&quot; in a taama=\r\nsik way).\n\nThere are so many good people in this world, who just spend thei=\r\nr entire lives in honest labor like the honeybees and accumulate things for=\r\n themselves and others around them. Their sattwa is in deep sleep and Madhu=\r\n Kaitabha born from that asleep sattva are very much active.\n\nThe problem w=\r\nith this focus on hard work and accumulation of material objects is that it=\r\n keeps us away from supreme bliss. Madhu Kaitabha&#39;s attack on Brahma and Ve=\r\ndas is symbolic of that. Vedas symbolize the supreme and liberating knowled=\r\nge of self and Brahma, the carrier of Vedas, symbolizes the sadhana to achi=\r\neve the supreme knowledge. The focus on working like honeybees and accumula=\r\nting material objects tries to kills one&#39;s ability to do sadhana and obtain=\r\n supreme knowledge of self.\n\nVishnu battles Madhu Kaitabha for 5,000 years.=\r\n Devi Bhagavatam even describes that Vishnu wondered in the middle how to d=\r\nefeat Madhu Kaitabha, as He finds them quite formidable! Even when the satt=\r\nva in us awakens, it is difficult for it to overcome the formidable instinc=\r\nt to lead the life of a honeybee and to accumulate the material objects for=\r\n oneself and others.\n\nAccording to Parasara, thighs are seen from the 9th h=\r\nouse of dharma. The earthy element symbolizes the commitment and stability.=\r\n The fact that earthy element came from the thighs of Vishnu shows that it =\r\nis the dharma of sattwa guna sustaining this universe that ensures that the=\r\nre is commitment and stability in this creation.\n\nMoreover, it is apt that =\r\nsomeone born in the ears (3rd house) of Vishnu found end in the thighs (9th=\r\n house, i.e. 7th house of death from the 3rd house) of Vishnu! Similarly, B=\r\nrahma, who is born from the navel (6th house) of Vishnu should naturally fi=\r\nnd His end in the 12th house of Vishnu (feet/sleep), which is the 7th house=\r\n of death from the 6th house! That may be why Vishnu goes to sleep, when th=\r\nere is a change of Brahma.\n\nAnyway, the instinct within us to keep accumula=\r\nting material objects like honey bees accumulate honey finds its end in the=\r\n dharma of the sattwa guna, i.e. when the sattwa guna within us follows its=\r\n dharma. Then we are fully awake spiritually. Naturally, the path to self-k=\r\nnowledge becomes open then and Brahma becomes elated.\n\nThus, the story of M=\r\nadhu-Kaitabha refers, allegorically, to the instinct most of us have toward=\r\ns leading a &quot;regular&quot; life, working hard like honeybees and accumulating ob=\r\njects for self and others and how that instinct needs to be defeated by wak=\r\ning up the sattwa guna and allowing it to perform its dharma.\n\n*        *  =\r\n      *\n\nLest I am misunderstood, I need to clarify one thing. I am not say=\r\ning that these stories are not real. These stories ARE very much real. In f=\r\nact, when a Yogi is able to transport consciousness (Kundalini) to a partic=\r\nular plane (chakra), He/She can vividly see these stories actually happenin=\r\ng. The stories are as real as our own existence as beings made of flesh and=\r\n blood is, in the normal plane of consciousness.\n\nWhat I am saying is that =\r\nthere is an allegorical link between various planes of consciousness. What =\r\nis real in one plane of consciousness is an allegory in another plane of co=\r\nnsciousness. If one is atleast capable of understanding a story as an alleg=\r\nory, that will serve a valuable purpose!\n\n---------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n\n&lt;A discussion on oneness and manyness of forms&gt;\n\n&gt; Is=\r\n vishnu there in the flower? The answer is yes\n&gt; Is Vishnu there in the tre=\r\ne? The answer is yes \n\nThat&#39;s all fine. But a devotee of Kaali like Ramakri=\r\nshna will eventually reach the stage where he sees Kaali in flowers, trees =\r\netc (just as you may aspire to see Vishnu in everything). A great devotee o=\r\nf Shiva will eventually see Shiva in everything.\n\nIt is possible to devote =\r\nto several deities and eventually start seeing the deity in everything that=\r\n exists. It is not correct that only Vishnu&#39;s form has the characteristic y=\r\nou explained above.\n\nIn order to explain this more clearly, let me go back =\r\nto the analogy I gave earlier. This fantastic analogy is from my spiritual =\r\nguru.\n\n-------------- Quote Begin --------------\nImagine God to be a bright=\r\n star in the sky. When you see from a distance, star seems tiny and you con=\r\nclude that there is only one God. If you start moving towards God, you real=\r\nize as you get closer that the star is in reality a huge diamond with 330 m=\r\nillion faces. Each face is several miles long and wide and has various attr=\r\nibutes (gunas). One face may be red and hot and another may be blue and col=\r\nd etc. So, as you get closer to the diamond, you have to pick one face to g=\r\net close to.\n\nNow, when you get too close to a face, the whole world will s=\r\neem to have the attributes of that face. For example, if you get too close =\r\nto a face that is cold and blue, then the whole world will feel cold and bl=\r\nue to you. In other words, the God you are getting close to is the Supreme =\r\ngod of the world and fills the entire world as you experience it.\n\nThis is =\r\nthe ultimate goal in sadhana for one adhering to Dwaita siddhanta (duality)=\r\n. For them, getting close to ishta devata and securing a place near the fee=\r\nt is the highest goal. Everything else is immaterial to them.\n\nFor some, th=\r\nere is a next stage: As you get closer and closer to the face you picked, y=\r\nou finally merge with it! This is the ultimate goal in sadhana for one adhe=\r\nring to Visishtaadwaita.\n\nTo Advaitis, this communion with a Saguna (&quot;with =\r\nattributes&quot;) form of God is not the final goal. The final goal is to break =\r\nthrough the face and jump into the inside of the diamond. As you break thro=\r\nugh the face of the diamond into which you merge and jump into the interior=\r\n of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces of the diamond or the wor=\r\nld outside. There are no longer any objects or attributes. The experiencer,=\r\n experienced and experience all merge into one.\n\nThis state can be achieved=\r\n by first merging into any face (Vishnu, Shiva, Mahalakshmi, Mahakali etc).=\r\n\n-------------- Quote End --------------\n\nRead the above analogy carefully.=\r\n Imagine Vishnu, Shiva etc to be faces of the diamond in the above analogy.=\r\n If you get too close to Vishnu, you will indeed see Vishnu in everything a=\r\nnd you &#39;realize&#39; that Vishnu is the supreme god of this universe and fills =\r\neverything that exists. You see Vishnu in even Shiva. Similarly, if you get=\r\n too close to Shiva, you will indeed see Shiva in everything and you &#39;reali=\r\nze&#39; that Shiva is the supreme god of this universe and fills everything tha=\r\nt exists. You see Shiva in even Vishnu. The same applies to Sun, Ganesha an=\r\nd so many other deities.\n\nIt is as simple as that.\n\nBut then, one may ask w=\r\nhat is the importance of picking ishta devata based on chart. If it is poss=\r\nible to see Vishnu in Shiva or Shiva in Vishnu, what is the big deal in cho=\r\nosing a deity? Why can&#39;t one pray to a random deity?\n\nThe answer is that th=\r\ne stage of perceiving the ishta devata in all gods and everything that exis=\r\nts has not been reached by most people. Our ishta devata prescriptions are =\r\nfor people who are yet to reach that stage. In terms of my analogy, the jou=\r\nrney to different faces of the diamond takes different times based on where=\r\n you stand right now. If you pick a face that is closest to you based on wh=\r\nere you are, you reach the diamond faster. For example, if you choose a fac=\r\ne on the other side, it will take considerably longer to reach it. On the c=\r\nontrary, if you select a face that is closest to you, you reach it faster.\n=\r\n\nSimilarly, if you choose a form (face of the diamond of divinity) that is =\r\nclosest to you based on where you stand in karmic evolution (i.e. based on =\r\nall previous karmas and samskaras), you reach god faster. Once you reach th=\r\ne chosen face and get too close to it, you will see that deity in the entir=\r\ne universe. Someone with different samskaras may choose a different deity a=\r\nnd reach a different face and that person will see that deity in the entire=\r\n universe. There is no contradiction here!\n\nThus, while trying to surrender=\r\n to a random deity may eventually work, surrendering to some specific deiti=\r\nes may work faster based on your previous karmas. That is what astrologers =\r\nshould try to figure out. Instead of setting one on a different course, if =\r\nwe help one continue the course one was on already (from various lives), we=\r\n would have done a good thing!\n\nThus, my humble appeal is this: Let us not =\r\nrestrict to one deity (e.g. Vishnu and His avataras) based on OUR OWN samsk=\r\naras. Let us recommend all deities based on the native&#39;s inclination, samsk=\r\naras and karmas.\n\nI hope my view on not prescribing only Vishnu&#39;s avataras =\r\nas ishta devatas is better understood after this detailed mail!\n\n----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_004B_01C7027D.A87B02F0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.2963&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Welcome to the newly formed group.

I said that \nSans=\r\nkrit names have not one meaning, but layers of meanings that can be \nunders=\r\ntood based on the capability of the reader. Rishis used this to hide some \n=\r\nspecial meanings and to keep some higher knowledge as secret, even though i=\r\nt is \nvery much out there! The example I gave was of bhava and pada. Parasa=\r\nra \ndescribed bhavas (houses) and how to find their respective padas (arudh=\r\na padas \nof houses) and said that a bhava and its pada should be judged to =\r\nsee the \nmatters of a house. Though he did not explain the difference betwe=\r\nen a bhava and \nits pada further and did not elucidate when to use which on=\r\ne, I said that the \nvery choice of names is a huge clue! Bhava, which is us=\r\nually translated as a \nhouse,&nbsp;also means &quot;a thought/concept/feeling&quot; a=\r\nnd pada means &quot;a \nsymbol/word&quot; used to express a thought/concept. Thus, hou=\r\nses are to their arudha \npadas what thoughts (bhavas) are to the words (pad=\r\nas) that attempt to express \nthem. For example, if the 4th house shows one&#39;=\r\ns happiness from vehicles, the \npada of 4th house shows the tangible articl=\r\nes that attempt to throw light on \none&#39;s happiness from vehicles (e.g. the =\r\nphysical vehicle owned by one). Houses \n(bhavas) show intangible/internal a=\r\nspects of a matter (just like thoughts inside \none&#39;s head), while their aru=\r\ndha padas show tangible/external aspects of a matter \n(just like the extern=\r\nal words spoken that attempt to express the thoughts in the \nhead). If you =\r\nuse the English words to translate Parasara, this hidden meaning \nmay be lo=\r\nst! So, I argued that Sanskrit names used by Rishis are not like words \nin =\r\nany language.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Anyway, let us come back to the Madhu Kaitabha \nstory.

Well, they keep working hard to \naccumulate the=\r\n sweet honey! They are not intelligent enough to think about any \nhigher th=\r\nings in life. Thus, Madhu Kaitabha are an allegory to the quality \nwithin u=\r\ns which makes us work hard, like honeybees, with a single-minded focus \non =\r\naccumulating material comforts. Like honeybees accumulate honey, we \naccumu=\r\nlate material objects and spend whole life working hard doing just \nthat.&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Vishnu is a personification of the sattwa guna of \nt=\r\nhe Parama Purusha (Universal/Absolute Being).

Once you reach the chosen face and g=\r\net too close to it, you will see \nthat deity in&nbsp;the entire universe.
