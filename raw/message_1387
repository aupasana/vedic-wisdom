However, certain egoistic actions make one lose \nsome or all of the accumulated shakti.\n\nLong hair and beard trap some shakti and help avoid situations where one \ncommits an action that results in a loss of all of one&#39;s shakti. They \nimprove the control over senses in tricky situations.\n\nIt is like a small railing atop a mountain. If one wanders off at night, \nthose railings can stop one from falling. A small barrier can make a big \ndifference at critical times. Beard and long hair are like that small \nbarrier.\n\nOf course, a small railing cannot save a car driving at 70 mph from plunging \ndown. But it can stop a person wandering at night. Similarly, beard and long \nhair are not sufficient for control over senses, but one who made a lot of \nprogress and still struggling at some critical times can benefit \nsignificantly from long hair and beard.\n\nBTW, the tradition of growing long hair or beard is not limited to Hinduism. \nIt is there in many religions.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, March 01, 2009 3:49 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Significance of long hair and beard\n\n\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any significance of having long hair and beard in the\n&gt; spiritual sadhana? we typically see lot of sadhus having long beard and\n&gt; hair, also some households who does some spiritual sadhana emulate\n&gt; that. I understand these as the external signs, but this has been an\n&gt; age old practise to have long hair for the spiritual sadhakas, please\n&gt; throw some light on this topic.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank and warm regards\n&gt; Krishna Kanth\n\n\n"}}
