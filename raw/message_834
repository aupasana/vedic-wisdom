Rao \n&lt;pvr@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Dear Sundeep,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is quite relevant and not at all inappropriate. Let me give \nt=\r\nhe crux\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the philosophy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The mind is like a=\r\n monkey. It wanders from one place to another \nvery\n&gt; &gt; rapidly\n&gt; &gt; and giv=\r\nes varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadness \netc. When\n&gt; &gt; the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can experience \nthe bl=\r\niss\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; finding the true Self. The goal of all spiritual sadhana - \n=\r\njapam, homam,\n&gt; &gt; dhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - is to enable=\r\n the \nmind to\n&gt; &gt; become\n&gt; &gt; calm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; At first, one cannot make the mi=\r\nnd stable and calm. All one can \ndo it to\n&gt; &gt; tie\n&gt; &gt; the monkey (mind) to =\r\na fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still \nmoves around,\n&gt; &gt; but its motion i=\r\ns restricted. Once it goes far, the thread tying \nit to the\n&gt; &gt; pole stops =\r\nit from going further away. Similarly, when one tries \nto focus\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; =\r\na mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one constantly \nbrings it\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; back to the mantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the \nmantra.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries \nto =\r\nbecome\n&gt; &gt; calm and stable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After trying enough, just as monkey tie=\r\nd to a pole may stop \njumping around\n&gt; &gt; and fall asleep holding on to the =\r\npole, the mind may stop \nthinking of so\n&gt; &gt; many things and become absolute=\r\nly calm and stable while \nrepeating a mantra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When all the thoughts=\r\n cease and some level of silence comes to \nthe mind,\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; experience=\r\ns some level of bliss.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus, mantra is a combination =\r\nof sounds that is repeated by the \nmind to aid\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; mind to stop wanderi=\r\nng from one thing to another thing. The goal \nis to give\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; an anchor =\r\nfor the mind to focus on, instead of jumping \neverywhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Various s=\r\nound combinations can be used for this purpose. For \nexample, one\n&gt; &gt; can e=\r\nven repeat &quot;I want to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every \ncombination of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; sounds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating it \nenough. =\r\nSound\n&gt; &gt; patterns making sense in various languages were used by some \nsai=\r\nnts and\n&gt; &gt; messiahs from time to time in the past to obtain bliss and thos=\r\ne \nsound\n&gt; &gt; patterns are revered as being sacred in various religions.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Compared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are \neasier =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; focus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24 \nletters/syl=\r\nlables,\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; part of the mind is responsible for changing from one let=\r\nter to \nanother and\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; there is more mind activity even in a state of =\r\nhigh mental focus \non the\n&gt; &gt; mantra. If you repeat a single syllable const=\r\nantly, the task is \nsimpler for\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; the mind and it is easier for the m=\r\nind to shut down various \ntasks of the\n&gt; &gt; mind and become close to being s=\r\ntill and silent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Various syllables can be used for this purpose. Th=\r\nese syllables \nare called\n&gt; &gt; beeja aksharas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Beeja m=\r\neans a seed. Beeja akshara means a seed syllable.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When mind has abs=\r\nolutely no activity and becomes completely \nstill (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; ceases to exist=\r\n!), one realizes the true Self (Aatman or \nBrahman). When\n&gt; &gt; mind\n&gt; &gt; has =\r\nvery little activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still \nexists, but\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; a very high state of focus and calmness), one realizes different \npu=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; manifestations of cosmic being.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When one meditates on a beej=\r\na akshara and attains the above \nstate of high\n&gt; &gt; mental focus and calmnes=\r\ns, one&#39;s mind has no thoughts other than \nthe\n&gt; &gt; repetition of the syllabl=\r\ne. Each syllable acts as a seed \ncorresponding to a\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; deity. The ener=\r\ngy of that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness when \none&#39;s mind\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; fill=\r\ned with that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. In \nother words,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n each deity is a personifications of the state of a mind that is \nfocused o=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; the sound of a specific beeja with no other thoughts in it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, if one&#39;s mind has many thoughts while repeating a \n=\r\nbeeja akshara\n&gt; &gt; (or any mantra in general), one may experience a lot of e=\r\nmotions \nand\n&gt; &gt; things.\n&gt; &gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still and =\r\ncalm with no \nthought in it\n&gt; &gt; (other than what is needed for repeating th=\r\nat sound), we can say \nthat one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; individual ego has been replaced =\r\nwith that of a deity and the \ndeity has\n&gt; &gt; filled one&#39;s mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus=\r\n, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one \nexperience the\n&gt; &gt; en=\r\nergy of a deity.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which syllables make one experience =\r\nwhich energy was well-\nunderstood and\n&gt; &gt; catalogued by ancient Hindu sages=\r\n nicely.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Many mantras other than beeja aksharas were also experieme=\r\nnted \nby rishis,\n&gt; &gt; who understood the nature of energy experienced by one=\r\n&#39;s mind \nwhen one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; mind is completely filled with the sound of the man=\r\ntra and all \nother\n&gt; &gt; thoughts leave the mind.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So we need not expe=\r\nriment newly. We can use the knowledge \ndiscovered by\n&gt; &gt; rishis and go fur=\r\nther.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Messa=\r\nge -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is my first time posting on the vedic-w=\r\nisdom group.
