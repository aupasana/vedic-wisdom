A lot of what I read here, in this yahoo-group,=\r\n is one of the most lucid explanation of spirituality, and the final goal o=\r\nf every saadhana, and the link between spirituality and rituals, yoga, ayur=\r\nveda, and leading a simple and humble life.\n\nI have downloaded the book com=\r\npiled from your writings on spiritual matters and I am in the process of re=\r\nading that as well, and derive great happiness in reading it. I also visite=\r\nd your website and saw a wealth of material for spiritually inclined people=\r\n there. The manuals on do-it-yourself homams are one of your outstanding co=\r\nntributions to society, and shine brightly among the other gems of your con=\r\ntributions. I feel an inclination towards performing homams on a daily/week=\r\nly basis. Before I start this, I want to seek your guidance on the followin=\r\ng:\n\n1. Do I need to prepare myself in any way before I start the homam?- I =\r\nwill explain to you what I mean here - since you have suggested that one st=\r\nart with MahaGanapathi homam, I shall start with it too. However, as I have=\r\n been worshipping DeviMa every morning and Hanumanji every evening, do I ne=\r\ned to start worshipping MahaGanapathi now for a few days during mornings an=\r\nd evenings and then after a few days, start with the homam?\n\n2. Related to =\r\nthe first question, as I have been worshipping DeviMa for quite sometime no=\r\nw, I see/visualize Her many times during the day (at work/home), so now whe=\r\nn I start with the MahaGanapathi homam with complete faith, devotion, and s=\r\nurrender to MahaGanapathi, wouldn&#39;t there be a conflict in my mind, since I=\r\n may still be visualizing DeviMa everywhere around me (due to mind&#39;s condit=\r\nioning), while I am worshipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source,=\r\n cradle and end of everything, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead?=\r\n This may be a hypothetical situation, as I am talking about the future, ho=\r\nwever, may still be relevant, and so I seek your advice here.\n\n3. As I am h=\r\nouseholder, and we are expecting our first child in the next few months, is=\r\n it ok to perform a homam at home? It may sound jouvenile but I don&#39;t know =\r\nany better, and would rather listen to wiser men. The reason I ask this is =\r\nthat while doing the homam, we chant various mantras/stotras, and they prod=\r\nuce effects in the immediate environment, specially in the presence of Agni=\r\n, the Pavaka. Although, the goal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd t=\r\no move towards greater purity, humility and peace, and I have faith that a =\r\nregular homam will enable me to achieve that. However, for the sake of my w=\r\nife and our child (inside her womb), I am prompted to ask this question. Pl=\r\nease don&#39;t take it in any other way except as a genuine concern for my fami=\r\nly (however silly it is)\n\n4. Related to the above question, if it is fine f=\r\nor me to do the homam at home, then can my pregnant wife also participate i=\r\nn it, if she wants to?\n\n5. Should I wait for an auspicious day like an amav=\r\nasya or an eclipse to start the homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, shoul=\r\nd I do the homam at a particular time every day or is any time fine? I do u=\r\nnderstand that doing the homam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, what=\r\never time one does it, is more beneficial than doing it at different times.=\r\n\n\n6. Is it better to do the homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as we=\r\nll? The reason I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodation and the=\r\n smoke from the homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling. However, in ou=\r\nr residential/apartment complex, there is a common area, which is open on t=\r\nwo sides, where some community festivals are celebrated together, and if I =\r\nget the permission, then maybe I can do the homam there? Is there a strong =\r\nreason/added benefit to doing the homam at home?\n\nNarasimhaji, I will be ve=\r\nry grateful to you for your answers to the above questions.\n\nYou are render=\r\ning a great service to today&#39;s society and we pray to DeviMa to keep showin=\r\ng you the way.\n\nThank you for sharing so much!\n\nHumble regards,\nVipin\n\n\n"}}
