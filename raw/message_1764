When chanting \nthe mantra as a part of homam (with swaahaa and with offerings), read it \nwith minimum sound. If lips are moving to the mantra, that is enough. But \nwhen meditating at the end, you can be absolutely soundless and \nmovementless. It is better that way actually.\n\nYes, you can do in the evening.\n\nDo not think of homam as just regular fire. It is a representation of \ndivinity - the soul and the Sun. Homa purifies all elements, especially \nfire. If there are fire element related problems in the horoscope, homam can \npurify the fire element.\n\nI really suggest Ganapathi for a few months. After that, switch to Shiva.\n\nThe big fire Manish was shown by those siddhas is a symbolic representation \nof the regular homam done by thousands of people in future. Those who are \nhere and slowly starting are the first few.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, May 02, 2009 4:06 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Homam - Ugra Devatas\n\n\n&gt; Narasimha ji,\n&gt; Pranam!\n&gt;\n&gt; on Akshyaya Triteya i performed the first homam using the &quot;bare essential&quot; \n&gt; procedure. Today was the third day of homam and i thought it went better \n&gt; than the first two days. i liked the sound of crackling fire while \n&gt; meditating on the mantra.\n&gt;\n&gt; i want to ask a few questions. somehow, i feel more comfortable meditating \n&gt; on Mahamrityunjaya mantra than pronouncing the mantra aloud. is it ok do \n&gt; do so without producing sound (vaikhri?)?\n&gt;\n&gt; today i felt that i should do the homam every day. is is ok if i do this \n&gt; in the evening when i come back from work...say 7-7.30 p.m.?\n&gt;\n&gt; For some reason, real or imagined, i am drawn to fire but am also afraid \n&gt; of it. people who have seen my horoscope have told me that i should be \n&gt; wary of fire probably because i have rahu and mars in 8th house in Saggi - \n&gt; aspected by Sun (and also Jupiter and Merc). Seven months ago my \n&gt; mother-in-law got burnt while doing Puja and passed away.This incident \n&gt; took place right in front of me.\n&gt;\n&gt; i have not been a believer of rituals...or a personal deity. So one of my \n&gt; problems was who should i meditate to while performing homam. Then on this \n&gt; very forum there was a discussion on mahamrityunjaya mantra and i thought \n&gt; this should be right for me. i also realise that Triyambake could be an \n&gt; ugra form of shiva.\n&gt;\n&gt; sometime back i had visited Thiruvanamallai and did girivalam...Am curious \n&gt; about the &quot;fire&quot; in / near Chennai that has been mentioned in your \n&gt; introductory write-up on homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thankyou!\n&gt;\n&gt; best wishes and regards\n\n\n"}}
