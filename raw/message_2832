Instead of\n&gt; focusing on the lord, i was angry at the=\r\nm and refused to oblige.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) Once we (group of friends) went to &#39;Mota Am=\r\nbaji&#39; (in Gujarat near Mount\n&gt; Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamag=\r\nri) just at the entrance of the\n&gt; famous temple, gave us all the puja mater=\r\nial in a plate. We made a mistake\n&gt; by not asking him price. After we came =\r\nback from the temple, he asked us to\n&gt; pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can an=\r\nybody imagine such price?. we have to\n&gt; bargain so much with him that after=\r\n that i hardly buy such puja saamgri\n&gt; whenever i go to any temple. for ins=\r\ntance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temple of\n&gt; Mumbai, i&#39;ll take 3 lotuses to off=\r\ner Mahakaali-Mahalakshmi-MahaSaraswati and\n&gt; that is all.\n&gt;\n&gt; However I mus=\r\nt say that the above two bad experiences did not discourage\n&gt; me.\n&gt;\n&gt; Such =\r\nthings as well as few other things like General atmosphere, crowd,\n&gt; noise,=\r\n beggars, dirt, etc=85 are external things IMHO.

They have helped me a lot on the=\r\n query.\n&gt; Actually, I recently visited few (not to name any but also includ=\r\ning 1 or 2\n&gt; from your list) places with my parents. But, my experience was=\r\n really bad. I\n&gt; could see lot of commercialism and greed invloved amongst =\r\neveryone there\n&gt; including those in position over there. And spiritualism w=\r\nas difficult to\n&gt; find. I could feel spiritual vibes more outside (slightly=\r\n away from the main\n&gt; building and crows) the temples than inside. And to m=\r\ny believe, these places\n&gt; would not have been like this always. So, I kept =\r\nwondering, that if these\n&gt; famous and energised idols have the power to rai=\r\nse the spiritual energies,\n&gt; then why did &quot;locals&quot; who have always been her=\r\ne, are getting corrupted. But,\n&gt; then probably the tamas energies of people=\r\n coming day in and out have\n&gt; overpowered or as you say visitors have made =\r\nthe incense disappear over the\n&gt; period of time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have one experie=\r\nnce to share, which is somewhat on similar lines. I was\n&gt; in Hardiwar with =\r\nmy parents on a certain &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking bath, they\n&gt; started looki=\r\nng for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately or\n&gt; unfortunately, we =\r\ncould found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain place.\n&gt; But, they were =\r\nsurrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. And\n&gt; per my estima=\r\nte a 10000 people would have already fed them per their\n&gt; &quot;Custom&quot;. Now, do=\r\nes it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already\n&gt; had her quota =\r\nof 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or food\n&gt; poisoning pro=\r\nblems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed the,\n&gt; but could n=\r\not succeed. And the whole day felt bad about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In general, whatev=\r\ner holy place I have visited, I have hardly found it\n&gt; spiritual enough and=\r\n have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always happen\n&gt; to see plentiful =\r\ncases of useless greed which make me feel that to keep\n&gt; whatever goodness =\r\nis left in one, he or she should never visit these places.\n&gt; As they are hi=\r\nghly filled with Tamas now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Sriram\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On=\r\n Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

At\n&gt; &gt; the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a po=\r\nwerful\n&gt; divine\n&gt; &gt; presence.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the=C2 =\r\nKrishna temple\n&gt; &gt; in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills i=\r\nn Gujarat and\n&gt; &gt; Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s pl=\r\nace). There is a\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those place=\r\ns. There are several\n&gt; temples\n&gt; &gt; where the idol is practically alive. For=\r\n example, even 123 years after\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali =\r\nidol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;.\n&gt; I did\n&gt; &gt; not get the same impression a=\r\nt the famous Kalighat temple which is also\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhere was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was\n&gt; &gt; taken to by a priest=\r\n who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil\n&gt; Nadu\n&gt; &gt; before we =\r\ndid the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ntemple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2 form of=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the divine Mother=C2 present there was a Tamil language name and I d=\r\nid not\n&gt; &gt; understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I =\r\nclosed my\n&gt; eyes\n&gt; &gt; and started meditating with my mantra in front of the =\r\nidol, I was dazzled\n&gt; by a\n&gt; &gt; vision of a very fierce goddess whose face w=\r\nas emiting rays like Sun. I\n&gt; felt\n&gt; &gt; that there was a powerful presence t=\r\nhere. Unfortunately, I do not\n&gt; remember the\n&gt; &gt; name of the place or the g=\r\noddess, but it is a temple without roof over\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; goddess. They tried =\r\nto put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the\n&gt; roof\n&gt; &gt; came down in=\r\n a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the\n&gt; goddess\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlikes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a\n&gt; hurr=\r\ny, I\n&gt; &gt; was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probabl=\r\ny knows\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Like this, I =\r\nam sure there are many temples with a\n&gt; &gt; powerful divine presence across I=\r\nndia.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one\n&gt; &gt; of =\r\nmy best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple\n&gt; at\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditatin=\r\ng\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; underground chamber there.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Even the middle of =\r\na busy road in India is better\n&gt; &gt; for meditating than a temple in USA. The=\r\nse western countries are so\n&gt; filled with\n&gt; &gt; rajas and tamas. There is raj=\r\nas in India too, but there is a good amount\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; sattwa there. Thus, an=\r\ny temple in India will be a good place to meditate,\n&gt; but my\n&gt; &gt; view is th=\r\nat there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; rea=\r\nlly good.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months doing\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\npiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Mayapu=\r\nr, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east\n&gt; &gt; India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvanna=\r\nmalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2 and\n&gt; &gt; Narayana=C2 vanam (near Tirupati)=C2 i=\r\nn south India, Shirdi, Aalandi,\n&gt; &gt; Dwaraka=C2 and Girnar mountains (Junaga=\r\ndh) in west India, Varanasi,\n&gt; Vrindavan\n&gt; &gt; and Hrishikesh in north India =\r\nand Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2 and Ujjain\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; central India.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; There are many other good places, but the above\n&gt; &gt; come to my mind. V=\r\nisiting a temple once is one thing and staying there\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; several mont=\r\nhs while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sadhana=\r\n (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best\n&gt; &gt; regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/=\r\nvedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.c=\r\nomcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish\n&gt; &gt; writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyotish=\r\nWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri\n&gt; &gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan n=\r\nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n---------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From:\n&gt; &gt; Astro\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Seeker\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, =\r\nOctober 07, 2009 9:11\n&gt; &gt; AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would like to know yo=\r\nur opinion on holy places (famous temples\n&gt; &gt; etc) in today&#39;s time.

If it&#39;s a feel good factor within or without?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nIf we g=\r\no to the famous temples of India today, it is almost sure that one will fin=\r\nd lot of crowd and resultant noise, gossips, business, cheating, discrimina=\r\ntion etc... etc...&lt;br&gt;\ncan that be criteria for judging the spiritual energ=\r\ny of the place?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nmy two distinct experiences (external):&lt;br&gt;\n1) i w=\r\nent to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when i entered to take Darshan of al=\r\nl the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the dogmatic behavior of the Pandas =\r\nstanding there near the Idols. they almost commanded me to put some money i=\r\nn front of the Idol. one can imagine my condition. Instead of focusing on t=\r\nhe lord, i was angry at them and refused to oblige.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n2) Once we (g=\r\nroup of friends) went to &#39;Mota Ambaji&#39; (in Gujarat near Mount Abu).=\r\n one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just at the entrance of the famo=\r\nus temple, gave us all the puja material in a plate. We made a mistake by n=\r\not asking him price. After we came back from the temple, he asked us to pay=\r\n around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybody imagine such price?. we have to barg=\r\nain so much with him that after that i hardly buy such puja saamgri wheneve=\r\nr i go to any temple. for instance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temple of Mumbai,=\r\n i&#39;ll take 3 lotuses to offer Mahakaali-Mahalakshmi-MahaSaraswati and t=\r\nhat is all.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever I must say that the above two bad experiences=\r\n did not discourage me.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSuch things as well as few other things li=\r\nke General atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, dirt, etc=85 are external thi=\r\nngs IMHO. There is also spiritual energy generated by many many pure hearte=\r\nd visitors.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWarm regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thanks f=\r\nor sharing your thoughts. They have helped me a lot on the query. Actually,=\r\n I recently visited few (not to name any but also including 1 or 2 from you=\r\nr list) places with my parents. But, my experience was really bad. I could =\r\nsee lot of commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there includin=\r\ng those in position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I c=\r\nould feel spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main buildin=\r\ng and crows) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places would=\r\n not have been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous=\r\n and energised idols have the power to raise the spiritual energies, then w=\r\nhy did &quot;locals&quot; who have always been here, are getting corrupted.=\r\n But, then probably the tamas energies of people coming day in and out have=\r\n overpowered or as you say visitors have made the incense disappear over th=\r\ne period of time.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have one experience to share, which=\r\n is somewhat on similar lines. I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certa=\r\nin &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking bath, they started looking for a cow =\r\nto feed as per the custom. Fortunately or unfortunately, we could found a f=\r\new (around 10) sitting at a certain place. But, they were surrounded by som=\r\ne 1000 odd people trying to feed them. And per my estimate a 10000 people w=\r\nould have already fed them per their &quot;Custom&quot;. Now, does it reall=\r\ny make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already had her quota of 3-4 days, =\r\nprobably leading her to have digestion or food poisoning problems. I tried =\r\nto convince my parents not to try to feed the, but could not succeed. And t=\r\nhe whole day felt bad about it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In general, whatever ho=\r\nly place I have visited, I have hardly found it spiritual enough and have m=\r\nostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always happen to see plentiful cases of =\r\nuseless greed which make me feel that to keep whatever goodness is left in =\r\none, he or she should never visit these places. As they are highly filled w=\r\nith Tamas now.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sriram&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

However, eventually the smell=\r\n will be gone!

At &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the same time, some n=\r\not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; presence=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna=\r\n temple &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there=\r\n), Girnar hills in Gujarat and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamala=\r\ni (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tremendous amount of =\r\nspiritual energy in those places. There are several temples &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; where=\r\n the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;ali=\r\nve&quot;. I did &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not get the same impression at the famous Kaligha=\r\nt temple which is also in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Calcutta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; taken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over =\r\nTamil Nadu &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 200=\r\n6. I never heard of that &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; temple before and it seemed like a=\r\n small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the divine Mother=C2=\r\n=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;=\r\nim&quot;&gt;\n&gt; understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I c=\r\nlosed my eyes &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and started meditating with my mantra in front of t=\r\nhe idol, I was dazzled by a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vision of a very fierce goddess whose=\r\n face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that there was a powerful=\r\n presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; name of the=\r\n place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; g=\r\noddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided =\r\nthat the goddess &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only=\r\n 5 min and left in a hurry, I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; was very pleased with that temple. =\r\nSomeone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; name of the temple and=\r\n goddess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Like this, I am =\r\nsure there are many temples with a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; powerful divine presence acros=\r\ns India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Apart from the Ka=\r\nali temple at Dakshineshwar, one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of my best experiences when medi=\r\ntating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Aalandi near Pune. I =\r\nam sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; underg=\r\nround chamber there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Even the middle of a busy roa=\r\nd in India is better &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for meditating than a temple in USA. These w=\r\nestern countries are so filled with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rajas and tamas. There is raj=\r\nas in India too, but there is a good amount of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sattwa there. Thus=\r\n, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vi=\r\new is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; really good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If o=\r\nne has a chance to spend a few months doing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spiritual sadhana nea=\r\nr a temple, I suggest the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanas=\r\ni, Vrindavan &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mant=\r\nralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; central India.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There are many other good places, but the above &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there f=\r\nor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing =\r\na spiritual &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Do &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rologer.org/&lt;/=\r\na&gt; homam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Do &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://ro=\r\nloger.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rologer.org/&lt;/a&gt; tarpana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a=\r\n&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;/a&gt; group/vedi=\r\nc- wisdom&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Free &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nvedicastro.&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/a&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Free &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rologer.o=\r\nrg&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jyotish &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; writings: =\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://yahoo.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;/a&gt; group/JyotishWri tings&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; Sri &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagan&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://nat=\r\nh.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   From: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   Astr=\r\no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   Seeker &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;   &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   AM&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;   &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;       Respected Narsimhaji,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n         &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;         I would like to know your opinion on h=\r\noly places (famous temples &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;         etc) in today&#39;s time.
