Please tell us why we should listen to you, not him. Specifically, you=\r\n insist chitta is a tattwa. Whereas when VC uses the word Chitta as a verb,=\r\n i.e. consciousness, then this property is only possessed by Brahman becaus=\r\ne only it is Sat-chitta-ananda. When VC uses this word as a noun, it is use=\r\nd as a modification of antahakarana (whose other three modifications are ma=\r\nnas, ahamkara and buddhi). So to put this is context, VC clearly implies th=\r\nat at the material level of tattwas, we see the Linga Sarira. One of the co=\r\nnstructs of Linga sarira is antahakrana. One of its &quot;modifications&quot; is chit=\r\nta. I take this to mean (since I take that only Brahman can have true chitt=\r\na (verb))it is that property of the antahakarana that, when enlivened by Br=\r\nahman, gives awareness/consciousness to the Linga sarira.\n\nHow exactly am I=\r\n wrong. Only facts and explanations please, no proof by ridicule/intimidati=\r\non. \n\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n\n&gt; Patanjalis&#39; Chitta Vrittis&#39; correspond to th=\r\ne 5 tattwas and are all happening on the background of Chitta, the all-perv=\r\nading 6th tattwa. The normal-human- experience happens by the 5 modificatio=\r\nns/ movement of Chitta (finest creation).\n&gt; \n&gt; How would the Soul become aw=\r\nare of the more material Aakash Tattwa (and thus a single coherent self per=\r\nvading the material physical body), if it were not standing behind the Chit=\r\nta (SuperEther) ?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, all our experiences of matter are through non-=\r\nmaterial Chitta, and it doesn&#39;t imply that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist. If you=\r\n could calm all those modifications of Chitta, you would have your self-rea=\r\nlized.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aajnaa chakra lies the primordial state of the universe wh=\r\nere\n&gt; &gt; there is just space and time, but no five elements.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nothing co=\r\nmes out from nothing. How can the lower tattwas evolve from higher tattwas,=\r\n if even their subtle representations are purged from existence altogether =\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; Greatest of the Seers have already put down the scriptures in writin=\r\ng, so that people like us can benefit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nitish\n\n\n\n"}}
