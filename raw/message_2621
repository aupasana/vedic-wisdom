May be it is useful. I haven&#39;t =\r\nread a lot of JK or even Osho (little bits and pieces on the web or an occa=\r\nssional article or so). So I cannot vouch for the truth level of this. You =\r\ncan make your own judgements.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;Begin Quote&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Question: Osho, Can A=\r\nn enlightened person be wrong? This refers to what you told us about J. Kri=\r\nshnamurti, who keeps on saying that one does not Need a Master, which is ac=\r\ntually not right please comment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Osho: Prem Pantha, An Enlightened per=\r\nson can never be wrong. Neither J. Krishnamurti is wrong, but he never cons=\r\niders the situation in which you are. He considers only the space in which =\r\nhe is, and that freedom is part of enlightenment. The enlightened person ha=\r\ns reached the highest peak of consciousness; his abode is on Everest.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNow it is his freedom to speak according to the peak, the sunlit peak where=\r\n he is, or to consider the people who are still in the dark valley, who kno=\r\nw nothing about the light, for whom the peak of the Everest is only a dream=\r\n, only a perhaps&quot;. This is the freedom of the enlightened person. Krishnamu=\r\nrti speaks in terms where he is.\n&gt; \n&gt; I speak in terms where you are, I con=\r\nsider you, because if I am speaking to you, you have to be taken in conside=\r\nration. I have to lead you towards the highest peak, but the journey will b=\r\negin in the dark valley, in your unconsciousness. If I talk about my experi=\r\nence, absolutely inconsiderate of you, I am right, but I am not useful to y=\r\nou.\n&gt; \n&gt; An enlightened person is never wrong, but he can be useful or he c=\r\nan be useless. J. Krishnamurti is useless! He is perfectly right; about tha=\r\nt there is no question, because I know the peak and what he is saying is ce=\r\nrtainly true -- from the vision of the peak. Those who have arrived, for th=\r\nem the journey becomes almost a dream phenomenon. For those who have not ar=\r\nrived the journey is real, the goal is just a dream. They are living in two=\r\n different worlds. When you are talking to a madman you have to consider hi=\r\nm; if you don&#39;t consider him you cannot help him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once a madman was br=\r\nought to me. He had this crazy idea that one afternoon when he was sleeping=\r\n, a fly has entered his mouth. And because he used to sleep with open mouth=\r\n, nobody can deny the possibility. And since then he was very much disturbe=\r\nd because the fly was roaming inside him, jumping inside him, moving in his=\r\n belly, going to his bladder, circulating in his bloodstream, sometimes in =\r\nhis head, sometimes in his feet. And of course he could not do anything bec=\r\nause he was continuously occupied, obsessed with the fly.\n&gt; \n&gt; He was taken=\r\n to the psychoanalysts and they said, &quot;This is just in your mind -- there i=\r\ns no fly! And no fly can move in your bloodstream, there is no possibility.=\r\n Even if a fly has entered it must have died! And now six months have passe=\r\nd; it cannot be alive inside you.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He listened, but he could not belie=\r\nve it because his experience was far more solid. He was taken to the doctor=\r\ns and everybody examined him and they did everything, but finally they will=\r\n say, &quot;It is just a mental thing. You are imagining.&quot; He will listen what t=\r\nhey were saying, but he could not trust because his experience was far more=\r\n certain than their words.\n&gt; \n&gt; His family brought him to me as a last reso=\r\nrt. The man was looking very tired because he was being taken to one person=\r\n, then to another, then all kinds of physicians -- allopaths and homeopaths=\r\n and naturopaths -- and he was really tired. In the first place the fly was=\r\n tiring him, and now all these &quot;pathies&quot;, medicines. And everybody was insu=\r\nlting him -- that was his feeling, that they were saying that he was just i=\r\nmagining. Is he a fool or he is mad, that he will imagine such a thing? The=\r\ny were all humiliating him -- that was his feeling.\n&gt; \n&gt; I looked at the ma=\r\nn and I said, &quot;It is so clear that the fly is inside!&quot;\n&gt; For a moment he wa=\r\ns puzzled. He could not believe me, because nobody has said that to him -- =\r\nbecause nobody has considered him. And they ALL were right and I was wrong =\r\n-- there was no fly, but the madman has to be considered.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I said, =\r\n&quot;All those fools are just wasting your time; you should have come first her=\r\ne. It is such a simple thing to bring the fly out; there is no need to both=\r\ner. Medicines won&#39;t help -- you are not ill. Psycholanalysis will not help =\r\n-- you are not crazy.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; And immediately he was a changed man! He looked=\r\n at his wife and said, &quot;Now what do you say? This is the right man,&quot; he sai=\r\nd, &quot;who really knows. And all those fools were trying to convince me that t=\r\nhere is no fly. It is there!&quot;\n&gt; I said to him that, &quot;It is simple -- we wil=\r\nl take it out. You lie down.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I covered him with a blanket and told hi=\r\nm to keep his eyes closed and &quot;I will do some mantra, some magic, and we wi=\r\nll bring the fly out. You just keep quiet so that the fly sits somewhere. O=\r\ntherwise the fly is continuously running -- where to catch it?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He sai=\r\nd, &quot;That looks logical. I will keep absolutely still!&quot;\n&gt; And I said, &quot;Don&#39;t=\r\n open your eyes. Just remain silent, breathe slowly, so the fly settles som=\r\newhere, so we can catch hold of it!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Then I rushed into the house to f=\r\nind a fly. It was a little bit difficult because for the first time I was t=\r\nrying that, but finally I succeeded -- I could get a fly in a bottle. And I=\r\n came to the man, I moved my hand on his body, and I asked him, &quot;Where the =\r\nfly is?&quot; And he said, &quot;In the belly.&quot; And I touched the belly and I said, &quot;=\r\nOf course it is there!&quot; And I convinced him that I perfectly believe in him=\r\n and then I uncovered his blanket and showed him the fly.\n&gt; \n&gt; And he said =\r\nto the wife, &quot;Now see! And give this bottle to me; I will go all to those f=\r\nools and take all the fees that they have taken from me! I have wasted thou=\r\nsands of rupees, and all that they did was they told me I am mad! And now I=\r\n don&#39;t feel the fly anywhere, because it is in the bottle!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He took th=\r\ne bottle, he went to the doctors.\n&gt; One of the doctors who knew me, he came=\r\n to see me. He said, &quot;How you managed? Six months a fly can live in the bod=\r\ny? And that man has taken his fee back from me, because he was making such =\r\na fuss that I said, &#39;Better give it back to him!&#39; And he proved that he was=\r\n right!&quot;\n&gt; I said, &quot;It is not the point who is right.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Gautam the Budd=\r\nha defines truth as &quot;that which works&quot;. This is the ancient most pragmatic =\r\ndefinition of truth: &quot;that which works&quot;! All the devices are truth in this =\r\nsense: they work; they are only devices. The Buddha&#39;s work is Upaya; Upaya =\r\nexactly means device.\n&gt; \n&gt; Meditation is an Upaya, a device. It simply help=\r\ns you to get rid of that which you have not got in the first place -- the f=\r\nly: the ego, the misery, the anguish! It helps you to get free of it, but i=\r\nn fact it is not there. But it is not to be told...\n&gt; \n&gt; And Krishnamurti h=\r\nas been doing that: he has been telling crazy people that the fly does not =\r\nexist and you don&#39;t need any doctor. I say to you: the fly exists and you n=\r\need the doctor! Because just by telling to you that the fly does not exist =\r\nis not going to help you at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; For thousands of years you have been =\r\ntold the ego does not exist. Has it helped you in any way? There have been =\r\npeople who have told, in this country particularly, that the whole world is=\r\n illusory, MAYA, it does not exist, but has it helped India in any way? The=\r\n true test is there: whether it has helped, whether it has made people more=\r\n authentic, more real. It has not helped at all. It has made people more de=\r\neply cunning, split, schizophrenic; it has made them hypocrites.\n&gt; \n&gt; All t=\r\nhe religions have done this, because they don&#39;t consider you. And you are f=\r\nar more important than the ultimate truth, because the ultimate truth has n=\r\nothing to do with y ou right now. You are living in a dreamworld; some devi=\r\nce is needed which can help you to come out of it. The moment you are out o=\r\nf it, you will know it was a dream -- but a person who is dreaming, to tell=\r\n him that it is all dream is meaningless.\n&gt; \n&gt; Have you not observed in you=\r\nr dreams that when you are dreaming it looks real? And every morning you ha=\r\nve found that it was unreal. hut again in the night you forget all your und=\r\nerstanding of the day -- again the dream becomes real. It has been happenin=\r\ng again and again: every night the dream becomes real, every morning you kn=\r\now it is false, but that knowing does not help. In the dream one can even d=\r\nream that this is a dream.\n&gt; \n&gt; And that&#39;s what has happened in India: peop=\r\nle are living in maya, deeply in it, and still talking that &quot;This is all ma=\r\nya.&quot; And this talk too is part of their dream; it does not destroy the drea=\r\nm. In fact it makes the dream more rooted in them, because now there is no =\r\nneed to get rid of it -- because it is a dream! So why get rid of it? It do=\r\nes not matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; In a subtle way all the religions have done this: they =\r\nhave talked from the highest peak to the people for whom that peak does not=\r\n exist yet. The people are living in darkness, and you go on telling them t=\r\nhat darkness has no existence. It is true -- darkness has no existence, it =\r\nis only the absence of light -- but just by saying to people that darkness =\r\nhas no existence is not going to bring light in.\n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s what Krishnamu=\r\nrti is doing; it has been done by many people. Nagarjuna did it -- Krishnam=\r\nurti is not new, not at least in the East. Nagarjuna did it: he said, &quot;Ever=\r\nything is false. The world is false, the ego is false, nothing exists. Beca=\r\nuse nothing exists you are already free. There is no need for any meditatio=\r\nn, there is no need for any Master. There is no need to find out any device=\r\n, strategy, technique, because in the first place there is no problem. Why =\r\ngo on looking for solutions? Those solutions will create more problems; the=\r\ny are not going to help.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagarjuna did it; before Nagarjuna, Mahakash=\r\nyap did it, and it has been a long tradition. Zen people have been saying t=\r\nhe same thing for centuries. Krishnamurti never uses the word &quot;Zen&quot;, but wh=\r\natsoever he is talking is nothing but Zen -- simple Zen.\n&gt; \n&gt; Zen says no e=\r\nffort is needed, nothing has to be done. When nothing has to be done, what =\r\nis the need of a Master? -- because the Master will tell you to do somethin=\r\ng. Nothing has to be done -- what is the need of the scriptures? -- because=\r\n the scriptures will tell you to do something, to know something. Nothing h=\r\nas to be done, nothing has to be known. You are already there where you are=\r\n trying to reach.\n&gt; \n&gt; And I know this is true, but to talk about this ulti=\r\nmate truth to people who are living in tremendous darkness is futile . Prem=\r\n Pantha, no enlightened person can ever be wrong, but only few enlightened =\r\npersons have been of help. The majority of enlightened people have been of =\r\nno help at all, for the simple reason because they never considered the oth=\r\ner.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, George Gurdjieff used to say, &quot;Don&#39;t consider the other.&quot;=\r\n It was one of his basic teachings: &quot;Don&#39;t consider the other. Just say wha=\r\nt is absolutely true.&quot; But the absolute truth is truth only when experience=\r\nd; people are living in relative truth.\n&gt; \n&gt; My approach is different from =\r\nKrishnamurti&#39;s. I know that one day you will come to that point where nothi=\r\nng is needed -- no Master, no teaching, no scripture -- but right now the s=\r\ncripture can be of help, the methods can be of help, and certainly a living=\r\n Master can be of immense help. The function of the Master is to give you t=\r\nhat which you already have and to take away that which you don&#39;t have at al=\r\nl.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;End Quote&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
