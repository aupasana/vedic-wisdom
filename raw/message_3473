It is a humble request.\nWe also visited Varanasi and the place=\r\ns around 10 years back. Our Master was telling all of us while we were proc=\r\needing to Varanasi, during the course of journey.\n&quot;All of you may find so m=\r\nuch of unclean environment there in Varanasi. You also see cows lying acros=\r\ns the narrow streets leading to the Temple, with all urine and dung split o=\r\nn the road. After taking a holy bath in the Ganges, you may have have to wa=\r\nlk on such narrow paths leading to the Diety and you may feel hatred for th=\r\ne place. The Purohits at the Ganges demand huge amounts of money and many p=\r\neople seem to take advantage of our needs and encash illegally. But underst=\r\nand that the people born at Varanasi are fortunate. People desire and make =\r\nattempts to have their last breath there, but it is not possible to all.\n\nN=\r\now let you realize a truth behind this. In Varanasi, there are lakhs and la=\r\nkhs of SIVALINGAS in the earth, and anywhere you try to dig, you get one.. =\r\nThat means you are virtually walking with your feet over the Lord, all alon=\r\ng the places in Varanasi. How painful it is to keep your feet and walk over=\r\n The Almighty. So remember the energies floating in the place and even belo=\r\nw your feet Lord is present. Don&#39;t get hatredness and feel bad about the un=\r\ncleanliness environment. \n\nMake yourself modified, transformed to contain s=\r\nuch unclean environment, and see only the abundant energy prevailing there.=\r\n It is but very difficult to improve on whatever is said about the cleanles=\r\nsness.Whenever we visit a holy place, when we come back from the visit, we =\r\nhave to learn some positive lessons, and the lesson here is &quot;STOP HATING AN=\r\nYONE, EVEN IN SLUMS AND MOST UN-HYGENIC PLACES, TRY TO SEE THE ALMIGHTY IN =\r\nTHOSE DIRTY AND SMELLING AREAS. REALIZE THE SAD STATE OF AFFAIRS PREVAILING=\r\n TO SOME OF OUR CO-HUMANS.&quot;\n\nSo when we visit Varanasi and see all kinds of=\r\n hopeless things as described by you, we should try to weigh them in the ba=\r\nck drop of the High Energies prevailing there, and from that point, we shou=\r\nld learn to love people as and when, it is an instant that have to hate the=\r\nm.\n\nThis requires a transformation in us, and we should go only with such p=\r\nrior preparation=C2=A0 for pilgrimages. We should also find some positive c=\r\nhanges in our performance, character, behavior after any visit to a holy pl=\r\nace , a temple or a Master. Then the purpose served.\n\nWhen you will leave s=\r\nomething in the Ganges, with a vow not to have it in future, you observe pe=\r\nople leaving vegetables, fruits etc. You may also find many leaving things =\r\nthey really do not like.\n\nBut what you have to leave for ever in Ganges, is=\r\n the angular points of character to be rounded off, anger, hatreds, jealous=\r\ny,narrow mind,stubbornness and so on. Thus every visit makes us polished.\n\n=\r\nThis is not to hurt the feelings, or not to look down the deficiencies poin=\r\nted out. But to accept the realities, expect the unexpected and utilize the=\r\n visit as an opportunity to make amends to personality.\nLove and Blessings =\r\nto you.\nUncle Bala Krishna Murthi, Vijayawada.\n----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n--- On Sun, 17/1=\r\n/10, padmaja.yarlagadda &lt;padmaja.yarlagadda@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: padmaj=\r\na.yarlagadda &lt;padmaja.yarlagadda@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Holipla=\r\nces and Cleanliness.\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Sunday, 17 Janu=\r\nary, 2010, 8:18 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Namaste a=\r\nll,\n\n\n\nCan someone please help me on how to overcome the following weakness=\r\n of mine?\n\n\n\nHow much importance should we give to the cleanliness of the h=\r\noly places like Haridwar, Varanasi etc?
