But, my view is that anybody interested in spiritual progress can do homam.\n \nToday&#39;s caste system is quite rigid unlike the fluid system of the old days. Ideally, one&#39;s varna is based on one&#39;s aptitude and attitude. One interested in knowledge and spiritual progress is a Brahmana. One interested in power and control over others and protecting others is a Kshatriya. One interested in money is a vaisya. One interested in physical pleasures is a Shudra.\n \nOne gets the caste of father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one grows, one&#39;s conditioning from previous lives blossoms and one develops an aptitude of one&#39;s own and gets one&#39;s own caste. It need not be one&#39;s birth caste. For example, Valmiki was a Shudra by birth, but became a brahmana and then a Maharshi. Vishwamitra was a Kshatriya by birth, but became a brahmana and then a Maharshi.\n \nIf one is doing homam and other intense spiritual sadhanas for power, control, money etc, it is a messy thing. But, if one is primarily interested in spiritual progress, then one IS a braahmana and one can do homam to remove weaknesses and make spiritual progress.\n \n(2) Upanayanam is essentially learning the mantra that takes one to god (i.e. Gayatri mantra). Yes, serious sadhana requires learning a mantra or a ritual or a procedure that takes one to god. But, if you haven&#39;t learnt Gayatri mantra, that does not mean you cannot reach god. If you learn homam and do it regularly, that can also take you to god. In that case, Ganapathi homam or Mahalakshami homam is doing the job that Gayatri mantra would&#39;ve done. Thus, learning homam is replacing learning Gayatri mantra (or upanayanam).\n \nYes, one without a formal Gayatri mantropadesa can do homam.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- alokam &lt;alokamanr@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Respected Sri Narasimhaji.\n&gt; namaste. My name is Nageswara Rao. I am residing in Vizag. Ima interested in doing Sri mahalakshmi Homam at home using super short proceedure. I have two doubts about this. I request you to kindly help me.\n&gt; \n&gt; My first doubt is I am non brahmin. Are non brahmins permited to do homams on thier own?\n&gt; \n&gt; As non brahmin upanayanam was not performed for me by parents as the tradition is not in our community. Are the people who did not undergo upanayanam can do homam on their own?\n&gt; \n&gt; These are two doubts I have in my mind sir, kindly guide me on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and regards\n&gt; Nageswara Rao\n\n\n"}}
