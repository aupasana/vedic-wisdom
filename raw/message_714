His &quot;The Life Divine&quot;, which is conisdered by many as=\r\n &#39;The Veda of the New Age&#39;, contains that philosophy. But to delve into it =\r\nfor the first time is very difficult, unless you know the basic philosophy =\r\nof Sri Aurobindo. So if you at first read the following books, it would be =\r\nhelpful to understand &quot;The Life Divine&quot;.\n\nYou may at first read the followi=\r\nng three books:\n  1. The Hour of God.\n  2. Bases of yoga.\n  3. The Mother.\n=\r\n\nThese are small books. They contain Sri Aurbindo&#39;s basic philosophy and th=\r\ne basis of His Integral Yoga.\n\nAfter that you may read the following books =\r\nin the order that follows:\n\n  4. Essays on the Gita\n  5.The Letters on Yoga=\r\n- 4 volumes.\n\nAfter finishing those books, you will gain a solid basis on t=\r\nhe philosophy and yoga of Sri Aurobindo. The start reading the following bo=\r\noks:\n\n6. The Synthesis of Yoga.\n7. The Life Divine\n8.The Upanishads.\n9.The =\r\nSecret of the Veda\n10.Hymns to the Mystic Fire.\n11. Savitri\n\nHe also have w=\r\nritten many books on social and political thoughts.\n\nAs an introduction to =\r\nthe Philosophy, Yoga and Life of Sri Aurobindo, you may read at first a boo=\r\nk on Sri Aurobindo by Satprem. It is now considered by many as a classic. T=\r\nhe title of the book is &quot; Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness.&quot;=\r\n\n\nLastly, please read what The Mahayogi has writteen about his yoga:\nThe fo=\r\nllowing is from SABCL, Vol. 26, &quot;Sri Aurobindo on Himself&quot;, pp. 95-97.\n\nThe=\r\n teaching of Sri Aurobindo starts from that of the ancient sages of India t=\r\nhat behind the appearances of the universe there is the Reality of a Being =\r\nand Consciousness, a Self of all things, one and eternal. All beings are un=\r\nited in that One Self and Spirit but divided by a certain separativity of c=\r\nonsciousness, an ignorance of their true Self and Reality in the mind, life=\r\n and body. It is possible by a certain psychological discipline to remove t=\r\nhis veil of separative consciousness and become aware of the true Self, the=\r\n Divinity within us and all. \n\nSri Aurobindo&#39;s teaching states that this On=\r\ne Being and Consciousness is involved here in Matter. Evolution is the meth=\r\nod by which it liberates itself; consciousness appears in what seems to be =\r\ninconscient, and once having appeared is self-impelled to grow higher and h=\r\nigher and at the same time to enlarge and develop towards a greater and gre=\r\nater perfection. Life is the first step of this release of consciousness; m=\r\nind is the second; but the evolution does not finish with mind, it awaits a=\r\n release into something greater, a consciousness which is spiritual and sup=\r\nramental. The next step of the evolution must be towards the development of=\r\n Supermind and Spirit as the dominant power in the conscious being. For onl=\r\ny then will the involved Divinity in things release itself entirely and it =\r\nbecome possible for life to manifest perfection. \n\nBut while the former ste=\r\nps in evolution were taken by Nature without a conscious will in the plant =\r\nand animal life, in man Nature becomes able to evolve by a conscious will i=\r\nn the instrument. It is not, however, by the mental will in man that this c=\r\nan be wholly done, for the mind goes only to a certain point and after that=\r\n can only move in a circle. A conversion has to be made, a turning of the c=\r\nonsciousness by which mind has to change into the higher principle. This me=\r\nthod is to be found through the ancient psychological discipline and practi=\r\nce of Yoga. In the past, it has been attempted by a drawing away from the w=\r\norld and a disappearance into the height of the Self or Spirit. Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo teaches that a descent of the higher principle is possible which will no=\r\nt merely release the spiritual Self out of the world, but release it in the=\r\n world, replace the mind&#39;s ignorance or its very limited knowledge by a sup=\r\nramental Truth-Consciousness which will be a sufficient instrument of the i=\r\nnner Self and make it possible for the human being to find himself dynamica=\r\nlly as well as inwardly and grow out of his still animal humanity into a di=\r\nviner race. The psychological discipline of Yoga can be used to that end by=\r\n opening all the parts of the being to a conversion or transformation throu=\r\ngh the descent and working of the higher still concealed supramental princi=\r\nple. \n\nThis, however, cannot be done at once or in a short time or by any r=\r\napid or miraculous transformation. Many steps have to be taken by the seeke=\r\nr before the supramental descent is possible. Man lives mostly in his surfa=\r\nce mind, life and body, but there is an inner being within him with greater=\r\n possibilities to which he has to awake - for it is only a very restricted =\r\ninfluence from it that he receives now and that pushes him to a constant pu=\r\nrsuit of a greater beauty, harmony, power and knowledge. The first process =\r\nof Yoga is therefore to open the ranges of this inner being and to live fro=\r\nm there outward, governing his outward life by an inner light and force. In=\r\n doing so he discovers in himself his true soul which is not this outer mix=\r\nture of mental, vital and physical elements but something of the Reality be=\r\nhind them, a spark from the one Divine Fire. He has to learn to live in his=\r\n soul and purify and orientate by its drive towards the Truth the rest of t=\r\nhe nature. There can follow afterwards an opening upward and descent of a h=\r\nigher principle of the Being. But even then it is not at once the full supr=\r\namental Light and Force. For there are several ranges of consciousness betw=\r\neen the ordinary human mind and the supramental Truth-Consciousness. These =\r\nintervening ranges have to be opened up and their power brought down into t=\r\nhe mind, life and body. Only afterwards can the full power of the Truth-Con=\r\nsciousness work in the nature. The process of this self-discipline or Sadha=\r\nna is therefore long and difficult, but even a little of it is so much gain=\r\ned because it makes the ultimate release and perfection more possible. \n\nTh=\r\nere are many things belonging to older systems that are necessary on the wa=\r\ny - an opening of the mind to a greater wideness and to the sense of the Se=\r\nlf and the Infinite, an emergence into what has been called the cosmic cons=\r\nciousness, mastery over the desires and passions; an outward asceticism is =\r\nnot essential, but the conquest of desire and attachment and a control over=\r\n the body and its needs, greeds and instincts are indispensable. There is a=\r\n combination of the principles of the old systems, the way of knowledge thr=\r\nough the mind&#39;s discernment between Reality and the appearance, the heart&#39;s=\r\n way of devotion, love and surrender and the way of works turning the will =\r\naway from motives of self-interest to the Truth and the service of a greate=\r\nr Reality than the ego. For the whole being has to be trained so that it ca=\r\nn respond and be transformed when it is possible for that greater Light and=\r\n Force to work in the nature. \n\nIn this discipline, the inspiration of the =\r\nMaster, and in the difficult stages his control and his presence are indisp=\r\nensable - for it would be impossible otherwise to go through it without muc=\r\nh stumbling and error which would prevent all chance of success. The Master=\r\n is one who has risen to a higher consciousness and being and he is often r=\r\negarded as its manifestation or representative. He not only helps by his te=\r\naching and still more by his influence and example but by a power to commun=\r\nicate his own experience to others. \n\nThis is Sri Aurobindo&#39;s teaching and =\r\nmethod of practice. It is not his object to develop any one religion or to =\r\namalgamate the older religions or to found any new religion - for any of th=\r\nese things would lead away from his central purpose. The one aim of his Yog=\r\na is an inner self-development by which each one who follows it can in time=\r\n discover the One Self in all and evolve a higher consciousness than the me=\r\nntal, a spiritual and supramental consciousness which will transform and di=\r\nvinise human nature. \n\nWarm regards\n\nDilip Banerjee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  ----- Original =\r\nMessage ----- \n  From: jitender dahiya \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com =\r\n\n  Sent: Monday, December 01, 2008 9:38 PM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Books\n=\r\n\n\n        Namaste to all\n\n        i have heard a lot about Sri Aurobindo\n  =\r\n      can somebody recommend 2 or 3 of his books,\n        actually there ar=\r\ne lot of books written by him\n\n        regards\n        jitender\n       \n\n\n\n=\r\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n  Connect with friends all over the world.

All beings are united in \n=\r\nthat One Self and Spirit but divided by a certain separativity of conscious=\r\nness, \nan ignorance of their true Self and Reality in the mind, life and bo=\r\ndy. It is \npossible by a certain psychological discipline to remove this ve=\r\nil of separative \nconsciousness and become aware of the true Self, the Divi=\r\nnity within us and all. \n&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Sri Aurobindo&#39;s teaching states that this =\r\nOne Being and Consciousness is \ninvolved here in Matter. Evolution is the m=\r\nethod by which it liberates itself; \nconsciousness appears in what seems to=\r\n be inconscient, and once having appeared \nis self-impelled to grow higher =\r\nand higher and at the same time to enlarge and \ndevelop towards a greater a=\r\nnd greater perfection. Life is the first step of this \nrelease of conscious=\r\nness; mind is the second; but the evolution does not finish \nwith mind, it =\r\nawaits a release into something greater, a consciousness which is \nspiritua=\r\nl and supramental. The next step of the evolution must be towards the \ndeve=\r\nlopment of Supermind and Spirit as the dominant power in the conscious \nbei=\r\nng. For only then will the involved Divinity in things release itself \nenti=\r\nrely and it become possible for life to manifest perfection. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;But wh=\r\nile the former steps in evolution were taken by Nature without a \nconscious=\r\n will in the plant and animal life, in man Nature becomes able to \nevolve b=\r\ny a conscious will in the instrument. It is not, however, by the mental \nwi=\r\nll in man that this can be wholly done, for the mind goes only to a certain=\r\n \npoint and after that can only move in a circle. A conversion has to be ma=\r\nde, a \nturning of the consciousness by which mind has to change into the hi=\r\ngher \nprinciple. This method is to be found through the ancient psychologic=\r\nal \ndiscipline and practice of Yoga. In the past, it has been attempted by =\r\na drawing \naway from the world and a disappearance into the height of the S=\r\nelf or Spirit. \nSri Aurobindo teaches that a descent of the higher principl=\r\ne is possible which \nwill not merely release the spiritual Self out of the =\r\nworld, but release it in \nthe world, replace the mind&#39;s ignorance or its ve=\r\nry limited knowledge by a \nsupramental Truth-Consciousness which will be a =\r\nsufficient instrument of the \ninner Self and make it possible for the human=\r\n being to find himself dynamically \nas well as inwardly and grow out of his=\r\n still animal humanity into a diviner \nrace. The psychological discipline o=\r\nf Yoga can be used to that end by opening \nall the parts of the being to a =\r\nconversion or transformation through the descent \nand working of the higher=\r\n still concealed supramental principle. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;This, however, cannot be do=\r\nne at once or in a short time or by any rapid or \nmiraculous transformation=\r\n. Many steps have to be taken by the seeker before the \nsupramental descent=\r\n is possible. Man lives mostly in his surface mind, life and \nbody, but the=\r\nre is an inner being within him with greater possibilities to which \nhe has=\r\n to awake - for it is only a very restricted influence from it that he \nrec=\r\neives now and that pushes him to a constant pursuit of a greater beauty, \nh=\r\narmony, power and knowledge. The first process of Yoga is therefore to open=\r\n the \nranges of this inner being and to live from there outward, governing =\r\nhis outward \nlife by an inner light and force. In doing so he discovers in =\r\nhimself his true \nsoul which is not this outer mixture of mental, vital and=\r\n physical elements but \nsomething of the Reality behind them, a spark from =\r\nthe one Divine Fire. He has \nto learn to live in his soul and purify and or=\r\nientate by its drive towards the \nTruth the rest of the nature. There can f=\r\nollow afterwards an opening upward and \ndescent of a higher principle of th=\r\ne Being. But even then it is not at once the \nfull supramental Light and Fo=\r\nrce. For there are several ranges of consciousness \nbetween the ordinary hu=\r\nman mind and the supramental Truth-Consciousness. These \nintervening ranges=\r\n have to be opened up and their power brought down into the \nmind, life and=\r\n body. Only afterwards can the full power of the \nTruth-Consciousness work =\r\nin the nature. The process of this self-discipline or \nSadhana is therefore=\r\n long and difficult, but even a little of it is so much \ngained because it =\r\nmakes the ultimate release and perfection more possible. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;There are =\r\nmany things belonging to older systems that are necessary on the \nway - an =\r\nopening of the mind to a greater wideness and to the sense of the Self \nand=\r\n the Infinite, an emergence into what has been called the cosmic \nconscious=\r\nness, mastery over the desires and passions; an outward asceticism is \nnot =\r\nessential, but the conquest of desire and attachment and a control over the=\r\n \nbody and its needs, greeds and instincts are indispensable. There is a \nc=\r\nombination of the principles of the old systems, the way of knowledge throu=\r\ngh \nthe mind&#39;s discernment between Reality and the appearance, the heart&#39;s =\r\nway of \ndevotion, love and surrender and the way of works turning the will =\r\naway from \nmotives of self-interest to the Truth and the service of a great=\r\ner Reality than \nthe ego.

The Master is one who has risen to a higher \nconsciousness and being and=\r\n he is often regarded as its manifestation or \nrepresentative. He not only =\r\nhelps by his teaching and still more by his \ninfluence and example but by a=\r\n power to communicate his own experience to \nothers. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;This is Sri Au=\r\nrobindo&#39;s teaching and method of practice. It is not his object \nto develop=\r\n any one religion or to amalgamate the older religions or to found any \nnew=\r\n religion - for any of these things would lead away from his central purpos=\r\ne. \nThe one aim of his Yoga is an inner self-development by which each one =\r\nwho \nfollows it can in time discover the One Self in all and evolve a highe=\r\nr \nconsciousness than the mental, a spiritual and supramental consciousness=\r\n which \nwill transform and divinise human nature. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Warm regards&lt;/P&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;P&gt;Dilip Banerjee&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-=\r\nLEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: =\r\n0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial; font-color: blac=\r\nk&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; \n  &lt;A title=3Ddahiyajiten@... \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:dah=\r\niyajiten@...&quot;&gt;jitender dahiya&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt=\r\n arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; \n  &lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Monday, December 01, 2008 9:=\r\n38 \n  PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Books&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n  &lt;P&gt;\n  &lt;TABLE ce=\r\nllSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n    &lt;TBODY&gt;\n    &lt;TR&gt;\n      &lt;TD vA=\r\nlign=3Dtop&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;Namaste to all&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n   =\r\n     &lt;DIV&gt;i have heard a lot about Sri Aurobindo&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;can som=\r\nebody recommend&nbsp;2 or 3&nbsp;of his books,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;actually =\r\nthere are lot of books written by him&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n     =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;jitender&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;!--1--&gt;\n  &lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n  &lt;/HR&gt;Connect with =\r\nfriends all over the world. &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_me=\r\nssenger_1/*http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/?wm=3Dn/&quot;&gt;Get \n  Yahoo!
