Yes, the Chandi is a siddh=\r\na text. Siddha in the sense of being &quot;accomplished for Self realization&quot; as=\r\n well as &quot;siddhis&quot;, depending on the inclination and capacity of the sadhak=\r\na and of course Her will.\n&gt; \n&gt; To understand why it is so, one has to do sa=\r\ndhana and keep praying to Her. Intellectual comprehension falls flat beyond=\r\n a point. It is plain useless.=C2=A0And the sadhana is not a one day/few mo=\r\nnths/one year or few years process. It is=C2=A0like an endless ocean, there=\r\n are simply no limits except for the ones you set for yourself in your own =\r\nmind.
