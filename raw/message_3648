However understand that a Chand=\r\ni homa is homa of the 13 chapters.

Kindly let me know =\r\nthe procedure if I am using just the Durga suktam for performing the homam.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nThe Durga Suktam is a Vedic Suktam. The pronunciation is a key here=\r\n.

The pronunc=\r\niation is a key here. But why not start with a Chapter from teh actual Shap=\r\ntasati for homa. That would be the best strategy, I feel.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT co=\r\nlor=3D#00007f&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/S=\r\nTRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 4/2/10, Girish &lt;I&gt;&lt;gisundar@yaho=\r\no. com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,2=\r\n55) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: Girish &lt;gisundar@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Query on Chandi Homam&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nDate: Thursday, 4 February, 2010, 11:28 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1998024496&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskarams Narasimhaji and =\r\nother Masters,&lt;BR&gt;I have been following the discussions on Aghori practices=\r\n and accounts in the smashan bhumi homams with great interest and curiosity=\r\n. I also managed to read some portions of the Aghora series by Svoboda. Whi=\r\nle I have been doing the Ganapathi homam for the past few months as regular=\r\nly as I can , I have always been very drawn to bhagawati / Devi upasanas. I=\r\n get very emotional whenever I hear a great song/ name of the devi or see a=\r\nn endearing image of the mother. I have to stop my tears with great effort =\r\nin such situiations. This does not happen with any other God /deity .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;1) Does this mean that Devi pooja is more suitable to me ? Or is it just =\r\nmy mind at working overtime. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After reading the accounts there is an=\r\n intense desire to perform the Chandi homam. But before that I need to beco=\r\nme comfortable with the Chandi recitation. That seems to be some time away =\r\nconsidering that its an exhaustive\n script. While I continue to work on thi=\r\ns path, I wanted to do some kind of homam for the devi in the mean time.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Is it possible to recite only specific portions from the Chandi for=\r\n the Chandi homam instead of going through the entore 700 verses?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3)=\r\n Can I use some other mantras like only the Chandi Beeja mantra &quot;om ai=C3=\r\n=A0 hr=C3=A9=C3=A0 kl=C3=A9=C3=A0 c=C3=A4mu=C3=AB=C3=B2=C3=A4yai vicce&quot; .&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) Alternatively can I perform the homam using the Durga Suktam . Kin=\r\ndly let me know the procedure if I am using just the Durga suktam for perfo=\r\nrming the homam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks and Regards with my humble pranaams,&lt;BR&gt;Giri=\r\nsh Sundaram.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABL=\r\nE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nYour Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized IE8.=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_ie8_new/*http://downloads.yahoo.=\r\ncom/in/internetexplorer/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;Get it NOW!&lt;/A&gt;.\n&lt;=\r\nP&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3Dx-dns-prefetch-control content=3Don&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;!-- cg30.c4.mail.gq1.yahoo.com compressed/chunked Sun Jan 31 20:46:37=\r\n PST 2010 --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-782474285-1265394813=:61011--\r\n\n"}}
