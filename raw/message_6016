I was thinking about the recent earthquake=\r\n and the tsunami which followed and did the most damage in Japan. The ways =\r\nof karma are mysterious and like Vimalananda says in the aghora series &quot; Ka=\r\nrma gahano gatih &quot; . \n\n 2011-2012 transition is bringing its own share of n=\r\natural disasters.\n\n1.Floods in pakistan last year which took a huge toll. \n=\r\n\n( Could be due to the huge violence this region has inflicted on the world=\r\n continously in the past few decades ) \n\n2.Floods in Australia in Jan/Feb w=\r\nhich also took a huge toll\n\nand now the Earthquake/Tsunami in Japan.  Why s=\r\nhould nature react in these places.\n\nJapan it turns out is the biggest kill=\r\ner of whales every year. Japan continues to hunt wild whales in numbers exc=\r\needing 2000 every year under the guise of scientific hunting.No other moder=\r\nn country does this.The ICW often criticizes the japanese for doing this . =\r\n\n\nhttp://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/whales/\n\n\nSurely this act of killing=\r\n so many of Maa&#39;s children in the water maybe brought about her wrath throu=\r\ngh the water .\n\nI have heard many modern day guru&#39;s talk about 2011-2012 be=\r\ning a lesson to humanity to learn to respect life in all forms and stop pol=\r\nluting mother earth and the constant killing . It is not earth that is in d=\r\nanger,it is man for nature can easily swat us like a mosquito with a giant =\r\ntsunami or earthquake.\n\n\nThe directive of the mother goddess to Manish ji a=\r\nnd Narasimha ji and the noble intent to heal the etheric atmosphere of the =\r\nearth through many people taking up homa is commendable in letting people c=\r\norrect their course before nature decides to take drastic action. \n\nRegards=\r\n\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
