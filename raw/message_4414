She worked in the kitchen and her devotion to Sri Bhagavan was\nto=\r\ntal. Since she served all with love, everyone at the Ashram loved her, and\n=\r\nwherever she stayed people surrounded her to listen to her expositions\ndesc=\r\nribing her life with Sri Bhagavan.\n\nA villager had a dream in which he was =\r\ntold to offer his next calf to\nRamanasramam. He brought his cow and the cal=\r\nf to Bhagavan. The jungle around\nthe Ashram was thick at that time and ther=\r\ne were cheetahs. The Ashram people\nwere perplexed and refused the offer, bu=\r\nt the villager was taking his dream\nseriously and would not take the calf a=\r\nway. The mother cow had to remain\nwith the calf to feed her. Finally, the c=\r\now and the calf were entrusted to a\ndevotee in the town. The calf became th=\r\ne famous cow Lakshmi. She grew up and\nhad three calves within a few years. =\r\nShe would come daily to the Ashram to\nhave her meals, graze on the Ashram l=\r\nand, enter the Hall and sit contentedly\nnear Bhagavan. In the evening, she =\r\nwould go back to the town as other women\ndid.\n\nOnce Lakshmi came into the H=\r\nall. She was pregnant at that time. It was after\nlunch time when Bhagavan w=\r\nas reading the newspapers. Lakshmi came near and\nstarted licking the papers=\r\n. Bhagavan looked up and said: &quot;Wait a little,\nLakshmi.&quot; But Lakshmi went o=\r\nn licking. Bhagavan laid his paper aside, put\nhis hands behind Lakshmi&#39;s ho=\r\nrns and his head against hers. Like this they\nstayed for quite a long time.=\r\n I stood nearby looking at the wonderful scene.\nAfter some ten minutes or s=\r\no, Bhagavan turned to me and said: &quot;Do you know\nwhat Lakshmi is doing? She =\r\nis in Samadhi.&quot;\n\nI looked at her and tears were flowing in streams down her=\r\n broad cheeks. Her\nbreathing had stopped and her eyes were fixed on Bhagava=\r\nn. After some time\nBhagavan changed his position and asked: &quot;Lakshmi, how d=\r\no you feel now?&quot;\nLakshmi moved backward, as if reluctant to turn her tail t=\r\nowards Bhagavan,\nwalked round the Hall and went out.\n\nOn the fourth day Lak=\r\nshmi gave birth to a calf. The man with whom Lakshmi\nused to stay brought h=\r\ner with her progeny and left them in the Ashram for\ngood. Lakshmi, with her=\r\n three calves, came into the Hall and lay down by the\nsofa. Bhagavan saw he=\r\nr and said: &quot;All these days Lakshmi had to go in the\nevening to the town an=\r\nd she was always leaving in tears. Today she is\ndelighted for she need not =\r\ngo away anymore. She knows that her home is here\nnow. We have to look after=\r\n her. Look at her. With what self-assurance she\nhas stretched herself out!&quot;=\r\n\n\nIn those days, before Bhagavan took his meals he would go around and see =\r\nif\nall the animals, like dogs and birds, had been properly fed. Then he wou=\r\nld\ngo and see if the cattle were looked after well. Even iddlies had to be\n=\r\ngiven to the cows and calves. Sometimes the Ashram iddlies were all eaten u=\r\np\nby the cows and we had to send to the town for more, lest Bhagavan should=\r\n\nreproach us for stingy cooking. Then he would see that the beggars at the\n=\r\nAshram gate were also fed. If there was no bean soup (rassam) ready for the=\r\n\nbeggars, to go with their rice, he would order sambar to be distributed.\n\n=\r\nDuring the Kartikai festival beggars from all over South India would collec=\r\nt\nat Tiruvannamalai in vast crowds and they would flock to the Ashram for a=\r\nn\nassured meal. Once they became so unruly that the attendants refused to\ns=\r\nerve them. The matter was discussed among the workers and it was decided to=\r\n\nabandon the distribution of food to beggars.\n\nThat night I had the followi=\r\nng dream: Bhagavan&#39;s Hall was full of devotees.\nOn the sofa appeared a smal=\r\nl creature which gradually grew until it became a\nhuge, bright-red horse. T=\r\nhe horse went round the Hall, sniffing at each\ndevotee in turn. I was afrai=\r\nd he would come near me, but the horse went to\nBhagavan, licked him all ove=\r\nr the body and disappeared. Bhagavan called me\nnear and asked me not to be =\r\nafraid. A divine perfume emanated from him. He\nsaid: &quot;Don&#39;t think it is an =\r\nordinary horse. As soon as the flags are hoisted\nat Arunachaleshwara Temple=\r\n for the Kartikai festival, gods come down to\npartake in the celebrations. =\r\nThey join the crowd and some mix with the\nbeggars at the Ashram gate. So ne=\r\nver stop feeding sadhus and beggars at\nfestivals.&quot; I told the dream to Chin=\r\nnaswami Swami, and that day he ordered\nseven measures of rice to be cooked =\r\nfor the beggars.\n\nTwo women came from Kumbakonam to meet Bhagavan. One of t=\r\nhem was a guru and\nthe other her disciple. They were leaving by train the s=\r\name evening. In the\nafternoon the disciple brought her guru into the Hall a=\r\nnd made an elaborate\nseat for her in front of Bhagavan. Every now and then =\r\nthe disciple would go\nup to Bhagavan&#39;s sofa and whisper. &quot;In everything, sh=\r\ne is just like you,\nSwami...she is in the same state as yourself.... Please=\r\n let us have your\nblessings.... Will you teach us briefly the path of salva=\r\ntion? What is\nattachment? How to be free from Maya?&quot; She was going on like =\r\nthis for quite\na long time. Bhagavan never replied. Evening was nearing. Th=\r\ne disciple felt\nhurt. &quot;Swami, please instruct us...Swami, proceed with init=\r\niation quickly,\nit is getting late.... Be quick, Swami. You know we have to=\r\n catch the train.\nHurry!&quot; The poor lady was getting desperate. &quot;At least te=\r\nll us something.\nThey all speak of ignorance, what is ignorance?&quot; Bhagavan =\r\nturned to\nMuruganar and, in his mercy, said: &quot;Ask her to inquire within. Wh=\r\no is\nignorant?&quot; Muruganar told them: &quot;Now you go, your initiation is over.&quot;=\r\n And\nthey went away.\n\nBhagavan talked about it later: &quot;Everything must be d=\r\none in a hurry.\nEverybody has some train to catch. They visit Swami in a ru=\r\nsh and want to\ncarry away a parcel of liberation. They read something here =\r\nand there and\nthink they are quite learned.&quot; (Whenever there was a chance t=\r\no snub our ego,\nBhagavan would never miss it). He continued: &quot;Before the pe=\r\nople come here,\neveryone has the most sincere desire to work for his own li=\r\nberation, but\nwhen they settle down, the ego goes to their heads and they f=\r\norget why they\ncame. They imagine they are doing me great service by feedin=\r\ng me and think\naltogether too much of themselves. The feeling of self-impor=\r\ntance that they\nhave when they serve their guru destroys their hope of enli=\r\nghtenment. Only\nhumility can destroy the ego. The ego keeps you far away fr=\r\nom God. The door\nto God is open, but the lintel is very low. To enter one h=\r\nas to bend.\n\nIn the kitchen, there were no proper jars for foodstuffs and e=\r\nverything was\nkept in tins and pots which would leak and spill and make the=\r\n floor in the\nkitchen mucky and slippery. Once I scrubbed the kitchen floor=\r\n very carefully\nand Bhagavan congratulated me on the neatness in the kitche=\r\nn. I sighed:\n&quot;What is the use, Swami. People will come and spill the oil an=\r\nd scatter the\nflour and it will return to how it was before. We must have p=\r\nroper jars and\ncontainers.&quot; Ten days later they called me to the Hall. Atte=\r\nndants were\nopening wooden boxes and there were six beautiful jars. &quot;You wa=\r\nnted jars,\nnow you have jars. Take them to the kitchen,&quot; said Bhagavan. On =\r\ninquiry it\nwas found that some station master had booked them to the Ashram=\r\n for no\nostensible reason.\n\nOne day there was talk in the Hall about one of=\r\n Bhagavan&#39;s old devotees who\nhad come under Sri Sai Baba&#39;s influence. Bhaga=\r\nvan said: &quot;Once a man has\nsurrendered his life here, he belongs here. Where=\r\nver he may go, he shall\nreturn. For him this is the door to liberation.&quot;\n\nT=\r\nhe next day Bhagavan refused to drink coffee. I gave up coffee too, as a\npe=\r\nnance, and a hard penance it was! A month passed like this. One day I\nburst=\r\n out in tears before Bhagavan: &quot;Swami, I did offend you, but there must\nbe =\r\nan end to punishment. Please have your coffee.&#39;&#39;\n\n&quot;No, do not think I gave =\r\nup coffee to punish you. Why should I punish\nanybody? I gave up coffee beca=\r\nuse it does not agree with me. Ask the doctor,\nhe will tell you. He advised=\r\n me to avoid coffee.&quot; Then, turning to the\naudience, Bhagavan added: &quot;It wa=\r\ns the same on the hill. I did not take\ncoffee, nobody would touch it and al=\r\nl would curse the swami for depriving\nthem of coffee.&quot;\n\nA few days later Ja=\r\nnakiamma brought a huge pot of coffee and put it before\nBhagavan. &quot;What am =\r\nI to do now? Coffee has come by itself; nobody asked\nJanaki to bring it. No=\r\nw, if I do not drink it, nobody will touch it and\nJanaki will be sorry.&quot; He=\r\n did taste some of Janaki&#39;s coffee and started\ntaking it again soon after t=\r\nhat.\n\n- from Ramana Smrti Souvenir\n\nSources:\n\n1) http://www.arunachala.org/=\r\nnewsletters/1999/?pg=3Djan-feb\n2) http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/199=\r\n9/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=\r\n=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=\r\n=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b2b09d1e7bd20488074391\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nAt the instance of Sri Muruganar, Shantammal came to the Ashram from Ramnad=\r\n in 1927.

Now, if I do not drink it, nobody will touch it and Janaki wil=\r\nl be sorry.&quot; He did taste some of Janaki&#39;s coffee and started taki=\r\nng it again soon after that.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;- fr=\r\nom Ramana Smrti Souvenir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sou=\r\nrces&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/199=\r\n9/?pg=3Djan-feb&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/19=\r\n99/?pg=3Djan-feb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n2) &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.arunachala.org/newslette=\r\nrs/1999/?pg=3Dmar-apr&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.arunachala.org/newslett=\r\ners/1999/?pg=3Dmar-apr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=\r\n=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636b2b09d1e7bd20488074391--\r\n\n"}}
