Good luck to anyone who c=\r\nreates such a\nsite in any city!\n&gt;\n&gt; Any public (or sometimes even private) =\r\nplace where sadhana is done\nwill eventually attract people of all kinds. I =\r\nthink that&#39;s ok, as long\nas one does sadhana sincerely and does not conscio=\r\nusly work hard to\nattract big crowds.\n&gt;\n&gt; My only 2 cents is that the focus=\r\n of such sites should entirely be on\nFire. If a specific person associated =\r\nwith a site is revered by people,\nit is human tendency to idolize that pers=\r\non and have some activities\ncentered around that idolization. Leaving such =\r\nthings and personalities\naside and just focusing on Fire as the guru and pr=\r\notector, will serve\nwell.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrol=\r\nogy & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;dgporob@...&quot; dgporob@...\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Sunday, March 10, 2013 11:34 AM\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A thought/wish\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Dear Narasimha Ji =\r\nand other members.\n&gt; &gt;For a long time I was having a thought about creating=\r\n a place for\npeople to do homam outside their apartments.  After doing homa=\r\nm in\napartment as well as in Homa kunda outside (we built one at my native\n=\r\nvillage), I felt big limitation when we do homam in an apartment. One,\nther=\r\ne are limited items one can offer in fire due to its size. Two, long\ndurati=\r\non homam invariably generates soot which eventually goes all over\nthe place=\r\n. General disturbance if you want to do extended sadhana with\nHomam. People=\r\n staying abroad will have more issues due to fire safety\nsystem also. Since=\r\n I don&#39;t have any means of creating such a facility at\nmy current place in =\r\nBangalore, I thought I&#39;ll share this with other\nfolks. If someone feels it =\r\nis worth pursuing and has ability (anywhere\nin world), they are welcome to =\r\ndo so.\n&gt; &gt;My idea was to create a site, may be 50x50 or 100x100 sq ft, with=\r\n 11\nor 21 or 51 Homa Kunda (whatever practically possible). Anyone\ninterest=\r\ned to do homam can come to this place anytime 24x7x365 days, do\nextended ho=\r\nurs of homam or do 1-3-5-7 days sadhana. Bring your own\nstuff; spend as muc=\r\nh as time day/night, evenings/mornings, whatever\nsuits you. The owner of th=\r\ne place may provide some basic needs if the\nsite is next to his house.\n&gt; &gt;O=\r\nff course all this should not involve any money and should be done\nwith the=\r\n sankalpa of one&#39;s spiritual progress or restoring Dharma in\nworld (as Nara=\r\nsimha had told many times). Also, in my opinion the place\nshould not be in =\r\ntemple premises as invariably people come with\nmaterials wishes and pray. W=\r\nell this is just a thought/wish; feel free\nto give your opinion. This conce=\r\npt could be helpful for people staying\nabroad too.\n&gt; &gt;With regards,\n&gt; &gt;Diga=\r\nmber\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
