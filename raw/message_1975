Not so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri tarp=\r\nana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nThe thoughts of the minds around us do have a subtle imp=\r\nact on our mind. When too many depressed, sad or frustrated people are arou=\r\nnd you, it will have a negative effect on you. Similarly, when some peacefu=\r\nl and blissful people or elevated souls are around you, it will have a posi=\r\ntive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does have an imp=\r\nact on you.\n \nThis is particularly true with respect to the minds of people=\r\n who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds of such people a=\r\nre in great distress or great excitement, it has an impact on your mind.\n \n=\r\nIf a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some strong desi=\r\nres and unable to progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his thoughts and =\r\ndesires will have an impact on your mind.\n \nThus, we invest our mental ener=\r\ngy praying for their relief. While offering balls of solid food (shraaddha)=\r\n on special occasions, pray that the ancestor may get an appropriate body a=\r\ngain to fulfil remaining desires. While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pra=\r\ny that the ancestor&#39;s desires may be satisfied and the ancestor may be over=\r\ncome the weaknesses. By praying for helping an ancestor, you are indirectly=\r\n helping yourself, by removing a powerful negative influence on your mind a=\r\nnd getting rid of some weaknesses.\n \nUnfortunately, the extremely simple ri=\r\ntual of pitri tarpana is out of fashion today. However, so many people will=\r\n benefit tremendously if they do it atleast once every month if not daily. =\r\nVimalananda says that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritua=\r\nl he can perform.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNot long ago, every orthodox Braa=\r\nhmana used to perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. =\r\nRituals use external symbols to induce internal changes. These two rituals =\r\nare really important and useful rituals.\n \nA small comparison of homam and =\r\ntarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:\n \n------------=\r\n--------------\nOne word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling deva=\r\ntas and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medi=\r\num is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whe=\r\nther watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horosc=\r\nope.\n \nIn homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to puri=\r\nfy you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas (conditi=\r\noning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If you have ge=\r\nnes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous an=\r\nd the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having those thoughts=\r\n, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the connection and may eve=\r\nn commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. You can free yourself f=\r\nrom the rina by working on giving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancest=\r\nor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of =\r\nthat consciousness will not affect your consciousness in the same way. Thus=\r\n, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of bad karmas, while homam burns =\r\noff previously committed bad karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for s=\r\npiritual progress.\n \nDevatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their =\r\nself-identification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. The=\r\ny work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitr=\r\nis are grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. =\r\nTheir self-identification is with what is known as mind and represented by =\r\nMoon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris i=\r\nn the hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for the=\r\nm respectively.\n \nDevas and pitris have different ways of working and influ=\r\nencing us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all =\r\nof us and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas=\r\n in fire and satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n---------------=\r\n-----------\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------- \n \n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Ramakrish=\r\nnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks fo=\r\nr this valuable manual.

At least if yo=\r\nu can provide information on some sources, it \nwould be a great help.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks and regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nRam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On =\r\nFri, 12/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now a Vishnu sahasra naama \nhomam manual is avai=\r\nlable. It contains a very short procedure for Vishnu sahasra \nnaama homam. =\r\nIt is very detailed and pretty much anybody can follow it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Those who regularly chant Vishnu sahasra naama stotram should be able \nto=\r\n perform a homam if they spend an extra 10 minutes, after a little practice=\r\n. \nFor those who are pressed for time and yet want to do a homam, a super-s=\r\nhort \nprocedure involving one verse is also given.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The man=\r\nual is \navailable in English language, with mantras given in Sanskrit/Hindi=\r\n, English, \nTelugu, Kannada or Malayalam scripts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In addit=\r\nion to this \nmanual, manuals for Mahaganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Krishna=\r\n homam, Shiva \nhomam, Mahalakshmi homam, Sani homam and Kuja homam are avai=\r\nlable. More will be \ncoming later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Chanting Vishnu&#39;s 1000 =\r\nnames is very powerful in \nthis age. It is the best antidote for many probl=\r\nems, material and spiritual. \nFire of a reasonable size augments the effect=\r\n. The philosophy of fire ritual is \nexplained in the manual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; This is a part of the effort to enable \na community of sadhakas who wors=\r\nhip various deities in fire, as per the command \nof the divine Mother to my=\r\n spiritual master at Kalikambal temple in Chennai in \nMarch 2006.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Please go to the homam website below to download \nthe manuals. It i=\r\ns hoped that spiritual sadhakas interested in homam will \nbenefit from this=\r\n and also help in increasing collective dharma in this world \nwith their co=\r\nntribution. Please feel free to spread this link among interested \npeople.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Any philosophical or practical questions on homam or \nany =\r\nspiritual sadhana can be discussed on the yahoogroup vedic-wisdom.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_022B_01C9EBA6.F0097560--\r\n\n"}}
