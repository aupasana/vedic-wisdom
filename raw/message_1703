Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fantastic question! =\r\nBefore I answer it, I want to say that I am impressed with the decription o=\r\nf your friend. My pranaams to him. Does he live in the greater Boston area =\r\ntoo?\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Karma and karmaphala (action and react=\r\nion) are like pushing something and being pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n When you karmically push an object with some force and that object pushes =\r\nyou back karmically with the same force at a later point of time, it is not=\r\n necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to push again. You =\r\npushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. That is reacti=\r\non. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has nothing to do =\r\nwith the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and apply some forc=\r\ne NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction later.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even a person of a high level of mental equanimity a=\r\nnd stability does have an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness=\r\n) which binds him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who lo=\r\noks like this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who w=\r\nants so and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of =\r\nSriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If th=\r\ne binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound from tha=\r\nt limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So any em=\r\nbodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets reborn,=\r\n this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and environment and re=\r\n-attached to another body and environment. Nature tracks this change. Just =\r\nas post office delivers all mail addressed to your old apartment to your ne=\r\nw apartment when you change address, Nature delivers the reactions of all p=\r\nrevious life actions to the sense of I-ness in this life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As long as =\r\none is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will continue to deliver =\r\nthe reactions to various previous actions from that being. Death of wife in=\r\n an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an election, being criticized =\r\nby thousand people, being hit by wife, being abused by husband, being kille=\r\nd by a brother, being cheated by a friend etc etc are examples of reactions=\r\n to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s sense of I-ness is bound to a body, =\r\nNature will continue to deliver reactions to previous actions. If one gets =\r\nan Oscar award as a result of previous good karma, it is not necessary that=\r\n one should be happy or excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction fro=\r\nm Nature to one&#39;s good karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one =\r\nhappy. How one feels NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necess=\r\nary that one should feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Na=\r\nture to one&#39;s bad karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him=\r\n. You cheated someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats you=\r\n now. How you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old action-re=\r\naction equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm=\r\n does not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In fact, it is better that =\r\nway. By not reacting to what is happening now, one is preventing new karmas=\r\n. Suppose you cheated a person in a previous life. Suppose Nature arranged =\r\nfor that person to cheat you now. His cheating you is merely a reaction to =\r\nyour own action (but if he does it with self-identification with the action=\r\n, it becomes a new karma for that person. But, that is irrelevant to you). =\r\nIf you just face it calmly and without doing anything, you finish off your =\r\nkarmic debt. Instead, suppose you fight and try to stop the person from che=\r\nating you. Then your current actions would become a NEW karma and you will =\r\nhave to face its reaction later. If you want to pay off old debts without i=\r\nncurring new ones, you have to behave like the person you described below. =\r\nAccept whatever comes your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with=\r\n a calm and relaxed mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the righ=\r\nt thing to do at the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of &quot;=\r\nI am doing this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts=\r\n and judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Sent: Th=\r\nursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to be in a neutral fr=\r\name \n&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few =\r\nyears \n&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He =\r\nvery \n&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the hospital and took care of a=\r\nll of his \n&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the family. His wife was a very spiri=\r\ntual person \n&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident, his wife told him=\r\n of her recent \n&gt; &gt; meditation experience and that she would probably be le=\r\naving her body \n&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never shed a tear and was in the utmo=\r\nst calm and \n&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even during the funeral process. So=\r\nme folks felt it \n&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor wi=\r\nth a stable mind. His \n&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spiritual and men=\r\ntal bond and they have two \n&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I have the utmost reverance t=\r\nowards him and also in awe of \n&gt; &gt; his spiritual level. My question is how =\r\nwould his karmas be burnt if he \n&gt; &gt; never feels the pain of such a perceiv=\r\ned tragedy?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
