I lik=\r\ne this story a lot.\n\nRegards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nPrasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  ONCE Narada besought the=\r\n Lord of the universe,&quot;Lord, show me that Maya of\n&gt; Thine which can make th=\r\ne impossible possible.&quot; The Lord nodded assent.\n&gt; Subsequently the Lord one=\r\n day set out on a travel with Narada. After going\n&gt; some distance, He felt =\r\nvery thirsty and fatigued. So He sat down and told\n&gt; Narada, &quot;Narada, I fee=\r\nl much thirsty; please get me a little water from\n&gt; somewhere.&quot; Narada at o=\r\nnce ran in search of water.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finding no water nearby, he went far from =\r\nthe place and saw a river at a\n&gt; great distance. When he approached the riv=\r\ner, he saw a most charming young\n&gt; lady sitting there, and was at once capt=\r\nivated by her beauty. As soon as\n&gt; Narada went near her,she began to addres=\r\ns him in sweet words, and ere long,\n&gt; both fell in love with each other. Na=\r\nrada then married her, and settled down\n&gt; as a householder. In course of ti=\r\nme he had a number of children by her.And\n&gt; while he was thus living happil=\r\ny with his wife and children, there came a\n&gt; pestilence in the country. Dea=\r\nth began to collect its toll from every place.\n&gt; Then Narada proposed to ab=\r\nandon the place and go somewhere else. His wife\n&gt; acceded to it, and they b=\r\noth came out of their house leading their children\n&gt; by the hand. But no so=\r\noner did they come to the bridge to cross the river\n&gt; than there came a ter=\r\nrible flood, and in the rush of water, all their\n&gt; children were swept away=\r\n one after another, and at last the wife too was\n&gt; drowned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overwhelme=\r\nd with grief at his bereavement, Narada sat down on the bank and\n&gt; began to=\r\n weep piteously. Just then the Lord appeared before him, saying, &quot;O\n&gt; Narad=\r\na,where is the water? And why are you weeping?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The sight of the Lord =\r\nstartled the sage, and then he understood everything.\n&gt; He exclaimed, &quot;Lord=\r\n, my obeisance to You, and my obeisance also to Your\n&gt; wonderful Maya!&quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Source: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna\n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; Om Namo Bhagavat=\r\ne Sri Ramanaya\n&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram\n&gt; \n&gt; Love And Love Alone\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
