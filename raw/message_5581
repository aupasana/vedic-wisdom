In fact, nobody can go through Ved=\r\na completely in one\n&gt; &gt; lifetime. When Maharshi Bharadwaja was trying to *r=\r\nead* and understand\n&gt; &gt; more and more Vedic knowledge, he was told by Indra=\r\n that reading more\n&gt; &gt; will not help and he just needed to meditate more ti=\r\nme with Gayatri\n&gt; &gt; mantra, in order to understand Veda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One ca=\r\nnnot understand Veda intellectually by reading or thinking.

If one&#39;s mind is always filled with=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that verse, a day might come when the meaning of the verse *reveals*\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; itself to one. Veda can be &quot;understood&quot; only through &quot;revelation&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even if one properly understands a *single* verse of Veda in one&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; life, it is enough and one&#39;s life is fruitful!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Restraint is shakti.

and then you relish it but learn that the negative visdom spread in the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; time of Bhakti age has led india to slavery and away from Vedic virtues=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and values, the negative message was not spread by those great Bhaktas=\r\n\n&gt;
