I think its b=\r\netter to use either dried coconuts or cow dung cakes than logs. Somehow, I =\r\nfeel that its also a sin cutting a big tree and using its body parts for a =\r\nspiritual work. I know its difficult to get cow dung cakes but if we can af=\r\nford dried coconuts that is even better. Can you please clarify if my way o=\r\nf thinking is wrong. I know a Devi bhakta who does homam only with dried st=\r\nicks fallen on the ground if he does not have any other materials. \n\n2. Als=\r\no, using honey in religious works is in my opinion wrong. I am not exactly =\r\nsure how they extract honey from bee hives, but I know there are larvae sti=\r\nll present when honey is taken from hives.\n\nSatyam Bruyat Priyam Bruyat.\n\nR=\r\navi\n\n\n"}}
