How can i again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; That th=\r\nen is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; When the sadhak=\r\n&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then=\r\n the sadhak experiences himself as that Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; There then arises=\r\n no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to hap=\r\npen( be it what appears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) .=\r\n The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almo=\r\nst for nothing himself, so self identification is minimised and the person&#39;=\r\ns spiritual evolution continues.\n&gt; Remember, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=\r\n=A0according to me which is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your=\r\n Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, T=\r\nara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be that of God himself( Provided you=\r\n have Vijnana). After the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm=\r\n of the deity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate r=\r\nealm reserved for these beings. \n&gt; Attacking such a sadhak brings the full =\r\nbearing of karma onto the heads of the attackers and some people may realis=\r\ne this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city=\r\n of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equa=\r\nte this with black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like =\r\nyou attack a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that sam=\r\ne Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack som=\r\nebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas left, th=\r\nen the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadha=\r\nka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n&gt; If people persist=\r\n in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only=\r\n a little Shakti which can be used, moreover=C2=A0then their minds and inte=\r\nllects will not be free of identification with the body and so their action=\r\ns are those which are generally termed as black magic. These people usually=\r\n join the same spirits which they have been using after death, this is not =\r\nan enjoyable experience.\n&gt; Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for =\r\na few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that deity a=\r\nnd such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(because of h=\r\nis previous effort).\n&gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in=\r\n this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are cruc=\r\nial and may not acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; According to me the proof of th=\r\ne pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy sadhana.\n&gt; If one is =\r\nso inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savi=\r\ntri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) e=\r\nvery day, main constraints\n&gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; Same place.\n&gt; Same mate=\r\nrials.\n&gt; Same direction.\n&gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; Count on rudrak=\r\nsha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the m=\r\nind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; D=\r\no not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty before yo=\r\nu start.\n&gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n=\r\n&gt; See the difference in your personality before and after.\n&gt; Long and short=\r\n , what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadhana, and per=\r\nsist with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.\n&gt; I hope this=\r\n clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Kind=\r\n Love and Regards\n&gt; manish\n&gt; You may post this on the list as a clarificati=\r\non from me if you feel that this is suitable.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; On Sun, Mar 1, 200=\r\n9 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

That is why I tal=\r\nked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works slightly diffe=\r\nrently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Also, commanding =\r\ngod is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, which c=\r\nan be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually and suff=\r\nering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as gods is p=\r\nossible only for a spiritually=C2=A0elevated person with no or extremely sm=\r\nall ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achievem=\r\nent. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in comp=\r\nletely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat s=\r\nomething from the previous mail to clarify:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; The universe has =\r\nmany lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. There =\r\nare infinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there =\r\nare infinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mi=\r\nnd and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberati=\r\nng in the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect a=\r\nbsorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes=\r\n by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra)=\r\n and that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and corresp=\r\nonding karmic interactions between various objects.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Each set of =\r\n&quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantra=\r\ns are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging self-awareness in a mantr=\r\na fully and getting a specific result from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from=\r\n god.

Various mantras and =\r\ntechnicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhak=\r\nas.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Those are hardly of use to so many people out there with den=\r\nse egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command specific resu=\r\nlts from god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, which is in =\r\nturn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they use all th=\r\ne techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astrology. I=\r\nnstead of wasting their time with these technicalities, they will be better=\r\n off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Just pick any pr=\r\nasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so=\r\n many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Pat=\r\niently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever=\r\n and whenever he gives.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Keep praying every day or every second w=\r\nhen you are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of =\r\nyour actions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself=\r\n that it is his and that=C2=A0he gave it to you. If you remember him all th=\r\ne time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing=\r\n of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra=\r\n, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge co=\r\nming from questionable sources!).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Th=\r\nere may be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it=\r\n. Each path may lead to a different spot (different experience) on the top =\r\nand show a different scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may te=\r\nll you to use a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). =\r\nBut such advice is useless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish =\r\nperson with dense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who=\r\n is strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonabl=\r\ny detached person with very little ego).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Even when you encounter=\r\n a person who has legs and can actually climb the mountain, the stress shou=\r\nld be on how to climb the mountain and traverse the long path, rather than =\r\nwhich path to take. The astrologers who are bogged down by all the technica=\r\nlities and people who take customized mantra advice from astrologers and th=\r\nink that they will get a result quickly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are=\r\n missing the basic point. The power of a powerful mantra is with respect to=\r\n the experience and result obtained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A=\r\n partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a path leading to a point atop th=\r\ne mountain where the view shows a particularly beautiful scenery. But the b=\r\nottomline is that you do have to survive the climb along the long path.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; We need to emphasize the attitude and approach needed for the long=\r\n climb, rather than emphasizing the choice of the path based on horoscope. =\r\nIt is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came in the la=\r\nst century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra based on horos=\r\ncope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitude - surrender,=\r\n submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility etc!!!!=\r\n=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to be oversmart=\r\n with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; when should the worship of a graha be done?

What is the reason =\r\nfor Gandanta being in 0 deg, 120 deg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is not=\r\n a junction between agni and jala...I want to her your words if you have an=\r\ny. You keep saying Parasara says so and yet there is nothing forthcoming.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya as the rashi come into exis=\r\ntence because of the Sun, which is the agni tattva. Vara is also agni tattv=\r\na among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi. K=\r\narma has been advised in the vaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora of=\r\n the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting an=\r\nd other such karma related to rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna Ma=\r\nrga for details].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moon is the significator of the Aroodha. It is t=\r\nhe *emotional content* related to the maya manifestation of everything in l=\r\nife. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the karma associated that resu=\r\nlted in suffering and fasting is a a means of self punishment and correctio=\r\nn related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Just as Agni has the purity t=\r\no burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related to the UL is surely going =\r\nto cleanse the sins associated with the suffering in it. While this may not=\r\n give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content has not been addressed, at =\r\nleast the initiation of the aroodha occurs and people find their partners, =\r\nget married and get along with life. Proof lies in the pudding and with so =\r\nmany cases where people have fasted on UL days and have got result, we have=\r\n found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why fast? Fasting on vaara is a=\r\n means to correcting the flaw associated with the raashi. Raashi is a quant=\r\nity and hence it\n&gt;  is related to the material effects of the bhava and tha=\r\nt is what people are looking for when they come to th astrologer. You have =\r\ndone well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C remember =\r\nwhat I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should worship a female deity an=\r\nd women shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting. I wonder if they rea=\r\nlly follow this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun=\r\n is always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limit=\r\ned this to day fasting and not night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This =\r\nis my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have given long periods o=\r\nf fast starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of =\r\nchild! You think I should be doing that! You think anyone will lsiten. Try =\r\nit yourself before asking me to advise those hard penance kind of fasts.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. It is the susta=\r\niner. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for getting married=\r\n and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging marriage. Either =\r\nthey want to get into one or get out of one and into another...astrologe rs=\r\n these days are relegated to helping people make these transitions painless=\r\n and fast. Of course some have come and I have not failed them. I have a re=\r\nady shloka for this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C start from Taurus in Hamsa gat=\r\ni:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gouri, Kaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Durga, Kanti, Saraswati\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nngalaa, Vaishnavi, Lakshmi, Shivaa, Naraayani\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; See I have them read=\r\ny for the 12 signs in Hamsa Gati from the mool trikona of Moon in hamsa gat=\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mantra Shastra is a very detailed work and includes mantra dosha=\r\n etc. It is very scientific and accurate.

Perhaps I have mi=\r\nssed many mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to command God i=\r\ns *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the least. The attitude shoul=\r\nd always be that of a beggar in front of God.

His section on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not dis=\r\nmissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowly p=\r\nreparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you gone through the Navagrah=\r\na mantras given in the Garuda Purana and other puranic literature?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e=\r\n.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavas=\r\nya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosh=\r\na and the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the c=\r\nhart.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya dosha is to be performed on Amava=\r\nsya, when should the worship of a graha be done? Let us say someone wishes =\r\nto worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this worship should be d=\r\none?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayan=\r\na) got his knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did t=\r\nhey get it from?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People=\r\n are mentioning complicated principles that are not found in classics or wo=\r\nrks of rishis and scaring people that performing austerities such as fastin=\r\ng on certain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult t=\r\no Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and based =\r\non hasty thinking. There may be a little difference between doing an auster=\r\nity on different days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the d=\r\nifference between doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong =\r\nday&quot; does not cause danger as being suggested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am=\r\n sorry. I missed the context and just saw some mails that were forwarded to=\r\n me amidst my writing. But them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in =\r\nthat many many have benefitted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thir=\r\nd, our shastras primarily talk about worshipping various deities on various=\r\n days, based on the energy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity,=\r\n certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better than others. This is based=\r\n on the deity and irrespective of the person worshipping. Let me give an an=\r\nalogy. If a rich man comes out with more money to give to beggars on a spec=\r\nific day, a beggar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedule an=\r\nd mood of the giver is more important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s not right...at least people who read this will think. L=\r\net=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s say Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the prat=\r\nyadhi devata of the Sun and is not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NO=\r\nTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C a day after Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the p=\r\nratyadhi devata of Mercury and is worshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednes=\r\ndays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C again a day after! So what happened to =\r\nthe energy equation? J\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the d=\r\neity is more important and the variations based on individual horoscope are=\r\n less important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations. But th=\r\ney are smaller and, more importantly, I question if they are actually well-=\r\nunderstood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*. I question over-emphas=\r\nizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable origin and sca=\r\nring people on that basis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] To this I can agree as m=\r\nany have not understood even the basics of Sanatana dharma! Some behave as =\r\nif there is a battle going on between Shiva and Vishnu =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C it=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s hilarious to see how these are just atte=\r\nmpts to convert Hinduism into a religion they have left rather than trying =\r\nto learn what Hinduism means. Being newly converted there is a bellicose pa=\r\ntriotism in them to prove their faith to the *new god* they have found and =\r\nevery other God must be the devil in disguise!! It will take years for many=\r\n to learn that there is no devil. It=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s a figment of =\r\ntheir imagination and whatever is devilish is the dark side of mankind hims=\r\nelf.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Statement 2 is an arrogance that t=\r\nhe entire mantra shastra is useless\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and the Rishi=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=80=9A=C2=AC=C3=A2=E2=80=9E=C2=A2s were wasting time in giving so man=\r\ny mantras for\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for=\r\n Vishnu or Hanuman\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is l=\r\nike saying that we can\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; take paracetamol and pray that cancer is =\r\ncured.

But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning=\r\n complicated principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis a=\r\nnd scaring people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain da=\r\nys cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, base=\r\nd on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinki=\r\nng. There may be a little difference between doing an austerity on differen=\r\nt days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference betwe=\r\nen doing and not doing at all and that doing it on=C2=A0a &quot;wrong day&quot; does =\r\nnot cause danger as being suggested.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Third, our shastras primari=\r\nly talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the ene=\r\nrgy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekd=\r\nay or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irres=\r\npective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man co=\r\nmes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is b=\r\netter off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is =\r\nmore important.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity =\r\nis more important and the variations based on individual horoscope are less=\r\n important. I am not saying there are no horoscopic variations. But they ar=\r\ne smaller and, more importantly,=C2=A0I question if they are actually well-=\r\nunderstood by astrologers=C2=A0today to apply *reliably*. I question over-e=\r\nmphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of questionable origin an=\r\nd scaring people on that basis.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Sta=\r\ntement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless\n&gt; &gt; and =\r\nthe Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mant=\r\nras for\n&gt; &gt; the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Ha=\r\nnuman\n&gt; &gt; when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we c=\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; seers.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I did not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest th=\r\nat our ability to use it is limited and we should take our limitations into=\r\n consideration.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The universe has many lokas (planes of conscious=\r\nness) , many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interaction=\r\ns possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. =\r\nWhen one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra =\r\n(i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), the=\r\nn one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awarenes=\r\ns in the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internal=\r\nly in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding =\r\nexternal changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions betw=\r\neen various objects.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, this variety of mantras, experienc=\r\nes and results is irrelevant to one who does not have such perfect control =\r\nover the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to =\r\na seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hence control over mind im=\r\npeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare today. Most people are un=\r\nable to experience any mantra and mantras do not=C2=A0work for them as they=\r\n are supposed to.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Just repeating a co=\r\nmbination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may think that=\r\n certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of times. Th=\r\nat is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickly and ano=\r\nther may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorptio=\r\nn of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to really work an=\r\nd it is much more difficult than one may think.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; A highly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to co=\r\nmmand the king and get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is bet=\r\nter off begging the king, rather than trying to command (and failing for su=\r\nre).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, most people are better off begging god for what =\r\nthey want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command what they w=\r\nant. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowl=\r\nedge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and=C2=A0pe=\r\nrsistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude=\r\n rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most people is t=\r\no learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; What people today nee=\r\nd for material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better=\r\n attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantr=\r\nas and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific res=\r\nult from god.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is worth noting that so many great spiritual te=\r\nachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the ri=\r\nght mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the corr=\r\nect attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, disc=\r\nipline, humility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and useful than t=\r\nrying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; One more thing. We have many mantras =\r\ngiven by rishis, but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how t=\r\no pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today =\r\ndo not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules comi=\r\nng from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfect=\r\nion. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irresp=\r\nective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8=\r\nth lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for d=\r\nebt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astro=\r\nlogers, way beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one ha=\r\ns a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of =\r\nan astrology theoretician.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If not, there is no foolproof way to =\r\nknow the right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you =\r\nfeel attracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your at=\r\ntitude. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble begg=\r\nar at god&#39;s door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If=\r\n you succeed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of =\r\nsuccess than great scholars.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashta=\r\nkshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram=\r\n, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunj=\r\naya mantra=C2=A0etc) can help one make progress if one develops the right a=\r\nttitude. Without the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will=\r\n do nothing.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I hope this sufficiently =\r\nclarifies my stand.

The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of=\r\n Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lor=\r\nd, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occu=\r\nr, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why=\r\n does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi???? =\r\nWhy does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raa=\r\nshi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the D=\r\nvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After =\r\nall, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element =\r\nof water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (w=\r\nater) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is=\r\n represented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the ele=\r\nment of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could=\r\n even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it=\r\n brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and caus=\r\nes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated wit=\r\nh the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just=\r\n as the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, al=\r\nl the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fas=\r\nting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; [Narasimha] We always say that ho=\r\nuses (truth) are represented by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moo=\r\nn (mind).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the a=\r\npparent creator in the field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be ass=\r\nociated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (pe=\r\nrception) should actually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After a=\r\nll, that is what we do in the tripod method in dasa judgment.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Th=\r\nus, it is actually more logical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe=\r\n the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Is the above &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own thinking =\r\nor is it from a classic or from tradition?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote=\r\n &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasti=\r\nng is far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy ot=\r\nherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra =\r\nmeditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maxim=\r\nize the effect of the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with t=\r\nhis. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days =\r\nwhen one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn a=\r\nnd churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is ma=\r\nny many times better than complete fasting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to=\r\n expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the =\r\nmantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should meditate ei=\r\nther without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case,=\r\n I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are heavily re=\r\nstrained in effectiveness.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0=\r\n&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts is quite=\r\n illogical.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very=\r\n definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the interface between fire=\r\n and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, the fire dies...There =\r\nare other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart but they are not anta=\r\n (ends).

But the question is of contact. If I am think=\r\ning of fire in my mind while standing in water, it does not kill the fire. =\r\nThere is no contact.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; My point is that the examples given have no=\r\n real identifiable contact between water and fire.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; One can be cr=\r\neative and come up with a lot of theories. For example, one can say that Mo=\r\non and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are s=\r\nome rasis marked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the s=\r\nign occupied by Moon and Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then o=\r\nne can say fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus cau=\r\nses gandanta and serious danger.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is not enough to show some f=\r\nire and some water. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage =\r\nin illogical extrapolations.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you =\r\ntold me two years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now=\r\n it is getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of=\r\n Jyotish is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in diffe=\r\nrent levels of their understanding and intelligence. \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=\r\n=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s =\r\ncannot be taken away. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some re=\r\njoice when it seems like something comes and cry when it seems like somethi=\r\nng leaves. Some impassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do=\r\n what they see as their dharma with the things they seem to have.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just=\r\n a factual correction though: I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few=\r\n years after my spiritual master entered my life, my interest in other thin=\r\ngs went down (though I continued to do other things) and my focus on spirit=\r\nual sadhana intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low=\r\n. However, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teaching=\r\ns of Parasara independently,=C2=A0meditate=C2=A0on them and share my interp=\r\nretations with the world.=C2=A0He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish =\r\nactivities earlier, and he wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately=\r\n and without an attachment. He felt that I still have a contribution to mak=\r\ne to Jyotish and wants me=C2=A0to do it as an unattached karma.=C2=A0His wo=\r\nrd is everything for me.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; What I told you recently is not that I =\r\nwas leaving Jyotish but what I said above.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However,=C2=A0if your=\r\n judgment is correct and=C2=A0if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure =\r\nmy spiritual guru will realize it sooner or later and change his command to=\r\n me.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can categorical=\r\nly declare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi =\r\nand take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or=\r\n tithi and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. Y=\r\nou can take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say=\r\n, a few months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vr=\r\nata for the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the v=\r\nrata, there is nothing like it!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine=C2=\r\n=A0 statement but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other tea=\r\nchings of the seers is of not much relevance. Of course you are right as it=\r\n will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry sho=\r\nuld not fast on UL days and should choose any day (all days are the same) o=\r\nr any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any=\r\n mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few=\r\n years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage w=\r\nill happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is rig=\r\nht.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; [Narasimha] This is a gros=\r\ns exaggeration.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Is all that is being taught and practiced now st=\r\nrictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the seers&quot;?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I did no=\r\nt say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, there is some difference=\r\n. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; To make khoa, whethe=\r\nr one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a black cow o=\r\nr a Jersey cow or another cow does make some difference. But it is secondar=\r\ny. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see the quoted mails for such=\r\n claims)=C2=A0can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say that a wrong=\r\n choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross=C2=A0exagger=\r\nation.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The main thing is that you need milk and sugar. If one is=\r\n confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends up not maki=\r\nng khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick some =\r\nmilk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take an extra=\r\n half hour, but the job will be done.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I request Jyotishis to beh=\r\nave responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a=\r\n speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or=C2=A0tithi in a chart=\r\n) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teacher=\r\ns look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it.

It is funny that I should be typing this email on an Ek=\r\nadashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I write on dvadasi when so many vasihnava also fast an=\r\nd keep great austerities. J Any difference?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point =\r\nand view about the question raised. 2nd bhava is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vish=\r\nnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day of UL in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we br=\r\ning insult to Vishnu who provides the food for us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My dear Zoran, =\r\nplease allow me to express my disagreement.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Austerities can never =\r\nbe seen as an insult to Vishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such =\r\nas food (fasting) or speech (mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities.=\r\n Giving up food or speech is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex =\r\n(i.e. brahmacharya) is not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [Sanj=\r\nay Rath:] I though Brahma was very angry that his sons decided not to have =\r\nprogeny and stayed celibate. So He created others. Why was Brahma angry whe=\r\nn his sons remained celibate? Why should Sukracharya be angry if someone is=\r\n celibate? How is it an insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are tak=\r\ning planet signification of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation pr=\r\nocess...which is wrong Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, =\r\n8 and 12 from lagna or 7th which is....you know this.There is nothing wrong=\r\n with the 7th house as it is necessary for procreation. It is only the link=\r\n of this with the Brahma graha that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu=\r\n. Married people are as eligible for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors=\r\n. It depends on the following of dharma and ashrama.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Various gods =\r\nbestow various things on us, some at the gross physical level and some at t=\r\nhe subtle spiritual level. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things=\r\n, we make progress at the subtle level.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one eats food, a good a=\r\nmount of internal fire (and subtle internal energy associated with it) is u=\r\nsed for digesting it and for generating physical energy from it. If one fas=\r\nts, that subtle energy is unused and available for other things. This is a =\r\ntremendous benefit. As a result, one can better digest mantras and spiritua=\r\nl food available all around one.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The mantra one me\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
