Bhatla&quot; &lt;astrologytree@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Respected Bhupendra Ji, I am sorry for replying late. I wa=\r\ns not able to understand what points you are making so it took time to unde=\r\nrstand what you are saying. \n&gt; \n&gt; sir, below are some words which constitut=\r\ne my thinking. with deep regards i want to share them here with a hope that=\r\n they may answer your questions. Please forgive me for my mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)=\r\n Regarding behaviour and thinking of Vimlananda and other Rishis, i honestl=\r\ny admit that I do not understand properly why they do what they do. This is=\r\n because I am not able enough to reach that level of intelligence. But when=\r\n it comes to Vimalananda, when I try to understand why they are doing so, I=\r\n always refer to his saying that he wanted to die with a clean karma accoun=\r\nt. Here clean means &#39;empty&#39;. \n&gt; \n&gt; Second, he usually said that it is best =\r\nto exist at two levels of conciousness at the same time(Forgive me for wron=\r\ng words). like when he is playing chess with Robert at the same time he is =\r\nwandering at higher level of conciousness, without anyone realising that wh=\r\nat he is thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, i assume that whatever he did was because of ab=\r\nove two principles which he was always aware of. Whether he was interruptin=\r\ng TV Signal or messing with Sadhu at his cave or any other incidence. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n At the end, he gave his life for saving son of one of his disciples withou=\r\nt even letting them know. \n&gt; I may never be able to understand why Vimalana=\r\nnda did what he did. \n&gt; \n&gt; What I think of Vimalananda is that he was a gre=\r\nat Soul. Who have some rinanubandha left in this world along with some cond=\r\nitioning. so he came to pay them and to remove those conditioning. And I th=\r\nink that he has again taken birth in this world to repay some more of his l=\r\neft rinanubandha.\n&gt; \n&gt; I believe Manish Ji is also a Soul of same caliber a=\r\nnd he is one who is nitya siddha soul. And he is here to just repay his rin=\r\nanubandha and to help others evolve.\n&gt; \n&gt; Raman Maharishi used to eat pan d=\r\naily after every lunch before going on a walk. once his disciple became lat=\r\ne for bringing the Paan. Ramana Maharishi waited for about 10-15 minutes an=\r\nd when disciple didnt arrived he went on his walk. but after that he never =\r\nate Paan. This can be interpreted as his ego or his realisation that he was=\r\n attached to Paan so he quit a thing which he was attached to.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Seco=\r\nnd thing you pointed out about &quot;pre-requisite&quot; of sadhna. what i think is t=\r\nhat Pre-requisite of sadhna is just &quot;want to do sadhna&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; While Sadhna i=\r\nt self is a pre-requsite to reach god (or to attain Moksha or any other obj=\r\nective)\n&gt; \n&gt; Controlling anger, greed etc; to remove conditioning of mind a=\r\nnd to empty our &#39;Karma-fruit account balance&#39;. These all three constitute s=\r\nadhna. Process which constitute doing all the above things is sadhna. \n&gt; Co=\r\nntrolling anger etc are not pre-requisite of saadhna, but controlling them =\r\nitself is saadhna.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we achieve them, we attain the moksha or what =\r\never objectives we have. If we haven&#39;t achieved them yet, it means our Sadh=\r\nna is incomplete. \n&gt; \n&gt; Now whether Vimlananda or Rishis were angry because=\r\n of their incomplete sadhna or because of Divine will, I can not judge. Eve=\r\nn if they were incomplete, Still they were lot lot better than me and I nee=\r\nd to respect them and learn from them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Udhav ji had Brahmgyana. He was=\r\n one of few persons who, in their living conciousness realised that Shri Kr=\r\nishna is God Himself. But still he had some ego left in him. So Shri Krishn=\r\na taught him lessons in his own way. And even after Lord Krishna left his B=\r\nody, Udhav had to do Tapasya for many many years to achieve ultimate stage.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Third thing was about saadhna and Sidhis.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are numerous =\r\npaths for reaching God or we should say that there are many paths for doing=\r\n Sadhnas. Many in Hinduism itself, In sikhism, in Islam, Budhism etc etc al=\r\nl are paths for doing Saadhna. These all paths are different. But still the=\r\ny take us to same objective.\n&gt; \n&gt; These all paths have two things in common=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; a) Mind Training\n&gt; b) Surrender to God.\n&gt; \n&gt; In most of the Paths on=\r\ne is more prominent other is less prominent. Like in bhakti Yoga, Surrender=\r\n to god is given utmost important but Mind Training is to some extent only.=\r\n While in Rajyoga or Hath Yoga Mind training is given more important and Su=\r\nrrender is to some extent.\n&gt; In Karma yoga, Mind is trained in a different =\r\nway using different methods and in Gyan yoga Mind is trained in different w=\r\nay using different methods.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tantra is a saadhna method where both Mind=\r\n training and Surrender are given equal importance and both these are done =\r\nin a very aggressive and fast manner. So it works very fast. \n&gt; \n&gt; Mind Tra=\r\nining part of Saadhna, produces lot of energy in us. many names are given t=\r\no this energy. This energy is what gives Siddhis. \n&gt; So on quest to find Go=\r\nd, these Sidhis are just by-products or I term them as &quot;side effects&quot; for m=\r\ny own reference. They are not our aim when we are trying to reach God. We d=\r\no not need sidhis but still they are produced. When Vivekananda was offered=\r\n sidhis by His Guru he refused to accept them as his guru acknowledged that=\r\n these sidhis will not help him in achieving god. Although at later stage V=\r\nivekananda achieved lot of Sidhis by himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; What I want to point her=\r\ne is that For achieving Sidhis, 2nd aspect of surrender is not needed. One =\r\ncan achieve Sidhis by following some methods but they will not help him rea=\r\nch God. They just add to his Karma-Fruit account and take aways from God.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; In the book &quot;Concentration - By Mouni sadhu&quot;, Author explains simple te=\r\nchniques to achieve some simple sidhis step by step. He also adds that one =\r\nneed not to believe in God to attain these sidhis. But if he use these sidh=\r\nis in Quest for God these can be helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; So a person who had control=\r\nled his mind and trained his mind to achieve some powers does not mean that=\r\n he has controlled his anger etc and has a love for God.\n&gt; \n&gt; But for Vimal=\r\nananda and other Rishis, I believe that he was a person who had control on =\r\nmost of his instincts including anger. Although his level of intelligence a=\r\nnd concious was so much different from us that we may not be able to unders=\r\ntand why he did so.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry for stretching this mail too long. I ho=\r\npe some of your points were addressed in this mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; please pardon for =\r\nmy mistakes\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; Atul\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Rao J=\r\ni,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do understand that you are saying that it is important to eff=\r\nace once ego for \n&gt; &gt; success in sadhana and while I read and Vimalananada&#39;=\r\ns book and do like him for \n&gt; &gt; what he was able to achieve, I still see eg=\r\no in him when he disrupts TV \n&gt; &gt; transmission of of an interview where is =\r\nhe not rightly acknowledged or killing \n&gt; &gt; another sadhu for taking a spac=\r\ne he prefers for meditation in a cave. I also see \n&gt; &gt; ego in his Senior Gu=\r\nru Maharaj for cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of \n&gt; &gt; illness for not=\r\n being given audience and I see ego in them in much the same way \n&gt; &gt; you a=\r\nnd other people see ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n caliber. Yet people burn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see h=\r\nis \n&gt; &gt; actions identified with his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a=\r\n demon. \n&gt; &gt; Robert Svoboda puts up a very positive image of Vimalananda so=\r\n we see only \n&gt; &gt; positive in him. Ravana is put in a very bad light by som=\r\ne scriptures and we see \n&gt; &gt; only bad in him, yet he was a very powerful sa=\r\ndhaka than Vimalanada or his \n&gt; &gt; senior guru maharaja for sure. So why can=\r\nnot we see Ravana&#39;s action as divine \n&gt; &gt; play and stop Ravana dahan on dus=\r\nsera? And if we see Ravana as egoisitic, then \n&gt; &gt; for sure why the inciden=\r\nts I mention from Vimalanada&#39;s book cannot be seen in a \n&gt; &gt; similar way. B=\r\nut htese are all great sadhak and were greatly successful in \n&gt; &gt; whatever =\r\nthey tried to achieve from their sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not very well verse=\r\nd with scriptures so I find it hard to quote from them \n&gt; &gt; or remember all=\r\n the names, but do you remember a rishi from the Mahabharata who \n&gt; &gt; was p=\r\nleaded to Duryodhana to pay a visit pandavas in the forest. This rishi was =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; very pleased by the hospitality shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi wa=\r\ns well \n&gt; &gt; known for his temper and often feared by people. It is exactly =\r\nfor this reason \n&gt; &gt; why Duryodhana invited this rishi to his palace and pr=\r\novided him with all \n&gt; &gt; hospitality so that he could convince this rishi t=\r\no pay visit to panadavas who \n&gt; &gt; would not be able to accomodate the rishi=\r\n this lavishly and therefore would have \n&gt; &gt; to suffer his curse.If this ri=\r\nshi was so temperamental, how was he so succesful \n&gt; &gt; in his sadhana? I re=\r\nad so frequently=C2=A0about the need to give up anger for success \n&gt; &gt; in s=\r\nadhana.=C2=A0This apparently does not seem=C2=A0to apply to=C2=A0this rishi=\r\n. He was \n&gt; &gt; successful regardless. Vimalanada&#39;s book also mentions that t=\r\nhis rishi was later \n&gt; &gt; punished by Lord Visnu and had 10,000 years of his=\r\n tapasya fruits taken away \n&gt; &gt; from him. If everything that these rishi&#39;s =\r\ndo has to be identified with their \n&gt; &gt; deity and therefore cannot be fault=\r\ned, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not saying that I =\r\nshould not change my svabhau to achieve success in \n&gt; &gt; sadhana. It is neve=\r\nr nice to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is \n&gt; &gt; certainly not ea=\r\nsy to change once nature either. we can only hope that chnage in \n&gt; &gt; svabh=\r\nau can be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not going to be \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuccessful in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svabhau, and =\r\nif we \n&gt; &gt; do not have the strength to change ourselves, basically based on=\r\n what you are \n&gt; &gt; saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am no=\r\nt trying to start an \n&gt; &gt; argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see =\r\nego in all the poeple of the \n&gt; &gt; stories I mentioned and all of them are a=\r\nbout great sadhaks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lastly that link to the=C2=A0post=C2=A0regardi=\r\nng Manish is very interesting. You did not \n&gt; &gt; send this to me before. You=\r\n did make a mention though about Vimalanada Aghora \n&gt; &gt; series of books, an=\r\nd in the same message, you mentioned someone who was able to \n&gt; &gt; achieve s=\r\npecifioc results from specific sadhana&#39;s by reading this book. That is \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n what drew my attention to that book and finally made me join this yahoo gr=\r\noup as \n&gt; &gt; a way to get in touch with you. It could be that your message h=\r\nad gone to the \n&gt; &gt; SPAM folder.You are very fortunate to have met him and=\r\n=C2=A0have his guidance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While I am on this subject of success in =\r\nsadhana, I do the Super Short version \n&gt; &gt; of the homa on a=C2=A0weekly bas=\r\nis. As I read and try to learn the regular version, I \n&gt; &gt; see that it make=\r\ns use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you in \n&gt; &gt; Boston, we h=\r\nave a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass let \n&gt; &gt; alone =\r\ndarbha during the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you grow them in \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; a pot? If so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? You al=\r\nso \n&gt; &gt; mention that one should not be looking for specific results from on=\r\nce sadhana. \n&gt; &gt; Before the commencement of the sadhana or homa, what shoul=\r\nd one declare as the \n&gt; &gt; motive in such a case? I have to tell you here th=\r\nat I cannot lie about my \n&gt; &gt; intentions to God. And=C2=A0if I do, I will p=\r\nrobably keep thinking about it for the \n&gt; &gt; duration of the sadhana and the=\r\n whole experience gioes to waste as the mind is \n&gt; &gt; not at ease.=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0How about when one is not clear about the specific reasons for \n&gt; &gt; doin=\r\ng homa or sadhana but you were doing it for a specific purpose but now with=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; purpose met, you are directionless but realise the significance of sa=\r\ndhana or \n&gt; &gt; homa, feel good doing it=C2=A0and do not want to give up? Is =\r\nit important to declare \n&gt; &gt; a motive before commencing sadhana?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhanks,\n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; _____________________________=\r\n___\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Cc: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thu, November 18, 2010 =\r\n2:52:06 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Ego (Re: Success with Mantras=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me add my 2 cents of persp=\r\nective on your nice observations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The examples I give above does=\r\n not illustrate a picture of people who were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compassionate and always=\r\n willing to forgive and forget.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Forgiving and forgetting is not ne=\r\ncessarily saattwik, when it is the work of a \n&gt; &gt; dense ego. For example, o=\r\nne may do it to look good or impress others. Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; hurting someon=\r\ne is not necessarily taamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a \n&gt; &gt; light=\r\n ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; foot was a divine drama for a higher purpose.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Copying the action=\r\ns of divine beings requires some intelligence. To borrow an \n&gt; &gt; idiom from=\r\n my mother tongue, a fox does not become a tiger if it paints stripes \n&gt; &gt; =\r\non its body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; People you are talking about are very high level bein=\r\ngs. Those who efface their \n&gt; &gt; ego and start to self-identify with some hi=\r\ngher deities will start to exhibit \n&gt; &gt; the nature of those deities. Their =\r\nactions may be fierce at times, but their \n&gt; &gt; purpose will be divine.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Whether one wants liberation or one wants saayujya (togetherness) or y=\r\noga \n&gt; &gt; (oneness) of a deity or whatever one wants, the first step is to e=\r\nfface ego. All \n&gt; &gt; sadhanas are meant for that only. If you want to achiev=\r\ne what Vimalananda or \n&gt; &gt; someone else achieved, the starting point is to =\r\nefface your ego through sadhana. \n&gt; &gt; As you make progress, at some stage, =\r\nyou may start seeing some results.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody here I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary=\r\n for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular mantra....but certianly what is required such that =\r\nour sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; produces results that are easily noticeable to us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable results if one is t=\r\nhinking \n&gt; &gt; of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a century tod=\r\nay&quot; is unlikely to \n&gt; &gt; score a century. The best strategy is to take it a =\r\nball at a time and focus. \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to st=\r\nop thinking about results and just \n&gt; &gt; focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Moreover, liberation is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna s=\r\naid that he \n&gt; &gt; would come back a century later and that people would be l=\r\niberated en masse in \n&gt; &gt; that birth. Even in these times, it is possible t=\r\no be liberated.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent=\r\n before you joined this list.

Similarly when Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda=\r\n during a TV interview, Vimalananda \n&gt; &gt; goes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mad inspite of Robert t=\r\nrying to explain his reasons for not acknowledging him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vimalanada di=\r\nd not like to draw attention to himself and secondly he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sick,=C2=\r\n=A0and that was the reason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; received from Vimalananda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vimalananda could not be pacified and had the TV transmission disable=\r\nd at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time the interview was going to be aired.

Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sbvoboda himself mentions in the open=\r\ning chapter that dealing with Vimalananda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was impossible especially w=\r\nhen one knows he is wrong but will never admit to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mistake.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Then there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was den=\r\nied audience by \n&gt; &gt; &gt;a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so ins=\r\nulted by this, he curses this ill\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sicknes=\r\ns and that sadhu finally succumbs to that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dies! Now if I li=\r\nke to meet somebody and am denied audience, do I curse them \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\neath?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The examples I give above does not illustrate a picture o=\r\nf people who were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compassionate and always willing to forgive and for=\r\nget. But still, they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hugely successful in their sadhana in their=\r\n own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about here....the pre-requi=\r\nsite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thinks expects to acheive l=\r\niberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; particular mantra...=\r\n.but certianly what is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; produces result=\r\ns that are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling \n&gt; &gt; &gt;though\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\npre-requisites. I guess once just hasd to put in their best effort and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n continue\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without to let things unfold themselves=C2=A0gradually.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; _________________=\r\n_______________\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Dr. A.

( or nadis - sor=\r\nry if i am choosing bad words) if \n&gt; &gt; &gt;those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; channels are not clean =\r\nthen that energy flow can create unpleasant experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; like increase=\r\nd anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; R=\r\nishis have clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blessings they give are just part of divine will. like curse given to=\r\n lord\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses gi=\r\nven to yadav\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vansh and king prikshit played an important role. vimlan=\r\nanda was a cool guy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; except few times when he was markedly irritated.L=\r\nike in an incidence where one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his female disciple tried to illude =\r\nhim by coming almost naked in front of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him to learn how to become a b=\r\nhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; student did =\r\nnot learnt well what he taught to her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On other side peop=\r\nle with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be \n&gt; &gt; able\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc. like=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i personally believe t=\r\nhat this \n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; also part of divine will.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please f=\r\norgive me for my mistakes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Atul\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
