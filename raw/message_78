Different beings, different points in time/space are like diff=\r\nerent ripples in the ocean of Brahman.\n \nOne who identifies oneself with a =\r\nripple on the surface of the ocean only sees things from that perspective. =\r\nOne who realizes, not superficially but fully, that one is actually not the=\r\n ripple but the ocean itself and identifies with the entire ocean sees ever=\r\nything. A ripple may not see another ripple at a distance, but the ocean it=\r\nself can see all ripples as its own parts.\n \nNothing is impossible for a ma=\r\nn who realizes his true nature.\n \nHowever, one who has realized the true se=\r\nlf may not be interested in making a show of such abilities or in exercisin=\r\ng such abilities or even in looking at them as &quot;abilities&quot;. Such a person&#39;s=\r\n attitude may be totally different from that of an un-realized person who j=\r\nust fancies all those as &quot;abilities&quot; and is curious about them.\n \nIt is als=\r\no possible to have some such abilities without being self-realized, but tha=\r\nt is an unwise pursuit.\n \nA true jnaani pursues nothing but knowledge of se=\r\nlf. When the knowledge of self comes, knowledge about everything comes as a=\r\n result. After all, everything we perceive is a limited manifestation of Se=\r\nlf, while Self itself unlimited.\n \nOn the other hand, one pursuing some spe=\r\ncific thing may succeed in getting it. But it will only bind one further.
