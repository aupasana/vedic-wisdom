Krishna clearly says in \nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your ow=\r\nn dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone \nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the=\r\n path of dharma basically means engaging in the right \naction/duty. Right a=\r\nction varies from person to person, from time to time \nand from place to pl=\r\nace. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, \nwhich in turn is bas=\r\ned on who you have been in the past, what actions you \ndid in the past whil=\r\ne identifying with the action, who you affected in the \npast (and how) with=\r\n the actions that you identified with, what debts you \ncreated in the proce=\r\nss, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until \nnow.\n\nIf, based on on=\r\ne&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \nto kill evil=\r\n persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental \ntendencies =\r\nand karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of \nuniformit=\r\ny of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the \nritual of =\r\nhomam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s \nmental t=\r\nendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of \nmoney a=\r\nnd construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a b=\r\neing may change from one life to another.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, =\r\nit was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, \nelders and relatives. The time t=\r\nhen was such that there was too much weight \non earth and nature wanted ear=\r\nth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \ndestruction was to take place=\r\n and civilization destroyed to a great extent, \nto welcome Kali yuga and se=\r\nt the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \nit was his dharma to faci=\r\nlitate that. Some people he deeply loved and \nrespected were on the other s=\r\nide and it was his dharma to kill them.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born agai=\r\nn in the 19th century as one of \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami =\r\nYogananda had been Arjuna in a \nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna) , =\r\nhis dharma was different in this \nnew time and place. He was born to renoun=\r\nce material life despite his \naristocratic upbringing and live the simple l=\r\nife of a monk and inspire \ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental d=\r\netachment and service to \nothers. When he is born again (which he has to, a=\r\ns per what Ramakrishna \nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may b=\r\ne something else.\n\n* * *\n\nThe tricky question is: How does one decide what =\r\nis one&#39;s dharma?\n\nSome people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;foll=\r\now your own dharma \nand not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism.=\r\n Though the concept \nof caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long=\r\n time, the concept of \ncaste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a sh=\r\nudra who lived by \nkilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later=\r\n. Vishwamitra was a \nkshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana an=\r\nd and a maharshi \nlater. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts o=\r\nff with the varna \nof father, because that is what one is exposed to in chi=\r\nldhood. As one \ndevelops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what on=\r\ne does.\n\nThus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to =\r\nknow your \ndharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 =\r\ndharmas in \nthe world. Each person has individual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one=\r\n&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \nenough, one will =\r\n*know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \nmind that tells=\r\n us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \nnoise from other =\r\nparts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \nconfused.\n\nWe sho=\r\nuld make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition and \ndeci=\r\nde what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing \nth=\r\ne best we can is all that we can do!\n\nMore than following dharma, what is o=\r\nf utmost importance is to engage in \nactions without identification. *That*=\r\n alone ensures that we are not \naccumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasin=\r\ng the load. We should not build \ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. =\r\nWe should engage in the best \npossible actions (based on our best judgment =\r\non what our dharma in the given \nsituation is), with as little attachment a=\r\nnd self-identification with the \naction as possible. When the action is fin=\r\nished, we should leave the result \nto god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, =\r\n&quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \nwork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama kar=\r\nma yoga (unfication through \nuntached action) will simplify our ego and pur=\r\nify our consciousness slowly. \nAs we become purer, our mind will work sharp=\r\ner and tell our dharma clearer. \nThere is a positive feedback here. This wi=\r\nll slowly enable us to see our \ndharma clearly and follow it without incurr=\r\ning new karmas. This is not easy, \nbut not as difficult as people think.\n\nT=\r\nhe bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of=\r\n \n&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with =\r\n\nlittle attachment.\n\n* * *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and i=\r\nntuition are the inputs. \nAnother external input is the words of scriptures=\r\n and learned men. One can \nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place i=\r\ns given to one&#39;s spiritual \nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiritual master=\r\n, one can take the words of \nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follo=\r\nw it sincerely.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and tho=\r\nught killing gurus \nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna =\r\nwho clarified his \ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confus=\r\ned about his dharma \nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =\r\nplace to do sadhana, \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him =\r\nto stay in the material \nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne who =\r\nis not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \ndebts =\r\nare and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \none&#39;s=\r\n dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into \non=\r\ne&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline i=\r\ns that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \ndeclare that =\r\nas the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from \ntime to time=\r\n and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \nout what o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \ndharma by=\r\n increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual \nsadhana (=\r\nlike homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much \nattachment, on=\r\ne can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \none&#39;s indivi=\r\ndual dharma.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dah=\r\niyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n=\r\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n\n=\r\n&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;\n&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; and in it in last p=\r\nart\n&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; Can somebody share =\r\nviews on that and how can we approach\n&gt; towards it\n&gt; Does it has to do some=\r\nthing with vedas and upanishads\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   =\r\n   Be the first one to try the new Messenger 9 Beta!

Krishna clearly says in &lt;BR&gt;Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dhar=\r\nma. It is dangerous to follow someone &lt;BR&gt;else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Following =\r\nthe path of dharma basically means engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;action/duty. R=\r\night action varies from person to person, from time to time &lt;BR&gt;and from pl=\r\nace to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;which in=\r\n turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you &lt;BR&gt;did i=\r\nn the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the &lt;BR&gt;p=\r\nast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;now.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, natur=\r\ne wants a person &lt;BR&gt;to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, b=\r\nased on one&#39;s mental &lt;BR&gt;tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person=\r\n to spread\n the message of &lt;BR&gt;uniformity of all religions, that becomes on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and karmic debts, natu=\r\nre wants a person to spread the &lt;BR&gt;ritual of homam in the world, that beco=\r\nmes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;mental tendencies and karmic debts=\r\n, nature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;BR&gt;money and construct a temple, =\r\nthat becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The dharma of a being may ch=\r\nange from one life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the time of Mahabharata war, it wa=\r\ns Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus, &lt;BR&gt;elders and relatives. The time the=\r\nn was such that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;on earth and nature wanted ea=\r\nrth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;destruction was to take p=\r\nlace and civilization destroyed to a great extent, &lt;BR&gt;to welcome Kali yuga=\r\n and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;it was his dhar=\r\nma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;respected were o=\r\nn\n the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the same =\r\nArjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;previous life, ac=\r\ncording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this &lt;BR&gt;new time and=\r\n place. He was born to renounce material life despite his &lt;BR&gt;aristocratic =\r\nupbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;generations t=\r\no embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to &lt;BR&gt;others. Whe=\r\nn he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;said), his=\r\n dharma based on the time and place may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dhar=\r\nma &lt;BR&gt;and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the c=\r\noncept &lt;BR&gt;of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long\n time, th=\r\ne concept of &lt;BR&gt;caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra w=\r\nho lived by &lt;BR&gt;killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. V=\r\nishwamitra was a &lt;BR&gt;kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana an=\r\nd and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One start=\r\ns off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;of father, because that is what one is exposed to =\r\nin childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based o=\r\nn what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words whic=\r\nh tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, the=\r\nre are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;the world. Each person has individual dhar=\r\nma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one=\r\n is pure &lt;BR&gt;enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have =\r\na part of our &lt;BR&gt;mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surround=\r\ned by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;noise from other parts of our minds\n which tell other th=\r\nings. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;confused.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We should make the best judgment co=\r\nmbining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;decide what is our dharma and =\r\nfollow it sincerely. We may be err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;the best we can is all th=\r\nat we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;More than following dharma, what is of utmost importan=\r\nce is to engage in &lt;BR&gt;actions without identification. *That* alone ensures=\r\n that we are not &lt;BR&gt;accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.=\r\n We should not build &lt;BR&gt;too much attachment to what we are doing. We shoul=\r\nd engage in the best &lt;BR&gt;possible actions (based on our best judgment on wh=\r\nat our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;situation is), with as little attachment and=\r\n self-identification with the &lt;BR&gt;action as possible. When the action is fi=\r\nnished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;to god. We should not think &quot;I did i=\r\nt&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishk=\r\nama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;untached\n action) will simplify our =\r\nego and purify our consciousness slowly. &lt;BR&gt;As we become purer, our mind w=\r\nill work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;There is a positive feedb=\r\nack here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;dharma clearly and foll=\r\now it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;but not as diffic=\r\nult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline is: Even if one is not following=\r\n one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with tim=\r\ne if one engages in action with &lt;BR&gt;little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiri=\r\ntual &lt;BR&gt;master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the =\r\nwords of &lt;BR&gt;the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Arjuna was confused about\n what his dharma was and thought kill=\r\ning gurus &lt;BR&gt;and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who cl=\r\narified his &lt;BR&gt;dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused =\r\nabout his dharma &lt;BR&gt;and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =\r\nplace to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon h=\r\nim to stay in the material &lt;BR&gt;world and do the work of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what o=\r\nne&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment=\r\n of what &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clea=\r\nr insight into &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set=\r\n of principles and &lt;BR&gt;declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from =\r\nperson to person, from &lt;BR&gt;time to time and from place to place. Also, ther=\r\ne are no thumbrules to find\n &lt;BR&gt;out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can ref=\r\nine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;dharma by increasing internal purity. =\r\nBy doing various kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and=\r\n engaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify one=\r\nself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.ved=\r\nicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. y=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;dahiyaj=\r\niten&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:dahiyajiten%40yahoo.co.in&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ni just finished my Aghora series&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vim=\r\nalanda says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Can\n somebody share vi=\r\news on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; towards it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Does it has =\r\nto do something with vedas and upanishads&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; j=\r\nitender&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;=\r\nhr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Connect with friends all over the world. &lt;a href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//in.rd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_1/*http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/?wm=3D=\r\nn/&quot;&gt; Get Yahoo!
