It dissolve=\r\ns and creates Aakash tattwa, which constitutes and separates various layers=\r\n of vibratroy material as the astral and physical cosmos.\n\n4. It is support=\r\ned by Sankhya in the creation of the 4 antahkarana principles - Buddhi, Man=\r\nas, Ahamkara, and Chitta. These are non-material conscious principles, whil=\r\ne any of the rest of 20 principles do not carry consciousness.\n\n5. It is cr=\r\neated as a result of &quot;Satvic-Tamas&quot; Guna Combination.\n\n6. Whether you find =\r\na mention to this non-material tattwa or not, is immaterial. The indescriba=\r\nble consciousness of Soul, reflects through the help of this tattwa alone -=\r\n you call it Mind-ether as Sri Ramana Maharishi or superEther as Yogananda,=\r\n it doesn&#39;t matter. Thats it.\n\n7.  For your interest, I am giving you the r=\r\neference of talks with Sri Ramana Maharishi - please, don&#39;t drag me in a di=\r\nscussion because am clear about it, but you may resolve all your doubts by =\r\nreading the talks. Here is an Excerpt (Page 560):\n\n&quot;...Chidakasa (chit-ethe=\r\nr) is Pure Knowledge only, It is the source\nof mind. Just at the moment of =\r\nrising up, the mind is only light;\nonly afterwards the thought &quot;I am this&quot; =\r\nrises up; this `I-thought&#39;\nforms the jiva and the world.\n\n   The first ligh=\r\nt is the pure mind, the mind ether or Isvara. Its modes manifest as objects=\r\n. Because it contains all these objects within itself it is called the mind=\r\n-ether. Why ether? Like ether containing objects it contains the thoughts, =\r\ntherefore it is the mind-ether.\n\n   Again, just as the physical ether thoug=\r\nh accommodating all the gross objects (the whole universe) is itself the co=\r\nntent of the mind-ether, so also the latter is itself the content of Chit-e=\r\nther. The last one is Chit Itself. There are no things contained in it. It =\r\nremains as Pure Knowledge only....&quot;\n\n\nON 3 GUNAS\n\nSatva is the light,\nRajas=\r\n is the subject, and\nTamas is the object.\n\n  Even the satva light is only r=\r\neflected light. Were it pure, original Light, there would be no modificatio=\r\nn in it. The manokasa (mind-ether) is reflected as bhootakasa (element-ethe=\r\nr) and objects are seen as being separate from the subject.\n\nRegards,\nNitis=\r\nh\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostu=\r\ndent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nitish,\n&gt; \n&gt; You clearly contradict Adi Sankara&#39;s Vive=\r\nkacudamani (VC from here on). Please tell us why we should listen to you, n=\r\not him. Specifically, you insist chitta is a tattwa. Whereas when VC uses t=\r\nhe word Chitta as a verb, i.e. consciousness, then this property is only po=\r\nssessed by Brahman because only it is Sat-chitta-ananda. When VC uses this =\r\nword as a noun, it is used as a modification of antahakarana (whose other t=\r\nhree modifications are manas, ahamkara and buddhi). So to put this is conte=\r\nxt, VC clearly implies that at the material level of tattwas, we see the Li=\r\nnga Sarira. One of the constructs of Linga sarira is antahakrana. One of it=\r\ns &quot;modifications&quot; is chitta. I take this to mean (since I take that only Br=\r\nahman can have true chitta (verb))it is that property of the antahakarana t=\r\nhat, when enlivened by Brahman, gives awareness/consciousness to the Linga =\r\nsarira.\n&gt; \n&gt; How exactly am I wrong. Only facts and explanations please, no=\r\n proof by ridicule/intimidation. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Patanjalis&#39; Chitta Vrittis&#39; correspond to the 5 tattwas and are all ha=\r\nppening on the background of Chitta, the all-pervading 6th tattwa. The norm=\r\nal-human- experience happens by the 5 modifications/ movement of Chitta (fi=\r\nnest creation).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; How would the Soul become aware of the more materi=\r\nal Aakash Tattwa (and thus a single coherent self pervading the material ph=\r\nysical body), if it were not standing behind the Chitta (SuperEther) ?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Thus, all our experiences of matter are through non-material Chitta, a=\r\nnd it doesn&#39;t imply that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist. If you could calm all th=\r\nose modifications of Chitta, you would have your self-realized.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn Aajnaa chakra lies the primordial state of the universe where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ther=\r\ne is just space and time, but no five elements.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nothing comes out =\r\nfrom nothing. How can the lower tattwas evolve from higher tattwas, if even=\r\n their subtle representations are purged from existence altogether ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Greatest of the Seers have already put down the scriptures in writing, s=\r\no that people like us can benefit.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
