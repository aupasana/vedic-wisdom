I have seen the priests who do it just for mone=\r\ny without any devotion, and few of them don&#39;t even chant &#39;CHAMAKAM&#39; durng t=\r\nhe rudrabhisheka.\nIs there any standard procedure for rudrabhisheka? It wou=\r\nld be really great if some one points me to the correct procedure. Mr. P. V=\r\n. R. Narasimha Rao has done a great service by providing simplified homam p=\r\nrocedure on his website vedivastrologer.org. If similar type of resources a=\r\nre created for rudrabhisheka, it will be a great help for people like me wh=\r\no want to do the abhishekam on their own.\n\nThanks & Regards\nAmit Agrawal\n--=\r\n------------------------------------------\nOn Tue, 25/2/14, Narasimha P.V.R=\r\n.
