But =\r\nlet me say some things clearly, I think they may help you. It is probably t=\r\nrue that you have had some significant spiritual experiences, which is why =\r\nyou speak with authority. I have no problem with that, and that is why I ac=\r\ntually expect to find some wisdom in your words. But see, the problem with =\r\nspiritual experience is terminology, terminology, terminology. Ordinary sen=\r\nsory experiences are easily communicated - it is easy to say the word &quot;tree=\r\n&quot; and you know exactly what I mean - because trees are available everywhere=\r\n in common sensory experience. But not so with spiritual experience, they a=\r\nre by definition outside common sensory experience! So if you want to commu=\r\nnicate your ideas (if you dont that&#39;s fine too), you will have to invest so=\r\nme significant time in coming to common ground (with others) before ideas g=\r\net exchanged for the benefit of all. \n\nI will take your current post as an =\r\nexample. I will try to explain my terminology as clearly as possible and yo=\r\nu will then see that there is some common ground between you and everyone e=\r\nlse here: The essential point in all our minds when we talk Ahamkara, ego e=\r\ntc is, in very loose essence, a &quot;centering principle&quot;, right? It is that ce=\r\nntering principle which either is, or leads to, the formation of an individ=\r\nuality, no? At every level of existence, no? \n\nI think you will agree with =\r\nthe above. Now, from my understanding of what you write, when you say Ahamk=\r\nara is the dominant I sense in the physical cosmos, Manas in astral cosmos =\r\nand Chitta in the causal cosmos, you are simply in essence trying to convey=\r\n the fact that at difference levels of existence the actual centers are dif=\r\nferent, which is probably true. It is common experience that for all of us =\r\nin everyday experience, we are not aware of our deeper senses of self (I am=\r\n not using any loaded terms here, simply the loosely defined term &quot;self&quot;). =\r\nOur senses of self are clearly body centered. \n\nSo what you are trying to d=\r\no, are at least what I get from your writings, is to call that body centere=\r\nd sense of self Ahamkara, right? Whereas everyone else on this forum is usi=\r\nng the standard Upanishadic terms wherein Ahamkara is the centering princip=\r\nle! There is only one underlying centering principle, which creates an appa=\r\nrent sense of self in the manas, in the body and everywhere else you mentio=\r\nn. Or do you disagree that at the root, there isnt only one causative cente=\r\nring principle?\n\nI could do the above for the rest of your writings and pro=\r\nbably reach common ground, but it would take time which as I said I am sudd=\r\nenly at a shortage of. But it would be easier if you tried and understood t=\r\nhe terms as everyone uses them here, so the exchange of ideas and understan=\r\nding would be much quicker and without the conflict..\n\nRegards\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;yeeahoo_99&quot; &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; Dear Narasimha and Sundeep,\n&gt; \n&gt;    Thanks for you=\r\nr feedback.

My comments on that is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  I-=\r\nness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control =\r\nany other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt;    Reason:\n&gt;    Soul is the only T=\r\nruth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. T=\r\nhus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each oth=\r\ner. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to us=\r\ne his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ne=\r\nss derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt;    He has no Buddhi o=\r\nr discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and te=\r\nll it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the sense=\r\ns due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; \n&gt;    I hope this cl=\r\narifies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nitish\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Out of the 19 =\r\nor 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea =\r\n&quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosen=\r\nse or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a ph=\r\nysical body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible=\r\n person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a g=\r\nreat person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying =\r\nwith the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the phys=\r\nical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name fr=\r\nom distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s=\r\n consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards=\r\n the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself =\r\nto more than a body.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One=\r\n may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may t=\r\nhink of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a differen=\r\nt body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that =\r\nso and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away =\r\nfrom the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in =\r\na dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Your idea t=\r\nhat ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamka=\r\nra or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Also, your idea th=\r\nat deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have=\r\n physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thin=\r\nks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he wo=\r\nuld not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of in=\r\ndividualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the =\r\nword &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (=\r\nintellectual/discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interact=\r\ns with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas inter=\r\nacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things.=\r\n My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this=\r\n and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part c=\r\nannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memor=\r\nies and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriya=\r\ns etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play=\r\n different roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some =\r\nof those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;    Am not m=\r\nixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

There are dif=\r\nferent abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized consci=\r\nousness.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas includ=\r\ning the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational or causal body,=\r\n but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (See point 5.). As=\r\ntral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t h=\r\nave to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara=\r\n/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they a=\r\nre all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeat=\r\nes through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2=\r\n. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;    There is a fine line between=\r\n the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-n=\r\ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the=\r\n three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurre=\r\nction implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara inc=\r\nluding all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Individuality of a causal-bodied bei=\r\nng is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot=\r\n be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of th=\r\ne Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 idea=\r\ns. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to a=\r\nct upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the function=\r\ning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forc=\r\nes and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is indepen=\r\ndent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas=\r\n and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as exi=\r\nstence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara=\r\n. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind =\r\nstill carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that partic=\r\nular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basi=\r\ns of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well=\r\n, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmo=\r\nses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied=\r\n beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities=\r\n. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness=\r\n for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astr=\r\nal/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sens=\r\ne-consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousnes=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive-consciousness =\r\nas the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Howev=\r\ner, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is w=\r\nhy it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and rein=\r\ncarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   As an example, Devatas, with =\r\ntheir finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their ph=\r\nysical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni d=\r\nigests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that wo=\r\nuld require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one =\r\nis mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are,=\r\n however, Astral/Causal-bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence t=\r\nhe Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the o=\r\nther hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out =\r\ntheir Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta =\r\n(remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) ar=\r\ne parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the e=\r\nnd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobio=\r\ngraphy of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that=\r\n include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, =\r\n5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force)=\r\n and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n   Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one =\r\nor two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causa=\r\nl bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic conscious=\r\nness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at differe=\r\nnt times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be=\r\n termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence =\r\nI wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Thus, the idea of Ahamkara i=\r\ns bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Manas with Subtle Astral v=\r\nibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undeveloped =\r\nirrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to =\r\ntheir Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   BTW, C=\r\nhitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressio=\r\nns of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, =\r\nit doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions,=\r\n just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatical=\r\nly burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   The Samskaras stored=\r\n by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, =\r\ncorrespond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence =\r\nthe &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous ma=\r\nil). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-g=\r\nuni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all=\r\n residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coher=\r\nent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti=\r\n (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n   In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -=\r\n6\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of s=\r\neeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Since astral-=\r\nbodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, tast=\r\ne and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not=\r\n take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Simil=\r\narly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;    Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is associa=\r\nted with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness, must=\r\n be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi=\r\n (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who ca=\r\nnnot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are per=\r\nmitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos.

For e=\r\nxample, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical b=\r\nody, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resid=\r\nes in the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkarana=\r\ns, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) a=\r\nre parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sen=\r\nsory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinkin=\r\ng mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta (rememberi=\r\nng or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously=\r\n stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sens=\r\ne of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousn=\r\ness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down t=\r\nhe individualized consciousness into various groups by functionality, like =\r\nfive koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmend=\r\nriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness i=\r\ns the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to different people, a jn=\r\naana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination.

One pursuing that path may or may not deba=\r\nte with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will analyz=\r\ne and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is=\r\n imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminatin=\r\ng things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a be=\r\nginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like =\r\nthis and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self.
