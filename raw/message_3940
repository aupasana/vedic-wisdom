One person in my office read your mes=\r\nsage and she was very happy reading it because she identified with your tho=\r\nughts instantly and i am sure that you have echoed feelings of few others.\n=\r\n\nBUT i am not entirely agreeing with this. It sounds like- because &#39;Agni&#39; i=\r\ns very effective medium for praying, one is taking its advantage to get all=\r\n the mundane benefits, release from various troubling issues, fulfilling th=\r\ne worldly ambitions. It&#39;s like switching the source (Normal prayers in temp=\r\nles, Japam etc...) for asking the same thing. It&#39;s like acting very smart w=\r\nith God. \n\nNarasimha Insisted in his homam manual about the mental attitude=\r\n. He indicated that one is hoped to use these manuals for Spiritual purpose=\r\n (purifying or getting control over internal nature) and to the benefit of =\r\nthe external nature (World at large) \n\nI am not trying to be rude or &#39;holie=\r\nr than thou&#39; but sincerely request you to change this mental attitude. I, y=\r\nou and others must cultivate the idea of self surrender. Oh Mother! We are =\r\ndoing this homam and request you to take us from darkness to Light, from le=\r\nsser truth to higher truth, from poison (desires) to Nectar (Devotion). Ple=\r\nase make us so strong that we can accept, with mental equilibrium, whatever=\r\n you decide for us. Eradicate our ego and make us tools in your hands. Make=\r\n us sit on your lap by purifying us.\nAfter some few years struggle, i have =\r\nunderstood that one must not confuse Spiritual rituals with Material benefi=\r\nts.\n\nAs Narayana said our money, fame etc...are the result of Rnas/Karmas. =\r\n\n\nWe must pray during homam for the continuation of daily Homam. Let Mother=\r\n take care of that in the same breath i would also say here that it is perf=\r\nectly human to ask for help if something in life is really going unbearable=\r\n. If once in a while, i ask Maha Ganapati to show me a way out from a troub=\r\nled relationship or disastrous financial troubles. such prayer may naturall=\r\ny come if one is really going through deep trouble and that should be fine =\r\nbut we must consciously avoid to pray for so called good things in life-Nam=\r\ne, fame, money, career, Roti, Kapada, makan, dukan, biwi, bachha, motor gad=\r\ni etc...:)\n\nRegret if I was all &quot;Chhota mu badi baat&quot;\n\nYours,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajesh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narsimhagaru, Utpal, Rajarshi and others..\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Last =\r\nyear, I was in trouble ( financial/social/physical) &=C2=A0I was fortunate =\r\nto be advised by my friend utpal to start homam..

Whether it is Krishna or Chandi, they may test by push=\r\ning the person to an extreme, but they never push beyond the breaking limit=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the mind identifies with something, that thing may be negativel=\r\ny affected by god to let one realize that that thing is transient and does =\r\nnot matter. As one realizes it a little, it may be more negatively affected=\r\n. Finally, one may be pushed to an extreme.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, god is kind (even=\r\n an ugra devata). God never pushes one to the breaking limit. God may push =\r\none short of the breaking limit. The breaking limit may change and then god=\r\n may push further.\n&gt; \n&gt; To use the analogy from the other mail of today, go=\r\nd the teacher does not test the 5th grade student with 6th grade questions.=\r\n Of course, a 5th grade student passing from 5th grade to the 6th grade wil=\r\nl now be tested with 6th grade questions.
