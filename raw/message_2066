But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our \n&gt; texts say - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any \n&gt; choice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the \n&gt; divine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity \n&gt; and overcoming ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short Chandi \n&gt; homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the \n&gt; following mail:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not proficient in \n&gt; his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of the ten \n&gt; incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who and \n&gt; a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with \n&gt; white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was \n&gt; Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I \n&gt; was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This \n&gt; was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future \n&gt; that is to come has not already happened. It has already happened in \n&gt; reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I \n&gt; mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I \n&gt; said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is \n&gt; not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main \n&gt; characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, \n&gt; contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he \n&gt; could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened \n&gt; at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a \n&gt; movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some \n&gt; people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen \n&gt; later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying \n&gt; something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is \n&gt; going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But \n&gt; somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has \n&gt; already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along \n&gt; these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision \n&gt; over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably \n&gt; confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things, \n&gt; this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody \n&gt; who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible \n&gt; and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, \n&gt; in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. \n&gt; It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman \n&gt; or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small \n&gt; naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. \n&gt; When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and \n&gt; powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel \n&gt; normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful \n&gt; and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done \n&gt; here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire \n&gt; consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before \n&gt; that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting \n&gt; next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second \n&gt; time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the \n&gt; garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main \n&gt; Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint \n&gt; in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three \n&gt; occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that \n&gt; boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is \n&gt; the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say \n&gt; it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter \n&gt; than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in \n&gt; making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that \n&gt; internal purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better \n&gt; and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has \n&gt; to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay \n&gt; attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The \n&gt; only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how \n&gt; smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist \n&gt; attraction to external things better and you can resist internal \n&gt; enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma \n&gt; better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the \n&gt; root cause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but \n&gt; bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including \n&gt; your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s \n&gt; property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these \n&gt; properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining \n&gt; the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of \n&gt; his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as \n&gt; his or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for \n&gt; taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the \n&gt; best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a \n&gt; servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept \n&gt; that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables \n&gt; one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about \n&gt; what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s \n&gt; properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without \n&gt; getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!

But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts\nsay - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ¬†&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any\nchoice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the\ndivine.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ¬†&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ¬†&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ¬†Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam,\npurity and overcoming ego&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@\nyahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short\nChandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the\nfollowing mail:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt;\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not proficient\nin his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of the\nten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who\nand a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with\nwhite clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was\nKalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But,\nwhen I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious\nthought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above\nmail.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the\nfuture that is to come has not already happened. It has already\nhappened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You\nknow what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not\nto know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This\nboy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main\ncharacteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind,\ncontented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he\ncould not express himself.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already\nhappened at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of\nlike a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio.\nSome people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the\nscreen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you\nsaying something like that?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If\nsomething is going to happen in future, it will happen when future\ncomes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because\nit has already happened.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking\nalong these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his\nvision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably\nconfused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things,\nthis probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody\nwho had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and\ncame to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness.\nHowever, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes\nchanged. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual\nAatman or Brahman or Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a\nsmall naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before\nname. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense\nand powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel\nnormally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful\nand a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done\nhere. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire\nconsciousnss.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice\nbefore that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating\nsitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India.\nSecond time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside\nthe garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the\nmain Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great\nsaint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three\noccasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes,\nthat boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this\nis the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to\nsay it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure,\nshorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was\nsuccessful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline\nis that internal purity is the most important thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual\nbetter and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one\nhas to keep doing it until one breaks through.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay\nattention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The\nonly worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller\nyour ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to\nexternal things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust,\nanger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego -\nthinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all\nproblems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging,\nbut bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you -\nincluding your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body -\nis god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of\nthese properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without\nentertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very\ngood care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those\nthings as his or her belongings.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary\nfor taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes\nthe best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a\nservant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept\nthat is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables\none to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry about what\none does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of\nmaster&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life\nwithout getting caught and overcome ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n--------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt;\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://vedicastro.&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/a&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/a&gt; nath.org&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n--------- - &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &amp;#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!\nCRICKET &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://cricket.yahoo.com&quot;&gt;http://cricket.\nyahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\r\n--------------040908080709020009070602--\r\n\n"}}
