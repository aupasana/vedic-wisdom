Even in the prelimina=\r\nry stage one should join the ascetic order, as this voluntary renunciation =\r\nwhile yet a neophyte will qualify the aspirant for Vedantic study.\nThe srut=\r\ni says: =E2=80=9COne should leave the house the very day dispassion dawns i=\r\nn him.=E2=80=9D\nThe sannyasi is free from all kinds of worldly distractions=\r\n, ties and attachments The garb puts a check on the aspirant from going ast=\r\nray or doing evil actions. When there is internal change, when one is ready=\r\n for entering the fourth ashrama of life, why should he be afraid of puttin=\r\ng on the orange-colored robe? Why should he say, =E2=80=9CI have given colo=\r\nring to my heart?=E2=80=9D It is a sort of timidity and hypocrisy. Vasanas =\r\n(subtle desires) still lurk in his heart. \n\n\n"}}
