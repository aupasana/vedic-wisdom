While in the procedure given for hamam the h=\r\noma kund for better cleaning can be covered by aluminium foil. I am confuse=\r\nd whether to use aluminium foil or not.\n2)I have been doing homam after reg=\r\nular pooja. Can I do shodachopchar pooja before homam and keep the idol on =\r\nthe back side ( east of homa kund,- my deoghar is raised so that the idol o=\r\ng ganapati is slightly above homam kunda)of homa kunda. And then follow the=\r\n regular procedure of homam. \n3)Beetal nut as poornahuti does not burn comp=\r\nletely, so a piece of coconut is okay?\nWith regards,\nmadhusudan\n\n\n"}}
