One may accept whatever material results god gives, but=\r\n be prepared for any results and take what god gives as mahaprasad. Sure, s=\r\nome people have gotten great material results from homam, but there are no =\r\nguarantees.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If you have a dharmik material result in mind (e=\r\n.g. marriage, childbirth, getting a job etc), it is ok to think of it, but =\r\ndo not get into the frame of mind that homam will solve your problem. Use h=\r\nomam as a way to reach god and then let god decide what is right for you. A=\r\nccept that what you currently want may or may not be the best for you.

Her slaying of Mahisha, Nishumbha, Shumbha etc symbolize=\r\n slaying one&#39;s pride (over one&#39;s achievements), one&#39;s mamata or mine-ness (=\r\nlooking at things, including body, as &quot;mine&quot;), one&#39;s asmita or I-am-ness (t=\r\nhe very notion that one exists as a being separate from Brahman) etc. As an=\r\nyone trying to overcome those will know, it is not an easy task at all. Cha=\r\nndi represents a very fierce approach to it, which simply destroys those (a=\r\nnd puts one in samadhi!). In sadhana and rituals, we use symbols and eventu=\r\nally external symbols resonate with internal happenings.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; For=\r\n most people, Chandi is too fierce. Though phalasruti entices with all kind=\r\ns of nice results (which is the case with most prayers in Hinduism!), pleas=\r\ne note that Chandi is not for everyone.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Especially so with C=\r\nhandi homam. Fire amplifies things and the energy of the prayer resonates i=\r\nn the internal fire faster. I humbly suggest that people should not rush in=\r\nto Chandi homam. Not that it produces bad results. It may produce supreme r=\r\nesults, but you may not be looking for those or be ready for them!\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; It is better to do Chandipath for a few weeks or months, before try=\r\ning Chandi homam.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Also, don&#39;=\r\nt think that Chandi homam is the only homam for fast progress. Most higher =\r\ndeities (Krishna, Vishnu, Shiva, Lakshmi, Hanuman etc) are capable of givin=\r\ng all material and spiritual results one may imagine.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If you=\r\n can find a deity whose homam generates love and feeling inside your heart,=\r\n THAT homam is the right homam for you.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; In fact, even Ganapa=\r\nthi homam is capable of giving everything. Because we worship Ganapathi in =\r\nthe beginning of every homam, people look at Ganapathi homam as an &quot;appetiz=\r\ner&quot; and Chandi homam etc as the &quot;full meal&quot;. That&#39;s not correct. Even Ganap=\r\nathi homam can be a &quot;full meal&quot;.
