I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n\nNear the beginning of the =\r\n20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo,=\r\n began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high =\r\nstates of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the=\r\n evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on=\r\n Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now.=\r\n He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakd=\r\nown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards t=\r\nhis =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo was joined in Pondic=\r\nherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as =\r\nthe Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular trans=\r\nformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today=\r\n.\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, a=\r\nnd that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of t=\r\nhe divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The proc=\r\ness by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolut=\r\nion. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these t=\r\nwo events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresa=\r\nw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDs=\r\nupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change e=\r\nverything on Earth.\n=EF=BF=BD\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is,=\r\n says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is som=\r\newhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal s=\r\npirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of h=\r\nis constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if=\r\n the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.\n\nSri Aurobindo re=\r\ncognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage ha=\r\ns been reached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the o=\r\nne hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as=\r\n a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a =\r\nconsciousness higher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the S=\r\nupermind, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is =\r\nactive there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.=\r\n\n\nEvolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later w=\r\nith the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forw=\r\nard, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind.=\r\n Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will s=\r\noon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=\r\n=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing =\r\nan individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging =\r\nwith it.\n=EF=BF=BD\nNext is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species tha=\r\nt is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expandi=\r\nng supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from s=\r\noul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n\nThirdly is the =EF=BF=\r\n=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=\r\n be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =\r\nthat has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n\nFinally, our ultimat=\r\ne goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity in=\r\ncarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of w=\r\nhat we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the=\r\n unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n\nThe great =\r\nwork of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousn=\r\ness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is=\r\n a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was=\r\n simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, a=\r\nwaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in coll=\r\nective matter.\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corre=\r\nsponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience=\r\n with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at=\r\n work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suff=\r\nering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces=\r\n that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current=\r\n global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone=\r\n through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned=\r\n to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth=\r\n. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=\r\n=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive in=\r\nner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how =\r\nthis same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current polit=\r\nical sphere.\n\nWith the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our =\r\nold obsolete human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo em=\r\nphasized that although the changes will be enormous they would not be neces=\r\nsarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and=\r\n our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, h=\r\ne maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this re=\r\nsistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras wil=\r\nl eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Bea=\r\nuty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence i=\r\nn the world today, the destruction we might have experienced if not for thi=\r\ns power of harmonization!\n\nWhen does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the=\r\n Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and=\r\n that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental t=\r\nransformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a mini=\r\nmum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=\r\n=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nThis was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says abou=\r\nt changes coming in the world.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nThe upsurge (of c=\r\nonsciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n \n\n_______________________________=\r\n_\nICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!

A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tre=\r\nmendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to preve=\r\nnt its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified befo=\r\nre her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, =\r\nwhat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fiel=\r\nds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into=\r\n cellular consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Evolution took a great leap forward=\r\n with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now=\r\n at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepa=\r\nre for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stag=\r\nes of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurr=\r\nently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current =\r\nspecies, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely ob=\r\nstructed from contacting and merging with it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =\r\nbirth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=\r\nhat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=\r\nind-consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOv=\r\nerman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be i=\r\nn possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that =\r\nhas begun to merge with cellular consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Bein=\r\ng,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. T=\r\nhis will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=\r\n=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized=\r\n upon Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother =\r\nwas in bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousn=\r\ness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant =\r\nthat the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into th=\r\ne consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flow=\r\ner into its full manifestation in collective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Whenever there is a=\r\n =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo=\r\n and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is=\r\n the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and=\r\n the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, a=\r\nnd which seem to be in control of current global events.

Interestingly, they spoke of th=\r\ne Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during Wor=\r\nld War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influenc=\r\ne. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing =\r\nother world leaders in the current political sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With th=\r\ne descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human st=\r\nructures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that althoug=\r\nh the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. =\r\nThe power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the mo=\r\nst part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried=\r\n a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means oth=\r\ner than dramatic struggle and violence.
