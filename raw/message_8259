What you call first =\r\nstage is dominated by tamas, with some rajas too. What you call the second =\r\nstage is dominated by rajas, with some tamas too. What you call the third s=\r\ntage is dominated by satta, with some rajas too.=C2=A0This can be further b=\r\nroken down as follows:=C2=A0(1) Mostly tamas: Does not think about spiritua=\r\nl sadhana or progress. May fear god and go to temple or see/do poojas now a=\r\nnd then.(2) Mostly tamas, with some rajas: Engages in some sadhana. But the=\r\n ignorance and attachments bring fears, worries, anxieties, doubts etc. As =\r\ntamas reduces and rajas increases, doubts and fears are allayed to some ext=\r\nent, some direction is found and there is more focused effort.(3) Mostly ra=\r\njas, some tamas: Engages in a lot of sadhana, but still has some misconcept=\r\nions and doubts in mind. As tamas reduces, doubts and misconceptions reduce=\r\n.(4) Mostly rajas, some sattwa: Engages in a\n lot of sadhana and focus and =\r\nclarity of thinking starts to set in. As sattwa increases, one&#39;s thinking, =\r\nvision and focus become clearer.(5) Mostly sattwa, some rajas: Weaknesses t=\r\nhat troubled earlier start to trouble less and there is mental clarity. The=\r\nre is still some passion, attachment and resultant internal stress (i.e. re=\r\nsisting divine will or the fruits of previous karmas), which reduces as raj=\r\nas reduces.(6) Mostly sattwa: Clear vision, nice focus of mind in sadhana, =\r\nvery good acceptance of divine will (fruits of previous karmas) and flowing=\r\n with the divine rhythm.=C2=A0There can be several other abstractions to lo=\r\nok at stages in sadhana. Vasishtha describes some in Yoga Vaasishtham.=C2=\r\n=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0One important thing to note is that sadhana and spir=\r\nitual progress are not something to flaunt. If one is in stage 2 or 3, it i=\r\ns nothing to be ashamed of and one need not pretend otherwise. The most imp=\r\nortant thing is to be honest\n internally. If there are doubts and anxieties=\r\n, there is no point in suppressing them. They should be addressed in the ea=\r\nrnest. A proper and natural evolution of understanding comes with time to e=\r\nveryone. Pretensions of being someone one is not and forceful suppression o=\r\nf misunderstandings does not help in the long run.=C2=A0Secondly, one need =\r\nnot spend a fixed amount of time in each stage. Some people make fast progr=\r\ness and some people take more time. If God wills, one can become liberated =\r\nin a second. So don&#39;t worry wherever you are in terms of these &quot;stages&quot;.=C2=\r\n=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0BTW, what you say of &quot;external experiences&quot; applies =\r\nto &quot;internal experiences&quot; as well. After all, mind (especially an imaginati=\r\nve one) is capable of &quot;manufacturing&quot; over time whatever it fancies. Some e=\r\nxperiences can be hallucinations. Even when not, they can reinforce some un=\r\nneeded conditioning. I am not just talking about beginners, but even highly=\r\n evolved\n sadhakas.=C2=A0For example, there have been several elevated yogi=\r\ns claiming to be the reincarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may al=\r\nl have genuinely believed it and not trying to deceive anyone. If one&#39;s min=\r\nd nurtured a secret desire to be somebody important and if one likes Ramakr=\r\nishna, it is possible to experience an internal vision suggesting that one =\r\nis a reincarnation of Ramakrishna.=C2=A0Let me give a subtler example. I wa=\r\ns once discussing the meaning of &quot;Mantra Pushpam&quot; here (see http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7015). A learned yogi wrote to me that =\r\nit was about denser elements dissolving in lighter elements as Kundalini as=\r\ncends and denser elements coming back from lighter elements as Kundalini de=\r\nscends. When I pointed out weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me th=\r\nat that was the *vision* (internal experience) he got when he meditated wit=\r\nh it. However, that absolutely does not add up. What is described in Mantra=\r\n Pushpam\n is not chain of X merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, al=\r\nl elements are not covered. Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in water=\r\n, water lies in X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is dif=\r\nferent from dissolution and creation of elements as happens when Kundalini =\r\nascends and descends.=C2=A0However, I can believe that that yogi may have i=\r\nndeed gotten the vision as he claimed. When one looks at a verse (or any ot=\r\nher notion or idea), one&#39;s rational mind may consciously or sub-consciously=\r\n come up with an intellectual understanding. If an imaginative and focused =\r\nmind meditates then, it may indeed experience a corresponding vision! It is=\r\n all a play of mind and of no significance. Not every internal experience o=\r\nf even an elevated yogi who genuinely experienced aspects of divine (but no=\r\nt yet liberated) may mean something.=C2=A0Knowing which internal experience=\r\n is a result of some conditioning, some desire or some rational/emotional n=\r\notion\n still present in the mind, is not easy, even for good and sincere sa=\r\ndhakas.=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0External and internal experiences cannot=\r\n be avoided as one does sadhana. Depending on one&#39;s conditioning, one may e=\r\nxperience many things.=C2=A0Whether an experience is external or internal i=\r\ns not IMHO the main thing. Both can be useful in some cases and increase fa=\r\nith and confidence or give clarity of thinking, and trigger positive intern=\r\nal transformation. Both can be detrimental in some cases and increase pride=\r\n or reinforce some wrong notions, and delay positive internal transformatio=\r\nn or even trigger negative internal transformation.=C2=A0Vasishtha&#39;s guidan=\r\nce is very clear. Neither seek nor avoid experiences (which are like roadsi=\r\nde trees as one travels on a hilly road to the top of the hill). Keep the m=\r\nind focused on sadhana to the best of your ability.=C2=A0Though I said it b=\r\nefore, I will say this again, because it is worth saying many times:=C2=A0T=\r\nhe\n only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and the only experience w=\r\north longing is the internal experience of detachment. If one experiences l=\r\ness stress in situations that would&#39;ve stressed one before, if one experien=\r\nces less anger in situations that would&#39;ve angered one before, if one exper=\r\niences less lust in situations that would&#39;ve made one lusty before, if one =\r\nexperiences less jealosy in situations that would&#39;ve made one jealous befor=\r\ne, and so on, then one is making progress.=C2=A0Best regards,Narasimha-----=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------=C2=A0 Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ri=\r\ntual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=C2=A0 Jyotish writings:\n http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam108--------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------=C2=A0 =C2=A0On Thu, May 10, 2012 at 2:57 PM, rajars=\r\nhi14 wrote:\nThree stages of sadhana, as I see it. Purely my own observation=\r\ns. Not points of debate. Everyone is free to disagree. \n1st stage of Sadhan=\r\na: Try out scoops of everything, hanging on to solicited or unsolicited adv=\r\nice from anywhere and everwhere, and eventually moving in confused circles,=\r\n feeling proud and happy about the fact that, yes I am doing something call=\r\ned sadhana while many others are not. The mind lies in the communal stage (=\r\ncommunal =3D anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not necessar=\r\nily in a religious sense), trying to find a community of similar minded ind=\r\nividuals and hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define itself=\r\n. \n2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of &quot;experiences&quot; in an externa=\r\nl format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either fee=\r\nls happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called ext=\r\nernal &quot;experiences&quot; are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts start=\r\n creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to stage =\r\n1 described above. \n3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of the ex=\r\nternal experiences compared to what is happening inside, if at all anything=\r\n is happening. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind, all=\r\n of it is meaningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millions de=\r\nities may dance infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is not =\r\nable to still the &quot;monkey-mind&quot; and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentrated f=\r\neeling of internal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular activitie=\r\ns and thoughts, it&#39;s so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is firmly e=\r\nstablished in this stage, will never bother too much about the external rit=\r\nual, its source, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external rituals, b=\r\nut he/she realizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of a sa=\r\ndhana is inside the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the &quot;alone&quot; ph=\r\nase. Alone, but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external validatio=\r\nn, in being\n alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy. \nAs =\r\nsuch, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy informat=\r\nion he/she will try to extract is what has the other person experienced int=\r\nernally, and be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which deity=\r\n he/she is trying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classifications d=\r\no not impress him/her anymore. \nFrom here starts the real journey. Before t=\r\nhat, stage 1 and stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sadhaka m=\r\nust ask himself/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where is he/=\r\nshe headed! \n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--908827570-2085437001-1337217209=:83503\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Although I =\r\ndo not have any personal thoughts to share, Swami Krishnananda has penned s=\r\nome nice thoughts on this topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/u=\r\npanishad/upan_14.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neat thing is that one can also listen to it (=\r\nleft hand corner on the webpage: &quot;listen&quot;)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A nice website, in genera=\r\nl with a lot of e-books and audio/video lectures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sat,=\r\n 5/12/12, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;i&gt;&lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nlockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5p=\r\nx; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] RE: Stages of Sadhana&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Saturday, May 12, 2012, 11:00 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv13=\r\n87739654&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1387739654ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div a=\r\nlign=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Namaste R=\r\najarshi,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Ve=\r\nrdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00=\r\n0000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;What you are describing is essentially ev=\r\nolution of gunas.

If one is in stage 2 or 3, it is nothing to be ashamed of and one=\r\n need not pretend otherwise. The most important thing is to be honest inter=\r\nnally. If there are doubts and anxieties, there is no point in suppressing =\r\nthem. They should be addressed in the earnest. A proper and natural evoluti=\r\non of understanding comes with time to everyone. Pretensions of being someo=\r\nne one is not and forceful suppression of misunderstandings does not help i=\r\nn the long run.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot;\n face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Secondly, one need not spend a fi=\r\nxed amount of time in each stage. Some people make fast progress and some p=\r\neople take more time. If God wills, one can become liberated in a second.

After all, min=\r\nd (especially an imaginative one) is capable of &quot;manufacturing&quot; over time w=\r\nhatever it fancies. Some experiences can be hallucinations. Even when not, =\r\nthey can reinforce some unneeded\n conditioning. I am not just talking about=\r\n beginners, but even highly evolved sadhakas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEF=\r\nT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;For =\r\nexample, there have been several elevated yogis claiming to be the reincarn=\r\nations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may all have genuinely believed it =\r\nand not trying to deceive anyone. If one&#39;s mind nurtured a secret desire to=\r\n be somebody important and if one likes Ramakrishna, it is possible to expe=\r\nrience an internal vision suggesting that one is a reincarnation of Ramakri=\r\nshna.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verda=\r\nna&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00000=\r\n0&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Let me give a subtler example. I was once di=\r\nscussing the meaning of &quot;Mantra Pushpam&quot; here (see http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom/message/7015). A learned yogi wrote to\n me that it was a=\r\nbout denser elements dissolving in lighter elements as Kundalini ascends an=\r\nd denser elements coming back from lighter elements as Kundalini descends. =\r\nWhen I pointed out weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me that that =\r\nwas the *vision* (internal experience) he got when he meditated with it. Ho=\r\nwever, that absolutely does not add up. What is described in Mantra Pushpam=\r\n is not chain of X merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, all element=\r\ns are not covered. Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in water, water l=\r\nies in X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is different fr=\r\nom dissolution and creation of elements as happens when Kundalini ascends a=\r\nnd descends.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;However, I can believe that that y=\r\nogi may have indeed gotten the vision as he claimed. When one looks at\n a v=\r\nerse (or any other notion or idea), one&#39;s rational mind may consciously or =\r\nsub-consciously come up with an intellectual understanding. If an imaginati=\r\nve and focused mind meditates then, it may indeed experience a correspondin=\r\ng vision! It is all a play of mind and of no significance. Not every intern=\r\nal experience of even an elevated yogi who genuinely experienced aspects of=\r\n divine (but not yet liberated) may mean something.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;=\r\n2&quot;&gt;Knowing which internal experience is a result of some conditioning, some=\r\n desire or some rational/emotional notion still present in the mind, is not=\r\n easy, even for good and sincere sadhakas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Ve=\r\nrdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00=\r\n0000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;External and internal experiences cannot =\r\nbe avoided as one does sadhana.

The mind lies in the communal =\r\nstage (communal =3D anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not n=\r\necessarily in a religious sense), trying to find a community of similar min=\r\nded individuals and hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define=\r\n itself. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of &quot;experiences&quot; in an ext=\r\nernal format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either=\r\n feels happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called=\r\n external &quot;experiences&quot; are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts s=\r\ntart creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to st=\r\nage 1 described above. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana=\r\n&quot;\n size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of th=\r\ne external experiences compared to what is happening inside, if at all anyt=\r\nhing is happening. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind,=\r\n all of it is meaningless. The external world may crack open and 33 million=\r\ns deities may dance infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is =\r\nnot able to still the &quot;monkey-mind&quot; and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentrat=\r\ned feeling of internal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular activ=\r\nities and thoughts, it&#39;s so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is firm=\r\nly established in this stage, will never bother too much about the external=\r\n ritual, its source, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external ritual=\r\ns, but he/she realizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of =\r\na sadhana is inside the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the &quot;alone=\r\n&quot;\n phase. Alone, but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external vali=\r\ndation, in being alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy. =\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;As=\r\n such, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy informa=\r\ntion he/she will try to extract is what has the other person experienced in=\r\nternally, and be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which deit=\r\ny he/she is trying to worship.
