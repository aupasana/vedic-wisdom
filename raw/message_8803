I feel the sadhana gradua=\r\nlly reduces our prejudices and ego so that the same child with wonder in it=\r\ns eyes surfaces again within us. \n\nWhile walking today somebody yelled at m=\r\ne for absolutely no mistake of mine. I got furious but immediately split my=\r\n mind into two. One mind was furious on the guy who yelled at me and the ot=\r\nher mind was studying the furious mind. This revealed my silly self which w=\r\nanted to kill that person for making some noise. I laughed at this scheme. =\r\nI felt like thanking that person and god for presenting an insight into the=\r\n designs of my ego and saved me from useless thinking. My mistake or not bu=\r\nt i got something to learn !

It inspired me to follow my intuiti=\r\non and setup my own saadhana routine. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve recently started (just a m=\r\nonth ago) meditating on different mantras, homam and tarpana. I thoroughly =\r\nenjoyed this thread and as it reflects some of my own doubts. I&#39;ve not had =\r\nany experiences but I am a lot calmer and happy after i started. \n&gt; \n&gt; Here=\r\n are a few things I&#39;m doing:\n&gt; 1. Rising up early before sunrise (as compar=\r\ned to 3-4 hours after sun rise)\n&gt; 2. Doing pranayam, suryanamaskar, kapaal =\r\nbhaanti - all learn from youtube videos (though i have some previous knowle=\r\ndge)\n&gt; 3. Doing Ram-raksha strotram and Ganapati homam and some other strot=\r\nras that i like in &#39;Nitya Karma Pooja Prakash&#39; from geeta press.  \n&gt; 4. Fol=\r\nlowing close to satvik diet (least oil, spices) only self cooked no outside=\r\n food. (This is all to aid in saadhana).  \n&gt; \n&gt; If one you fellow sadhakas =\r\nor gurus have any tips or comments, I&#39;d be obliged. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks everyone. =\r\n\n&gt; May parampita bless us all. Hari Aum! \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;shoonyakaya&quot; &lt;shoonyakaya@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I totally agree with Vish=\r\nal & Rajarshi... Even i started my sadhana with the same question in mind. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Follow rules or not, my take on it is follow your intuition. Then=\r\n the question arises how to differentiate between intuition and wishful thi=\r\nnking? (even i am looking for an answer)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why not to follow rules?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; One might not at all begin his/her sadhana thinking of rules. Sadhana h=\r\nas to be tailored with the normal life till one finds a rythm and confidenc=\r\ne. Then the rules will be automatically followed based on the seriousness o=\r\nf the sadhak.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Why to follow rules?\n&gt; &gt; As pointed out by Rajarshi,=\r\n the chandipath had so strict rules may be because of the following reason:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 1. Some sadhanas give immediate heightened awareness to the sadhak. It=\r\n means they can smell, taste, hear and see better than normal. The world al=\r\nl of a sudden starts looking beautiful.\n&gt; &gt; 2. They can visualize better th=\r\ne details of everything and every being and get lucid dreams.\n&gt; &gt; 3. Normal=\r\n people are naturally attracted to the sadhak because of his/her composure =\r\nand grace and there is a beauty in the way they walk and talk that attracts=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The downfall:\n&gt; &gt; Despite these changes, one thing would still re=\r\nmain...the &quot;Vasanas&quot; which is a biggest obstacle to any sadhak. The normal =\r\nworld has many trigger points for vasanas which would entice the sadhak and=\r\n make him lose control over his self. For a male sadhak women would look ex=\r\ntraordinarily beautiful and start dreaming about them. Their voice, their a=\r\nctions, their laughter would haunt them day n night. Because people are att=\r\nracted towards sadhak, it boosts his ego and he/she forgets the very basic =\r\ndharmas of life. All this is not the purpose of sadhana and hence the siddh=\r\nas of past recommended seclueded life which protects sadhaka from triggerin=\r\ng the vasanas before he attains maturity.\n&gt; &gt; The first 2 sadhanas (mention=\r\ned below)though very simple, gave me the experience explained above (includ=\r\ning the downfall).\n&gt; &gt; Self-awareness at every waking moment (sometimes sle=\r\neping moment also) becomes very essential to prevent downfall. I cannot put=\r\n in words the importance of swadhyava (self-study)and Ishvara pranidhana (s=\r\nurrender to divine)in this sense. Maybe mantra jap all day long is a good i=\r\ndea (as also suggested in Vignyan Bhairava Tantra)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sadhana Krama i=\r\n followed:\n&gt; &gt; 1. jog for a kilometer and do Sudarshana Kriya\n&gt; &gt; 2. jog fo=\r\nr a kilometer or more and chant long OM and contemplate on the after-silenc=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; 3. Jap of moolamantras of navagrahas\n&gt; &gt; 4. Bandhas as given in Shiva=\r\n Samhita\n&gt; &gt; 5. Sooryanamaskar and Gayathri Sahasranam Jap (current)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The saying: An old patient is better than the new doctor. I have only pr=\r\nesented my view (with some experience)even though i am only a beginner in t=\r\nhis path so your guidance will be helpful.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Om tat sat\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
