The well-known Manu Smriti is the authority for dharma matte=\r\nrs in Satya yuga. Goutama smriti is the authority in Treta yuga. For Kali y=\r\nuga, Parasara is the authority in dharma matters.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;And &quot;Parasar=\r\na Madhaveeyam&quot; clearly sets out the following:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Compared to a =\r\nritual such as homam performed in one&#39;s name by a PRIEST, a ritual performe=\r\nd in one&#39;s name by one&#39;s own disciple is 100 times more powerful; compared =\r\nto that, a ritual performed in one&#39;s name by one&#39;s own progeny is 100 times=\r\n more powerful; compared to\n that, a ritual performed by oneself\n is 100 ti=\r\nmes more powerful.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In other words, a ritual such as homam per=\r\nformed by oneself is 1,000,000 times more powerful than a ritual performed =\r\nin one&#39;s name by a priest! THIS is the guideline given for Kali yuga.&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline is that one is on one&#39;s =\r\nown as Kali deepens and priests will be limited in their ability to give a =\r\nmaterial and spiritual uplift to others.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;All I am doing is to =\r\nenable anybody interested in doing key rituals by themselves.

There are such emails from around=\r\n the world and not just India or US or UK.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I even heard from a=\r\n few people who were serious alcoholics and were able to leave the habit af=\r\nter starting homam and are so much happier.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Fire is one thing common between various religions.

So is this right to hit on their stomaches ?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; But I am happy at the same time. For those Grihasthas who have time=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; can&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; now look up these Procedures, Videos an=\r\nd can feel like Pundits&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves and have the satisfact=\r\nions of doing homams themselves.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But at same time I feel =\r\nsad for the Pundit community too.
