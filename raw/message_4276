Of course if there were no s=\r\nnakes ever the\n&gt;&gt; mind would have never seen it would have never thought th=\r\ne rope as a snake.\n&gt;&gt; Snake and rope are real. Its as simple as that.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n When watching a movie I know that actors are mouthing dialogues written by=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; somebody else. I don&#39;t become the movie or become a character in the mo=\r\nvie\n&gt;&gt; before, during or after the movie.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hence why I said it was an =\r\nimperfect analogy.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  If doing is a figment of our minds , who is doing =\r\nwhat ? Is a real mind\n&gt;&gt; doing real things ? Is an unreal mind doing real t=\r\nhings ?Is an unreal mind\n&gt;&gt; doing unreal things ? Oh wait, is mind real or =\r\nunreal ?Take your pick.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It&#39;s not that simple. It is real to us, becau=\r\nse we are a part of it,\n&gt; within it. But the &quot;fabric&quot; itself, as it were, i=\r\ns just quantum foam soup,\n&gt; completely chaotic (well, technically stochasti=\r\nc) in apparent patterns,\n&gt; fractals are an excellent way to understand what=\r\n I&#39;m getting at. They are\n&gt; drawn from specific calculations in which pure =\r\nrandomness is introduced. And\n&gt; yet each one &quot;fits itself&quot; into a pattern a=\r\nnd repeats that pattern again and\n&gt; again.\n&gt;\n&gt;  When Lord Krishna gave Arju=\r\nna divya Drishti ,Arjuna never saw an unreal\n&gt;&gt; world.He continued to do hi=\r\ns Karma without having doubts of real vs unreal.I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t see anywhere in =\r\nBG where Krishna says universe is a creation of mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you keep den=\r\nouncing the world as unreal I&#39;m afraid it may lead to a\n&gt;&gt; state of Tamas.I=\r\nf you say everything you see is Maya then is Maya real or\n&gt;&gt; unreal ?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n lol. I&#39;m not denouncing anything. Science has proven it&#39;s unreal. Yes, it\n=\r\n&gt; *may* lead to Tamas. However, to me it has lead to to Sattva (not that I&#39;=\r\nm\n&gt; Sattvic, but I&#39;m magnetically geared in that direction). To say &quot;it is =\r\ngod&#39;s\n&gt; will&quot; makes no sense to me, but that is the makeup of the karmas I =\r\nam\n&gt; working with. But to just adopt the scientific viewpoint &quot;it&#39;s just qu=\r\nantum\n&gt; soup, nothing is real&quot; and that&#39;s it, leads to Tamas and nihilism, =\r\nIMO. It&#39;s\n&gt; why I became drawn to Vedic thought, from atheism and before th=\r\nat a\n&gt; conservative Catholic upbringing. Long way to go, no?\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To me put=\r\nting the teachings of Bhagavad Geeta into practice itself is a\n&gt;&gt; long jour=\r\nney and may take many life times. If you guys already realized that\n&gt;&gt; worl=\r\nd is unreal by Advaita logic or otherwise tand you are indeed Brahman,\n&gt;&gt; m=\r\nore power to you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As I stated, I got the idea from Science. My arriva=\r\nl to the feet of the\n&gt; Rishis came because they already knew it, even witho=\r\nut the electron\n&gt; microscope and other advanced technology.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anyways I =\r\nwould like to close my posts on this topic. I have no vendetta\n&gt;&gt; against A=\r\ndvaita or Advaitins. Advaita just does not make sense to me and no\n&gt;&gt; where=\r\n in Geeta I find Advaita.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You do not have to have a vendetta to disag=\r\nree, I find that to be an\n&gt; illogical extrapolation. Do I agree with everyo=\r\nne? No. Does that\n&gt; automatically mean I have a vendetta against them?\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nAnyway, if Gita is where you find your Heart, then there it belongs. You\n&gt; =\r\nseemed to me to be genuine, so I offered my opinion.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  Vedic wisdom is =\r\nnot just Advaita. There are many schools of thought that\n&gt;&gt; have challenged=\r\n and continue to challenge Advaita.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; That is true, of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  I =\r\nhope my posts help people who are beginning their spiritual journey\n&gt;&gt; use =\r\ntheir rationale to conclude as to what is real and what is not.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Jai\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; PS: My wife&#39;s lagna is Mithuna as well.

Thus\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whatever you are saying is also unreal.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n You can compare it, however imperfectly, to a movie. Actor A is speaking\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; memorized dialogue to Actor B, but to the viewer, characters are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; c=\r\nommunicating. It is not real on one level, and on the level where it is\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; real (the experiential level of the viewer), it is only apparently real.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Why would I need to do Karma in an unreal world ? Is Karma e=\r\nven unreal ?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; One does not &quot;do Karma&quot;. If anything, Karma doe=\r\ns one. It is merely an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extrapolation of the law of cause and effect wh=\r\nich operates on\n&gt;&gt; everything\n&gt;&gt; &gt; within the material plane, but reflects =\r\nthe Ego&#39;s tendency to grasp,\n&gt;&gt; own,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and separate in order to label it=\r\n as something other.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that ex=\r\nist everywhere are experienced\n&gt;&gt; &gt; by us;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there is nothing here anywh=\r\nere which has not been experienced by us.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Okay. How does this st=\r\natement prove world is unreal ?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus scientists are veering round=\r\n to the conclusion that since every\n&gt;&gt; &gt; object is a sum of its qualities a=\r\nnd these\n&gt;&gt; &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective universe o=\r\nf matter\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a constr=\r\nuction of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; consciousness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Which scientist says universe is a =\r\nconstruction of consciousness ?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Why does consciousness construct =\r\nanything ? Why can&#39;t it just be as it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is ? What is the need for an unr=\r\neal world ?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I understand your point about consciousness. I a=\r\ngree that it just &quot;Is&quot;,\n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that the extrapolation of &quot;doing&quot; is on=\r\nly a figment of our minds and\n&gt;&gt; egos in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; order to try and understand i=\r\nt. The funny thing is, though, that only\n&gt;&gt; &gt; consciousness can understand =\r\nconsciousness. All we can do is invent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; languages and stumble around tr=\r\nying to square &quot;it&quot; in our organic\n&gt;&gt; brains.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; However, the univer=\r\nse really is, on a level of actuality, unreal. It\n&gt;&gt; seems\n&gt;&gt; &gt; real to us =\r\nbecause we are also characters in the same movie. A quick\n&gt;&gt; study\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of =\r\nquantum psychics will swiftly show you that. There is no such thing\n&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;solid&quot; material, the closest this universe gets to solidity (and hence=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;realness&quot;) is a black hole, which is so out of place that it rips ap=\r\nart\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fabric of space and time, so that not even light, a massles=\r\ns particle (a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; paradox if there ever was one) can escape its grasp. Sim=\r\nilarly, though\n&gt;&gt; on a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different level of course, the Ego tries to fin=\r\nd and create solidity on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; earth which draws Chaos to it, which requires=\r\n further constructions of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; solidity (&quot;beliefs&quot;) to bolster it. The only=\r\n thing that allows the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; appearance of &quot;things&quot; as &quot;separate&quot; from other=\r\n &quot;things&quot;, is\n&gt;&gt; electromagnetic\n&gt;&gt; &gt; energy, or shakti, in her symbolic fo=\r\nrm as Maya.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; India (Bharat) has come up with many scientific ideas=\r\n that form the\n&gt;&gt; basis\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (foundation) of Western science. *And they did=\r\n it through meditation on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Consciousness*.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=93We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, without\n&gt;&gt; whic=\r\nh no\n&gt;&gt; &gt; worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC - Albert\n&gt;&gt; Einstein\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Carl Sagan:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;The tenth episode o=\r\nf COSMOS is largely about cosmology - the study of\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; universe in =\r\na perspective in which the Earth is like a grain to stand in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vast beac=\r\nh or desert - and the way we approach the subject is through\n&gt;&gt; Hindu\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ncosmology. ... But the main reason that we oriented this episode of\n&gt;&gt; COSM=\r\nOS\n&gt;&gt; &gt; towards India is because of that wonderful aspect of Hindu cosmolog=\r\ny\n&gt;&gt; which\n&gt;&gt; &gt; first of all gives a time-scale for the Earth and the unive=\r\nrse -- a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time-scale which is consonant with that of modern scientific =\r\ncosmology.\n&gt;&gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As far as I know. It is the only ancient religious t=\r\nradition on the\n&gt;&gt; Earth\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which talks about the right time-scale.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Few are the scientists that are brave enough to stand up and grant\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Bharat\n&gt;&gt; &gt; her rightful inheritance, because they suffer from their own c=\r\nultural\n&gt;&gt; &gt; xenophobia and religious bigotry, but that is a whole differen=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; subject....\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It is possibly only an assumption that the unive=\r\nrse is a construction of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Consciousness, however, Consciousness is one =\r\nof the only &quot;things&quot;, if\n&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the *only* thing, that can never be &quot;t=\r\nhis&quot;. Take away everything that is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;This&quot;, and the only thing left is =\r\n&quot;That&quot;. It&#39;s sort of how 2 hydrogen\n&gt;&gt; &gt; molecules electromagnetically bond=\r\n with one oxygen molecule, and &quot;Live&quot;\n&gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what we humans have labele=\r\nd &quot;Water&quot;. There is no such thing as &quot;water&quot;,\n&gt;&gt; per\n&gt;&gt; &gt; se, there are onl=\r\ny electrons, protons, and neutrons -etc.- bumping\n&gt;&gt; around in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a vast =\r\nsea of Chaos, the substratum, what we call Brahma.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; By the way, I =\r\nam a Caucasian, American by birth, who considered himself\n&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; atheis=\r\nt for many years (I presently live in India and am Hindu). When I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; disc=\r\novered the greatness of the Rishis, the Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rea=\r\nlized how much *more* splendid this planet could be with the Sanatana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nDharma respected for the greatness, beauty, and Truth it holds and\n&gt;&gt; besto=\r\nws\n&gt;&gt; &gt; upon us, who are also That (Consciousness is not divided as the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nUpanishad\n&gt;&gt; &gt; states &#39;take the full from the full, and the full remains.&#39; =\r\nI don&#39;t\n&gt;&gt; offhand\n&gt;&gt; &gt; recall the attribution.)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just qu=\r\nestioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; They are also=\r\n &quot;assumptions&quot; that have been laboratory tested in the\n&gt;&gt; halls of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sci=\r\nence and proven sound.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which seem to be totally opposite of =\r\nwhat Bhagavad Gita is saying. In\n&gt;&gt; &gt; fact what you are saying leads to nih=\r\nilism which is what Buddhists say.\n&gt;&gt; If\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you agree that you believe in=\r\n Buddhism we can move on. But if you say\n&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; what you are saying is=\r\n in Vedas , then I will question.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Nihilism is an attitude of=\r\n defeatism. It is not an attitude of\n&gt;&gt; respectful\n&gt;&gt; &gt; worship towards thi=\r\ns great mystery that we call the universe, the\n&gt;&gt; cosmos,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which we are=\r\n a part of; and Life itself, which animates us and all other\n&gt;&gt; &gt; living th=\r\nings.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I consider every &quot;thing&quot; as &quot;alive&quot;. The main difference in=\r\n us is that\n&gt;&gt; we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have a brain which allows us access to levels of Und=\r\nerstanding not\n&gt;&gt; possible\n&gt;&gt; &gt; without a complex symbolic language. There =\r\nis no difference between me,\n&gt;&gt; you,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a drop of water, a worm, the Sun,=\r\n etc., except in appearance due to\n&gt;&gt; Maya.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I have a Mithuna Lagn=\r\na (which should be obvious!) so I tend to think of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things on an intell=\r\nectual level. However, Maa Maya/Kali/Parvati\n&gt;&gt; (different\n&gt;&gt; &gt; facets of s=\r\nhakti) makes it easy for my human mind to grasp the Dance of\n&gt;&gt; Life\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd Existence, and I stand in awe before this great tapestry of\n&gt;&gt; Brahman&#39;s=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; dream.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspec=\r\nt of the universe\n&gt;&gt; (the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and g=\r\nrants it an all-encompassing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; power over all that is. A Shivaite would =\r\nsay that the Destructive aspect\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (entropy) is actually the engine of li=\r\nfe, and hence Shiva is the God of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Gods. A Shakta would say that since =\r\nShakti is responsible for the\n&gt;&gt; appearance\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of apparent reality, then =\r\nShe is the God of Gods.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I say only that Thou Art That, there is n=\r\no Other. And this draw towards\n&gt;&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Form of Divinity or another, or =\r\nthe Advaitin draw towards the Formless\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Divine, is based on, i.e. has i=\r\nts foundation in, one&#39;s Karma.

Physicists chased them further and broke them\n&gt;&gt; &gt; down to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; nuc=\r\nleus, electrons, quanta, waves, particles, and fields. Einstein\n&gt;&gt; &gt; said t=\r\nhat\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the universe of our experience consists of matter and energy in =\r\na\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; space-time-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D mc2=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; where C is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a constant representing the velocity of light. Mat=\r\nter and energy\n&gt;&gt; &gt; became\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; interchangeable.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Max Planck, famou=\r\ns for his quantum theory, added a further dimension\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this, st=\r\nating that it is consciousness that is fundamental and that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; matter\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; is a derivative of consciousness. As a corollary even space and time\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; only concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are vee=\r\nring\n&gt;&gt; &gt; round to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the conclusion that since every object is a sum o=\r\nf its qualities and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; these\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; qualities are perceived by us, the wh=\r\nole objective universe of matter\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; energy, atoms and stars do=\r\nes not exist except as a construction of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere are experienced\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; by us;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; there is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienc=\r\ned by us.&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavan has told us that the world as such is not=\r\n real. It is real as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Brahman or Consciousness. The world we see and =\r\nexperience with our\n&gt;&gt; &gt; senses is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a product of the mind; the mind i=\r\ns a part of the ego, which rises from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Pure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Consciousness, which=\r\n is the same as Reality.

It is =\r\nmerely an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; extrapolation of the law of cause and effect which opera=\r\ntes on everything&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; within the material plane, but reflects the Ego&=\r\n#39;s tendency to grasp, own,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and separate in order to label it as=\r\n something other.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      Yoga Vashista says: &qu=\r\not;All things that exist everywhere are experienced&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; by us;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;      there is nothing here anywhere which has not been experienced by us.=\r\n&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     Okay. How does this statement prove world is =\r\nunreal ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     Thus scientists are veering round to the co=\r\nnclusion that since every&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; object is a sum of its qualities and the=\r\nse&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      qualities are perceived by us, the whole objective univers=\r\ne of matter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and  energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as =\r\na construction of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     Which=\r\n scientist says universe is a construction of consciousness ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;     Why does consciousness construct anything ? Why can&#39;t it just=\r\n be as it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is ? What is the need for an unreal world ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I understand your point about consciousness. I agree that =\r\nit just &quot;Is&quot;, and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that the extrapolation of &quot;doing&=\r\nquot; is only a figment of our minds and egos in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; order to try and =\r\nunderstand it. The funny thing is, though, that only&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; consciousness=\r\n can understand consciousness. All we can do is invent&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; languages a=\r\nnd stumble around trying to square &quot;it&quot; in our organic brains.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; However, the universe really is, on a level of actuality, =\r\nunreal. It seems&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; real to us because we are also characters in the =\r\nsame movie. A quick study&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of quantum psychics will swiftly show yo=\r\nu that. There is no such thing as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;solid&quot; material, the =\r\nclosest this universe gets to solidity (and hence&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;realness&q=\r\nuot;) is a black hole, which is so out of place that it rips apart the&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; fabric of space and time, so that not even light, a massless particle =\r\n(a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; paradox if there ever was one) can escape its grasp. Similarly,=\r\n though on a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; different level of course, the Ego tries to find and =\r\ncreate solidity on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; earth which draws Chaos to it, which requires f=\r\nurther constructions of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; solidity (&quot;beliefs&quot;) to bolster =\r\nit. The only thing that allows the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; appearance of &quot;things&quot=\r\n; as &quot;separate&quot; from other &quot;things&quot;, is electromagnetic=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; energy, or shakti, in her symbolic form as Maya.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; India (Bharat) has come up with many scientific ideas that form the basi=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (foundation) of Western science. *And they did it through medita=\r\ntion on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Consciousness*.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=93We owe a lot to the Indians, who taught us how to count, withou=\r\nt which no&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worthwhile scientific discovery could have been made.=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC  - Albert Einstein&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nCarl Sagan:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The tenth episode of COSMOS is largely about cos=\r\nmology - the study of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; universe in a perspective in which the E=\r\narth is like a grain to stand in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; vast beach or desert - and the wa=\r\ny we approach the subject is through Hindu&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cosmology. ... But the =\r\nmain reason that we oriented this episode of COSMOS&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; towards India =\r\nis because of that wonderful aspect of Hindu cosmology which&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; first=\r\n of all gives a time-scale for the Earth and the universe -- a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tim=\r\ne-scale which is consonant with that of modern scientific cosmology. ...&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; As far as I know. It is the only ancient religious tradition on the =\r\nEarth&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; which talks about the right time-scale.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Few are the scientists that are brave enough to stand up and grant Bha=\r\nrat&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; her rightful inheritance, because they suffer from their own c=\r\nultural&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; xenophobia and religious bigotry, but that is a whole diff=\r\nerent subject....&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is possibly only an assumption that=\r\n the universe is a construction of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Consciousness, however, Conscio=\r\nusness is one of the only &quot;things&quot;, if not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the *only* th=\r\ning, that can never be &quot;this&quot;. Take away everything that is&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &quot;This&quot;, and the only thing left is &quot;That&quot;. It&#39;s=\r\n sort of how 2 hydrogen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; molecules electromagnetically bond with on=\r\ne oxygen molecule, and &quot;Live&quot; as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what we humans have lab=\r\neled &quot;Water&quot;. There is no such thing as &quot;water&quot;, per&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; se, there are only electrons, protons, and neutrons -etc.- bumping a=\r\nround in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a vast sea of Chaos, the substratum, what we call Brahma.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; By the way, I am a Caucasian, American by birth, who co=\r\nnsidered himself an&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; atheist for many years (I presently live in In=\r\ndia and am Hindu). When I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; discovered the greatness of the Rishis, =\r\nthe Vedas, Upanishads, etc., I&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; realized how much *more* splendid t=\r\nhis planet could be with the Sanatana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dharma respected for the gre=\r\natness, beauty, and Truth it holds and bestows&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; upon us, who are al=\r\nso That (Consciousness is not divided as the Upanishad&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; states &#39=\r\n;take the full from the full, and the full remains.&#39; I don&#39;t offhan=\r\nd&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; recall the attribution.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;      I&#39=\r\n;m just questioning certain basic assumptions of Advaita&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; They are also &quot;assumptions&quot; that have been laboratory =\r\ntested in the halls of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; science and proven sound.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     which seem to be totally opposite of what  Bhagavad Gita is=\r\n saying. In&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fact what you are saying leads to nihilism which is wh=\r\nat Buddhists say. If&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you agree that you believe in Buddhism we can=\r\n move on. But if you say all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what you are saying is in Vedas , the=\r\nn I will question.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nihilism is an attitude of =\r\ndefeatism. It is not an attitude of respectful&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; worship towards thi=\r\ns great mystery that we call the universe, the cosmos,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; which we ar=\r\ne a part of; and Life itself, which animates us and all other&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; livi=\r\nng things.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I consider every &quot;thing&quot; as &quot;a=\r\nlive&quot;. The main difference in us is that we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have a brain whic=\r\nh allows us access to levels of Understanding not possible&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; without=\r\n a complex symbolic language. There is no difference between me, you,&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; a drop of water, a worm, the Sun, etc., except in appearance due to May=\r\na.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have a Mithuna Lagna (which should be obvious!) so =\r\nI tend to think of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; things on an intellectual level. However, Maa M=\r\naya/Kali/Parvati (different&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; facets of shakti) makes it easy for my=\r\n human mind to grasp the Dance of Life&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and Existence, and I stand =\r\nin awe before this great tapestry of Brahman&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; dream.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; While I hesitate to say this, the BG takes one aspect of the uni=\r\nverse (the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Creative aspect, symbolized as Vishnu) and grants it an=\r\n all-encompassing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; power over all that is. A Shivaite would say tha=\r\nt the Destructive aspect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (entropy) is actually the engine of life,=\r\n and hence Shiva is the God of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Gods. A Shakta would say that since=\r\n Shakti is responsible for the appearance&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of apparent reality, the=\r\nn She is the God of Gods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I say only that Thou Art That,=\r\n there is no Other. And this draw towards one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Form of Divinity or =\r\nanother, or the Advaitin draw towards the Formless&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Divine, is base=\r\nd on, i.e. has its foundation in, one&#39;s Karma. And hence&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one&#=\r\n39;s Karma *does* drive one on, like a chariot driver. The BG contains&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; many, many wonderful Truths.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     PS : I&#=\r\n39;m not a Dvaitin or Visishtadvatin and I do not want to start&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; an=\r\nother Dvaita v/s Advaita thread on this forum.There have been many such&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; threads going on on the internet without any value.  I just want more=\r\n solid&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; explanation if what you wrote is indeed true.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One does not have to declare oneself a =\r\ndualist in order to be one, one&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; merely divides the &quot;spiritual=\r\n realm&quot; as something different and outside of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the material.  =\r\nThere is no material, only the appearance thereof.

Physicists chased them further and broke them&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; down to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; nucleus, electrons, quanta, waves, parti=\r\ncles, and fields. Einstein&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; said that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; the univers=\r\ne of our experience consists of matter and energy in a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; sp=\r\nace-time-continuum. He established the famous equation E =3D mc2,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nwhere C is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; a constant representing the velocity of light.=\r\n Matter and energy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; became&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; interchangeable.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;     &gt; Max Planck, famous for his quantum theory, added a further dim=\r\nension&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; this, stating that it is consciousness=\r\n that is fundamental and that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; matter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; is a deriva=\r\ntive of consciousness. As a corollary even space and time&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;     &gt; only concepts of our conscious- ness. Thus scientists are vee=\r\nring&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; round to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; the conclusion that since every ob=\r\nject is a sum of its qualities and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; these&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; qualiti=\r\nes are perceived by us, the whole objective universe of matter&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; energy, atoms and stars does not exist except as a const=\r\nruction of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     =\r\n&gt; Yoga Vashista says: &quot;All things that exist everywhere are experie=\r\nnced&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; by us;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; there is nothing here anywhere which=\r\n has not been experienced by us.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;     &gt; =\r\nBhagavan has told us that the world as such is not real.
