What is the idea?. Even tod=\r\nay, beings like Lord Krishna, Saibaba, Ramakrishna and many other beings ar=\r\ne believed to appear in original physical appearance.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal=\r\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;schinnas&quot; &lt;schinnas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt;     Sri Aurobindo&#39;s yoga is Integral, which means it _=\r\nalso_ includes material existence which is nothing but condensed consciousn=\r\ness. It is a different path from most others which call the world as maya a=\r\nnd body consciousness as something to be forgotten or gotten rid of. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n    Our physical body as such is not plastic enough. The nature of Universe=\r\n or the expression of consciousness (Divine Mother) is constant change / pr=\r\nogress. So the body has to die and soul housed in a new form as time progre=\r\nsses. All Rishis / Naths do not live for ever in the same material body as =\r\nours. Either their body is transformed or they will have to lose their body=\r\n after some time. By power of yoga one can prolong existing body into sever=\r\nal centuries or even few thousand years, but that body will still be mortal=\r\n. The necessary condition for that is the matter that forms the body regain=\r\ning its consciousness and becomes totally fluid  - a body of light can be i=\r\nmmortal as it can modify itself as per the flow of the guiding consciousnes=\r\ns. So there will not be a necessity to break that form and create another n=\r\new form. It can simply transform. That is the essense (atleast in my unders=\r\ntanding) of what Sri Aurobindo refers to as physical immortality. He and th=\r\ne Mother have explained it more clearly in some other places but I am not a=\r\nble to find it now. \n&gt; \n&gt; As per Sri Aurobindo, there has been few being wh=\r\no might have attained Supramental descent and even partial transformation p=\r\nersonally but not the full supramental transformation. Besides, as per him,=\r\n unless the transformation is collective, individual transformation is not =\r\nperfect. \n&gt; \n&gt; Supramental transformation is a state beyond Sahaja Samadhi.=\r\n In Sahaja Samadhi, one consciously functions from a state of Brahman, but =\r\nbody still is unconscious for most part, subject to laws of nature and they=\r\n remain mostly detached from the body consciousness (Eg. Ramana Maharishi).=\r\n A person in Sahaja Samadhi is like a deity that can walk and talk. His/her=\r\n body will also be transformed to some extent to host the immense shakthi a=\r\nnd vibration of the enlightened person, but that is a far cry from what Sri=\r\n Aurobindo calls as Supramental transformation. \n&gt; \n&gt; However, in Suprament=\r\nal transformation, the matter of the body _also_ is transformed to express =\r\nthe Sat-Chit-Ananda consciousness. There are lots of other things too other=\r\n than body transformation. \n&gt; \n&gt; If you have time and are interested, I wou=\r\nld suggest you read &quot;Sri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness&quot; by Sa=\r\ntprem. It is a not a large book but may take a loong time to read and assim=\r\nilate. It very lucidly and clearly delineates different stages of conscious=\r\nness from a very practical standpoint, starting with body consciousness to =\r\nvital, mental, intellectual and higher regions of consciousness. It is a un=\r\nique biography which deals not with mundane life details of the subject, bu=\r\nt his journey through consciousness and while doing that explains various f=\r\niner stages and aspects of consciousness to the reader. If Spiritual biogra=\r\nphies of other Masters are written in that way, it would be amazing. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nWhat ever I said on this topic is _very crude_ and does not do justice to t=\r\nhe topic at all. I really mean it. I have oversimplified for the sake of th=\r\ne post. This topic needs a very subtle and sublime treatment  stemming at l=\r\neast in part from corresponding inner experiences & realizations which I am=\r\n not capable of at present. The best I can do is point to those that have d=\r\none it. Once &quot;Sri Aurobindo or adventure of Consciousness&quot; is read, then al=\r\nl of Sri Aurobindo&#39;s works and what he says about Supramental descent and t=\r\nransformation can be comprehended more easily.  Alternately one can start w=\r\nith the works of M.P. Pandit as well. Shri. Pandit&#39;s writings are very luci=\r\nd, profound and illuminating.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, I read with interest your thread &quot;R=\r\nama Nam Satha Hai&quot;.

I=\r\nf these are to remain the descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - =\r\nfor a change of consciousness which would mean mental - spiritual union wit=\r\nh the Divine, the Overmind is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficien=\r\nt. The Supramental Descent is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth=\r\n in mind, vital and body. This would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disap=\r\npearence of the unconsciousness of the body; it would no longer be subject =\r\nto death or disease. That would mean it would not be subject to ordinary pr=\r\nocesses by which death comes. If a change in the body had to be made, it wo=\r\nuld be by the will of the inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  immortality. If someone wanted to live 1000 years or more, then suppo=\r\nsing one had the complete siddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be =\r\nno immortality of the body without supramentalization. &quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Aga=\r\nin at another place Sri Aurobindo states that immoratlity is not the aim of=\r\n Supramental Descent, but one of the possibilities.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I did no=\r\nt quite understand, what exactly is this Supramental Descent, if it has not=\r\nhing to do with physical immortality.Because, connecting the and uplifting =\r\nthe ordinary mind to the state of divinity and functioning from that sphere=\r\n is something that most self realized Yogis do. Then how is &quot;Supramental De=\r\nscent&quot; so unique?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Again if, as we see from the above writing=\r\ns, a total transformation is what is being spoken off, that would mean also=\r\n a transformation of the body. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Well, the Naths(nine Naths),=\r\n Munis and Rishis can exist as immortals in this plane.

Immediately upon my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; arrival I was struck =\r\nby the spiritual atmosphere of the place. On August\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 15th of that year=\r\n, I had my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; three time=\r\ns in a year that he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to=\r\n be powerful spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; to work on the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manner. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his =\r\nor the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; While I =\r\nwas in Aurobindo Ashrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disciple=\r\n of both Aurobindo and Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; visiting=\r\n Sri Ramanasramam, he would describe to me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashra=\r\nma. His intriguing descriptions, along with the reading of B. V.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nara=\r\nsimhaswami&#39; s biography of the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; to Ramanasramam in 1933.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Before this second visit to Raman=\r\nasramam I once again read Bhagavan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biography. In it I found a passa=\r\nge relating to the possibility of changing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt =\r\nabout this and addressed it to the Maharshi. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Certai=\r\nnly. One can change his guru. What of that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Aurobindo Ashr=\r\nama our daily life, to a large extent, was regulated and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; controlled. =\r\nFor instance, even to take a simple trip into town we had to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obtain p=\r\nermission. In contrast, here in Ramanasramam it was totally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different=\r\n. I experienced a liberating feeling of freedom, informality and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spon=\r\ntaneity. Everything was so natural and at the same time elevating.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were generally permitted to visi=\r\nt all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; other saints and ashramas, with the exception of the Maharshi a=\r\nnd Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Maharshi had the power =\r\nto undo years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mother and Aurobindo =\r\nwere effecting on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; psyche of their followers. In other words, they=\r\n considered the Maharshi too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; powerful an influence. Bhagavan was awar=\r\ne of this and once when I was alone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with him he told me, &quot;Yes, I know=\r\n of that place. They are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Leaving Aurobindo Ashr=\r\nam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five years. Du=\r\nring those years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they showered me with kindness and love, while guidi=\r\nng me on the spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; path. My gratitude and regard for them compell=\r\ned me to obtain their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permission and blessings before leaving. This t=\r\nurned out to be much more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; difficult than I imagined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In =\r\nAurobindo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; questions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; letters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit=\r\n with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writin=\r\ng. Sometimes we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; would see the lights burning all night as they were e=\r\nngaged in this work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote =\r\na letter stating my desire to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; receive their blessings and permission =\r\nto live at Ramanasramam. In the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that sinc=\r\ne your yoga begins with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me to go to R=\r\namana Maharshi who emphasizes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only Self-realization, a state I have n=\r\not attained, or may not even be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s repl=\r\ny was affectionate, but negative in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regards to my leaving his ashram.=\r\n He wrote, &quot;Both Self-realization and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supra-mental state can be s=\r\nimultaneously developed and achieved here. There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no need for you t=\r\no go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was extremely disappointed at his response and =\r\nconsequently became\n&gt; &gt; &gt; frustrated, restless and discouraged. I soon bega=\r\nn to have sleepless nights\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and felt distraught. I then wrote a second=\r\n letter to Aurobindo with the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; request. Again I was denied permis=\r\nsion. It took a long five months and a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; third letter before Aurobindo =\r\nand the Mother finally agreed, giving me their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; permission and blessin=\r\ngs. Perhaps they realized I was determined to go and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they saw no othe=\r\nr recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final lette=\r\nr to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; follow a path in which=\r\n you can achieve only partial realization, we give you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; our blessings,=\r\n though we believe it would be better if you stayed on here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and pursu=\r\ned your sadhana where both the Mother and I can help you.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It =\r\nwas the rule in Aurobindo Ashram that any letter written to or received\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; from Aurobindo should not leave the ashram premises. So, to comply with =\r\nthis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rule, I burnt all my letters, except the final letter I received=\r\n from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo. This I kept with the view of showing it to Bhagavan.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Settling at Sri Ramanasramam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; During the early ye=\r\nars there were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was mostly j=\r\nungle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahmin&#39;s h=\r\nouse near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometim=\r\nes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\noutside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Da=\r\nily I would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; hall with Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again to t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on like this =\r\nduring the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close to Bhaga=\r\nvan so I could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hear all of his precious utterances.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; S. S=\r\n. Cohen, after repeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Yogi from Pondicherry must have some greatness. Consequently, one day he=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; travelled to Pondicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; describing who he was, what he wanted from life (Self-realization) and=\r\n where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was then residing (Sri Ramanasramam) . Cohen later showed m=\r\ne the reply he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; got from Aurobindo. It said, in brief, that all his as=\r\npirations could be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fulfilled at Sri Ramanasramam, where he was then l=\r\niving.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I remember during my second visit to Ramanasramam the M=\r\naharshi was one day\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reading a lengthy book review from a newspaper. T=\r\nhe book being reviewed was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The reviewer w=\r\nas Kapali Sastri and the editor of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s devo=\r\ntee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed to take\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great interest in the revi=\r\new and would occasionally stop reading and comment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on what he had jus=\r\nt read to those sitting around him. When he had concluded\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reading it,=\r\n someone who was aware that I had that very book with me, said to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bha=\r\ngavan, &quot;This man has come from the Aurobindo Ashram and he has that book\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; with him.&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and said, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; look at it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I went back to my room, fetched the book=\r\n and handed it over to Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Immediately Bhagavan began reading i=\r\nt intently. He kept on reading it well\n&gt; &gt; &gt; into the night, with the help =\r\nof a small oil lamp, until he finished it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When I came into th=\r\ne hall the next day he began discussing the book with me,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; telling me =\r\nthat a certain term used in the book might look like something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; new, b=\r\nut it is actually the equivalent of this other term used in such and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsuch ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and comparing\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly understood\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also from the standpoint=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan that the =\r\nmajor attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teachings is that it professes that i=\r\nmmortality of the body can be achieved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavan made no comment.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat down, Bha=\r\ngavan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam there was one yo=\r\ngi, C. V. V.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of the imm=\r\nortality of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Anni=\r\ne Besant (a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; distinguished public and spiritual personality in India) =\r\nwould have to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to him to learn how to make her body immortal. But=\r\n, before he had a chance\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This bri=\r\nef story clearly illustrated his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; point.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On another day, =\r\nnot too long after settling near Sri Ramanasramam, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; approached Bhaga=\r\nvan when no one was in the hall and showed him that last\n&gt; &gt; &gt; letter I had=\r\n received from Aurobindo. Bhagavan asked me to give it to him to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read=\r\n. I told him he would be unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwriting, as\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; it was very illegible and only those who have studied it for sometime co=\r\nuld\n&gt; &gt; &gt; read it. He said, &quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After=\r\n looking into it and realizing he could only make out a few words, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n returned it and asked me to read it out. I began reading it and when I cam=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the sentence, &quot;Since you are determined to follow a path in whic=\r\nh you can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; achieve only partial realization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped m=\r\ne and said,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Partial realization? If it is partial, it is not realiza=\r\ntion, and if it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realization, it is not partial.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This=\r\n was the final blow that silenced all my doubts. I then destroyed this\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; letter, like all the rest. And because of all the discussions I had had w=\r\nith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly established in his teachings, havi=\r\nng a clear\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding of where the Maharshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s=\r\n path diverged and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went different ways. When all the clouds of doubts=\r\n and distractions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dispersed, so did our discussions. Bhagavan then kn=\r\new that I understood and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the foundation work had been done. The purpo=\r\nse of all our discussions were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; served and so they stopped automatical=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of Bhagavan was t=\r\nhe power of his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; presence. Much of what he taught had already been tra=\r\nnsmitted to the masses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; down through the ages. In Bhagavan we found a =\r\nbeing that was surcharged with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Reality to such an extent that com=\r\ning into his presence would effect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dramatic change in us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Sources:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/?=\r\n pg=3Dmay-jun\n&gt; &gt; &gt; b) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3D=\r\nmar-apr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-au=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`&quot;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=\r\n=B8=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9B =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BD=D1=80=E2=96`=\r\n=D0=A7=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97 =D1=80=\r\n=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=90 =\r\n=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B3=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=\r\n=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BF\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=\r\n=D0&#39;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=AC=D1=80=E2=96`=\r\n=E2=96&quot;=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=95=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0&#39;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BA=\r\n=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=\r\n=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97 =D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=\r\n=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=\r\n=B4=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0`\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Your Mail works best with the New Yahoo Optimized=\r\n IE8.
