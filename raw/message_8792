And slowly he explains how the mantra began to repeat itself =\r\nconstantly in his mind without him having to do anything. He solves the pro=\r\nblems of mind-wandering and attains\n\n&gt; one-pointedness, and various spiritu=\r\nal truths are slowly revealed to him.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; By the way, is there anyone on=\r\n the forum who has actually experienced this state?

It =\r\nsometimes helps to hear from someone who was just like you, and how they wo=\r\nrked on themselves.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Coming back to the book, in the first chapter, h=\r\ne is a &#39;spiritual baby&#39; just starting out on the path and completely ignora=\r\nnt (was an ordinary householder, but then wife died and his house burnt dow=\r\nn and he became poor) He reads in the Bible &quot;pray unceasingly&quot; and becomes =\r\nfascinated with this idea.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; He meets a Guru (an elderly monk) and sai=\r\nd &quot;I want to pray unceasingly but I don&#39;t know how&quot;. Guru taught him the Je=\r\nsus prayer and said do 3000 repetions a day of the prayer for one week, 600=\r\n0 a day the week after, and 12000 a day the week after that! After 12000 re=\r\npetitions a day, he says his tongue felt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb we=\r\nre hurting a little from counting the beads on his\n\n&gt; rosary! But he follow=\r\ned his Guru&#39;s instructions fully.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Later the Guru said, well done...n=\r\now it&#39;s time to repeat this prayer all the time, keeping other thoughts awa=\r\ny as much as possible! How is this possible asks the student (as many of us=\r\n may also ask). The Guru said just try. He tries, and succeeds.

It would be inspiring to hear your experiences. Reading stories=\r\n of highly exalted God realised beings is fine, but it&#39;s difficult to relat=\r\ne to them (they seem so far advanced). It sometimes helps to hear from some=\r\none who was just like you, and how they worked on themselves.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Coming back to the book, in the first chapter, he is a &#39;spiritual bab=\r\ny&#39; just starting out on the path and completely ignorant (was an ordinary h=\r\nouseholder, but then wife died and his house burnt down and he became poor)=\r\n He reads in the Bible &quot;pray unceasingly&quot; and becomes fascinated with this =\r\nidea.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He meets a Guru (an elderly monk) and said &quot;I want=\r\n to pray unceasingly but I don&#39;t know how&quot;. Guru taught him the Jesus praye=\r\nr and said do 3000 repetions a day of the prayer for one week, 6000 a day t=\r\nhe week after, and 12000 a day the week after that! After 12000 repetitions=\r\n a day, he says his tongue felt a bit numb, and his wrist/thumb were hurtin=\r\ng a little from counting the beads on his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rosary! But he followed =\r\nhis Guru&#39;s instructions fully.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Later the Guru said, well=\r\n done...now it&#39;s time to repeat this prayer all the time, keeping other tho=\r\nughts away as much as possible! How is this possible asks the student (as m=\r\nany of us may also ask). The Guru said just try. He tries, and succeeds. Qu=\r\nite inspiring.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; For anyone who&#39;s interesting in glancing =\r\nthrough a few chapters, a preview is available on google books.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://books.google.c=\r\no.uk/books?id=3DPsQ7zEi9AGsC&amp;source=3Dgbs_book_similarbooks&quot;&gt;http://boo=\r\nks.google.co.uk/books?id=3DPsQ7zEi9AGsC&amp;source=3Dgbs_book_similarbooks&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Here is a summary of the seeker on wikipedia&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://en.wikiped=\r\nia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_a_Pilgrim&quot;&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Way_of_a=\r\n_Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Om Namo Narayanaya&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Aparn=\r\na&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquot=\r\ne&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n---929976460-500187089-1351065878=:81552--\r\n\n"}}
