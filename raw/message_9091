Liberation from what? From &#39;me&#39; and &#39;mine&#39;. Surely the fir=\r\nst step is to break down the barriers between us. Your suffering has to bec=\r\nome my suffering. Otherwise there is no oneness. It&#39;s just a word. If you&#39;r=\r\ne hungry, and I really feel one with you, I&#39;ve got to do something about yo=\r\nur hunger. Half the world is dying of starvation, and the other half is dyi=\r\nng of diseases due to overeating. The half that are overeating are generall=\r\ny unaware and/or uninterested in the ones that are starving in front of the=\r\nm. It&#39;s a tragedy.\n\nWe live surrounded by beggars, homeless people, sick pe=\r\nople, dying people. (How many live near you? Are you doing something for th=\r\nem?) The West is in many ways as miserable as the East- it seems that pract=\r\nically 50% of people here are on antidepressants. \n\nWe can serve the suffer=\r\ning in 3 ways. In thought, word and action. We are not noble charity worker=\r\ns, living in rural places, striving day and night to feed the hungry and gi=\r\nve clothes to the naked. We are not of much help in terms of action and wor=\r\nd. \n\nThe least we can do is send them positive thoughts via prayer, japa, h=\r\nomam and pooja. Let us at least be generous in thought, even if we cannot b=\r\ne in action. \n\nAnd hopefully, most crucially, we will be one day moved to g=\r\nood action. May be help build a free clinic in a rural part of India or Afr=\r\nica, provide a scholarship for deserving kids from poorer backgrounds, set =\r\nup a soup kitchen for the homeless/beggars. SOMETHING that actually creates=\r\n some good in this miserable world of ours.\n\nThe path to realisation accord=\r\ning to Sivananda and many other yogis is SERVE, Love, Give, Purify, Meditat=\r\ne and Realise. Service comes first. There is no spirituality without servic=\r\ne. \n\nIf all the homams and japas we do, don&#39;t create a feeling that &quot;others=\r\n suffering is my suffering&quot; i.e. genuine Oneness, then there&#39;s a long way y=\r\net to go in our journey. This feeling slowly develops, but we have to make =\r\na start somewhere. May be just by small acts of service, like buying food f=\r\nor someone who is hungry and can&#39;t afford a meal.\n\nGandhi said, &quot;Fie on tha=\r\nt man who uses his rosary while the man next to him is starving.&quot; \n\nI think=\r\n real spirituality must involve providing basic practical help to others. F=\r\nood, education, clothes (when I was in India last month, I hear some childr=\r\nen froze to death in Delhi), whatever we can give. It is as important as ho=\r\nmam and japa. It is nothing less than feeding and clothing the living God. =\r\n\n\nHomam and japa is meant to purify us so we give generously. And giving do=\r\nes sometimes involve an element of sacrifice.\n\nI&#39;ve always loved the Bodhic=\r\nitta concept in Buddhism. This idea that one even desires enlightenment, no=\r\nt for one&#39;s own sake, but for the sake of all sentient beings. The yogis pr=\r\nayer is also wonderful &quot;I do not wish even for liberation. I wish only to b=\r\ne Your instrument, and to do Thy will.&quot;\n\nSivananda says &quot;Surrender everythi=\r\nng unto Him. Place your ego at His feet and be at ease. He will take comple=\r\nte charge of you. Let Him mould you in any way He likes. Let Him do exactly=\r\n as He wills. He will remove all defects and weaknesses. He will play beaut=\r\nifully in this body flute. Hear the marvellous music of the flute of the Lo=\r\nrd-the mysterious music of the soul-and rejoice.&quot;   \n\nOm Dum Durgayai Namah=\r\na\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n"}}
