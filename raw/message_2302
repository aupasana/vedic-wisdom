It is one thing to =\r\nquote a relevant passage from a book or url or Master on a currently runnin=\r\ng topic and another to post along the recent patterns. One can always start=\r\n a discussion sharing a piece of writing or speech by any Master/Book and o=\r\npen it to the forum for discussing issues, problems or clarifications by ra=\r\nising them explicitly along with the relevant material. If other members sh=\r\nare my feeling on this then we can request the moderator to act accordingly=\r\n. \nRegards,\n-Prasad\nPS: I was thinking of turning some of my group subscrip=\r\ntions to direct email mode and evaluating the volume in each of those group=\r\ns in recent past and I hit upon this in the process. \n\n\n"}}
