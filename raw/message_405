P.V.R.N.Acharyaji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskaram&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Very well said. Now a days people seek quick solutions leaving aside the golden path of daily Sadhana. The result is that many temples particularly in Tamil Nadu with archaelogical importance are allowed to remain in ruins and people pour several lakhs in building new temples for Devatas like Pratyingira, Sarabeswara etc. and publish widely homams to propitiate these deities. As you have rightly said these deities occupy a special place.&nbsp; In fact, the greatest of Devi Upasaka Sri Abirami Bhattar of Tirukadaiyur of Abirami Andhadhi firm laments in his Andhadhi (meaning each stanza begining with the end of previous stanza&#39;s last word) that he shall not leaving the lotus feet of Sakthi, waste his efforts after &quot;bali kavar Deivangal&quot; ( who demand some weird occult&nbsp;sacrifice).&nbsp; That sums of what you have beautifully and tellingly exposed in your letter.&nbsp; Some Vaishnavite Scholars like Velukudi Krishnan Swamiji in his discourses decry\n such practices. Whatever be the purana behind Pratyingira, it is not ordined for the general mass to go after such devatas leaving the Bhagawath Githa saying &quot;patram pushpam Yo me bhaktya&quot; offers to Lord Narayana.&nbsp; It is not my aim to decry such practices.&nbsp; But when an easy path is shown in our scriptures, why invoke special deities purely for personal aggrandisement and mundane objects.&nbsp; In a famous place as Tirunageswara near Kumbakonam known from yore the Great Nageswara Temple known for its Raghu Sthala and Uppiliappan Temple (Oppilathaappan Temple= Purushothama= Sri Venkatachapathi) , a small Pratyingira temple in its outskirts has shot into prominence where it is alleged a woman ex chief Minister of Tamil Nadu was reported to have performed homam with chillies on an amavasya day&nbsp;to gain political ascension and the priest therein has&nbsp;reportedly&nbsp;gained&nbsp;lot of prominence sporting toyoto van etc.&nbsp; More people\n flock to that place nowadays having their individual person specific agenda. In this scenario, you have pointed out the obvious. Many thanks for this service&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;J.R.Krishnan&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-594123353-1221379184=:26971--\r\n\n"}}
