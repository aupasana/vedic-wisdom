You should write more often.\n \n*       =\r\n *        *\n \nKaala is time personified. Kaali is the shakti of Kaala, i.e.=\r\n Kaali is the animator of Time. It is She who causes time to flow (or even =\r\nto stop).\n \nThe concept of time and its flow are behind the entire delusion=\r\n of duality. As per vedanta, there is nothing called past or future, here o=\r\nr there, I or you. There is Brahman at all places and all times. The object=\r\nification of Brahman into various objects is possible due to the play of Ka=\r\nala and Kaali and the creation of a concept of &quot;time&quot;. One absorbed in non-=\r\ndual Brahman wihtout any concept of time or objectification is immortal. Ti=\r\nme, the great devourer, catches up with anyone stuck in duality, sooner or =\r\nlater.\n \nBTW, Kaala and Kaali are inseparable. Without the &quot;flow of time&quot;, =\r\nthere is no &quot;time&quot; itself. Similarly, without time, there cannot be a flow =\r\nof time. Thus, time and its flow exist together and cannot exist without ea=\r\nch other.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDakshina not only means south, but it als=\r\no means right. Tantra texts talk of Dakshina Kaali and Vaama Kaali. Dakshin=\r\na Kaali is propitiated using dakshinaachaaraa (right-handed practice), whil=\r\ne Vaama Kaali is propitiated using vaamaachaara (left-handed practice). The=\r\n former is worshipped in temples, while the latter is worshipped in shmasha=\r\nana (cemetaries). The latter is also known as Shmashaana Kaali. Symbolicall=\r\ny these two versions are depicted with right foot and left foot forward, re=\r\nspectively.\n \nRight side is associated with Pingala nadi, Surya (Sun) and d=\r\nevatas (gods). It is also linked to the left brain and structured thinking.=\r\n Left side is associated with Ida nadi, Chandra (Moon) and pitris (manes). =\r\nIt is also linked to the right brain and emotional and intuitive thinking.\n=\r\n \nDakshinaachaara attempts to reach the supreme using a structured approach=\r\n. One does not try to destroy layers of deep conditioning of the mind in on=\r\ne shot and takes an orderly and structured approach. It is appropriate for =\r\ntemples (places of public spiritual practice) and for general public too. V=\r\naamaachaara (left-handed path), on the other hand, attempts to nuke the lay=\r\ners of deep conditioning of the mind by throwing the mind into dark alleys =\r\nthat force the mind to realize the non-distinction between light and darkne=\r\nss. Of course, there is a chance one will fall and settle down in the darkn=\r\ness.\n \nThe tools and imagery used by dakshinaachaara followers worshipping =\r\nDakshina Kaali and those used by vaamaachaara followers worshipping Shmasha=\r\nana Kaali may be different, but they are searching for the same primordial =\r\nenergy that results in the flow of time.\n \nThus, Dakshina Kaali and Shmasha=\r\nana Kaali are not really different and merely represent different paths to =\r\nobtain the same realization. Different forms of Kaali represent different p=\r\naths to arrive at the same srealization.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBhadra mea=\r\nns auspicious. While one aspect of Time is that Time devours all and brings=\r\n the end of every object in the field of duality, the flow of Time does mor=\r\ne. Flow of time brings the fruits of various karmas, brings maturity and tr=\r\nansformation in various objects of the field of duality and brings them clo=\r\nser to liberation. When one ponders the primordial energy that results in t=\r\nhe flow of time, from these angles, this path is represented by Bhadra Kaal=\r\ni. She is also worshipped in temples like Dakshina Kaali.\n \n*        *     =\r\n   *\n \nMahaa Kaali, Mahaa Lakshmi and Mahaa Saraswati are three parts of th=\r\ne very initial root primordial energy that is referred to as the golden-hue=\r\nd &quot;Mahaa Lakshmi&quot; in Saptashati rahasya. This very initial root primordial =\r\nenergy Mahaa Lakshmi divides Herself into 3 parts - Mahaa Kaali, Mahaa Laks=\r\nhmi and Mahaa Saraswati, 3 distinct aspects of the primordial energy. These=\r\n 3 energies create 3 couples - Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and their consorts. We=\r\n may see this very initial root primordial energy &quot;Mahaa Lakshmi&quot; as the ex=\r\npression of the supreme cosmic being, as the energy that makes the supreme =\r\ncosmic being be, want, think and know.\n \nChandi represents a fierce energy =\r\nthat makes one battle and overcome various weaknesses and conditioning of t=\r\nhe mind and reach this very initial root primordial energy.\n \nBest regards,=\r\n\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri=\r\n Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n=\r\n \n---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Rajarshij=\r\ni,\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandi is Goddess Durga and a confluence of the energies of Majakal=\r\ni, Mahalakshmi & MahaSaraswathi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear =\r\nNarayanji\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your reply.
