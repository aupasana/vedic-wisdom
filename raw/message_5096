He didnt have formal Guru then but he started oneday on regular ba=\r\nsis without any initiation. later he ispired few people to start reading CP=\r\n.\n\nIf one looks at this group, many have started CP and homam just by posit=\r\nive influences and no formal initiation.\n\nYou are probably very right in yo=\r\nur assumption when you say Adhikara to recite CP may be sprung up due to Ch=\r\nandi is Ugraatiugra.\n\nHowever, Chandi is also Mother and though she may be =\r\nUgraatiugra, she is also Sumyaatisaumya. In this age of Kali, She has becom=\r\ne the later and she&#39;ll be happy if someone just prays with *slightest* of d=\r\nevotion to her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. this is a strong convi=\r\nction developed in me.
