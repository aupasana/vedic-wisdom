Impossible it is not. Pick the time in such a way that yo=\r\nu will be able to do it at that time everyday. For example, if the time of =\r\ncoming back home is not in your hands, do it in the morning before you go t=\r\no work. If you come home late oneday, sleep less and somehow wake up and do=\r\n it at that time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2) This is a difficult niyama and takes many years =\r\nto get perfection. To start with, keep physical restraint and divert the mi=\r\nnd whenever it has those thoughts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3) No, any prasiddha mantra can be=\r\n used.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4) Then don&#39;t. :-) Each rule contributes in a different way to=\r\n success. If one is unable to follow some rules, one can then follow whatev=\r\ner rules one is able to follow.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 5) Yes, even Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;=\r\ns direct disciples thought like that sometimes and wanted to go back and le=\r\nad &quot;regular lives&quot;. Luckily they didn&#39;t and many people are benefiting even=\r\n today.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the early stages, such thoughts are normal. Those who use =\r\ntheir will power to persist will persist and achieve some level of success =\r\nlater on. Those who cannot (or do not) use their will power to persist end =\r\nup giving up and postponing it to a later day (or a later life), when the h=\r\nurdles may be even greater.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri=\r\n Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I reread yours and Manish&#39;s post on and Urdhwaretas and &#39;On Remedial Measu=\r\nres Difference&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; Please answer a few queries of mine.\n&gt; &gt; 1) Out of the=\r\n points he mentioned\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same mate=\r\nrials.\n&gt; &gt; Same direction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on =\r\nrudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(fr=\r\nom the mind and the body, not just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow =\r\na beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are e=\r\nmpty\n&gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole=\r\n procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t doing the sadhna &#39;Same time every day.&#39; diffi=\r\ncult because of job requirements?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)How do you have restraint on s=\r\nex from the mind? i have tried for body but still manytimes\n&gt; &gt; these thoug=\r\nhts come to my mind and with strong urge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)If Manish has specific=\r\nally mentioned Gayatri mantra does he means it to be Gayatri mantra only.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; What if i have chosen some different one?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) What if growing be=\r\nard is not acceptable in your working environment?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5)When you are =\r\ndoing your pooja or havan etc doesn&#39;t this thought ever comes to your mind =\r\n:What the hell i am doing?I should go and concentrate more on my career or =\r\nfollow my hobby.i mean all those sort of insecurities which a common man ha=\r\ns.Though Vimalananda has said on this but these things still ring a bell in=\r\n your mind and force you to think Am i wasting my time or what?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; as=\r\nking these questions on groups is odd,so kindly excuse me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
