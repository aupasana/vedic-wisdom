I came across this nonsense =\r\non youtube when searching for any recent lectures on Saptashati.  You may f=\r\nind some person chanting the so called Navashati written in Telugu if you s=\r\nearch Navasati (probably they don&#39;t know to spell it right).  The Navashati=\r\n blog was poorly written but was trying to put down Saptashati, which I cou=\r\nld not take it knowing it&#39;s value from experience.  Some hallucinatory pers=\r\non trying to prove that he could come up with something better than the Sap=\r\ntashati which has Rig,Yajur and Sama Vedas as it&#39;s own Swaroopam, and for m=\r\ne Saptashati is the Veda.\n\nThanks Sri Rajashri for taking on this kind of n=\r\nonsensical efforts as it seems they are even selling books with that Navash=\r\nati name which can mislead gullible people into something undesirable.\n\nReg=\r\nards,\nKris. \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi=\r\n14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; There were so many sentences in that=\r\n blog which could be picked, questioned, debated and ripped, and shredded t=\r\nhat I am not even sure whether to laugh or to cry.\n&gt; \n&gt; This kind of dubiou=\r\ns logic can be used to prove anything under the sun. Moreover, the so calle=\r\nd Navasati is a figment of some &quot;SRI SRI SRI KALYANANDA BHARATHI MANTACHARY=\r\nA MAHASWAMY&quot;&#39;s meditations using &#39;mantra-shastra&#39; to baptise the Saptasati =\r\nto make it &quot;vedic&quot; (as per their understanding of what vedic must entail) a=\r\nnd save it from &quot;Tantrikas&quot;. Sorry, sounds like a bag of hot air.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; M=\r\nany statements are rank malicious, like - &quot;The term &quot;PARAMPARA&quot; invariably =\r\ndenotes=C2=A0 VEDIC PARAMPRA ONLY and there is no PARAMPARA FOR SAPTHASATHI=\r\n&quot;! Absolute rubbish. Tantras are as much a valid path as any other. And the=\r\nre have been great paramaparas which have been using the Sri Sri Chandi as =\r\nits main sadhana and producing lines of serious spiritual greats since ages=\r\n. If anyone really has a far better locus standi to comment on Sri Sri Chan=\r\ndi, it is the Tantrika Paramparams, for they have done this sadhana is far =\r\ngreater depth and dimension and volume than anyone else at any point in his=\r\ntory. Whatever one cannot digest is not necessarily bad and evil and flawed=\r\n. As a corollary, this blog reminded me of the religious fights during midd=\r\nle-ages, when each group would kill the other fighting over whose imaginary=\r\n sky-daddy is greater.\n&gt; \n&gt; I could have still attempted to take this so ca=\r\nlled found-in-meditation &#39;navasati&#39; with some seriousness, had not the auth=\r\nor of this blog betrayed such rank ignorance, malice, bigotry and intoleran=\r\nce of what clearly has gone way above his cranium. Moreover it is questiona=\r\nble if his so called Vedic-wisdom is truly what the Vedas say, or something=\r\n *he thinks* the Vedas are saying.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway. There is no debate here. At=\r\n best, after completing the whole blog I have only one question for the aut=\r\nhor, &quot;Sir, what have you been smoking?&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAna=\r\nnto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;=\r\n  From: enlnlife &lt;enlnlife@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent:=\r\n Monday, 29 October 2012 9:52 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Saptashati and N=\r\navashati\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Dear PVR Narsimha Garu/Or other great sadhakas =\r\nin the group,\n&gt; \n&gt; I adore Saptashati and fond of reading/reciting/meditati=\r\nng on it.
