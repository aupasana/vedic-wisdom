In my view, Brazil nuts are quite suitable for homam. So are pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds etc. Peanuts (groundnuts) have too much rajas in them and are avoidable. Most other nuts are fine.\n \nSome priests use cardamom. However, my suggestion is not to use it. Mild spices like cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg, stronger spices like cloves, and very hot spices like black pepper and red pepper are better avoided in homam. In fact, such materials are used for specific purposes such as attracting two people to each other, separating two people, destroying people and communities etc. The ability to successfully perform such negative rituals has been nearly taken away from the world for a reason and we should not try such rituals. I only advocate doing homam for spiritual progress and recommend avoiding materials used in negative rituals.\n \nGrains and parched grains, white/black sesame seeds, gud (jaggery), sattwik herbs, different nuts/seeds, dry coconut pieces, simple dry fruits like raisins (kismis), dates and pomegranate seeds etc are sufficient for all saattwik purposes. \n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sunitha&quot; &lt;sunitha_macherla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha garu,  You mention different materials (woods/nuts) being used for different purposes in homam.  What is your thought on using Brazilian nuts in homam? I find it perfect for homam mainly for its high fat content.  It burns just like coconut producing no smoke and can be found in most grocery stores.  Also, can we use cardamom in homam? I assume it is a saatvik substance unlike cinnamon.  \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; -Sunitha\n\n\n"}}
