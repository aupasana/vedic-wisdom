Wh=\r\nen Napolean asked where is God in it, the guy said, do not talk about God. =\r\nIt makes things complicated.\n&gt; So is there a place for Divine Mother and He=\r\nr Love or Grace or Protection in your theory. Is=A0this intermediate zone a=\r\ns you say is created by Her and part of Her creation=A0or by=A0somebody els=\r\ne.=A0 Does=A0She needs some visa to go there if she is=A0not the Creater.=\r\n=A0As you say all higher deity are there but less in ability. Does the deit=\r\nies have even less =A0ability on earth plane.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I am sure this is not=\r\n your theory. You have taken it from yogi Aurobindo. Many times when certai=\r\nn person reach a stage in their spiritual path, others think whatever this =\r\nguy is uttering is=A0complete truth, when in fact it is=A0far from truth. O=\r\nnce=A0I saw in a article that Aurobindo said that Divine Lord who spoke Git=\r\na completely forgot it after few minutes or so. I could not believe what I =\r\nwas reading. Then my respect for this yogi went down the drain.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Div=\r\nine Mother, Her Love, Her Grace Her Protection and other Eternal Divine Bei=\r\nngs are outside of our human perception. They only allow us to know about T=\r\nhemselves what They wish to. For me there is a=A0difference between a yogi =\r\nand devotee.=A0 A devotee rises due to Grace of Divine Mother or their Isht=\r\ndav. where as a yogi rises after a lot of huff and fuff, and they get stuck=\r\n everywhere. I am sure there are only=A0devotee in this group. They may be =\r\ndoing haven or japa or other devotional work.\n&gt; So nobody should=A0feel any=\r\n sort of fear or pressure even for one second because there is no such hocu=\r\ns pocus zone to cross and there is Grace of Divine Mother on all Her childr=\r\nen.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Disclaimer---- My thi=\r\nnking is very different due to Darshan and=A0Grace of Divine Mother & Divin=\r\ne Lord.

Otherwise it does not help. And the only parameters=\r\n of judgement is to objectively see what changes are happening in our surfa=\r\nce, day-to-day consciousness.That is are we less angry, more equanimous, et=\r\nc etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The field of experiences - visions, sights, sounds etc etc - is=\r\n VAST. Some of it can be genuine and plenty non-genuine. It is a complex st=\r\nudy in itself. Most spiritual people have never gone in depth trying to ana=\r\nlyse and understand these things properly, but some pattern is observable.=\r\n=A0 Not all experiences are what they seem to be. Many yogis have lost them=\r\nselves in this jungle of experiences, not being able to adequately determin=\r\ne which is genuine and which is non-genuine. This is the world of astral pl=\r\nane, driven by the overlapping shealths of pranamayakosha and parts of mano=\r\nmayakosha of a human being. In Tantrik terminology, the areas rules by the =\r\noverlapping influence (overlapping and not discreet) of swadhisthana to ana=\r\nhata. Everything=A0 is possible here. Every higher deity has a correspondin=\r\ng lesser manifestation in this realm, but limited in ability. Similarly the=\r\nre are endless beings of varies character and hue who can very easily creat=\r\ne an\n&gt;  expereince for a sadhaka to delude him/her off the path. They can e=\r\nven fake an experience/aura of a higher deity and, in extreme cases, take h=\r\nold of a seeker and use him/her for its own advantage. It is a whole wide w=\r\norld, the lower extreme of which causes, in a normal human being, a cementi=\r\nng of a surface ego driven by attractions, desires, dreams, personal sub-co=\r\nnscious ambitions, jealousy, lust, anger (which is nothing but lust suppres=\r\nsed) etc etc and at the other extreme this layer can, if properly channaliz=\r\ned as is done in genuine Vaishava Bhakti, it can make one experience Divine=\r\n Ananda and manifest the &quot;antaratmah&quot; as an unfailing guide to the path.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In a nutshell, a genuine &quot;experience&quot; is good and authentic only to the =\r\nextent that it helps to modify and transform your waking surface personalit=\r\ny. That is the only true test. Rest all the range of experiences that come =\r\nfrom this realm, and 95 percent of Yogis get experiences ONLY from this rea=\r\nlm, are just sound and fury without substance. \n&gt; \n&gt; In the writings of Sri=\r\n Aurobindo, he calls it the intermediate zone, which has destroyed innumera=\r\nble yogis who have got swept away by the light and sound of this realm. One=\r\n sure-shot way to cross this realm, and all sadhakas will have to cross thi=\r\ns some day, is to hang on tightly to the fundamentals.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =A0R=\r\najarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bh=\r\nAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________________=\r\n_______\n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 9 October 2012 9:07 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRe: A thought\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; A sage &quot;sms&quot; indeed!

Thought I will share it here.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Progress has little to do=\r\n with speed; but much to do with direction. So always concentrate on your d=\r\nirection, not on speed.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For any genuine spiritual seeker, this is=\r\n one of the sanest advices, ever. In the milieu of spirituality, too many p=\r\neople get caught up in the less important - aka, visions, &#39;experiences&#39;, to=\r\nugh-penances, complex rituals, offbeat sadhanas etc etc, while forgetting t=\r\nhe goal of real spirituality, that is transformation of mind/emotions/body =\r\nresulting in greater surrender to the Divine, greater equanimity to life si=\r\ntuations, an abiding calm and peace, genuine humility, lessening of lower e=\r\nmotions like lust, anger, jealously, hatred, cravings, furious attachments,=\r\n such that eventually every action of the individual is like a consecration=\r\n (sacrifice, yagjya) to the Divine. A life so transformed and so away from =\r\nour average superficial existence, that it becomes a fulfillment on its own=\r\n. God is not the finish line of a bicycle race. It is the progressive unfol=\r\nding of a transformation process.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complex rituals and speedy sadha=\r\nnas and experiences et al are ok, provided one does not lose sight of the f=\r\nundamentals. THEN these can be useful. Otherwise one ends up running in cir=\r\ncles and going nowhere. An experience-chaser is not necessary a spiritual e=\r\nntity. I had to learn this basic truth the hard-way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
