It may be true however that some women or pe=\r\nrhaps all women have the capacity to devour a man on various levels, mainly=\r\n on the emotonal level.  Lets face it, women are actually superior in stren=\r\ngth to men in this way.  Now virtues are some thing different and this vari=\r\nes with each individual both man and woman.\n\nRegarding friendship between m=\r\nen and women, is it not many times like playing with fire and expecting not=\r\n to get burned? This seems to the situation with these friendships that may=\r\n be little more than disguised romances or something of that sort.  If the =\r\ntext were a woman speaking it may be one woman consoling the other by sayin=\r\ng &quot;oh you know men are all dogs&quot;. Now this is not true of all men.  Yet all=\r\n men have the capacity to exibit doglike tendencies.\n\nThis is is my humble =\r\nopinion\n\nAjaya\n\n\n\n\n"}}
