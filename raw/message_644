Was he satisf=\r\nied? How did he feel \n&gt; after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) He did pass away abru=\r\nptly in bombay while in the middle of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; giving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spirtual talks?=\r\n It seems unusual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have also read somewhere that once a =\r\nperson reaches a \n&gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state, he cannot remain in human body=\r\n for more than few days, \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the case?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; May be others who have read this book can share more light.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read this book \nif \n&gt; &gt; one \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, it is available for free to download as a pdf book on=\r\n \nhis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; web site.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot =\r\nof work for the betterment \n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upliftment, a lot of his informat=\r\nion is wellknown.

We were used to=\r\n go to seashore daily at 7 pm after \n&gt; &gt; duty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nwere talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea s=\r\nhore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some g=\r\nuest have come to my home and my wife is \nremembering \n&gt; &gt; me. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall hav=\r\ne to go \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise=\r\n his 8 years old son came to call \nhim. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incid=\r\nent he told me that there will be a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; plane \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much \nimpressed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to =\r\ngo to \nDwarka \n&gt; &gt; by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to =\r\ngo through bus, as bus tire will be \n&gt; &gt; punctured. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nunctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This al=\r\nl incidents made me to believe that he had some \n&gt; &gt; super \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nttracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be di=\r\nsciple \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/19=\r\n74. At 7 pm I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surrendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at=\r\n Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I \n&gt; &gt; &gt; prayed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and \n&gt; =\r\nbestow \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a=\r\n discussion with my wife at \n6.10 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking t=\r\nhe tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I \n&gt; &gt; was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that \nI \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; annoyed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =EF=\r\n=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such \na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at =\r\n\n&gt; Calcutta. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Gur=\r\nu should be living one, who can \n&gt; guide \n&gt; &gt; &gt; us, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram \n&gt; &gt; Sharma \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in \n&gt; general=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confuse=\r\nd. I thought-- yes I \n&gt; have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was=\r\n in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Pa=\r\ntel had told me that Thakur \nwas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples=\r\n to test him before accepting him. I also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tes=\r\nt Thakur. I immediately told my wife that \n=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mr. Patel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You ha=\r\nve also not seen him. He \nhas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me =\r\nwhere I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our \n&gt; &gt; house \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection f=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laugh=\r\ned at me=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible?
