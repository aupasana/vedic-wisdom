Guess you might have missed in your s=\r\nurely flooded mailbox.\n\nI am delighted to see your response.\n\nBecause of my=\r\n karmic pattern I do have a nature full of worry, doubt, sadness, anxiety b=\r\nut I truly know and believe that the way out of all troubles/misery is sinc=\r\nerity of bhakti and karma. So I want to strongly come out of all this. I re=\r\nspectfully seek your blessings.\n\n* * * *\n\nSir I have read each and every po=\r\nst of yours for all last 5-6 yrs and \nI understand that if one does homam, =\r\na god truly comes to help you in all ways possible. In this job of cleaning=\r\n the karmic room some dust might initially rise up but after that the room =\r\nwill be beautiful and blessed.\n\nI know you have earlier also made clear tha=\r\nt \na. Technicalities are never a hinderance at all \nb. Sincerity, devotion =\r\nand poorahuti meditation are the main things.\n\nI have one general question.=\r\n \n1. Can homam (for soyma deity)(leaving aside initial issue) backfire unde=\r\nr any other circumstances. \na. Any chart combination.\nb. any wrong days in =\r\ngeneral\nc. any difference in diety days (like VS homam on Pradosh time)\nd. =\r\nany other situation we might watch out for\n\n\nHave sent a mail to you with m=\r\ny name and gotra details at ur id, many many thanks for adding me in sankal=\r\np.\n\n\n* * * *\n\n\nSir I am unable to understand things/life/ form all five sid=\r\nes\n1. Increased issues after homam\n2. My strong premonition that healthwise=\r\n something is wrong with my father\n3. My Sadesati and Guru antar dasha (sup=\r\nposedly markesh/bhadhakesh) is starting\n4. Should I invest more money in Co=\r\nllege fees in US or go back to India. For last 6yrs am jobless\n5. How do I =\r\nimprove my weak pschylogy.\n\nRequest \nWill appreciate if you can find out so=\r\nme time to guide and make me understand my life. I have posted my DOB and a=\r\nll details in vedic astrology forum. thread num - 126118, priyank_priyank, =\r\n\n\nHelp me fine tune my spiritual sadhana.\n\n\nRegards\nPriyank\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Pr=\r\niyank,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry to know your problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is possible that ther=\r\ne is something bad in your karmas and sadhana \n&gt; made the bad result smalle=\r\nr in magnitude, i.e. it could&#39;ve been much \n&gt; worse without sadhana. Howeve=\r\nr, it is tough to prove so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, it is also possible that some ma=\r\nterial setbacks may be given \n&gt; by a deity to remove confusions from the mi=\r\nnd and make one realize what \n&gt; is permanent and what is impermanent. Somet=\r\nimes, in order to overcome \n&gt; the tendency towards anxiety and depression, =\r\ngod may push one into a \n&gt; terrible situation that aggravates one&#39;s anxiety=\r\n, before clarity dawns \n&gt; on one. Strange are the ways of god. Many great s=\r\naints went through \n&gt; terrible sufferings as their lives transformed to bec=\r\nome fruitful and \n&gt; meaningful! What we think is good for us may actually b=\r\ne bad in the long \n&gt; run. If we surrender to god, things we want in the sho=\r\nrt term may or may \n&gt; not happen, but our life will be steered in the right=\r\n direction in the \n&gt; long term. God knows better than us, what is better fo=\r\nr us.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is doubt in your mind that Vishnu sahasra naama homam c=\r\naused \n&gt; problems for you, it may be better to not restart it. Give it some=\r\n time. \n&gt; When you find inspiration again, possibly at a later time, you ca=\r\nn start \n&gt; again. It is sometimes not useful to do a sadhana with such deep=\r\n \n&gt; fear/doubt. Instead of homam, just chant Vishnu sahasra naama stotra \n&gt;=\r\n everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also send me your gotra, name, nakshatra and rasi by privat=\r\ne email (pvr \n&gt; at charter dot net).
