In fact, a bra=\r\nahmana is supposed to do a minimum agni karyam at home everyday. If not a h=\r\nomam for a deity, atleast start fire and make ahutis to Prajapati, Indra, A=\r\ngni etc. That much agni kaaryam a brahmin is supposed to do everyday at hom=\r\ne.\n \nIn fact, some people used to not only perform a regular homam at home,=\r\n but cook right next to homam and take fire from homam to start fire in sto=\r\nve for cooking. Until recently, there were people who were performing homam=\r\n daily at home.\n \nWhen homam is performed for several special occasions (su=\r\nch a griha pravesam, upanayanam etc), priests do perform homam at home.\n \nT=\r\nhe practical difficculty is the smoke from homam. It can be uncomfortable f=\r\nor some people. But it is good. Once, Srila Prabhupada was conducting a hom=\r\nam in an apartment in New York. When poornahuti was offered, there was a lo=\r\nt of smoke. When some people were covering their noses, Srila Prabhupada to=\r\nld them, &quot;no no, this smoke is very good for you. Don&#39;t cover noses.&quot;\n \nTho=\r\nse who have trouble with smoke can minimize it by using ghee minimally, avo=\r\niding wood completely and relying on dry coconut (copra).\n \nYajnas that are=\r\n done on a bigger scale for specific material goals are typically not perfo=\r\nrmed inside the house. Those are formal events. You are calling several god=\r\ns and appeasing them. After all, you want a specific material thing and are=\r\n doing &quot;business&quot; with them. So some protocols are to be employed. The plac=\r\ne should be suitable for all of them to come and do &quot;business&quot; with you. Ho=\r\nwever, a homam done for spiritual growth is a personal and informal affair =\r\nand not formal business. Your home is perfectly fine.\n \nProbably the confus=\r\nion arises from yajnas.\n \nMr Babu is the son of a great man. But, unfortuna=\r\ntely, it is not good karma to spread wrong views that may discourage some p=\r\neople from doing good things.
