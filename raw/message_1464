And I would not question the fami=\r\nly purohit for fear of appearing arrogant or causing any offence to them be=\r\ncause aren&#39;t priests after-all, micro-Gods...in such a case should one cont=\r\ninue doing a mantra which one doubts because:\n\n1. one has to accept this is=\r\n one&#39;s karma for getting a &#39;wrong&#39; mantra?\n2. even if the mantra were to be=\r\n incorrect, does the fact that it was heard out of the mouth of a pious and=\r\n pure purohit automatically correct any blemishes of the mantra?\n3. or shou=\r\nld one trust one&#39;s own judgement and auto-correct the mantra without inform=\r\ning the purohit about it?\n\nI will be grateful for any input on this one as =\r\nalways.\n\nMany thanks,\nSomanathan\n\n\n\n\n"}}
