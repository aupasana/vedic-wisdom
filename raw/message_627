It is also poss=\r\nible that \nneither is \n&gt; Thakur.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that it does not really=\r\n matter!\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit fro=\r\nm \nthem. Beings \n&gt; like Thakur are born out of free volition and out of com=\r\npassion for \nother \n&gt; beings. They are the playmates of the Mother and are =\r\nreborn as a \npart of Her \n&gt; plan. They are born to show the path to others.=\r\n However, there are \nmany \n&gt; paths. In each life, they may take up a differ=\r\nent mission and \ndemonstrate \n&gt; different paths to people through their tea=\r\nchings and deeds. If you \nlike the \n&gt; teachings of such a being in a specif=\r\nic birth, due to some rina \nwith the \n&gt; path taught in that birth, follow t=\r\nhe teachings of that birth. Who \nelse the \n&gt; same being was in other births=\r\n is not that relevant or useful.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you are attracted to the teachings=\r\n of any saint - Ramakrishna \nParamahamsa \n&gt; or Shriram Sharma Acharya or Yo=\r\ngeshwar ji or Ramana Maharshi or \nAurobindo or \n&gt; Srila Prabhupada or Akkal=\r\nkot Maharaj or Sai Baba or Kabir or \nSamartha \n&gt; Ramadas or Jnaneshwar Maha=\r\nraj or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or \nRamanujacharya or \n&gt; Raghavedra Swami or Ga=\r\nutama Buddha or Jesus Christ or whoever, \nfollow the \n&gt; teachings of that s=\r\naint and benefit from them. Other speculative \nthings \n&gt; about them may be =\r\ninteresting, but can turn out to be a mere \ndistraction.\n&gt; \n&gt; Find the teac=\r\nhings and path that attracts you the most. Read the \nteachings. \n&gt; More imp=\r\nortantly, try to *walk* the path. Imbibe the teachings in \nyour \n&gt; thinking=\r\n and in your common sense. Your actions and thoughts should \nreflect \n&gt; the=\r\n teachings. Focus on the teachings of the saint, digest them \nfully and \n&gt; =\r\nbase your thoughts and actions on them.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regar=\r\nding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. The extent to which \nhe \n&gt; imbib=\r\ned the upanishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actions, the \ndepth of \n&gt;=\r\n his sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolute lack of \npersonal eg=\r\no \n&gt; in him are the real miracles to me. Other miracles are useful to \ninst=\r\nill \n&gt; faith and confidence in some people. But they do not do justice to \n=\r\nhis \n&gt; personality. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very conscious of \npossi=\r\nbly \n&gt; limiting Thakur&#39;s personality to a bunch of miracles and was \nconcer=\r\nned if \n&gt; books on him would be able to do justice to his personality.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa tranformed a bunch of youngsters into \nspiritua=\r\nl \n&gt; giants who affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila \nPrab=\r\nhupada \n&gt; transformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who changed t=\r\nhe \nworld, \n&gt; it was possible because of their *total* surrender to the Lor=\r\nd and \nthe \n&gt; zeroness of their personal ego. *That* is a true miracle.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I do not want to downplay the discussion of other tangible \nmiracles. But=\r\n I \n&gt; do not want people to lose track of the crux of the matter.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rama=\r\nkrishna could do miracles because he had no ego and surrendered \nfully to \n=\r\n&gt; Her. *She* did everything for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said earlier, a person with =\r\nnormal ego can do some things; a \nperson \n&gt; with very little personal ego c=\r\nan do tremendous things; and, a \nperson with \n&gt; *no* personal ego can do *a=\r\nny* thing. Our goal should be to \neradicate \n&gt; personal ego through constan=\r\nt vigilance and total surrender.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.=\r\nhome.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To=\r\n: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM\n=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram S=\r\nharma\n&gt; Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anothe=\r\nr as intresting as well as equally confusing thing is that\n&gt; Late Shri Yoge=\r\nshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about\n&gt; his past life and he =\r\nalso indirectly indicated in his biography that\n&gt; he was Thakur Ramkrishna =\r\nin the previous birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; I know\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Respe=\r\ncted Ashwinji\n&gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.\n&gt; &gt; I would lik=\r\ne to mention something that may be an interesting\n&gt; insight.\n&gt; &gt; You mentio=\r\nned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

This is an unbelievable experience that \nI\n&gt; &gt; have had. I have not ad=\r\nded anything from my own. I am writing\n&gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; as was happened in my =\r\nlife. I am going back to the period of\n&gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; Kindly read this only=\r\n when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraph=\r\nist at Okha Port Post office near\n&gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 =\r\npm and I was getting late fee allowance\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a T=\r\nelephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2?T=\r\nt; I had friendship with some\n&gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai =\r\nPatel, (we will call him as Mr. \nPatel)\n&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was=\r\n a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 shri\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was mee=\r\nting him he was always talking\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day b=\r\ny day. There was a weekly\n&gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He w=\r\nas singing devotional songs created\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; him and was weeping while sing=\r\ning. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were =\r\nattending this weekly\n&gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 year=\r\ns old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily a=\r\nt 7 pm after duty \nhours\n&gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One =\r\nday when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; =E2?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nome guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\n&gt; son\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwill come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2?\n=9D. -\n&gt; =\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At o=\r\nne another incident he told me that there will be a plane\n&gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; tomor=\r\nrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about\n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; He c=\r\nould foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; tol=\r\nd me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet \nI\n&gt; &gt; went =\r\nto Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; on t=\r\nhe way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe th=\r\nat he had some super\n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship =\r\nonly. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also =\r\nbe disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I=\r\n surrendered\n&gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2?Ts house before Thakur =\r\npicture. I prayed\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follow=\r\ner and bestow his\n&gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with m=\r\ny wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start fr=\r\nom 7 am I was\n&gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the mor=\r\nning that I have\n&gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was=\r\n annoyed and\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy should you take =\r\nsuch a hasty\n&gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kal=\r\ni at Calcutta. He\n&gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one=\r\n, who can guide us,\n&gt; give\n&gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa fro=\r\nm Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2?=9D--=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not\n&gt; kn=\r\now\n&gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I reme=\r\nmber that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was \ntelling\n&gt; &gt; their disciple=\r\ns to test him before accepting him. I also decided \nto\n&gt; &gt; test Thakur. I i=\r\nmmediately told my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. Patel\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; never come =\r\nto our home. You have also not seen him. He has never\n&gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; me where =\r\nI am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\n&gt; within\n&gt; &gt; 10 to 15=\r\n minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur \nis\n&gt; &gt; perfect?=\r\n=E2?=9D--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2?oHow it is possible? I don=E2?Tt =\r\nbelieve.=E2?\n=9D-\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediat=\r\nely to justify my\n&gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2?~I want to test yo=\r\nur existence\n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; today.=E2?T\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel =\r\nwas at my home at 06.30 in the\n&gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =E2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what \nhappened?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at \n05.30\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly \nThakur\n&gt; &gt; p=\r\nulled my blanket and told me that-=E2?o Go to your friend=E2?Ts\n&gt; house. He=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his\n&gt; house=\r\n=E2?=9D\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the =\r\nway\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are\n&gt; di=\r\nsturbing\n&gt; &gt; him in such an early morning for such a silly things?=E2?T\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that\n&gt; &gt; Morn=\r\ning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.\n&gt; =\r\nThere\n&gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will\n&gt; =\r\nwrite\n&gt; &gt; it sometime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is =\r\nstill alive on the\n&gt; &gt; earth.
