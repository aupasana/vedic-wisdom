As an introductory post, I would like to add=\r\nress a theme that is most pressing in my current worldview, namely the prob=\r\nlem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman with what appears to =\r\nbe the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theory and the Aghori pa=\r\nth throughout most of the world. I don&#39;t think this is as simple as recongn=\r\nizing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in constant balance, be=\r\ncause the focus of the argument seems more oriented toward an almost uncons=\r\ncious Kali worship among parts of the world in which Buddhism is planting o=\r\nr has planted roots. \n\nFor some time I have struggled with the unsettling s=\r\nuspicion that Buddhism is a terrible trap for the mind to stumble upon. Eve=\r\nr since I heard a clip of U.G. Krishnamurti saying that Buddhism introduced=\r\n the concept of conversion into the world, and perhaps before, I have been =\r\nplagued by this suspicion. It appears that Anatman theory merely creates a =\r\na playground for various forms of absurdity which manifest themselves as a =\r\nculture&#39;s obsession with sex and death, which result in the economy of many=\r\n parts of the world being driven by war and prostitution. \n\nNow the Aghori =\r\npath is what is is for most people: a path of self-destruction which is als=\r\no a form of Goddess worship. But I would maintain that such naive practitio=\r\nners of this path have used, consciously or unconsciously, the prevalent An=\r\natman-related theories as excuses to perpetuate the endless cycle of imperi=\r\nalism, heroin-trafficking and prostitution that generally drives world econ=\r\nomy. Because of this fatal misunderstanding of Shaivic energies, along with=\r\n the corresponding fascination with the lingo of Anatman theory, most of th=\r\ne world has become a wasteland of dispersed energy, prematurely sacrificed =\r\nto Kali without a shred of taste or sophistication. \n\nIt is here that I sup=\r\npose one could get into some kind of nirvikalpa/savikalpa samadhi debate re=\r\ngarding whether the Buddha, by renouncing his family, actually created the =\r\ndisintegration of focus which is symbolic of the state of the world, in tha=\r\nt Atman theory, represented by Hinduism is left holding down the homestead =\r\nwhile Anatman theory actually creates suffering by attempting to remove it =\r\nthrough meditation. I would submit that the current state of world dharma l=\r\nocked in some kind of identity crisis over who is supposed to be holding Ka=\r\nli&#39;s left leg and who the right. This is the essential problem, Shiva just =\r\nlay there.\n\nThanks,\nJeff Berger\n\n\n"}}
