Very interesting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This reminds me of an incident with a good frie=\r\nnd of mine. There is an\n&gt;&gt; individual I know, who had never chanted the Sav=\r\nitur-Gayatri mantra ever.\n&gt;&gt; He used to feel, as per his own confession, no=\r\n special love or attraction\n&gt;&gt; for this mantra and being born in a non-brah=\r\nmin family, there was no\n&gt;&gt; religious-cultural occasion where he was formal=\r\nly introduced to this\n&gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One day while meditating on some Tan=\r\ntrik mantras, he got a random\n&gt;&gt; inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri man=\r\ntra. He had a vague idea of what\n&gt;&gt; the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea a=\r\nt all of correct swara or\n&gt;&gt; intonation. So he started chanting, mentally a=\r\nnd soundlessly, the Savitur\n&gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas=\r\n of the mantra, he felt/saw -\n&gt;&gt; and I describe it as he told me - an unbro=\r\nken steam of tremendous, pure,\n&gt;&gt; flood of Golden Light above his head. Lik=\r\ne a world above and outside our\n&gt;&gt; world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine.=\r\n The eventual idea, he told me, was\n&gt;&gt; to enter into that stream of Light a=\r\nbove and see things from that\n&gt;&gt; perspective. But as long as there are impu=\r\nrities in the mind and body, it\n&gt;&gt; is not possible to enter into that realm=\r\n easily. The gunas must be in a\n&gt;&gt; stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness=\r\n of Tamas, nor the impatience of\n&gt;&gt; rajas is conducive for it, but the stab=\r\nle, illuminating, self-assurance of\n&gt;&gt; satwa leading to a deeper equanimity=\r\n in mind and life is needed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Apparently, he also realized that there =\r\nare some Tantrik mantras of Ma\n&gt;&gt; which serve a similar purpose as the Gaya=\r\ntri mantra. They take a person to\n&gt;&gt; the spiritual planes above.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So I=\r\n asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Gayatri\n&gt;&gt; ma=\r\nntra, since there was a nice experience. He said it would have pulled him\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; in and he would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n which he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half way i=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; not good.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Reading the explanation your provided below, that i=\r\ns :\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) ou=\r\nr (naH)\n&gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH).

He wrote a simple, lucid commentary on the Gayatri mantra.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n It starts with a summary in 32 shlokas, followed by an introduction. He\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n then gives 4 explanations / meditations on the mantra -- (1) gayatri, (2)\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; narayana, (3) paramashiva and (4) paramatma.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I am not attempting a=\r\n literal or scholarly translation ... I=92ll try to\n&gt;&gt; summarize the main p=\r\noint, from a practical point of view.

This follows the famous verse from the Agastya\n&gt;&gt; Smriti -- =93yo devaH =\r\nsavitA  .asmAkam dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya\n&gt;&gt; yad bhargaH tad v=\r\nareNyam upAsmahe=94.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas=\r\n (bhargaH) of the deva\n&gt;&gt; (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas i=\r\ns the light of the sun,\n&gt;&gt; which is experienced by all living beings, and i=\r\ns thus easy to meditate\n&gt;&gt; upon.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Whatever is experienced is easy to m=\r\neditate upon, and that which is not\n&gt;&gt; experienced can be difficult to medi=\r\ntate upon. Everyone can meditate upon\n&gt;&gt; the light of the Sun. This is why =\r\nthis meaning for the Gayatri mantra is\n&gt;&gt; always taken first.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; vareNya=\r\nm =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through all karmas and\n&gt;&gt; upaasanaas, w=\r\nhatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. =93Savitaa&quot; is the\n&gt;&gt; fruit of a=\r\nll karmas ... this is taught in the Chandogya Upanishad. [ A long\n&gt;&gt; explan=\r\nation follows, which is omitted here ].  We meditate upon the\n&gt;&gt; splendor o=\r\nf the sun, which is vareNyam.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who=\r\n impels (prachodayaat) our (naH)\n&gt;&gt; thoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with s=\r\nubtle eyesight. Without his light,\n&gt;&gt; we would not be able to distinguish d=\r\nifferent objects.

Like a world above and outside our world. Intensely =\r\npure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told me, was to enter into th=\r\nat stream of Light above and see things from that perspective. But as long =\r\nas there are impurities in the mind and body, it is not possible to enter i=\r\nnto that realm easily. The gunas must be in a stable equilibrium. Neither t=\r\nhe laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of rajas is conducive for it, but =\r\nthe stable, illuminating, self-assurance of satwa leading to a deeper equan=\r\nimity in mind and life is needed.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Apparently, he also realized th=\r\nat there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma which serve a similar purpose as th=\r\ne Gayatri mantra. They take a person to the spiritual planes above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSo I asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Gayatri m=\r\nantra, since there was a nice experience. He said it would have pulled him =\r\nin and he\n would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices whi=\r\nch he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half way is no=\r\nt good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading the explanation your provided below, that is : &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&quot;We meditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaa=\r\nt) our (naH) \nthoughts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Withou=\r\nt his \nlight, we would not be able to distinguish different objects. This i=\r\ns \nexplained in the Aitaterya Upanishad=A0=93The sun, having become eyesigh=\r\nt, \nentered the eyes=94. He thus blesses all living beings.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;..=\r\n matches with the description that I had heard from my friend.

This follows the famous verse from the Agas=\r\ntya Smriti --=A0=93yo devaH savitA=A0 .asmAkam dhiyo dharmAdigocarAH. prera=\r\nyet tasya yad\n bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe=94. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;W=\r\ne=A0meditate upon (dhiimahi)=A0the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the deva (=\r\ndevasya) that is the Sun (savituH).=A0This tejas is the light of the sun, w=\r\nhich is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to meditate upon=\r\n.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Whatever is experienced is easy to meditate up=\r\non, and that which is not experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Ev=\r\neryone can meditate upon the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for=\r\n the Gayatri mantra is always taken first. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;vare=\r\nNyam=A0=3D whatever we can ask=A0/ desire.
