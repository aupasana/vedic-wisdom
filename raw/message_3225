My only point in=\r\n\nVegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non\nViolenc=\r\ne)\nagainst Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).\n\n***\n\nAnyway, my point is=\r\n, I understand that it is good to eat totally\nvegetarian food when you enga=\r\nge in sadhana, specially things like\nhavans, or else it conflicts with your=\r\n system badly.\n\nIn my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not=\r\n correct will\nremain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if Not right=\r\n then for\nme it&#39;ll remain *Not right in all conditions*. it is a different =\r\nmatter,\nif in future i succumb to challanging conditions and start eating m=\r\neat\nbut even then it&#39;ll not justify and make it proper thing.\n\n***\nDear Raj=\r\narshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get offended by my message. i\napologise in adva=\r\nnce for my bluntness.\n\n  your second Para and some writings in your earlier=\r\n message gives me\nimpression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, D=\r\nesh/kaal etc...\ndoes not appeal me. to be very honest.\n\nIn my opinon, if on=\r\ne can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc..\nthen anything under the=\r\n Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those people\nwho choose to eat Crab, Sna=\r\nkes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly\nalright. even people who have starte=\r\nd eating human flesh are also\nacceptable and not doing anything wrong as pe=\r\nr the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\n\nTo talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc...,=\r\n and try to make\nquality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;e=\r\nating meat of\nalready dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a philosop=\r\nhy to cover\nup.\n\nPoeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becua=\r\nse they hate\nkilling invloved. I gave an example of one such person and the=\r\nre are few\nmore i know. howvever they are very very very rare.\n\n***\n\nThe ab=\r\nove arguments are incorrect. I know some non-vegetarian people who\nprovide =\r\nsuch arguements,  but these arguments are nonsensical and\nchildish. Almost =\r\nZakir Naik style of arguments.\n\n  I agree completely. it is childish, Laugh=\r\nable and cruel jokes. Thats\nhow i also take it when such people talk such n=\r\nonsense.\n\n***\n\nLastly, i&#39;ll add a philospohical thought. If so much of kill=\r\ning every\nhourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in=\r\n the\nworld, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have =\r\na\npeacefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma\n=\r\n(Cause & effect) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human\nsocieties=\r\n.\n\nOm Shaanti Shaanti Shaanti:\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,=\r\n\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I hope you or others won&#39;t get offended by my mails. Please take t=\r\nhem\nin the right vein. I am merely discussing. Now some points:\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt; But I have often feel that they are themselves are not convinced when\nth=\r\ney argue. they are &#39;hollow&#39; arguments. However , I&#39;ll honestly say\nthat i h=\r\nave no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I used to eat non-vegetarian=\r\n food many of my friends who were=C2\nvegetarian people would give me a simi=\r\nlar logic, as you mentioned in\nyour first writing. My point is, as a non-ve=\r\ngetarian I am not claiming\nthat I have any special sensitivity to plants, o=\r\nver animals. No. All I\nam saying is that,=C2  this logic that many vegetari=\r\nan people provide\nto convince average non-veg people to quit eating non-veg=\r\n, does not hold\ngood.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I personally can not look at butchery shops w=\r\nhere one finds hanging\ngoats. its pathetic site. People in their excitement=\r\ns stand in queue to\nsee the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take aw=\r\nay that as\nparcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a=\r\n cow or\npig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice o=\r\nf\ntheir inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing\nsi=\r\nte. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe\nthe con=\r\ndition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so\ntasty.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do n=\r\not\nshare them. Call me cruel hearted.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; When the question of sensitiv=\r\nity comes in, there is no universal\nstandard for such. It is moslty a case =\r\nof conditioning. What one feels\ndisgusted or pained about may not affect an=\r\nother. Same rule cannot be\nused to judge everyone.=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Some of my no=\r\nn-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel\nwhere they showed that=\r\n people in some parts of the world eat insects. My\nfriends seemed disgusted=\r\n. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken\nor a fish, what is wrong=\r\n=C2 if someone eats an insect. Just because one\nis born in a certain area i=\r\nn a certain culture in a certain set of\nvalue, one gets the believe that wh=\r\nat one is not accustomed to must be\nincorrect. I told them if in a future l=\r\nife time they were to be born in\nthat place, they would gladly keep eating =\r\ninsects without the slightest\ndoubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigib=\r\nle product of our own\nconditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the =\r\nproblem happens\nwhen we think our conditions are the only possible conditio=\r\nning in the\nworld, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar i=\r\ndeas.\nThat is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is=\r\n.\nEverything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a\n&gt; vegetarian in this lif=\r\ne, if he gets born in a place/culture/family in\na later lifetime which=C2 e=\r\nats non-vegetarian food, he would not even\nbat an eye lid while eating the =\r\nsame. I know=C2 people who faint at the\nsight of blood, but there are docto=\r\nrs who do multiple operations daily.\nSo my point is, personal sensitivity c=\r\nan be a very good reason for an\nindividual, but it=C2 cannot be=C2 a univer=\r\nsal logic applicable to\nall.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; A far better angle of tackling this is=\r\n the idea of karma. Even then,\nif someone can make sure he is not directly =\r\nkilling an animal, not\nselecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buy=\r\ns dead\nmeat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, i=\r\nf\nsomeone (a non-vegetarian)=C2 does not want to deal in the raw flesh,\nhe =\r\ncan buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you\nwould=\r\n get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C2\nIt is simi=\r\nlar to the one you would get for buying some simple daal which\nhas come to =\r\nthe market through the hands of a middle man who has cheated\nthe farmer, or=\r\n God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all\nfood we eat in t=\r\nhis age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs -\nbroiler eggs - which neve=\r\nr hatch into eggs. They are designed to be\neaten because they never grow in=\r\nto an animal. Alsmot like dead from\nbirth. What karma does one get for cons=\r\numing that? God knows.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; An average non-vegetarian, at least in India=\r\n, to be precise is\nactually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 p=\r\nercent\nvegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific poin=\r\nt of\nview, this is a good combination. People who feed on more than 60\nperc=\r\nent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to serious heath\nissues at=\r\n a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biologically\ngood.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; =C2 If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth\nwil=\r\nl be full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if\neverybody wil=\r\nl become vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not, put up\nsuch arguments t=\r\no defend however as i said earlier they are themselves\nnot convinced.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n The above arguments are incorrect.

My point is, as a non-veg=\r\netarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity to plants, ov=\r\ner animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C2&nbsp; this logic that many vege=\r\ntarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eating non=\r\n-veg, does not hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I personally can not lo=\r\nok at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. Peop=\r\nle in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a ch=\r\nicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered =\r\nChicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they jus=\r\nt overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water i=\r\ns such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English wo=\r\nrd to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fis=\r\nh thus is so tasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I understan=\r\nd and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me =\r\ncruel hearted. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When the question of sensitivity =\r\ncomes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of c=\r\nonditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect anothe=\r\nr. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel w=\r\nhere they showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My fri=\r\nends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a =\r\nfish, what is wrong=C2&nbsp;if someone eats an insect. Just because one is =\r\nborn in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one =\r\ngets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I to=\r\nld them if in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they w=\r\nould gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. =\r\nWe humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinio=\r\nn is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are th=\r\ne only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;=\r\nt others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the wor=\r\nld diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/family =\r\nin a later lifetime which=C2&nbsp;eats non-vegetarian food, he would not ev=\r\nen bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C2&nbsp;people who faint at=\r\n the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations daily=\r\n. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an ind=\r\nividual, but it=C2&nbsp;cannot be=C2&nbsp;a universal logic applicable to a=\r\nll.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the id=\r\nea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing=\r\n an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead =\r\nmeat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someo=\r\nne (a non-vegetarian)=C2&nbsp;does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he ca=\r\nn buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would g=\r\net for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C2&nbsp;It is s=\r\nimilar to the one you would get for buying some simple daal which has come =\r\nto the market through the hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer,=\r\n or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat i=\r\nn this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which n=\r\never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten because they never grow=\r\n into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does one get for c=\r\nonsuming that? God knows.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; An average non-vegetari=\r\nan, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple =\r\ndiet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. F=\r\nrom a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who feed=\r\n on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to se=\r\nrious heath issues at a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/non-veg, is biologi=\r\ncally good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;If we don&#39;=\r\nt eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chicken=\r\ns:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if everybody will become vegetarian =\r\n:Etc...are more often than not, put up such arguments to defend however as =\r\ni said earlier they are themselves not convinced.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n The above arguments are incorrect.

If anyone finds it, le me know so that 1 guy on this =\r\nearth can become vegetarian.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He also quotes Sai Baba, Jes=\r\nus and Mohammed Prophet adhering to non-veg. If any of you know the counter=\r\n argument, please help.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best Regards,Sriram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The INTERNET now has a personali=\r\nty.
