Bali&#39;s episode is one amongst some more when Lors Rama&#39;s Maryaada =\r\nand conduct is questioned. he is being criticised by some for Marich event,=\r\n Sita&#39;s Agniparikha, Foresaking of Sita Mata etc...\n\nBut i strongly feel th=\r\nat there will be much more depth in all that which we are not aware and eve=\r\nnts are just on the surface, which generally look at and form our opinions.=\r\n however people also provide counter arguments to justify all the above eve=\r\nnts for which Rama is questioned. like when you mentioned Vaali&#39;s killing, =\r\ni may say that to kill Vaali, there was no option but to Kill him the way h=\r\ne was killed. and if we see history of Vaali then his conduct was against D=\r\nharma towards his brother.

But if=\r\n the arrow, chain and beautiful necklace are all made of 22 caret gold, the=\r\ny are all equally pure. Simply because the necklace required more work, it =\r\nis nore purer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Rama and Krishna were both from Vishnu -=\r\n pure sattwa. One is not more &quot;evolved&quot; than the other. They just served di=\r\nfferent purposes (like the arrow and necklace made of the same 22 pure gold=\r\n) and hence had different qualities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Like I said, earlier, Rama an=\r\nd Krishna are from the soul and mind principles of the cosmic being.

In Mahabharata by c=\r\nomparison, aligning oneself with a higher Dharma beyond lesser dharmas is t=\r\nhe aim.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Being a master of all possible celesti=\r\nal weapons, Rama could have challenged Bali in a direct duel and killed him=\r\n straight; for, the boon on Bali -- that he would automatically get half th=\r\ne strength of his opponent in course of any duel -- could not have affected=\r\n the efficacy of celestial weapons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Rama could also have...&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) dried the Indian Ocean on the very first day when it did=\r\n not give him way to cross over to Lanka; instead he invoked Shiva and pray=\r\ned to the sea god till his patience couldn&#39;t sustain more;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) kille=\r\nd Ravana with a Brahmastra right from the day and right from the spot where=\r\n he stood at the time of coming to know who abducted Sita, without needing =\r\nto get into a war. He had in his arsenal what can be deemed that era&#39;s vers=\r\nion of an IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile)!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But he did no=\r\nne of the above because he thought there was a certain way established by d=\r\nharma to go about each act. This principle was breached on three occasions.=\r\n Killing of Bali in that manner was one IMO.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;C=\r\nonsidering the above, it does not make sense to me why Rama killed Bali in =\r\nthat manner.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarsh=\r\ni&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMs=\r\noNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: V=\r\nerdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f=\r\n&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SP=\r\nAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 5/6/09, utpal =\r\npathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px =\r\nsolid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Rama as God&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: F=\r\nriday, 5 June, 2009, 1:08 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv243526214&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp=\r\n-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;at that point of time Lord Rama wa=\r\ns unaware of his divine nature at &gt;that time and acted in the mould of a=\r\nny other human being.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you go through Yoga Vaasishtha, in the conc=\r\nluding part it is mentioned that Raama went in to Samadhi and Vasishtha Ris=\r\nhi then declares in front of the whole gathering that he is the Incarnation=\r\n of all pervading Vishnu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I understand fully when Narasimha says tha=\r\nt Rama realised his true nature later (During Vasishtha&#39;s discourse) and no=\r\nt from the birth. but once he realised, then he realised. i fail to appreci=\r\nate your argument that he forgotten his true nature during some course of e=\r\nvents and acted against dharma or Maryaada. Bali&#39;s episode is one amongst s=\r\nome more when Lors Rama&#39;s Maryaada and conduct is questioned. he is being c=\r\nriticised by some for Marich event, Sita&#39;s Agniparikha, Foresaking of Sita =\r\nMata etc...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But i strongly feel that there will be much more depth\n =\r\nin all that which we are not aware and events are just on the surface, whic=\r\nh generally look at and form our opinions. however people also provide coun=\r\nter arguments to justify all the above events for which Rama is questioned.=\r\n like when you mentioned Vaali&#39;s killing, i may say that to kill Vaali, the=\r\nre was no option but to Kill him the way he was killed. and if we see histo=\r\nry of Vaali then his conduct was against Dharma towards his brother. Howeve=\r\nr Rama also took the brunt of that Karma on himself in the later life durin=\r\ng Krishna Incarnation. BUT what is the use of all these arguments?
