For, unlike any other epoch in our history, the last 200 years have witne=\r\nssed the systematic and seemingly unstoppable deconstruction of religion as=\r\n an important element of Western society and human culture. So seemingly su=\r\nccessful has the exorcism of religion from public life been since the moder=\r\nn Enlightenment era, that many 20th century American scholars even went\nso =\r\nfar as to prematurely pronounce the imminent death of religion in our age. =\r\nAs events and trends in recent world history have shown us, however, this w=\r\nas an exceedingly mistaken pronouncement to say the least.\n\nAs is becoming =\r\nincreasingly apparent in the early years of the 21st century, religion&#39;s ob=\r\nituary may have been written somewhat prematurely. Our current era is witne=\r\nssing one of the greatest world wide religious resurgences ever recorded in=\r\n the annals of human history. In America alone, for example, we have seen t=\r\nhe importance of religiously based human values ushered center stage in the=\r\n elections of 2004. And the rest of the world has not been immune to this t=\r\nrend. The centrality of religion in human life and culture has been aggress=\r\nively reasserted in India, Israel, throughout the Islamic world, and throug=\r\nhout the Third World especially. Only the modern secular states of Western =\r\nEurope seem, so far, to have remained relatively untouched by the global re=\r\nvival of spirituality. Rather than ushering in a new secular age, an age fr=\r\nee from the influence of religion, spirituality and contemplation, the evid=\r\nence seems to indicate that we are actually entering a Post Secular Age: an=\r\n age wherein religion will necessarily fill up the vacuum created by the ru=\r\ninous failure of 20th century secular materialism....&quot;\n\n\nVISIT HERE TO READ=\r\n THE REST OF THIS INSIGHTFUL ARTICLE:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/forum/c=\r\nontent.php?20-Post-Secular-Age\n\n\n\nPlease forward this information to all si=\r\nncere spiritual seekers.\n\n\n\nAum Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya\n\n\n\n"}}
