Thers a slight confusi=\r\non in my mind regarding chanting mantras...\n\n1.A mantra has a specific way =\r\nof pronounciation.and i have seen there are several kinds of pronounciation=\r\n...like here in bengal thers one way....in benaras another...and in souther=\r\nn india another way.\n\nWich one is to be adopted ??\n\n2.I have understood the=\r\n bank balance analogy.I want to ask if chanting mantras of forms of shakti =\r\nlike Dakshina Kali wud be ok or not ??\n\nA reason for this confusion is that=\r\n i have read the way the energy of a mantra is directed from one house in h=\r\noroscope to another.Being only a novice in the vast field of astrology i am=\r\n unable to decide my mantra.\n\nAlso,at some point of time,i have read in thi=\r\ns forum that horoscope represents the maya.So if i just want to show my lov=\r\ne to the mother divine by chanting the mantra whenevr i get to do it ,be it=\r\n in any state of mind and body,will my love take preference over the maya o=\r\nr the formula for energy direction will still apply ????\n\n\n3.Now,that i hav=\r\ne selected a mantra.During chanting or japa of it,contradictory thoughts do=\r\n come in mind.Even sometimes i ask for material pleasures out of lack of fo=\r\ncus during tha japa. So i am confused whether to continue the japa or not.\n=\r\n \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is a frequently asked question.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If someone =\r\nopening a new bank account has a very rich father who gives him money for t=\r\nhe opening balance, one can start off with a million dollar balance. Of cou=\r\nrse, that helps. But, it is possible to squander that money and end up with=\r\n a zero balance later.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, one without a rich father may open =\r\na bank account with a very small opening balance. But, if one works hard, o=\r\nne may end up very rich.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your question is akin to asking whether a pe=\r\nrson who does not have a rich father can open a bank account. Of course, he=\r\n can. He should open an account and work really hard to grow it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Seco=\r\nndly, there are very very few people who have a good amount of shakti with =\r\nany mantra and the capability to transfer some of it to someone else.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- gigarm2003 &lt;gigarm2003@...&gt; wrote=\r\n: \n&gt; &gt; Respected members.\n&gt; &gt; I have heard that a Mantra to be effective ha=\r\ns to be assigned by a Guru, because\n&gt; &gt; he can send His Shakti to the devot=\r\nee.\n&gt; &gt; But sometimes for some people is not possible to meet a Guru person=\r\nally for many\n&gt; &gt; reasons (distance karma etc)\n&gt; &gt; Can someone pick a mantr=\r\na, chanting it with bhakti and have some benefit, even\n&gt; &gt; without a Guru g=\r\nuidance ?\n&gt; &gt; I would appreciate your opinion about my question.\n&gt; &gt; Thank =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; Armando\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Italy\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
