I=\r\nn this very bold and no nonsense presentation, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Achary=\r\na not only explains that we are, indeed, about to experience a time of hist=\r\norical spiritual transition, but he also reveals what we, our families, and=\r\n society can do in order to adequately prepare for the changes taking place=\r\n around us. This brand new presentation is the recently filmed follow-up to=\r\n Sri Acharyaji&#39;s earlier, history making talk of March, 2009, which became =\r\nknown to the world as the video titled &quot;The Coming Golden Age&quot;. This is a c=\r\nrucial message that you and your loved ones need to hear.\n\nWATCH THE FULL V=\r\nIDEO HERE:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DqrkE9vAwK9k\n\n\nAvailable in Hig=\r\nh Definition.
