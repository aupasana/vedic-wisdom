What will be our condition if =\r\nwe were tested by The Mother? Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; You have passionately rais=\r\ned some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thing i=\r\n wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes give=\r\ns to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a Saa=\r\ndhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many followers, e=\r\nnjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and does n=\r\not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmachar=\r\nya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.\n&gt; I whole hear=\r\ntedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in his=\r\n &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matte=\r\nrs. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature in soci=\r\nety. He really was a Saadhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a big difference between fall of=\r\n a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar did=\r\nn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for us=\r\n, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of th=\r\ne whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow to=\r\n faiths of general public.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not specific on Satyananda here becaus=\r\ne i do not know if it is really true.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the footage is right, then i =\r\nfancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear=\r\n Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corru=\r\nption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Further, in=\r\n this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and \n&gt; \n&gt; You=\r\n have spoken the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then sa=\r\ny even 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very=\r\n elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pa=\r\nins of sexual desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, i would say that its high time for Big=\r\n names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of =\r\n Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical a=\r\nnd mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmachary=\r\na. )\n&gt; \n&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa =\r\nChale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt =\r\nto Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation,=\r\n=C3=82 is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; 2) Second, how =\r\ndoes one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say some sexual r=\r\nitual?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a re=\r\nasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; We live in such ti=\r\nmes where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advanced sou=\r\nls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who might ha=\r\nve been brahmacharis in all previous births, would=C3=82 probably=C3=82  no=\r\nt be able to remain so when born in thid age=C3=82 is a simple fact of natu=\r\nre, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She w=\r\nants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Further, in this ag=\r\ne of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that until=\r\nl you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to ove=\r\nrcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misco=\r\nnceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; All said and done, =\r\nVimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - t=\r\nook 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus =\r\nand saints?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami N=\r\nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, th=\r\ne idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/h=\r\ner guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible w=\r\nay. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing ho=\r\nmas for some years. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Betwe=\r\nen me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; =\r\n- Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex=\r\n scandals by spiritual gurus\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Dat=\r\ne: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us gi=\r\nve the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusi=\r\nons as someone said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video =\r\nis genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web. =\r\nHe is a fantastic teacher of spiritual concepts.

His advice was very simple ...when in the physical act k=\r\neep it physical.As long as fantasies are not involved it does not become a =\r\naddiction. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHe could very well be repaying a rna ...or might be in=\r\nvolved in a sexual ritual. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTwo of his gurus were an old woman and=\r\n a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube video on divine consciou=\r\nsness and feminity.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a ver=\r\ny good way of explaining higher level truths.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhat he did or did n=\r\not do is only his karma alone .This does not take away anything from his le=\r\nctures or messages.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nand like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When w=\r\ne are prepared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be =\r\nprepared when the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share o=\r\nf the karma others committed and also will be judged quite harshly when our=\r\n turn comes.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegards&lt;br&gt;\nVemparla Ram Kishore &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a =\r\nrel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha aptly worte:&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter how much one =\r\nhas &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how =\r\n&gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences &gt=\r\n;one had, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt;of=\r\n the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still fal=\r\nl. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I learnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s me=\r\nssage.

There may not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very=\r\n popular on TV, Media and having a great many followers, enjoys sexual plea=\r\nsures but at the same time he preaches the same and does not hide it. If so=\r\nmeone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she =\r\ndoes not admit own weakness, it is a gross.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I whole heartedly resp=\r\nect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in his &#39;Satyana =\r\nPrayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matters. It is =\r\na rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature in society. He re=\r\nally was a Saadhu.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; There is a big difference between fal=\r\nl of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar=\r\n didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment fo=\r\nr us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front o=\r\nf the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blo=\r\nw to faiths of general public.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I am not specific on Saty=\r\nananda here because i do not know if it is really true.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIf the footage is right, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful ep=\r\nisodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing=\r\n such bitter pills so that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to =\r\nvery minimum.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karm=\r\nas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You have spo=\r\nken the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then say even 10=\r\n0 years back.

Souls who might have been bra=\r\nhmacharis in all previous births, would=C3=82&nbsp;probably=C3=82&nbsp; not=\r\n be able to remain so when born in thid age=C3=82&nbsp;is a simple fact of =\r\nnature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? S=\r\nhe wants it that way and so it is that way.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so t=\r\nwisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding=\r\n you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unne=\r\ncessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I c=\r\nonsider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of strugg=\r\nle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swa=\r\nmi Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come=\r\n, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as h=\r\nis/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possib=\r\nle way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doin=\r\ng homas for some years. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Take a=\r\nway the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- O=\r\nn Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To:=\r\n &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste KK,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of=\r\n doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone sa=\r\nid.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; *Even i=\r\nf* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is fre=\r\ne from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

Take your mind off god for a second and you CAN fall. When w=\r\ne are not in a state where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable t=\r\no a fall.

The key is to not be swayed by name, fame, image, following, res=\r\npect, money etc and retain the mindset of a dedicated servant, in the midst=\r\n of either adulation or adversity.
