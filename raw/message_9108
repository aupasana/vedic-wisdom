It&#39;s good to undertake an honest self-analysis to se=\r\ne where we are going. Towards real vedanta, or &#39;lip-vedanta&#39;.\n\nSwami Sivana=\r\nnda Saraswati (of the Divine Life Society, Rishikesh):\n\n&quot;The practice of ka=\r\nrma yoga prepares the aspirant for the reception of knowledge of the Self. =\r\nIt moulds him into a proper adhikari (eligible one) for the study of Vedant=\r\na.&quot; \n\n&quot;Ignorant aspirants jump at once to jnana yoga without any preliminar=\r\ny training in karma yoga. That is the reason why they fail miserably to rea=\r\nlize the truth.&quot;\n\n&quot;The impurities still lurk in their minds. They only talk=\r\n of Brahman or God, indulging in useless discussions, vain debates and dry,=\r\n endless controversies. Their philosophy is on their lips only. In other wo=\r\nrds, they are lip-Vedantins.&quot;\n\n********\n\n&quot;WHAT IS REALLY NEEDED IS PRACTICA=\r\nL VEDANTA THROUGH CEASELESS, SELFLESS SERVICE.&quot;\n \n********\n\n&quot;A Karma-yogi i=\r\ns either a Karma-bhakta yogi or Karmaa-gyana yogi. He works with either the=\r\n bhav of a Bhakta or Gyan.&quot;\n\n&quot;Certain qualities such as kindness, mercy, to=\r\nlerance equal vision, humility which are aids to gyana, can be cultivated t=\r\nhrough selfless service and service alone.&quot;\n\n&quot;Glory to Karma yoga ! Glory t=\r\no Karma Yogins ! The world is in dire need of Karma-gnana-yogins but not of=\r\n mere Mayavadins or lip vedantins who always indulge in vedantic gossipping=\r\n only but who do not turn out something very practical and useful to the wo=\r\nrld at large.&quot;\n\nFor the full articles:\n\nhttp://www.yogamag.net/archives/200=\r\n9/ajan09/integ.shtml\n\nsaileelas.org/articles/saisudha/karma.doc\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
