I am also waiting PVRs reply. In any case take his words as final words.=\r\n\n\n\nSimilar kind of unfortunate thing happened to me also after doing 21 vis=\r\nhnu sahastranaam homam. \n\nI strongly believe that getting inspired by PVR w=\r\ne have in a way jump started the spiritual side by doing homams. (They are =\r\npowerful) PVR had already lot of sadhana (i believe for 4-5yrs) before he m=\r\net his guru and started with homams.\n\nNoone knows the exact theory and i be=\r\nleive that such things are not in ones chart also. Even i was worried like =\r\nyou to get my chart analysed and know the reason but 3-4 astrologers couldn=\r\nt tell me the reason. i came to understand that chart is a map not a territ=\r\nory. \n\nPVR also has mentioned that its better if people do Ganapti homam fo=\r\nr first 2-3 months. I will request PVR to add this information in each and =\r\nevery manual and also to suggest some non homam sadhana of ganapati so that=\r\n people who are eager to start their journey can have a beautiful start to =\r\ntheir sadhana. \n\nPriya, you can stop the homams and get confortable and con=\r\nfident first. Dont attach any guilt to not doing homams. No god is out ther=\r\ne to punish you, its just that karmas are extremely complex. Its better to =\r\nstart with ganapati to remove all obstacles first. \n\n\nI can strongly sugges=\r\nt few ganapati sadhana. \n\n1. Ganapati Homam \n(This is no doubt very powerfu=\r\nl and i suggest this one for everyone but for al those who for any reason c=\r\nant do homam, please start sincerely with some non-homam sadhana)\n\n2. Ganap=\r\nati tarpan\nUse ganapati mool mantra 444 times for 40 days. (takes around 40=\r\nmin)\n&#2384; &#2358;&#2381;&#2352;&#2368;&#2306; &#2361;&#2381;&#2352;&#236=\r\n8;&#2306; &#2325;&#2381;&#2354;&#2368;&#2306; &#2327;&#2381;&#2354;&#2380;&=\r\n#2306; &#2327;&#2306; &#2327;&#2339;&#2346;&#2340;&#2351;&#2375; &#2357;&#2=\r\n352; &#2357;&#2352;&#2342; &#2360;&#2352;&#2381;&#2357;&#2332;&#2344;&#2306=\r\n; &#2350;&#2375; &#2357;&#2358;&#2350;&#2366;&#2344;&#2351; &#2360;&#2381;&=\r\n#2357;&#2366;&#2361;&#2366;&#2405; add &quot;tarpayami&quot; after swaha\nhttp://guruj=\r\niamrita.tripod.com/mahaganapathy_tarpanam.htm\n\n3. Variations in Ganapti tar=\r\npan\na. Instead of turmeric mound in the sadhana listed above you can keep g=\r\nanapti yantra also. \nb. I simply chooze to visualise ganapati and either i =\r\nvisualise washing his feet or simple focusing on mantra. \nc. As PVR has sai=\r\nd many times before that sincerity and devotion are the key and not the tec=\r\nhnicalities.\n\n4. I am on 30th day of this ganapti tarpan sadhana and i can =\r\nvouch for a wonderful clarity and good results.\n\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; De=\r\nar PVR garu,\n&gt; Actually I wanted to post this message privately but all my =\r\nprevious pvt messages that I sent to you never got responded so I decided t=\r\no post it public. The reason is I don&#39;t want anyone to get any wrong notion=\r\ns about God. \n&gt; Anyway, ever since I started homam my health problems have=\r\n=A0started increasing.I patiently accepted every problem or any test that G=\r\nod threw on my way. But recently along with Vishnu homam I have started cha=\r\nnting Laxmi Narayan Hrudyam and khadgamala stotram too. my health problems =\r\nhave manifolded to the extent that homams which I did everyday has been red=\r\nuced twice a week to once a month, to nothing due to very bad health.I rece=\r\nntly came from the emergency room and escaped jaws of death. The doctor cau=\r\ntioned against a recurring attack eventually leading to death. With two sma=\r\nll kids my heart for the first time=A0cried and asked God why such a big pu=\r\nnishment what did I do. All the while when I did homams I saw good spiritua=\r\nl progress also and many good things happening on the side.=A0 detachment t=\r\nowards abstract things is easy to overcome but what about attachment of a m=\r\nother towards their kids.=A0=A0For the first time in life I feel very depre=\r\nssed. I don&#39;t\n&gt;  feel like looking or talking to God anymore. Although ther=\r\ne is a hope that nothing wrong will happen he is by my side watching.=A0\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; With your divine instinct kindly guide me what future do you see for me =\r\nor if any=A0remedies can help. I can send in birth details privately if nee=\r\nded. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sincere thanks and regards from a worried mother,\n&gt; Priya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
