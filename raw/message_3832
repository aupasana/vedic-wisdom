It costs 40 Rs/Kg. here in nagpur and=\r\n it is of very good quality. 1Kg of this samagri can be used for some time.=\r\n\n3. I use wood sticks for homam which costs Rs 10/Kg. I generally find the =\r\nfire getting weak during the time of tarpana/bali during homam. For that yo=\r\nu may put some coconut pieces to keep the fire burning. You can use coconut=\r\n pieces to keep the fire burning for more time.\n4. My general=C2=A0experien=\r\nce=C2=A0is that Brahmacharya is an important activity in any sadhana especi=\r\nally in case of Ganapati ji and Hanuman ji.\nHope this helps.\nThanks,\n\n\n--- =\r\nOn Tue, 2/3/10, biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: biswa108 &lt;bisw=\r\na1975@...&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Ganapati Homam - Need so=\r\nme practical approach...\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Tuesday, 2 =\r\nMarch, 2010, 8:14 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n   =\r\n   NAMASKAR to all\n\n\n\nI have been performing Ganapati Homama for the last t=\r\nhree weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of this beau=\r\ntiful forum...\n\n\n\nNow I need some practical approach best suitable for me..=\r\n.\n\n\n\n1.
