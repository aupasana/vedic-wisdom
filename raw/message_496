If the wandering mind slows down, oneday there is a possibility of m=\r\nind stopping completely for a little time. When that happens, you perceive =\r\nthe underlying reality that an overactive mind normally stops you from perc=\r\neiving. As this happens more frequently, you are able to control your mind =\r\nfar better.\n=A0\nIf you do things in a business-like attitude, in haste, IMH=\r\nO, it is not really conducive to slowing the mind down and creating a usefu=\r\nl complete/partial silence of the mind. It is very counter-productive. Befo=\r\nre any ritual, we are expected to do praanaayaama.=A0The idea is that you g=\r\net as much control over breathing and hence on mind, and then rely on the m=\r\neditation/japam/ homam to take the mind further into calmness.\n=A0\nIf you a=\r\nre somebody who can maintain calmness of your mind even as you rush through=\r\n some hymns in haste, then I see no problem. But, normally, rushing through=\r\n something under time pressure destroys the calmness of the mind.\n=A0\nOn th=\r\ne other hand, if you do not have artificial pressures to meet a count and g=\r\no calmly as long as you can, it is more conducive to the calming down of th=\r\ne mind.\n=A0\nThus, I strongly recommend doing japam at the pace that is comf=\r\nortable and not detrimental to the calmness and focus of mind. If necessary=\r\n, I recommend dumping restrictions like meeting a count. In fact, in this a=\r\nge and time, it is probably better to not have a target count at all and ha=\r\nve a target time only. In other words, don&#39;t say &quot;I will do this mantra for=\r\n 1008 times&quot; and instead say &quot;I will do this mantra for 40 minutes&quot;. Then, =\r\nfor those 40 minutes, you can focus on the mantra calmly.\n=A0\nOf course, qu=\r\nantity also matters. Doing japam for 4 hours everyday is definitely better =\r\nthan half hour. But quantity without quality is useless. Very focussed medi=\r\ntation for half hour is better than distracted meditation for 4 hours.
