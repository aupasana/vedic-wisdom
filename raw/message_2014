I am posting it here for anyone in=\r\nterested.\n=C2=A0\nNear the beginning of the 20th century the great Indian fr=\r\needom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which =\r\nhad not been expressed before. In his high states of divine union he saw th=\r\nat the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw th=\r\nat the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time for thi=\r\ns divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending t=\r\no Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resista=\r\nnce held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n=\r\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mysti=\r\nc, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they embar=\r\nked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant=\r\n to the colossal uncertainties we face today.\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo saw t=\r\nhat the divine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore ha=\r\ns a force of\n consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending do=\r\nwn into matter is called involution. The process by which the divine ascend=\r\ns back upwards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobind=\r\no, humanity has reached a stage where these two events are occurring simult=\r\naneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experi=\r\nencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consci=\r\nousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.\n=EF=BF=BD\n=\r\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in wh=\r\nat he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if sel=\r\ndom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if=\r\n obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. Th=\r\nere is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer sen=\r\nses seems to contradict it.\n\nSri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is goi=\r\nng through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the hu=\r\nman mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessl=\r\ny inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the =\r\nMother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the =\r\nhuman rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been es=\r\ntablished in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is =\r\nto bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n\nEvolution took a great leap =\r\nforward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We =\r\nare now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as w=\r\ne prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about fo=\r\nur stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience =\r\nconcurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our c=\r\nurrent species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but lar=\r\ngely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.\n=EF=BF=BD\nNext is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous-ly coming to b=\r\nirth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being th=\r\nat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mi=\r\nnd-consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nThirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who wil=\r\nl still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Min=\r\nd of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with=\r\n cellular consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nFinally, our ultimate goal as a species is=\r\n the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within =\r\nthe subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=\r\n=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and =\r\nspirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n\nThe great work of Sri Aurobindo=\r\n and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into the cel=\r\nlular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousn=\r\ness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously being=\r\n brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment wh=\r\nen it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.\nWhenev=\r\ner there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. =\r\nSri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=\r\n=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world to=\r\nday. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of F=\r\nalsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardl=\r\ny apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global events. Accor=\r\nding to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transforma=\r\ntion recently, and the Asura of Suffering has\n returned to Source, and so o=\r\nnly the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, the=\r\ny spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitl=\r\ner during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering=\r\n his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be=\r\n influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.\n\nWith the=\r\n descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human str=\r\nuctures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although=\r\n the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. T=\r\nhe power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the mos=\r\nt part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried =\r\na power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means othe=\r\nr than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorb=\r\ned into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may=\r\n be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the=\r\n destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonizati=\r\non!\n\nWhen does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that =\r\nthe world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imm=\r\ninent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a ce=\r\nrtainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =\r\n=EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said tha=\r\nt the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThis was a very int=\r\neresting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the=\r\n world.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) i=\r\ns Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       ICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclus=\r\nively on  YAHOO!

The Mother said in=\r\n 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and that it =\r\nwould come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this mini=\r\nmum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a =\r\nturning point.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says abo=\r\nut changes coming in the world.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-fa=\r\nmily: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Courier&quot;&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;-=\r\n Shiva Sutra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/t=\r\nbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 e=\r\nxclusively on &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.ya=\r\nhoo.com/tagline_cricket_3/*http://cricket.yahoo.com&quot;&gt; YAHOO!
