I feel great tha=\r\nt I have learned this. I did the long (45 minute) procedure. As recommended=\r\n, I have used dried coconut pieces in the fire. The fire died out a few tim=\r\nes but within a short time I could light it again. By the end of the proced=\r\nure the fire was burning bright. However I notice that the fire left behind=\r\n fine traces of ash on the furniture, on the sofa etc.\n\nIs there a way out =\r\nof this? How do you all manage to do the homam without causing the fire to =\r\nfly? There is no way I can do this outside in the balcony, in the sub-zero =\r\ntemperature. \n\nI may have to do the short, 10-minute homam if I do not find=\r\n a way solution to the ash. \n\nThanks for sharing your experience.\nR\n\n\n"}}
