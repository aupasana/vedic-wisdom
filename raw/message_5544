He rel=\r\nated the following incident that took place between\nhis co-student (scholar=\r\n-1) and his teacher (scholar-2) who is a great\npandita.\n\nscholar-1 -- There=\r\n are so many Panditas these days, but people keep\ntalking about the scholar=\r\nship of some particular Pandit (scholar-3).\nIs there really such a vast dif=\r\nference?\n\nscholar-2 -- It is difficult to see the difference, unless you\nyo=\r\nurself have deep scholarship. Let me describe this by way of\nexample. Thoug=\r\nh you yourself are well-qualified, you see the\ndifference between us. It is=\r\n like you are seated at the base of the\nhimalayas, and I am seated at the t=\r\nop. Well, with this Pandita\n(scholar-3), I feel the same way. I am seated a=\r\nt the base of the\nhimalayas, and he is seated on top. But, for the average =\r\nperson, or\neven a mere scholar, it is almost impossible to tell the differe=\r\nnce.\n\nThere are many learned people who have access to a wide range of book=\r\ns\nand materials. They concentrate on breadth, and are limited to\nscratching=\r\n the surface. A true scholar on the other hand, looks for\ndepth. It isn&#39;t j=\r\nust the sheer amount of material that they have\nstudied -- they have intern=\r\nalized the material to such an extent that\nthey speak it with every breath.=\r\n Their way of thinking changes, and\ntheir speech is pramANam.\n\nbhavadiiyaH,=\r\n\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n"}}
