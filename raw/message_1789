Intellect is disliked because it =\r\nquestions. And when the answers are not comfortable with our existing belie=\r\nfs we find excuse to quite our mind. There are many ways to find God. Intel=\r\nlect never hinders. The same way pride also has many disguise. One can be p=\r\nroud of humility or one&#39;s devotion to god as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; So saying such a t=\r\nhing actually confuses people and set wrong beliefs in mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Siya.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Intellectual prowess is helpf=\r\nul in some matters, but it cannot make one understand or experience god.
