What I am trying to ask is=\r\n..should one surrender\n&gt; to any God we come across or loyalty towards one G=\r\nod is important? If\n&gt; loyalty is important then can I read Durga Saptashati=\r\n and say although I\n&gt; am praying to you mother I surrender to Lord vishnu o=\r\nnly? \n \nDo not think of it in terms of loyalty. Gods are not like egoistic =\r\npeople who compete with others and have qualities like possissiveness, jeal=\r\nosy etc. Gods are different aspects of (and pathways to) the Supreme.\n \nAll=\r\n gods are slightly different emanations of the supreme cosmic being, who ma=\r\ny also be called &quot;the Self of all&quot;. In order to realize Self, one needs to =\r\nreach the supreme cosmic being. That can be done through various gods. Firs=\r\nt develop attachment to one god, appreciate his/her qualities, think of him=\r\n/her all the time and reach him/her. Then you can reach the supreme cosmic =\r\nbeing through that god.\n \nOne who is most attached to Vishnu/Lakshmi/Shiva/=\r\nDurga/Ganesha/Surya should look at that god as the supreme god from whom al=\r\nl gods emanate. All other gods are created from that god and rest in that g=\r\nod. It is fine to worship various gods, thinking that they are all differen=\r\nt manifestations of the god one is attached to.\n \nIf one has not found a go=\r\nd one is attached to and about whom one can think like this, then one may h=\r\nave to look more.\n \n&gt; During navratri is it ok to read devi mahatmyam when =\r\na women has her\n&gt; periods? If no then what can she do to acheive the maximu=\r\nm benefit?\n \nIn my personal opinion, it is ok to read mentally. If you do e=\r\nxternal rituals like homam, idol worship etc, however, I suggest not doing =\r\nthem during periods and to read mentally instead. This is particularly true=\r\n for homam. While I do not fully understand the rationale through personal =\r\nexperience, I like to respect the words of tradition and of people who know=\r\n more than me.\n \n&gt; My homam fire is small so just wondering if it is ok to =\r\nput chopped basil\n&gt; leaves,chopped betel leaves or should one put whole lea=\r\nf only. I always see\n&gt; you use the words whole turmeric, whole lemon etc he=\r\nnce this doubt. \n \nYes. Undivided and full parts are better, but offering s=\r\nomething compatible with the size of your fire and making sure that it burn=\r\ns fully and comfortably is the most important criterion. So feel free to pu=\r\nr chopped things.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNamaste Mitesh,\n \n&gt; In the tarpan=\r\na process we invite all ancestors in the copper vessel\n&gt; but in the end wha=\r\nt should we do, request them to go back to their respective places?\n \nThe m=\r\nantra used for invocation does not ask for ancestors to enter the water in =\r\nthe kalasha. It asks them to come to the area to receive the water offering=\r\n. When they are satisfied with the sesame water, they leave. Explicit sendo=\r\nff is not done in the tradition I am familiar with. If one feels uncomforta=\r\nble and wants to send off formally, one can say &quot;OM pitruun yathaasthaanam =\r\nsthaapayaami&quot;.\n \n&gt; Also is it ok to tarpana in the night say 8 or 9 pm?\n \nI=\r\nt is not ideal, but it is better to do sometime than not to do at all.\n \n* =\r\n       *        *\n \nNamaste Ashok,\n \n&gt; &quot;At the end of pitru-tarpanam, the f=\r\nollowing needs to be said in conclusion:\n&gt; &quot;narake=C3=B1u samaste=C3=B1u y=\r\n=C3=A4tan=C3=A4su...&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you clarify the meaning also?\n \nThe verse &quot;n=\r\narakeshu samasteshu&quot; at the end means: &quot;Whoever are stuck in various hells =\r\n(inauspicious realms of existence in which mind can be stuck after death) a=\r\nnd suffering there, I am offering this water for them, thinking of their re=\r\nlief.&quot;. The next 4 verses pray for the relief of relatives, non-relatives a=\r\nnd relatives in previous lives and people born in one&#39;s lineage without spo=\r\nuse/children and all beings of the universe.\n \n*        *        *\n \nNamast=\r\ne Parijat,\n \n&gt; at the same time....narasimha ji told in one of the mails...=\r\n.....\n&gt; &quot;mother knows the best&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; these have removed the misconceptio=\r\nns i had ...\n&gt; \n&gt; what i want to know is when one is devoted to maa why doe=\r\ns she test ??.....\n&gt; is it a way to bring one closer to her through realiza=\r\ntions ??...\n&gt; \n&gt; when shes the all pervading shakti....why thers a need for=\r\n test ??....also...\n&gt; while testing does she give her child &gt; enuff\n&gt; stren=\r\ngth to pass the test ??\n&gt; \n&gt; i am looking forward to guidance from u people=\r\n...\n \nWords come with baggage and may mean different things to different pe=\r\nople depending on their life experiences and outlook in life.
