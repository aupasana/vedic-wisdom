Three dimensional sou=\r\nnd: viz, Sruti (Pitch) in X-axis, position of letters in Y-axis  and Svara =\r\n(Intonation) in Z-axis is perfectly positioned through out.\n\n2. Normally, i=\r\nn any audio, two voices will be merged and channellised in both the  speake=\r\nrs. Here, we are giving the two voices separately, instrumental music is  p=\r\nlaced as a background to the voices, to demonstrate and highlight, the voic=\r\ne  synchronization and clarity, and to feel live experience of recitation. =\r\n\n\n3. The pitch (Sruti) is maintained throughout, which is very rare. \n\n4. Y=\r\nou will be delighted to note the depth, punch, aggressiveness with force, c=\r\nlarity  and breathless recitation, though the words are very long and diffi=\r\ncult to recite.\n\n5. You can feel the Jeeva (that is life) in all recitation=\r\n, since it is coming from Nabhi  (that is abdomen) of the person who recite=\r\ns this. \n\n\nhttp://www.ghanapati.com/book-abroad.html\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\nI just finished list=\r\nening to the 1st CD&#39;s demo and I tell you this is something above normal,so=\r\n enjoy this super holy stuff.\nHari: Om.\n\n\n"}}
