And that too based=\r\n on astrology? \n\nIf you want spiritual progress alone, forget astrologicall=\r\ny trying to judge \nspiritual things for some time and=C2=A0focus only on ho=\r\nmas. Meditate more when the \nfire is burning. Try and make sure that the up=\r\nperpart of your body is as still \nas possible when the performing the homa/=\r\nmeditating. Keep the spinal cord \nstraight. Only movement should be hand mo=\r\nvements for ahutis. Discipline your \nself into following this, even if the =\r\nmind wavers here and there. Eventually it \nwill bear good result. Additiona=\r\nlly, if you want, then whenever you sit on the \nfloor try and sit with your=\r\n back straight. This can slowly become a habit.\n\nI can tell you my personal=\r\n experiences when I had started homas for the first \ntime. Before that I ha=\r\nd been chanting a certain mantra of Bhairava for nearly a \nyear. Then I dec=\r\nided to experiment with fire rituals. This was in 2007. I did \nnot know Nar=\r\nasimha or Manish or even the existence of this forum. Till then I \nhad seen=\r\n only one homa in my whole life, a priest was performing a Vishnu homa \nand=\r\n I was sitting in the crowd of people.\n\nSo without much of an idea of how t=\r\no go about things, I bought an iron kunda \nfrom a blacksmith, got some wood=\r\n, some ghee and started of with the experiments \nof giving ahutis of the Bh=\r\nairava mantra in fire.=C2=A0Around my 11th homa, while it \nwas going on, I =\r\nfelt a sudden pain in my leg. The heat of the fire had singed my \nleg. I wa=\r\ns sitting exactly at the same distance from the fire as I had always \nsat a=\r\nnd I still sit. I got up from the homa, there was a little bit of pain, I \n=\r\nignored it. A day later the leg started swelling, next day it turned blue a=\r\nnd \nthe 4th day I could not walk. My friends took me to a local doctor who =\r\n\nimmediately cut open the skin and started digging out the flesh with a sca=\r\nlpel, \nwithout anesthesia. I was screaming like mad from pain. He advised t=\r\nhat I should \nbe taken to a bigger hospital immediately. The doctors there =\r\ndecided I needed an \noperation. Obviously, I was very scared and had=C2=A0n=\r\no clue what was happening and \nwhy it was happening. I started praying ment=\r\nally, eventually a senior doctor \ncame and said he would use some intravene=\r\nous antibiotics and see for a couple of \nhours if there is any improvement.=\r\n If not, operation is a must. Thankfully it \nworked, but I had to stay in t=\r\nhe hospital for 4 days and for the next one month \nI could not walk properl=\r\ny.=C2=A0 I have a permanent mark on my right leg from that \nincident.\n\nAfte=\r\nr that I did not go close to the homa kunda for a few months. However, I \nl=\r\nove fire and fire rituals. Eventually I came across this forum and with som=\r\ne \nguidance from Narasimha I started doing Bhairava homas again. But I kept=\r\n doing \nit in an iron kunda. After sometime=C2=A0suddenly one day during ho=\r\nma I found myself \nsurrounded by spiders and scorpions. This was quite dist=\r\nurbing, specifically \nbecause I have a dislike for spiders. Then a thought =\r\ncame to me that I must \nchange the homa kunda. I bought a copper one and ev=\r\nerything was fine from that \nday onwards. \n\n\nAfter I had completed my 85th =\r\nhoma of Bhairava, I was sitting at night and \nmeditating. I saw something -=\r\n or maybe my mind projected something - which \nalmost kept me transfixed fo=\r\nr half an hour. I could not get up from my seat even \nif I wanted to. That =\r\ntime I also got a thought very strongly that I must stop \nthe Bhairava homa=\r\ns for now and worship a female deity. About 15 days from that \nexperience, =\r\nI got a call from Manish for the first time. He told me was to stop \nthe Bh=\r\nairava homas immediately and start Chandipath. He said, &quot;you have been \ndai=\r\nling His (Bhairava&#39;s) number, line lag gya hai, but you are just not prepar=\r\ned \nto take His energy&quot;. If Bhairava appears infornt of you, you may get a =\r\ncomplete \nnervous breakdown. Then slowly I started Chandi homas with Manish=\r\n&#39;s guidance. \nLater on I have done Bhairava homas and had good meditations.=\r\n I still sit at the \nsame distance from the fire, and often light a huge fi=\r\nre, but never did I \nexperience anything like what I went through=C2=A0afte=\r\nr the=C2=A0first few Bhairava homas.\n\nThe point is simple. An Ugra deity=C2=\r\n=A0can test you to your limits. A milder \ndeity=C2=A0won&#39;t test you to the =\r\nlimits. A deity knows very well where you limit \nlies.=C2=A0There is a joll=\r\ny good reason why our Rishis have classified different \ndeities differently=\r\n. And Baglamukhi or Narasimha are very ugra forms. It is not \nthat there ar=\r\nn&#39;t people who worship these forms, but you or I may not be able to \ndo it.=\r\n It is=C2=A0better to choose what is practical and doable.\n\nPatience is ver=\r\ny important. Unless you have done at least 108 homas of Ganapati, \nwhat is =\r\nthe use of shifting to another form? And if you have done 108, then \nfocus =\r\non making each homa to be a unique experience. Meditate more, extent the \nh=\r\noma for a longer period. Try out doing a 2/3 hours Ganapati homa when you c=\r\nan \nfind time. See the effects yourself. Give more than one supari in the h=\r\noma.=C2=A0 In \none shot Ganapati=C2=A0can take your normal=C2=A0mind to a d=\r\nifferent plane completely. The \nganas are the sense inputs, and=C2=A0Ganapa=\r\nti is the lord of these. He can cut off \nthe sense inputs and pull the mind=\r\n inwards very easily. \n\n\nDecide what is most convenient for you. But unders=\r\ntand the facts involved before \nexperimenting. Achieve some success/communi=\r\non in the worship of one form=C2=A0before \nyou decide to move on to another=\r\n. \n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi=C2=A0\n\nBazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.=\r\n\nHota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n=C2=A0\nEk khel hain aurang-e-sulema=\r\nan mere nazdeek\nEk baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n\n\n\n\n_________________=\r\n_______________\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com\nSent: Sun, 27 March, 2011 8:20:27 PM\nSubject: RE: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: Whats Wrong With Homam???\n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Utpal,\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Though in=\r\ntentions for specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not\n&gt; known, I bel=\r\nieve that it was for some or the other Saatwik desire\n=C2=A0\nIf the intenti=\r\nons are &quot;not known&quot;, then how can one &quot;believe&quot; one way or the \nother? :-)\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nMy comments were generic and not just direct=\r\ned at Biswajit.

He got it from some source \n&gt;and st=\r\narted giving Ahutis with the Mantra during his Maha-Ganapati Homam. As he \n=\r\n&gt;has written, First day he had troubles in office and 2nd day his bike was =\r\nstolen \n&gt;resulting in his shaken confidence due to obvious worries. \n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Looking at the situation, IMHO, it is very early to think about stopping t=\r\nhe \n&gt;same. Though intentions for specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi i=\r\ns not \n&gt;known, I believe that it was for some or the other Saatwik desire (=\r\nEven it may \n&gt;have been mundane and not speeding up spiritual progress). Al=\r\nso, it defies the \n&gt;logic to attach incidences to Homam with experiences of=\r\n just a couple of days. \n&gt;\n&gt; For that matter, even Maha-Ganapati Homam was =\r\nnot easy if I take my own \n&gt;personal experiences. I have chiefly performed =\r\nMaha-Ganapati Homas as well as \n&gt;Chandi homas and I have had many set backs=\r\n and some good things as well but \n&gt;again those are all part & parcel of li=\r\nfe. Even without Homam, one may \n&gt;experience such dualistic situations. \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand your insistence and your prudent advice to worship Soumya=\r\n Devatas \n&gt;and I agree to your logic which is most probably out of your exp=\r\neriences, \n&gt;however I also think that Ugra Devata should not be that fearfu=\r\nl while Soumya \n&gt;Devatas are not that Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all ab=\r\nout attraction/liking \n&gt;for a particular deity. It is my personal view that=\r\n one needs to decide upon a \n&gt;Homam of a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ug=\r\nra-Soumya in external Nature) to \n&gt;which one feels most attracted and then =\r\nforget about the rest. It would be a \n&gt;destabilizing effect on mind of a pe=\r\nrson to start judging and relating day to \n&gt;day experiences with homam. The=\r\n chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi or \n&gt;Krishna or Shiva or Hanum=\r\nan or any other deity. Once person starts surrendering \n&gt;to the chosen deit=\r\ny, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts going wrong, \n&gt;one need not =\r\ndespair and should keep faith till it is impossible because if God \n&gt;exist,=\r\n there never would be a breaking point and that holds true for all of us \n&gt;=\r\nwhether we have families to look after or not. \n&gt;\n&gt; I completely tend to ag=\r\nree and hence repeat for benefits of others that \n&gt;Ganapati is not a Lower =\r\ndevata. He is capable of everything. If one has a great \n&gt;liking for him, o=\r\nne can keep on performing his homam without need of switching. \n&gt;Actually t=\r\no switch from Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT changing \n&gt;of =\r\nLevels (especially from Lower to upper) which some may think. \n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best =\r\nRegards, \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR =\r\nRao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The point raised by Bis=\r\nwajit is a genuine one. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress requires freedom from =\r\nthe burden of some key blocking \n&gt; &gt; karmas. One way to be free from a karm=\r\na is to experience the reaction to \n&gt; &gt; it in full (in due course of time).=\r\n Another way is to burn it in \n&gt; &gt; sadhana. When one meditates or helps peo=\r\nple or engages in various \n&gt; &gt; spiritual practices also, some karmas are ge=\r\ntting burnt and being taken \n&gt; &gt; off one&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like =\r\nhomam accelerate that process. \n&gt; &gt; Homam of ugra devatas accelerates it fu=\r\nrther. The distinction is between \n&gt; &gt; soumya devatas and ugra devatas is a=\r\n very important one. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I gave this analogy a few times before. Supp=\r\nose there is a basket \n&gt; &gt; containing fruits (your karmas). Suppose a good =\r\nfruit (good karma) is \n&gt; &gt; stuck under some rotten fruits (bad karmas). Whe=\r\nn you do sadhana, the \n&gt; &gt; deity (personification of certain good qualities=\r\n within you, which are \n&gt; &gt; being=C2=A0 strengthened as you do the sadhana)=\r\n re-arranges the kaarmik \n&gt; &gt; pipeline. In terms of the analogy, some rotte=\r\nn fruits are taken out and \n&gt; &gt; thrown in garbage and the good fruit is giv=\r\nen to you to eat. If this is \n&gt; &gt; done slowly and carefully, it takes longe=\r\nr to take the good fruit out, \n&gt; &gt; but the spillage of rotten fruit pieces =\r\non the floor is minimized. This \n&gt; &gt; is the way of soumya devatas (gentle d=\r\neities). If this is done fast and \n&gt; &gt; aggressively, the good fruit comes o=\r\nut faster, but the spillage of \n&gt; &gt; rotten fruit pieces is more. This is th=\r\ne way of ugra devatas (fierce \n&gt; &gt; deities). It is a tradeoff. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I recommended before, those who want their mate=\r\nrial life to go \n&gt; &gt; smoothly and not in a hurry for spiritual progress sho=\r\nuld stick to \n&gt; &gt; soumya devatas. Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vishnu, Kr=\r\nishna etc can \n&gt; &gt; be worshipped in fire. Once one starts worshipping fierc=\r\ne forms like \n&gt; &gt; Chandi, Durga, Narasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, =\r\nespecially in \n&gt; &gt; fire, things CAN be too fast for them to handle. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; In fact, it is a good idea to just stick to Ganapathi homam for a few \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; months, before starting to worship any other deity. There is no need to =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; be in a hurry to &quot;graduate&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else.

No knowledge \n&gt; &gt; that enables=\r\n one to win court cases or defeat enemies or to get other \n&gt; &gt; temporary ma=\r\nterial results can be termed as &quot;supreme&quot; knowledge. \n&gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are fa=\r\nr more serious. They stand for different aspects of the \n&gt; &gt; knowledge of S=\r\nelf, which is the only supreme knowledge. They are the \n&gt; &gt; liberating form=\r\ns of the divine Mother. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most people on earth today are unready fo=\r\nr their worship. People today \n&gt; &gt; need deities who can take care of materi=\r\nal things and give some push \n&gt; &gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serious liberatin=\r\ng forces such as Mahavidyas are \n&gt; &gt; inappropriate for one who worries abou=\r\nt little things. I mean no \n&gt; &gt; disrespect - worrying about little things i=\r\ns not unusual for most people \n&gt; &gt; and is ok - but then think twice before =\r\nworshipping Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; especially in a fruitful medium such as fire. =\r\nFire amplifies the impact \n&gt; &gt; of the mantra and surrounding thoughts on th=\r\ne subtle body and \n&gt; &gt; accelerates the results, compared to normal meditati=\r\non. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Consider the above words carefully =\r\nand skip ugra devatas and Mahavidyas, \n&gt; &gt; atleast for a while in the begin=\r\nning. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, in the beginning, some mistakes may be made. Just as =\r\nShiva drank \n&gt; &gt; the poison that came out first during the churning of milk=\r\ny ocean, Guru \n&gt; &gt; gives protection in the beginning. If you have a spiritu=\r\nal guru, think \n&gt; &gt; of him/her before the homam. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t, yo=\r\nu may think of me or my guru Dr Manish Pandit. Better \n&gt; &gt; yet, think of Sh=\r\nri Tembe Swami (Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati Maharaj), \n&gt; &gt; Shri Gulwani Ma=\r\nharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman Rao Dattatreya Gulwani), Shri \n&gt; &gt; Nakhate Mahara=\r\nj and Manish Pandit. That is my Guru parampara. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, you ca=\r\nn also think of Dattatreya or Krishna or Shiva as your \n&gt; &gt; guru based on y=\r\nour inclination. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards, \n&gt; &gt; Narasimha \n&gt; &gt; --------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yoursel=\r\nf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: \n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam10=\r\n8 \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Mar 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM, biswa108 wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 NAMASKAR \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, got the point... but my point is W=\r\nhether I am ready for burning \n&gt; &gt; kermik debit with this kind of speed... =\r\nI am a family man after all... \n&gt; &gt; It would not be a problem at all if I a=\r\nm a Sadhu... but I am not, I have \n&gt; &gt; some responsibilitis (Rnabandhana) l=\r\neft for my family...

Meditate more when the fire is burning. Try and make sure=\r\n that the upperpart of your body is as still as possible when the performin=\r\ng the homa/meditating. Keep the spinal cord straight. Only movement should =\r\nbe hand movements for ahutis. Discipline your self into following this, eve=\r\nn if the mind wavers here and there. Eventually it will bear good result. A=\r\ndditionally, if you want, then whenever you sit on the floor try and sit wi=\r\nth your back straight. This can slowly become a habit.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I can tell you my personal experiences when I had started homas fo=\r\nr the first time. Before that I had been chanting a certain mantra of Bhair=\r\nava for nearly a year. Then I decided to experiment with fire rituals. This=\r\n was in 2007. I did not know Narasimha or Manish or even the existence of t=\r\nhis forum. Till then I had seen only one homa in my whole life, a priest wa=\r\ns performing a Vishnu homa and I was sitting in the crowd of people.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So without much of an idea of how to go about things=\r\n, I bought an iron kunda from a blacksmith, got some wood, some ghee and st=\r\narted of with the experiments of giving ahutis of the Bhairava mantra in fi=\r\nre.&nbsp;Around my 11th homa, while it was going on, I felt a sudden pain i=\r\nn my leg. The heat of the fire had singed my leg. I was sitting exactly at =\r\nthe same distance from the fire as I had always sat and I still sit. I got =\r\nup from the homa, there was a little bit of pain, I ignored it. A day later=\r\n the leg started swelling, next day it turned blue and the 4th day I could =\r\nnot walk. My friends took me to a local doctor who immediately cut open the=\r\n skin and started digging out the flesh with a scalpel, without anesthesia.=\r\n I was screaming like mad from pain. He advised that I should be taken to a=\r\n bigger hospital immediately. The doctors there decided I needed an operati=\r\non. Obviously, I was very scared and had&nbsp;no clue what was happening an=\r\nd why it\n was happening. I started praying mentally, eventually a senior do=\r\nctor came and said he would use some intraveneous antibiotics and see for a=\r\n couple of hours if there is any improvement. If not, operation is a must. =\r\nThankfully it worked, but I had to stay in the hospital for 4 days and for =\r\nthe next one month I could not walk properly.&nbsp; I have a permanent mark=\r\n on my right leg from that incident.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After tha=\r\nt I did not go close to the homa kunda for a few months. However, I love fi=\r\nre and fire rituals. Eventually I came across this forum and with some guid=\r\nance from Narasimha I started doing Bhairava homas again. But I kept doing =\r\nit in an iron kunda. After sometime&nbsp;suddenly one day during homa I fou=\r\nnd myself surrounded by spiders and scorpions. This was quite disturbing, s=\r\npecifically because I have a dislike for spiders. Then a thought came to me=\r\n that I must change the homa kunda. I bought a copper one and everything wa=\r\ns fine from that day onwards. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After I had com=\r\npleted my 85th homa of Bhairava, I was sitting at night and meditating. I s=\r\naw something - or maybe my mind projected something - which almost kept me =\r\ntransfixed for half an hour. I could not get up from my seat even if I want=\r\ned to. That time I also got a thought very strongly that I must stop the Bh=\r\nairava homas for now and worship a female deity. About 15 days from that ex=\r\nperience, I got a call from Manish for the first time. He told me was to st=\r\nop the Bhairava homas immediately and start Chandipath. He said, &quot;you have =\r\nbeen dailing His (Bhairava&#39;s) number, line lag gya hai, but you are just no=\r\nt prepared to take His energy&quot;. If Bhairava appears infornt of you, you may=\r\n get a complete nervous breakdown. Then slowly I started Chandi homas with =\r\nManish&#39;s guidance. Later on I have done Bhairava homas and had good meditat=\r\nions. I still sit at the same distance from the fire, and often light a hug=\r\ne fire, but never did I experience anything like\n what I went through&nbsp;=\r\nafter the&nbsp;first few Bhairava homas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The p=\r\noint is simple. An Ugra deity&nbsp;can test you to your limits. A milder de=\r\nity&nbsp;won&#39;t test you to the limits. A deity knows very well where you li=\r\nmit lies.&nbsp;There is a jolly good reason why our Rishis have classified =\r\ndifferent deities differently. And Baglamukhi or Narasimha are very ugra fo=\r\nrms. It is not that there arn&#39;t people who worship these forms, but you or =\r\nI may not be able to do it. It is&nbsp;better to choose what is practical a=\r\nnd doable.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Patience is very important. Unless =\r\nyou have done at least 108 homas of Ganapati, what is the use of shifting t=\r\no another form? And if you have done 108, then focus on making each homa to=\r\n be a unique experience. Meditate more, extent the homa for a longer period=\r\n. Try out doing a 2/3 hours Ganapati homa when you can find time. See the e=\r\nffects yourself. Give more than one supari in the homa.&nbsp; In one shot G=\r\nanapati&nbsp;can take your normal&nbsp;mind to a different plane completely=\r\n. The ganas are the sense inputs, and&nbsp;Ganapati is the lord of these. H=\r\ne can cut off the sense inputs and pull the mind inwards very easily. &lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Decide what is most convenient for you. But unders=\r\ntand the facts involved before experimenting. Achieve some success/communio=\r\nn in the worship of one form&nbsp;before you decide to move on to another. =\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Verdana; COLOR: navy; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D=\r\n#000000 face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: #000066&quot; cl=\r\nass=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: medium&quot; class=3DApple-styl=\r\ne-span&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#a2a2a2 size=3D3&gt;Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aag=\r\ne.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: #000066&quot; cl=\r\nass=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: medium&quot; class=3DApple-styl=\r\ne-span&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#a2a2a2&gt;Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha me=\r\nre aage&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR:=\r\n #000066&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: medium&quot; class=\r\n=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: #000099&quot; class=3DApple-style-span=\r\n&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: small&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: medium&quot; class=3DApp=\r\nle-style-span&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: #999999&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT size=3D3&gt;Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;=\r\n/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: medium&quot; class=3DApple-style-spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: #999999&quot; class=3DApple-style-span&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3=\r\n&gt;Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN=\r\n&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york=\r\n, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2p=\r\nx solid; MARGIN: 5px 0px 5px 5px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; FONT-FAMILY: times new=\r\n roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTaho=\r\nma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-W=\r\nEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Sun, 27 March, 2011 8:20:27 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; RE: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Whats =\r\nWrong With Homam???&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=\r\n=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;Dear Utpal,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=\r\n=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&gt; Though intentions for spec=\r\nifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is not&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&gt; known, I believe that it=\r\n was for some or the other Saatwik desire&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=\r\n=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;If the intentions are=\r\n &quot;not known&quot;, then how can one &quot;believe&quot; one way or the other? :-)&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerda=\r\nna&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=\r\n=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00=\r\n0000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;My comments were generic and not just directed=\r\n at Biswajit. There are a lot of people worshipping Mahavidyas without a go=\r\nod understanding. Even if one believes one is doing a sadhana for a &quot;saatwi=\r\nk desire&quot;, any attachments one has at the mundane level can affect one&#39;s in=\r\ntentions at the sub-conscious level!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT c=\r\nolor=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dlef=\r\nt&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;Moreover, the question is n=\r\not just of whether the desire is saattwik or not, but of whether one is rea=\r\ndy for a specific path for fulfilling that desire.

Ultimately, it is all about attraction/liking for a particu=\r\nlar deity. It is my personal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of =\r\na deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which =\r\none feels most attracted and then forget about the rest. It would be a dest=\r\nabilizing effect on mind of a person to start judging and relating day to d=\r\nay experiences with homam. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi =\r\nor Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any other deity. Once person starts surre=\r\nndering to the chosen deity, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts go=\r\ning wrong, one need not despair and should keep faith till\n it is impossibl=\r\ne because if God exist, there never would be a breaking point and that hold=\r\ns true for all of us whether we have families to look after or not. &lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana&gt;&gt;=\r\n I completely tend to agree and hence repeat for benefits of others that Ga=\r\nnapati is not a Lower devata.
