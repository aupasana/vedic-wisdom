What will be our condition if we were tested b=\r\ny The Mother? Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; You have passionately raised some question=\r\ns in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thing i wish to pin poi=\r\nnt and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes gives to follower of=\r\n Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which is ver=\r\ny popular on TV, Media and having a great many followers, enjoys sexual ple=\r\nasures but at the same time he preaches the same and does not hide it. If s=\r\nomeone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she=\r\n does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.\n&gt; I whole heartedly respect Ma=\r\nhatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayog=\r\no&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matters. It is a rare=\r\nst of rare frankness for a person of such a stature in society. He really w=\r\nas a Saadhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a big difference between fall of a Popular Spiri=\r\ntual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in=\r\n a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for us, then a (un)spe=\r\nctacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of the whole world is=\r\n even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow to faiths of gener=\r\nal public.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not specific on Satyananda here because i do not know =\r\nif it is really true.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the footage is right, then i fancy here that =\r\nsuch shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma=\r\n. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corruption is finally=\r\n controlled and reduced to very minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kal=\r\ni the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and \n&gt; \n&gt; You have spoken the=\r\n truth. The world today is many times more tempting then say even 100 years=\r\n back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very elavated soul l=\r\nike Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual de=\r\nsires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, i would say that its high time for Big names and even =\r\nBigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or M=\r\nahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Wh=\r\nich is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )\n&gt; \n&gt; It remi=\r\nnds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Van=\r\ndaavi Paule&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Ni=\r\ntyananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation,=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 2) Second, =\r\nhow does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say some sexu=\r\nal ritual?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami,=\r\n and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; We l=\r\nive in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VER=\r\nY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death.

She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have be=\r\ncome so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep=\r\n hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steepe=\r\nd in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to =\r\nbe one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of struggle to overc=\r\nome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake gu=\r\nru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea of running after a g=\r\nuru will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadh=\r\nana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard, fire ca=\r\nn act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10=\r\n, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus\n&gt; &gt; To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste KK,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No matt=\r\ner how genuine the video may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Para=\r\nmahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as someone said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a remind=\r\ner that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

Hindu newspaper which is praised by normal people as unbiased=\r\n\n was writing articles every day with so called details of misgivings at th=\r\ne ashram....Sense a pattern ...That is the media war of modern India contro=\r\nlled by vested interests who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulte=\r\nd.Also stakeholders in this drama are the missionary orgs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.In Nith=\r\nyananda&#39; s defense he never said he was god . He also never encouraged one =\r\nto turn away from sex. His advice was very simple ...when in the physical a=\r\nct keep it physical.As long as fantasies are not involved it does not becom=\r\ne a addiction. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He could very well be repaying a rna ...or might be =\r\ninvolved in a sexual ritual. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two of his gurus were an old woman and=\r\n a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube video on divine consciou=\r\nsness and feminity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a very =\r\ngood way of explaining higher level truths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What he did or did not d=\r\no is only his karma alone .This does not take away anything from his\n lectu=\r\nres or messages.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are=\r\n prepared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be prepa=\r\nred when the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share of the=\r\n karma others committed and also will be judged quite harshly when our turn=\r\n comes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Vemparla Ram Kishore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste=\r\n Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha aptly worte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;No =\r\nmatter how much one has read, no matter how much one has &gt;understood, no=\r\n matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how &gt;many good karmas o=\r\nne has done, no matter what spiritual experiences &gt;one had, no matter ho=\r\nw blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt;of the time, no\n matter =\r\nhow elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still fall. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nI learnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s message. What will be our=\r\n condition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ***&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; You have passionately raised some questions in defense and i find not=\r\nhing wrong in it but One thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of =\r\nembarrassment such episodes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may=\r\n not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and =\r\nhaving a great many followers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time=\r\n he preaches the same and does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime kno=\r\nwledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weaknes=\r\ns, it is a gross.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one s=\r\nense. He was extremely truthful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weak=\r\nness and his struggles on sexual matters. It is a rarest of\n rare frankness=\r\n for a person of such a stature in society. He really was a Saadhu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a big difference between fall of a Popular Spiritual Mas=\r\nter and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debat=\r\ne against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for us, then a (un)spectacular=\r\n fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of the whole world is even bi=\r\ngger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow to faiths of general publi=\r\nc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not specific on Satyananda here because i do not k=\r\nnow if it is really true.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If the footage is right, then i =\r\nfancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear=\r\n Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corru=\r\nption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twi=\r\nsted and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; You have spoken the truth.\n The world today is m=\r\nany times more tempting then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a =\r\nmarried person (Even for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes bac=\r\nk) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fina=\r\nlly, i would say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Sp=\r\niritual Masters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s =\r\nbold approach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of t=\r\nhe* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It reminds =\r\nme of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi V=\r\nandaavi Paule&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wro=\r\nte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. =\r\nThere are some questions one has to ask here:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation,=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;is a VERY questionable organization.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not =\r\npractising say some sexual ritual?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3=\r\n) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has s=\r\nex with someone?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We live in such tim=\r\nes where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advanced soul=\r\ns to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who might hav=\r\ne been brahmacharis in all previous births, would=C3=82&nbsp;probably=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp; not be able to remain so when born in thid age=C3=82&nbsp;is a simpl=\r\ne fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from othe=\r\nr\n yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have be=\r\ncome so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep=\r\n hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steepe=\r\nd in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - w=\r\nhom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of=\r\n struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible tha=\r\nt Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to=\r\n come, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God=\r\n as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best p=\r\nossible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps=\r\n doing\n homas for some years. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rega=\r\nrds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Take away the me, s=\r\no only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, =\r\nNarasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:v=\r\nedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste KK,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the =\r\nvideo may look, let us give the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda=\r\n and not jump to conclusions as someone said.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine, it=\r\n is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

Irrespective of his weaknesses that may have been expo=\r\nsed now, he is clearly a man of excellent knowledge and rare wisdom.

Take your mind off god =\r\nfor a second and you CAN fall. When we are not in a state where mind is foc=\r\nused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall.

There may be some members of this group who make=\r\n good progress in the coming years and people around them may start noticin=\r\ng their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by =\r\nname, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of =\r\na dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one =\r\nallows self-consciousness, ego and pride to\n take root in one&#39;s mind, one t=\r\nhing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Even if a spiritual master rea=\r\nlly had weaknesses and fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing tho=\r\nse weaknesses. If we instead discuss his teachings, we may still benefit. A=\r\n blue sky does not suddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is b=\r\nlue.
