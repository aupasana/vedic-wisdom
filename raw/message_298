In p=\r\nurusha suktam also it mentions God alone is Prabhu(lord) of bhoot(past) and=\r\n bhavya(future)..\nSo with these statements in mind can&#39;t we conclude that e=\r\nverybody&#39;s destiny is fixed by God according to his karmas? Now if my desti=\r\nny is fixed why should I bother if a particular day is auspicious or not, o=\r\nr the girl will be my perfect match or no. \nCan&#39;t I just concentrate on my =\r\nKarmas and leave the rest to God?  What is the relevance of Jyotish Shastra=\r\n in this point view? Why should I bother about Jyotish at all?\nI am convinc=\r\ned that you are the best person to answer these questions. Please find for =\r\nme some time in your busy schedule to answer this burning question of mine.=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nThis is a good question. It is a loaded philosophical question and one=\r\n that many may have. Though I addressed such questions in the past, I sense=\r\n that I may be able to give an inspired answer on this auspicious day. I wi=\r\nll hence spend a little time trying to put my thoughts into elaborate words=\r\n and cover various aspects related to this question. At the end, I may not =\r\nanswer your question fully or satisfactorily, but I will hopefully have pen=\r\nned some useful thoughts. Hoping you won&#39;t mind, I am cc&#39;ing this mail to a=\r\n few yahoogroups related to Jyotisha and spirituality.\n\nThis mail is a litt=\r\nle long, as I will cover a few different things and try to put them in pers=\r\npective.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBrief Answer\n\nFirst let me give the brief an=\r\nswer. If you can indeed concentrate on your Karmas (actions) and leave the =\r\nrest to God and if you can accept with an equal vision any results (fruits)=\r\n that your karmas may bring, then you are a liberated soul. Jyotisha shastr=\r\na is indeed irrelavent to you. But there are very few people who are like t=\r\nhat. For others, it is still relevant.\n\nNow let me give the long-winded ans=\r\nwer.\n\n*        *        *\n\nNature of Self\n\nWhen someone has a dream, one ma=\r\ny experience many objects of various attributes and qualities in the dream.=\r\n Do those objects exist in reality? No. All those objects and various inter=\r\nactions between those objects are unreal - they exist fictionally within th=\r\ne mind. Only the mind exists in reality and no other objects. Still, during=\r\n the course of a dream, the mind is under the illusion that all these objec=\r\nts exist outside of it. All those objects obey the rules conjured by the mi=\r\nnd that is dreaming.\n\nThis whole creation is basically like that. All being=\r\ns are but Brahman. Upanishads and vedanta teach that there is Brahman and n=\r\nothing or nobody else in this universe. There is no &quot;self&quot; and &quot;other&quot;. All=\r\n is self. However, a part of Brahman becomes deluded and forms a self-ident=\r\nity and entertains an illusion that there is an &quot;I&quot; and the &quot;other&quot;. This f=\r\nirst being is the supreme being (known by various names such as Sadashiva, =\r\nNarayana, Krishna, Mahaganapathi, Savita etc).\n\nWhen the supreme being imag=\r\nines the existence of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva etc to play various roles in th=\r\nis universe and imagines various beings that make this universe up, all tho=\r\nse beings come into being (just like the objects in someone&#39;s dream). Just =\r\nas the objects in a dream obey the rules conjured up by the dreamer in his =\r\ndream, the beings of this universe obey the rules of the game imagined by t=\r\nhe supreme being. Each being experiences various other beings and other obj=\r\nects in this universe because of the spell of delusion that he/she is under=\r\n. When one realizes the delusionary nature of this spell, one can break fre=\r\ne from it.\n\nBut a normal person is not aware of all this. One&#39;s senses simp=\r\nly perceive so many different objects and one entertains various notions wi=\r\nth respect to those objects. All these notions become very firmly establish=\r\ned in one&#39;s consciousness after many births and it is difficult to overcome=\r\n those notions. Some objects give pleasure and some give pain, some are fou=\r\nnd attractive and some are repulsive, some are considered good and some bad=\r\n. And so on. The field that is experienced by one, i.e. the field in which =\r\nall these objects of opposite qualities exist, is known as the &quot;field of du=\r\nality&quot; or &quot;maayaa&quot; (delusion).\n\n*        *        *\n\nOvercoming the Delusio=\r\nn\n\nOvercoming this delusion and rising above the limited perception of the =\r\nsenses and realizing that all the beings that seem to exist are like dream =\r\nobjects imagined by the supreme being, i.e. that there is nothing but the s=\r\nupreme being in this universe, is not easy.\n\nSaying &quot;all is Brahman and the=\r\n objects we perceive are all Brahman only&quot; is easy. Even understanding it a=\r\nt an intellectual level may be easy. But a perfect and unshakable understan=\r\nding of it is not difficult.\n\nLet us see an analogy. Suppose one goes to a =\r\nmovie. Some events unfold on the movie screen and they seem to really happe=\r\nn. However, they are not real events. It is just fake and manipulated. The =\r\ncharacters in the movie are not real. However, some people take the events =\r\non the screen seriously and react strongly. Good happenings on the screen m=\r\nake them elated and scary moments on the screen shake them up. There may be=\r\n someone with an intellectual understanding that the movie is not real and =\r\nyet one specific scene that may get him/her. For example, one may shiver wi=\r\nth shock in a scene despite the intellectual understanding that it is not r=\r\neal. Intellectual understanding does not give full control over instincts.\n=\r\n\nSimilarly, one with only an intellectual understanding that all is Brahman=\r\n does not have full control over the mind. The instincts, sense organs and =\r\nvarious aspects of mind sometimes run like a mad monkey, away from the unde=\r\nrstanding that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. One may feel happy about some things, feel=\r\n sad about some things, become attracted to some things and become repelled=\r\n by some things. A perfect, permanent and unshakable understanding that all=\r\n is Brahman is much more difficult to obtain than a mere intellectual under=\r\nstanding.\n\nIt requires dismantling the formidable fort of delusion made of =\r\nthe walls of mental conditioning formed by the bricks of sense experiences =\r\nthat are joined by the cement of logic and analysis. These walls are fortif=\r\nied over many many lives and make the fort quite formidable.\n\nThis is a lon=\r\ng process involving many steps. There are different practices designed to f=\r\nacilitate this in different religious/spiritual paths. There is no foolproo=\r\nf algorithm to ensure this process. There are only guidelines.\n\nAll is Brah=\r\nman and all the duality is arising from the Supreme Being. All of one&#39;s act=\r\nions are actually occurring due to the will of Supreme Being only. The resu=\r\nlts/fruits (good or bad) of one&#39;s actions may be viewed as the reactions by=\r\n Nature to one&#39;s actions and they too are due to the will of Supreme Being.=\r\n Thus, everything that happens is due to the will of Supreme Being. If one =\r\nperson remains in ignorance, keeps on taking a rebirth and keeps going thro=\r\nugh good and terrible experiences, it is all the will of Supreme Being. If =\r\none says &quot;it is all the will of Supreme Being. I am doing nothing&quot; just for=\r\n the heck of it and yet continues to have an egotism (self-identication wit=\r\nh a body or name or personality or some object), continues various actions =\r\nthrough that ego and continues to receive their fruits and becomes elated b=\r\ny some and depressed by some, it is all through the will of Supreme Being. =\r\nThough the person is saying &quot;Supreme Being does all&quot;, he continues to think=\r\n of an &quot;I&quot; and thinks deeply that &quot;I am doing&quot;. That is why Supreme Being w=\r\nills the persons to receive the appropriate fruits of that action. If anoth=\r\ner person truly understands that Supreme Being knows, wills and does all th=\r\nings, kills &quot;I&quot; completely at the mental level, then that person may seem t=\r\no engage in various actions, but he does not really perform any actions. Wh=\r\nen there is no &quot;I&quot;, there is action and no reaction. Despite moving in the =\r\nmaterial world and doing various actions, that person&#39;s mind is always esta=\r\nblished in bliss. Again, this person has no &quot;I-ness&quot; and hence Supreme Bein=\r\ng wills the person to be in supreme bliss always.\n\nThe subtle lesson I am t=\r\nrying to drive at is: As long as there is an &quot;I-ness&quot; to a person, actions =\r\ntake place and their reactions happen. &quot;All is Brahman. I do not do anythin=\r\ng&quot; is for one who has killed &quot;I-ness&quot; completely. It is not an excuse to do=\r\n anything and get away. Until one completely kills &quot;I-ness&quot;, one has to wat=\r\nch one&#39;s actions to produce good reactions that are conducive to making mor=\r\ne progress.\n\n*        *        *\n\nTwo Types of Knowledge\n\nThe teachings of =\r\nmaharshis in Veda and allied subjects like Vedangas and Vedanta cover essen=\r\ntially two types of knowledge:\n\n(1) Understanding the rules of engagement o=\r\nf the field of duality (maayaa)\n(2) Understanding how the field of duality =\r\nis delusionary and how all is Brahman only\n\nKnowledge of type (2) is essent=\r\nial because eventually the goal of each being is to overcome the delusionar=\r\ny nature of the field of duality and see Brahman in all. However, the probl=\r\nem with 2 is that this knowledge is only realized and not imparted in a ste=\r\np-by-step process. One may read reams about how all is Brahman and seemingl=\r\ny different objects of this universe are a delusion and one may even unders=\r\ntand and appreciate it to some extent intellectually. But it is of not much=\r\n use! Until the realization comes from within and experienced, one continue=\r\ns to be deluded by duality. One may know all the theory, but the mind conti=\r\nnues to be deluded and swayed by duality. When somebody praises one, one ma=\r\ny feel elated. When somebody attacks one, one may feel unhappy. When one fi=\r\nnds something nice, one may be attracted. When one finds something disgusti=\r\nng, one may be repelled. And so on. Please see my previous analogy of a mov=\r\nie.\n\nWhile knowledge of type (2) elaborates why the above behavior is silly=\r\n and describes the thinking and approach of a liberated soul, it is very ve=\r\nry difficult to imbibe such thinking and attitude and become liberated. Eve=\r\nn reading works imparting knowledge of type 2 for a long time does not guar=\r\nantee liberation.\n\nVedangas such as Jyotisha belong to type (1). When one d=\r\noes not realize that the field of duality is a delusion and is swayed by th=\r\ne opposites, then one needs tools to navigate the ocean of opposites. Jyoti=\r\nsh is one such tool. When one&#39;s mind is deeply stuck in duality and has uns=\r\nurmountable &quot;I-ness&quot; and &quot;other-ness&quot; deeply imprinted on it, &quot;all is Brahm=\r\nan. Parama Purusha knows, wills and does all&quot; is a useless concept. From th=\r\ne perspective of that person, one&#39;s &quot;I-ness&quot; does all actions and begets th=\r\ne fruits of those actions based on order set by Parama Purusha. This gives =\r\nhappiness and sadness of great proportions. This cycle of actions and fruit=\r\ns may go on forever, until one&#39;s &quot;I-ness&quot; is killed completely.\n\nSome spiri=\r\ntual sadhana is necessary to kill the &quot;I-ness&quot;. This spiritual sadhana is h=\r\nappening within the field of duality where the mind has a clear &quot;I-ness&quot; an=\r\nd &quot;other-ness&quot;. Thus, the rules of engagement in the field duality apply. S=\r\nubjects like Jyotisha throw light on these rules and they can be helpful. F=\r\nor example, one may start sadhana at a particular time and make swift progr=\r\ness. One may start sadhana at a particular time and encounter many obstacle=\r\ns and stop the sadhana without much progress. One may find the right sadhan=\r\na based on previous samskaras and vasanas from the horoscope. One may find =\r\nout that impending material problem (e.g. job loss or loss of a close relat=\r\nive or a divorce etc) may derail one&#39;s sadhana and take some measures to st=\r\nop it and reduce its magnitude. Thus, Jyotisha can be used to manipulate th=\r\ne field of duality to one&#39;s advantage, as one wades it trying to kill one&#39;s=\r\n &quot;I-ness&quot; and individual will.\n\n*        *         *\n\nOne&#39;s Will vs Other&#39;s=\r\n Will\n\nWhen a scripture says that everything that happens is God&#39;s will, it=\r\n is essentially referring to the supreme being (Parama Purusha) mentioned e=\r\narlier as the God. This Being is the first Being arising from non-dual Brah=\r\nman and the one who conjures up the entire duality. Thus, we are at the bor=\r\nder of non-duality and duality.\n\nDeities who operate completely within dual=\r\nity have their own wills which may clash with each other and clash with our=\r\n will. For example, the will of Yamadharmaraja (yama=3Ddisplicine, dharma =\r\n=3D righteousness, raja =3D ruler) compelled him to kill Markandeya and col=\r\nlided with the will of Markandeyaq who wanted to remain alive and the will =\r\nof Lord Shiva who wanted to save Markendeya. There are many stories where t=\r\nhe will of one deity/being clashed with another&#39;s.\n\nOf course, all these de=\r\nities are different forms of the same Brahman (or, loosely speaking, of Par=\r\nama purusha). The will of Parama Purusha is that one deity&#39;s will should co=\r\nmpel the deity to do X and another deity&#39;s will should compel that deity to=\r\n do Y and something should happen as a result. Everything is indeed the lee=\r\nlaa (play) of the will of Parama Purusha. But we are not at the stage of fa=\r\nthoming the play of Parama Purusha (and his Shakti). All we can say is that=\r\n Parama Purusha&#39;s will is a complex thing. It is in fact the sum total of t=\r\nhe individual wills of all beings of this universe!\n\nAs long as there is &quot;I=\r\n-ness&quot; and individual self-identity left in the mind, there is an individua=\r\nl will. As long as that is the case, one is not liberated. One&#39;s individual=\r\n will facilitates various actions that clash with the wills of various othe=\r\nr beings. It causes various probelms. Basically one acting based on &quot;indivi=\r\ndual will&quot; is in tune with only a small subset of &quot;God&#39;s will&quot;. That person=\r\n is not in tune with the *entire* God&#39;s will.\n\nThus saying &quot;all is God&#39;s wi=\r\nll. I need to do nothing&quot; is not conducive to liberation. It continues bond=\r\nage. Directed effort to kill &quot;I-ness&quot; makes one truly understand that &quot;all =\r\nis God&#39;s will&quot; and drop off one&#39;s individual will.\n\nOnly when &quot;I-ness&quot; is k=\r\nilled and &quot;individual will&quot; is completely evaporated can one be in tune wit=\r\nh the entire &quot;God&#39;s will&quot; (as opposed to a small subset). Then alone can on=\r\ne remain in constant bliss, as an unbound observer of the play of this univ=\r\nerse without any individual agenda or will. THAT is liberation. Such a libe=\r\nrated soul may seem to engage in various actions, but the mind is stable, h=\r\nas no &quot;I-ness&quot; or individual will and is established in constant bliss. Lik=\r\ne a fan may continue to turn for a while after the electricity supply is st=\r\nopped, such a liberated soul may continue to engage in actions based on the=\r\n previous flow, but without any egotism (supply of electricity in the analo=\r\ngy).\n \n*        *        *\n \nI wanted to write a little bit, but ended up w=\r\nriting too much.

The results/fruits (good or bad) of one&#39;s actions may be \nviewe=\r\nd as the reactions by Nature to one&#39;s actions and they too are due to the \n=\r\nwill of Supreme Being.

If one person remains in ignorance, keeps on taking a rebir=\r\nth and \nkeeps going through good and terrible experiences, it is all the wi=\r\nll of Supreme \nBeing.

THAT is liberation. \nSuch a liberated soul may se=\r\nem to engage in various actions, but the mind is \nstable, has no &quot;I-ness&quot; o=\r\nr individual will and is established in constant bliss. \nLike a fan may con=\r\ntinue to turn for a while after the electricity supply is \nstopped, such a =\r\nliberated soul may continue to engage in actions based on the \nprevious flo=\r\nw, but without any egotism (supply of electricity in the \nanalogy).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I wanted to write=\r\n a little bit, but ended up \nwriting too much.

I am completely ignora=\r\nnt of Jyotish Shastra. &lt;BR&gt;But I am avid \n  reader of spirituality and reli=\r\ngion from very early age.&nbsp; I have seen \n  many a places like Ramayana,=\r\n Mahabharata where God himself has made references \n  to Jyotish for auspic=\r\nious day calculation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have few questions in mind \n  which I am not=\r\n able to find a satisfactory answers from anyone. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There \n  is sayin=\r\ng in Sanskrit &quot;Tena vina truanam api na chalati&quot;&nbsp; means &quot; A blade \n  o=\r\nf grass doesn&#39;t move without his will&quot;. In purusha suktam also it mentions =\r\n\n  God alone is Prabhu(lord) of bhoot(past) and bhavya(future)..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So =\r\nwith \n  these statements in mind can&#39;t we conclude that everybody&#39;s destiny=\r\n is fixed \n  by God according to his karmas? Now if my destiny is fixed why=\r\n should I bother \n  if a particular day is auspicious or not, or the girl w=\r\nill be my perfect match \n  or no. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can&#39;t I just concentrate on my Ka=\r\nrmas and leave the rest to \n  God?&nbsp; What is the relevance of Jyotish S=\r\nhastra in this point view? Why \n  should I bother about Jyotish at all?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;I am convinced that you are the \n  best person to answer these question=\r\ns. Please find for me some time in your \n  busy schedule to answer this bur=\r\nning question of \n  mine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \nRegards,&lt;BR&gt;Pramo=\r\nd.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01B1_01C8B160.429D7010--\r\n\n"}}
