You can also check wi=\r\nth them if CP is available in your &#39;mother Tongue&#39; (Not only translation bu=\r\nt also the verses)\n&gt; \n&gt; If that&#39;s not possible, then you can think of order=\r\ning CP in English by Deva datta Kali.

The link to order is given below:\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Praise-=\r\nGoddess-Devimahatmya-Its-Meaning/dp/089254080X.\n&gt; \n&gt; This book has all the =\r\nverses of Durga Saptashati given in English so that you can read. i also su=\r\nggest to download MP3 from Narasimha&#39;s site where he has himself recorded t=\r\nhe Durga Saptashati in his own voice. That will be very useful to get famil=\r\niarize with Original Sanskrit pronunciation of all the verses.\n&gt; http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt; Click on &#39;Listen to Manta&#39; and you will get to the =\r\nlink of MP3.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please listen many times to get familiarized.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far=\r\n as homam is concerned, add swaha (offering Aahuti at the same time) at the=\r\n end of each verse and Uchu/Uvach. Do not forget to refer to Homam manual a=\r\nnd follow the instructions specifically given for offering Aahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; I =\r\nthink this should be enough to get started.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best of luck.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metll=\r\napalli@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a Durga Saptashati book which has everything=\r\n in story format.Can it be used for doing the chandi homam?
