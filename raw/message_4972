Here is my experiance.\n\nMy first attempt was similar to Ra=\r\njarhi. I was in a zoo. Why family was having lunch and I was waiting and th=\r\nought, instead of sitting idle, I can perform a homam mentally as i could n=\r\not do so in the morning. I lost my way in middle and I did not complete the=\r\n procedure. I told mentally kshamaswa (please tolerate). How ever, I was no=\r\nt really bogged down. \n\nMy second attempt was when I had to travel to anoth=\r\ner town and I did not carry my homam materials. I had plenty of time in the=\r\n morning, and I sat down to do homam mentally. It was very pleasant. Ofcour=\r\nse there are many advantages of doing homam mentally:\n1. I did not need to =\r\nbother about the fire going off and I could imagine sitting in front of a r=\r\neal big fire. If you can sit so that you face Sun, the imagination can be r=\r\neally easy!\n2. Normally, at times, when I offer akshatas as flowers, I feel=\r\n uncomfortable. With mental homam, I could imagine I am actually using all =\r\nthe flowers in the world\n3. Normally, naivedyam is more of routine. It is d=\r\nifficult to imagine the God eating it really. How ever, when it is done men=\r\ntally, I could imagine the God actually eating.\n\nI was tempted to continue =\r\nmental homam even after coming back to home. How ever, the presence of fire=\r\n does have some real impact. The sound of the dry coconut/small wood cracki=\r\nng, the smell and heat are missed when I did the homam mentally. So, I pref=\r\ner an external homam, but, when you can&#39;t do resort to doing the same menta=\r\nlly.\n\nAfterwards, I did mental homam few times while I am in airplane.\n\nSom=\r\ne thing is better than nothing. I remember Narasimha mentioning that he did=\r\n homam mentally in Korea. Do not hesitate to do so.\n\nDon&#39;t worry about not =\r\ncompleting homam. The objective of the homam is to loose your self. If you =\r\nlost your way in middle and get immersed in meditation, it only indicates g=\r\nood. However, when you realise you have not completed homam, you actually h=\r\nave a chance to complete it ;-)\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Utp=\r\nal/Somanath/Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; I have done mental homam (in my own way), however=\r\n as Vimalananda puts it, requires tremendous amount of visualization power =\r\nand connection to your deity!

I have browsed several posts here and I do not know of a=\r\nny \n&gt; &gt; &gt; reference in any traditional shastras, so I have a question regar=\r\nding the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; performance of homam in one&#39;s mind. There must be times in =\r\none&#39;s life when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; several restrictions of time or place or any other r=\r\neasons - do not allow one to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; perform an external homam under the &quot;pe=\r\nrfect&quot; conditions that one would like. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. So how does =\r\none go about this? Does one mentally visualize oneself performing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; al=\r\nl the external rituals from A-Z? What if one&#39;s mind cannot &quot;multi-task&quot; and=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; synchronize the mental recitation of mantras with the mental perfor=\r\nmance of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actions? What if one cannot maintain the same standards of =\r\nexternal environment \n&gt; &gt; &gt; purity, discipline etc? Is it then best to avoi=\r\nd mental homam altogether?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Can one derive the same benefit =\r\nfrom a mental homam that one would derive \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from an external homam?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Could a regular performance of mental homam remove the impedi=\r\nments that is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; blocking one in doing homam in real life and may it re=\r\nsult in one becoming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fortunate enough to carry out real-life homam b=\r\ny the grace of God?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many many Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
