She is the s=\r\num total of the energies of all beings of this universe. Chandi homam is un=\r\nquestionably a very powerful sadhana.\n \nThis ritual can be used for getting=\r\n wealth and health, for success in various wordly matters and for destroyin=\r\ng enemies. However, one performing Chandi homam for such a specific purpose=\r\n needs to meet some exacting demands, such as perfect pronunciation, perfec=\r\nt procedure and perfect materials for the purpose, and have some accumulate=\r\nd spiritual energy to pull off the feat.\n \nNeither is the author an expert =\r\nin performing homam with such an attitude nor does he teach that. This docu=\r\nment is strictly for one who performs Chandi homam for spiritual upliftment=\r\n and looks at the Divine Mother as a mother and looks at oneself as a helpl=\r\ness child who desperately wants to improve. This document is strictly for o=\r\nne who is willing to undergo whatever one&#39;s mother wants one to undergo, fo=\r\nr the sake of spiritual upliftment. \n \nHowever, it is not necessary that Sh=\r\ne should take away one&#39;s material success and prosperity in order to give s=\r\npiritual upliftment. In fact, many people who perform Chandi homam everyday=\r\n or every week using this document may experience continued or even increas=\r\ned material success (and yet be able to remain detached from it and progres=\r\ns spiritually). However, in some cases, She may decide to give a shock or t=\r\nwo in worldly matters if something is badly blocking one&#39;s spiritual progre=\r\nss and a setback is needed. The path towards self-realization is different =\r\nfor each person. She knows the best for each person. Unless one is willing =\r\nto surrender to Her completely and accept whatever comes one&#39;s way - good o=\r\nr bad - as Her blessings and unless one does not expect any specific materi=\r\nal benefit from this homam, one should not use this document to perform Cha=\r\nndi homam.\n \nAgain, as emphasized in the Mahaganapathi homam manual, regula=\r\nrity is the key. Performing a homam once in a while is insufficient. One sh=\r\nould repeat the sadhana daily or weekly. If one performs Chandi homam once =\r\neveryday, it is almost sure to transform one&#39;s attitude and outlook and put=\r\n one&#39;s spiritual evolution on the fast track.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_002A_01C8F33D.ED0BFE80\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3354&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;A brief manual for Chandi homam is now av=\r\nailable \nat&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam/chandi.htm&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam/chandi.htm&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;It builds upon Mahaganapathi homam manual and gives =\r\n\nincremental/differential directions for Chandi homam.
