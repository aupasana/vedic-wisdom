I will add a few more homams slowly.\n\nRegarding yantra:\n\nIf one has a yantra appropriate for the deity of homam, one can place the \nyantra inside the homa kundam (at the bottom). However, I do not consider it \nnecessary. Fire is a powerful enough medium to invoke deities in. It is not \nnecessary to have a yantra in addition.\n\nOf course, if you have a charged yantra that was used by a reasonably pure \nperson for a while in his rituals and you use it as the base of the fire in \nhoma kundam, it can then enhance the divine presence in your homam. It can \nbe helpful. However, it is not easy to find a charged yantra these days. It \nis difficult to know also.\n\nLet me give an analogy. If one is opening a bank account, one can open with \na zero balance and work hard to increase the balance. Or one can also look \nfor someone who will donate $10,000 so that one can open a bank account with \n$10,000 balance at start. But the latter approach creates a distraction and \nthe chance of success is low. So I tell people to forget all of that and \njust open an account with a small balance, keep working hard and save. They \nwill evenutally have enough balance.\n\nThings like using a charged yantra in homa kundam, charged idol in front of \nhoma kundam and getting the main mantra of the homam given by a qualified \nguru in a proper diksha etc are like the latter case in the above analogy. \nOne is better off starting off humbly and working one&#39;s way up. Start the \nritual, surrender to the deity, work on your attitude with constant \nintrospection and just be patient. That is a winning formula.\n\nOf course, you can also use an uncharged yantra. But then, it does not \nreally enhance your homam. It only serves to capture a little bit of the \nenergy generated in your homam and become charged in time. Generating a \ncharged yantra does not help you become purer. On the contrary, some energy \nof the homam is being diverted instead of being used to purify you. \nMoreover, now you have the responsibility of ensuring that the yantra is not \nmisused later by anyone. Not worth it, unless there is someone truly \ndeserving that you want to help by gifting the yantra and giving a head \nstart..\n\nRegarding the comment on Gayatri mantra in Aghora book:\n\nIn general, I found that Vimalananda is to be taken very seriously. He knows \nwhat he says and definitely does not fool around.\n\nHe may be correct. But the standard Savitri Gayatri mantra in Rigveda does \nhave a great effect in purifying one. One need not worry about secrets that \nare not yet revealed to one and instead focus on using what one already has.\n\nRegarding Navagraha homam:\n\nNavagraha homam is more involved and not easy to do everyday. I will \nprobably come to it last. There are others that are more suited for doing \ndaily. Our goal is to create a community of sadhakas who do homam daily with \na reasonably saattwik attitude in different places in India and world.\n\nI was asked to teach homam of kroora grahas like Saturn, Mars, Rahu and Ketu \nbefore teaching a full Navagraha homam, because so many people suffer \nbecause of these planets. I started with Saturn. Homam for one planet is \nreasonable to do daily, while Navagraha homam is more time consuming. But it \nwill come too, eventually.\n\nHoma kunda construction:\n\nAghora book second part (Kundalini) has a very nice section on homam. Please \nrefer to it for homa kunda construction. In general I recommend square and \ncircle shapes only. Square is appropriate for most people for most purposes. \nWhen there is a serious problem and we are doing for relief from it, \ncircular homa kundam is good.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message -----\nAUM SRI SAI RAM\nRespected Sri.Narasimha Rao Garu,\n                                               Greetings from\n&lt;deleted&gt;.At the outset on behalf of thousands of\nbeneficiaries let me offer my sincere thanks to you for the wonderful\npresentation of various homams in the net.It is indeed a very great\nservice in kali yuga & Divine Mother will always have a special share\nof blessings for you.It would be of a great help if you can put on the\nnet,Navagraha homam procedure,Dhanvantari homam,Lalitha homam,Rudra\nhomam & Mrityunjaya homam.With dedicated priests becoming a fading\nrace I feel people now have to gear up for doing fire rituals on their\nown.Also I have some doubts.It is said that the homa kunda should have\na yantra placed inside appropriate to the diety being invoked;your\nkind comments on it.Also I infer that you have gone through\nDr.Svoboda&#39;s Aghora series.In it, it is  mentioned that the real\ngayatri is not known to most,and what is chanted today is the Savitri\nmantra;Your kind comments on it.Now with the Jupiter transit next\nmonth it will not be a bad idea to have a Navagraha homam module from\nyour wonderful gifted hands.Also regarding details of construction of\nvarious types of homa kundams;are there any good resources available?\n\n\n"}}
