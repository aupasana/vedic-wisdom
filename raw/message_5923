One of the nice substances that one can offer in \nhomam fire is a whole fresh coconut. Though dry coconut (copra) can also \nbe offered, normal fresh whole coconut with water in it is a fantastic \nmaterial. Traditionally this is what was offered as poornaahuti \n(symbolic of head, i.e. ego).\n\nBTW, those who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces \nshould ignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in \nfire is practical only for those who do homam with a big fire using logs \nof wood. You want to offer something only if you can fully burn it.\n\nIf a fresh coconut is offered in fire, it will take a while to burn \ncompletely, because it has layers (fiber, shell, white stuff and water \netc, just like our own ego-consciousness!). If one offers it in the end \nof homam, it will be a challenge to make it burn fully.\n\nOne idea is to offer it in the beginning instead of the end, and give it \ntime to burn, as one goes through homam. I, for example, offer a fresh \ncoconut in my daily homam at the end of offerings to Ganapathi at the \nbeginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and offer Chandipath in fire \nwith various offerings. During the course, the fresh coconut burns fully \nand gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having offered a whole fresh \ncoconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell you that it is a very \ngood idea (if and only if it is practical in your case).\n\nOne risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gush at \nyou at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little understanding \nof the dynamics, one should not do this if one is worried about the \ninhury.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
