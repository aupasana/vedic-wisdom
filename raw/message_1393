Rao\nSent: Monday, March 02, 2009 8:09 AM\nSubject: Re: On Remedial Measur=\r\nes Difference (Re: Resolving Points)\n \n\nDear Narasimha,\n \nWhen the sadhaka =\r\neffaces his own personality such that the deity of the mantra comes and occ=\r\nupies him, then at that stage there is \nno real difference between the sadh=\r\naka and the Deity(even if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say=\r\n that there is no real difference).\nThe difference that one feels is as fol=\r\nlows:\nOne feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.\nA few repit=\r\nitions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity possesses the =\r\nsadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa Retas), \nD=\r\nuring all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or hands or face,=\r\n etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details of the room =\r\n(even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\nThe sadhak typically becomes dr=\r\neamless except for suchaka dreams.\nThe whole day the sadhaka behaves like a=\r\n love lorn person. How can i again experience the Beloved.\nThat then is the=\r\n experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\nWhen the sadhak&#39;s personal=\r\nity is effaced such that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak=\r\n experiences himself as that Deity(Devata).\nThere then arises no difference=\r\n in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it wha=\r\nt appears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s p=\r\nersonality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing=\r\n himself, so self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual ev=\r\nolution continues.\nRemember, there is very little according to me which is =\r\nblack magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a highe=\r\nr shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your =\r\npower will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the de=\r\nath of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was o=\r\nriginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these bein=\r\ngs. \nAttacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the head=\r\ns of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( Pat=\r\nan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti caus=\r\ning an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here=\r\n there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, an=\r\nd you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5=\r\n to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with =\r\nthe universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks=\r\n you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification,=\r\n ie God or the universe).\nIf people persist in using the Shakti possesed by=\r\n a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be us=\r\ned, moreover then their minds and intellects will not be free of identifica=\r\ntion with the body and so their actions are those which are generally terme=\r\nd as black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they hav=\r\ne been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\nImagine if s=\r\nomebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birt=\r\nh he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a fe=\r\nw repitions of a mantra(because of his previous effort).\nOn the other hand =\r\nsomebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 thing=\r\ns which bind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.=\r\n\nAccording to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me sugge=\r\nst an easy sadhana.\nIf one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, =\r\ndo 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, but the real =\r\nGayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\nSame time every day.\nSame pl=\r\nace.\nSame materials.\nSame direction.\nAs little movement as one can.\nCount o=\r\nn rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\nComplete restraint on sex(from=\r\n the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake, grow a bear=\r\nd.\nDo not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty befor=\r\ne you start.\nContinue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times=\r\n.\nSee the difference in your personality before and after.\nLong and short ,=\r\n what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadhana, and persi=\r\nst with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.\nI hope this cla=\r\nrifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n \nKind Love and Reg=\r\nards\nmanish\nYou may post this on the list as a clarification from me if you=\r\n feel that this is suitable.\n \nOn Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R.

Now where did that co=\r\nme from?\n  &gt; How is it related to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have =\r\nmissed many\n  &gt; mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to command=\r\n God is\n  &gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the least. The atti=\r\ntude should\n  &gt; always be that of a beggar in front of God. If anyone has s=\r\naid otherwise, I\n  &gt; also disagee with him/her.\n\n  I mentioned the above wi=\r\nth respect to the need of thousands of mantras and technicalities. If one d=\r\noes not want to command god and wants to be a beggar who will take whatever=\r\n is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras and all the umpteen te=\r\nchnicalities. These thousands of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for=\r\n commanding thousands of different results from god. That is why I talked o=\r\nf commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works slightly differentl=\r\ny than one may imagine. I will elaborate.\n\n  Also, commanding god is NOT bl=\r\nack magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic, which can be accompl=\r\nished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a =\r\nheavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only =\r\nfor a spiritually elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This comm=\r\nanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an e=\r\ngoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing in=\r\ndividual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the =\r\nprevious mail to clarify:\n\n  The universe has many lokas (planes of conscio=\r\nusness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactio=\r\nns possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras.=\r\n When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra=\r\n (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), th=\r\nen one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in=\r\n the mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally i=\r\nn specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding exte=\r\nrnal changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between =\r\nvarious objects.\n\n  Each set of &quot;karmic interactions between various object=\r\ns&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term m=\r\nerging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from =\r\nit as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the term or not, it =\r\nis essentially that.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  But the bottomline is this: =\r\nOnly a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results=\r\n from god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an u=\r\nnattached instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Vari=\r\nous mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant=\r\n for such sadhakas.\n\n  Those are hardly of use to so many people out there =\r\nwith dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command speci=\r\nfic results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, whic=\r\nh is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they us=\r\ne all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astr=\r\nology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities, they will b=\r\ne better off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n\n  Just pick any pr=\r\nasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so=\r\n many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Pat=\r\niently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever=\r\n and whenever he gives.\n\n  Keep praying every day or every second when you =\r\nare able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your act=\r\nions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it=\r\n is his and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowl=\r\ny the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude =\r\nis faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekd=\r\nay, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from que=\r\nstionable sources!).\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  There may be a mountain with=\r\n thousands of paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a diffe=\r\nrent spot (different experience) on the top and show a different scenery (r=\r\nesult). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (=\r\nmantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a=\r\n handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is r=\r\nelevant only to person with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can =\r\nsuccessfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very lit=\r\ntle ego).\n\n  Even when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually=\r\n climb the mountain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and =\r\ntraverse the long path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who=\r\n are bogged down by all the technicalities and people who take customized m=\r\nantra advice from astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly=\r\n by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The power of =\r\na powerful mantra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *af=\r\nter* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin =\r\nto a path leading to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a parti=\r\ncularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to surviv=\r\ne the climb along the long path.\n\n  We need to emphasize the attitude and a=\r\npproach needed for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choice of th=\r\ne path based on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great spiritual =\r\nteachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the =\r\nright mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the co=\r\nrrect attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, di=\r\nscipline, humility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and useful than t=\r\nrying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n\n=\r\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; when should the worship of a graha be done? Let =\r\nus say someone\n  &gt; wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you thin=\r\nk this\n  &gt; worship should be done?\n   \n  You can do anyday. Parasara does n=\r\not mention any day for doing homam to a graha.\n\n  In fact, if one wants, on=\r\ne can do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every day. It is even b=\r\netter that way.\n\n  If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is f=\r\nine. But saying that doing it on so and so day will bring serious dangers b=\r\necause Mars is an enemy of so and so planet would be stretching things.\n\n  =\r\n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got hi=\r\ns\n  &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did they g=\r\net it from?\n   \n  From Self - from within. That is the source of all knowle=\r\ndge. A sadguru need not specifically teach thousand things, but needs to op=\r\nen the door inside.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; OK, just spell it out. What=\r\n is the reason for Gandanta being in 0 deg,\n  &gt; 120 deg and 240 deg of the =\r\nzodiac if it is not a junction between agni\n  &gt; and jala...I want to her yo=\r\nur words if you have any.\n\n  Parasara&#39;s definition of gandanta is restricte=\r\nd to two neighboring areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of f=\r\nire and water elements. &quot;I see fire and I see water. So there is gandanta&quot; =\r\nis a wrong approach. One can then call Venus, a watery planet, being in a f=\r\niery sign or Mars, a fiery planet, being in a watery sign as gandanta. Gand=\r\nanta requires a *transition* in a contiguous space.\n\n  In your example of u=\r\npapada lord&#39;s tithi, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fi=\r\nre transition.\n\n  &gt; Now somewhere you talked of wasting time!!! Look what y=\r\nou are doing.\n  &gt; You were asked to work on Parashara by your Spiritual Mas=\r\nter, and\n  &gt; are you doing that? Me10, Ve7, Ve6...good research but is that=\r\n from\n  &gt; Parashara? \n   \n  Well, Me10, Ve7 etc theory is based on marrying=\r\n two different teachings of Parasara (bhava karakas and special lagnas).

You keep saying Parasara says so and yet t=\r\nhere is nothing forthcoming.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The rashi is associated with the Adit=\r\nya as the rashi come into existence because of the Sun, which is the agni t=\r\nattva. Vara is also agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is wh=\r\ny Vaara is related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the vaara of the lor=\r\nds of the rashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava a=\r\nnd for this reason, fasting and other such karma related to rashi are also =\r\nbased on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Moon is the signif=\r\nicator of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya ma=\r\nnifestation of everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom =\r\nthe karma associated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of=\r\n self punishment and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha is.=\r\n Just as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara rela=\r\nted to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the suffe=\r\nring in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* conte=\r\nnt has not been addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs an=\r\nd people find their partners, get married and get along with life. Proof li=\r\nes in the pudding and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL day=\r\ns and have got result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. W=\r\nhy fast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with=\r\n the raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related to the material e=\r\nffects of the bhava and that is what people are looking for when they come =\r\nto th astrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =E2=80=\r\n=93 remember what I taught =E2=80=93 Men should worship a female deity and =\r\nwomen shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting. I wonder if they reall=\r\ny follow this.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Why not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun i=\r\ns always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limited=\r\n this to day fasting and not night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This is=\r\n my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have given long periods of =\r\nfast starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of ch=\r\nild! You think I should be doing that! You think anyone will lsiten. Try it=\r\n yourself before asking me to advise those hard penance kind of fasts.\n  &gt; =\r\n\n  &gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. It is the sustain=\r\ner. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for getting married a=\r\nnd hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging marriage. Either th=\r\ney want to get into one or get out of one and into another...astrologers th=\r\nese days are relegated to helping people make these transitions painless an=\r\nd fast. Of course some have come and I have not failed them. I have a ready=\r\n shloka for this =E2=80=93 start from Taurus in Hamsa gati:\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Gouri,=\r\n Kaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Durga, Kanti, Saraswati\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Mangalaa, Vaishnavi,=\r\n Lakshmi, Shivaa, Naraayani\n  &gt; \n  &gt; See I have them ready for the 12 signs=\r\n in Hamsa Gati from the mool trikona of Moon in hamsa gati\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Mantra =\r\nShastra is a very detailed work and includes mantra dosha etc. It is very s=\r\ncientific and accurate.

Perhaps I have missed many mails an=\r\nd am not able to get the context. Trying to command God is *BLACK MAGIC* an=\r\nd this is detestable to say the least. The attitude should always be that o=\r\nf a beggar in front of God. If anyone has said otherwise, I also disagee wi=\r\nth him/her.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Prasiddha mantras always give result, even without ini=\r\ntiation and who knows how ready a person is for initation.

His section on remedial measures is fu=\r\nll of various homas. I am not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara =\r\nhimself and I am in fact slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody c=\r\nan do them by themselves.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? H=\r\nave you gone through the Navagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana and o=\r\nther puranic literature?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or=\r\n tithi for most of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for s=\r\npecific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tit=\r\nhi or nakshatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not base=\r\nd on any house or arudha in the chart.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya =\r\ndosha is to be performed on Amavasya, when should the worship of a graha be=\r\n done? Let us say someone wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do y=\r\nou think this worship should be done?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Thus, the principles I am qu=\r\nestioning are *not* from Parasara.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you thi=\r\nnk Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his knowledge and those who wrote i=\r\nt as scribes for him, where did they get it from?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Second, I said w=\r\nhat I said in a *context*. People are mentioning complicated principles tha=\r\nt are not found in classics or works of rishis and scaring people that perf=\r\norming austerities such as fasting on certain days cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot;=\r\n or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on horoscope. I find thes=\r\ne principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. There may be a little d=\r\nifference between doing an austerity on different days, but my point is tha=\r\nt it is smaller compared to the difference between doing and not doing at a=\r\nll and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause danger as being sugges=\r\nted.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I missed the context and just saw =\r\nsome mails that were forwarded to me amidst my writing. But them its always=\r\n a pleasure to talk to you as in that many many have benefitted, and that i=\r\nncludes us as well.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Third, our shastras primarily talk about worsh=\r\nipping various deities on various days, based on the energy of the *deity*.=\r\n For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is =\r\nbetter than others. This is based on the deity and irrespective of the pers=\r\non worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes out with more m=\r\noney to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better off going and=\r\n begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is more important.\n  &gt;=\r\n \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=E2=80=99s not right...at least people who read th=\r\nis will think. Let=E2=80=99s say Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pra=\r\ntyadhi devata of the Sun and is not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. N=\r\nOTE =E2=80=93 a day after Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devat=\r\na of Mercury and is worshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =E2=\r\n=80=93 again a day after! So what happened to the energy equation? J\n  &gt; \n =\r\n &gt; Choosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is more important and th=\r\ne variations based on individual horoscope are less important. I am not say=\r\ning there are no horoscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more impo=\r\nrtantly, I question if they are actually well-understood by astrologers tod=\r\nay to apply *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selling unreli=\r\nable principles of questionable origin and scaring people on that basis.\n  =\r\n&gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood even =\r\nthe basics of Sanatana dharma! Some behave as if there is a battle going on=\r\n between Shiva and Vishnu =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s hilarious to see how these=\r\n are just attempts to convert Hinduism into a religion they have left rathe=\r\nr than trying to learn what Hinduism means. Being newly converted there is =\r\na bellicose patriotism in them to prove their faith to the *new god* they h=\r\nave found and every other God must be the devil in disguise!! It will take =\r\nyears for many to learn that there is no devil. It=E2=80=99s a figment of t=\r\nheir imagination and whatever is devilish is the dark side of mankind himse=\r\nlf.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; *        *        *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Statement 2 is an arrogance tha=\r\nt the entire mantra shastra is useless\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; th=\r\ne same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman\n  &gt; \n  &gt;=\r\n &gt; when any one mantra would suffice.

I think I may have t=\r\no\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of th=\r\ne vedic\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; seers.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I got your point here. It=\r\n=E2=80=99s a good point. \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Now somewhere you talked of wasting time=\r\n!!! Look what you are doing. You were asked to work on Parashara by your Sp=\r\niritual Master, and are you doing that? Me10, Ve7, Ve6...good research but =\r\nis that from Parashara? \n  &gt; \n  &gt; I also know what argument you will give m=\r\ne - J You will say I am already working on that and have some spare time to=\r\n do this as well...to which I will have nothing to say.\n  &gt;\n   \n  ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- \n  From: Narasimha P.V.R.

I got into this thread because statements were mad=\r\ne that fasting on particular weekdays or tithis in a chart can cause &quot;insul=\r\nt to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot; and &quot;danger to spouse&quot;, based on these far-f=\r\netched extrapolations of gandanta.\n\n  &gt; Which is perfectly in line with eve=\r\nrything I have learnt.\n\n  Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/S=\r\nhiva/truth and arudhas represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningful=\r\n. Now, you associated UL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, w=\r\nith Gouri and water. I question whether the new theory on fasting is really=\r\n in line with everything you have learnt (and taught).\n\n  BTW, I specifical=\r\nly asked for a clarification on whether this was based on your own thinking=\r\n or from classics/parampara (see quoted mail below for the full context). L=\r\nike so many times with similar questions I asked privately and recently pub=\r\nlicly, you did not respond.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  &gt; Statement 1 is an a=\r\nrrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus\n  &gt; and has no relevance=\r\n as the remedial measures prescribed by\n  &gt; Parasara and others to be done =\r\non specific days are irrlevant and\n  &gt; not of much consequence.\n\n  First of=\r\n all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or tithis b=\r\nased on any arudhas or houses in a chart.\n\n  For doshas in birth chart or t=\r\no get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings of planets,=\r\n he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to perform t=\r\nhem.

I think I may have=\r\n to\n  &gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the ved=\r\nic\n  &gt; seers.\n\n  I did not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our=\r\n ability to use it is limited and we should take our limitations into consi=\r\nderation.\n\n  The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many be=\r\nings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible betw=\r\neen them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is abl=\r\ne to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no though=\r\nts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experienc=\r\nes the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then=\r\n causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways =\r\n(specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in =\r\nthe universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.=\r\n\n\n  However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant=\r\n to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the =\r\nmind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness =\r\nis quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are ext=\r\nremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantr=\r\na and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.\n\n  *        *  =\r\n      *\n\n  Just repeating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anythi=\r\nng. Some people may think that certain results come when they repeat a mant=\r\nra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work =\r\nfor one person quickly and another may spend the whole life chanting it and=\r\n nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed =\r\nfor a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult than one may thin=\r\nk.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  A highly learned scholar in the court of a kin=\r\ng may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants from king. An i=\r\nncapable one is better off begging the king, rather than trying to command =\r\n(and failing for sure).\n\n  Similarly, most people are better off begging go=\r\nd for what they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command =\r\nwhat they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarsh=\r\nip or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience =\r\nand persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right at=\r\ntitude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most peopl=\r\ne is to learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n\n  What people today need =\r\nfor material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better a=\r\nttitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras=\r\n and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific resul=\r\nt from god.\n\n  It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who=\r\n came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra=\r\n based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitu=\r\nde - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, hu=\r\nmility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to be ove=\r\nrsmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n\n  *        *   =\r\n     *\n\n  One more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis, but the gui=\r\ndelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra based on the horo=\r\nscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate solely based on th=\r\nem. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various traditions. They =\r\nare not free from corruption and imperfection. Most scriptures associate va=\r\nrious mantras with various results, irrespective of horoscope. For example,=\r\n irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Ri=\r\nna Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And so on. Linking o=\r\nf horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyond the scope of P=\r\narasara&#39;s guidelines.\n\n  If one has a sadguru, I recommend following the wo=\r\nrd of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoretician.\n\n  If not, the=\r\nre is no foolproof way to know the right path. Pick any path (given by an a=\r\nstrologer or one that you feel attracted to) instead of wasting time and th=\r\nen keep working on your attitude. The latter is the key. As I said earlier,=\r\n learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. Choice of Mantra is secondary a=\r\nnd attitude is primary. If you succeed in being a really humble beggar, you=\r\n stand a better chance of success than great scholars.\n\n  Any prasiddha man=\r\ntra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu saha=\r\nsranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva see=\r\nrsham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can help one make progress if one develops t=\r\nhe right attitude. Without the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked m=\r\nantra will do nothing.\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  I hope this sufficiently c=\r\nlarifies my stand. I discuss these matters related to spiritual sadhana mor=\r\ne on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.

Which is perfectly in line with everything I have l=\r\nearnt.\n\n    Two statements you have made contradict standard texts on Jyoti=\r\nsh and Mantra Shastra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well=\r\n out here -\n\n    1. Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good =\r\nso long as the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to.=\r\n Results maybe a bit delayed but will be there.\n    2. Statement 2: *reciti=\r\nng any prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to rem=\r\nedy\n\n    Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?\n\n    Sta=\r\ntement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has =\r\nno relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to =\r\nbe done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This so=\r\nunds like another astrologer I had known some time back whose statements li=\r\nke this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are =\r\nnot misled but such pretexts to knowledge.\n\n    Statement 2 is an arrogance=\r\n that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=E2=80=99s were was=\r\nting time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, like say thousands=\r\n of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. OR it =\r\nis like saying that we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured. =\r\nI think I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachi=\r\nngs of the vedic seers.\n\n    I think there is something wrong in the way yo=\r\nu are saying what you want to say. Please rethink and correct your statemen=\r\nts for the sake of good record in this list.\n\n    With Warm Regards\n    San=\r\njay Rath\n    http://srath.com http://sohamsa.com http://srijagannath.org\n  =\r\n  15B Gangaram Hospital Road, New Delhi, 110060, India\n\n    ----- Original =\r\nMessage ----- \n    From: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao \n    To: sohamsa@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \n    Sent: Sunday, February 08, 2009 12:03 PM\n    Subject: Re: ALTERNAT=\r\nIVE TO UPAPADA FASTING\n\n\n    Namaste Sanjay and friends,\n\n    My answers ar=\r\ne in red and prefixed with &quot;[Narasimha]&quot;.\n\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n =\r\n   &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carries ene=\r\nrgy\n    &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the=\r\n 2nd\n    &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandant=\r\na may\n    &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the =\r\nway out.\n    &gt; \n    &gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and n=\r\not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n    &gt; \n   =\r\n &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Sur=\r\nya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What =\r\nis happening?\n    &gt; \n    &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element of fire =\r\nand Gouri rules over the element of water and one worships Gouri at the tim=\r\ne of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one c=\r\nould even say that UL/marriage is represented by water element and fasting =\r\non UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity and well-being) =\r\nto one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the weekday of U=\r\nL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire element represented by we=\r\nekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n    &gt; \n    &gt; [Sanjay Rath:]=\r\n UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L =\r\nwhich is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates everythin=\r\ng through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her due to=\r\n the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th l=\r\nord will be a *more correct* answer.\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n    [Nara=\r\nsimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun (aatman) an=\r\nd arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n\n    Thus, 12th house is the actual c=\r\nreator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of maya. Houses (truth) =\r\nshould actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), =\r\nwhile arudha padas (perception) should actually be associated with Moon (mi=\r\nnd) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod method in dasa j=\r\nudgment.\n\n    Thus, it is actually more logical to say that 12th house and =\r\n12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala =\r\ntattva of Moon.\n\n    Is the above &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own=\r\n thinking or is it from a classic or from tradition?\n\n    &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quot=\r\ne &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting i=\r\ns far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy otherw=\r\nise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantra medi=\r\ntation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize =\r\nthe effect of the mantra.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this.=\r\n Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days when=\r\n one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and c=\r\nhurn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many m=\r\nany times better than complete fasting.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Nara=\r\nsimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is destined to expend some energy=\r\n on digestion after all and not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bot=\r\ntomline is that shastras say that one should meditate either without or wit=\r\nh very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree th=\r\nat meditation sessions after heavy eating are heavily restrained in effecti=\r\nveness.\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of =\r\nstretching of gandanta concepts is quite illogical.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:]=\r\n It is not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =E2=80=93 t=\r\nhe interface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of wate=\r\nr, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=E2=80=99s in the chart but they ar=\r\ne not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End =\r\nquote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha] Putting a burning match in a glass of water doe=\r\ns indeed kill fire. But the question is of contact. If I am thinking of fir=\r\ne in my mind while standing in water, it does not kill the fire. There is n=\r\no contact.\n\n  My point is that the examples given have no real identifiable=\r\n contact between water and fire.\n\n  One can be creative and come up with a =\r\nlot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala tatt=\r\nva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni r=\r\nasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and V=\r\nenus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on the =\r\nweekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious d=\r\nanger.\n\n  It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See what count=\r\ns as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolations.\n\n  &lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; Three years back you said you are leaving jyot=\r\nish....then again you told me two years back and again recently that you ar=\r\ne leaving jyotish. Now it is getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving =\r\nyou*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =E2=80=93 individuals embody it i=\r\nn different levels of their understanding and intelligence. \n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End =\r\nquote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be t=\r\naken away. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when =\r\nit seems like something comes and cry when it seems like something leaves. =\r\nSome impassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what they =\r\nsee as their dharma with the things they seem to have.\n\n  Just a factual co=\r\nrrection though\n  : I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years aft=\r\ner my spiritual master entered my life, my interest in other things went do=\r\nwn (though I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhan=\r\na intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However,=\r\n my guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Paras=\r\nara independently, meditate on them and share my interpretations with the w=\r\norld. He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and h=\r\ne wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and without an attachmen=\r\nt. He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants me=\r\n to do it as an unattached karma. His word is everything for me.\n\n  What I =\r\ntold you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but what I said above.\n=\r\n\n  However, if your judgment is correct and if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; =\r\nme, I am sure my spiritual guru will realize it sooner or later and change =\r\nhis command to me.\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n  &gt; I can categorically de=\r\nclare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and t=\r\nake a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tith=\r\ni and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You ca=\r\nn take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say, a f=\r\new months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata f=\r\nor the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata,=\r\n there is nothing like it!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statemen=\r\nt but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of th=\r\ne seers is of not much relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spi=\r\nritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast=\r\n on UL days and should choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi =\r\n(all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) a=\r\nnd then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... o=\r\nr maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! =\r\nI cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n\n  Is all t=\r\nhat is being taught and practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teac=\r\nhings of the seers&quot;?\n\n  I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of =\r\ncourse, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.=\r\n\n\n  To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a br=\r\nown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some differ=\r\nence. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see t=\r\nhe quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. =\r\nTo say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a=\r\n gross exaggeration.\n\n  The main thing is that you need milk and sugar. If =\r\none is confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends up no=\r\nt making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick=\r\n some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take an=\r\n extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n\n  I request Jyotishis to behav=\r\ne responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that a s=\r\npeicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or tithi in a chart) can c=\r\nause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teachers look =\r\ndown upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and self-importa=\r\nnce from us does not help our cause!\n\n  Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us=\r\n not oversell it or overplay the importance...\n\n  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n \n  &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like pray=\r\ners, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If y=\r\nour body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without to=\r\no many calculations.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya is good for someo=\r\nne planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive and this is kept for =\r\nsome period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahmacharya is good for =\r\nmarriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from physical union as Brah=\r\nmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n\n  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n  [Narasimha]=\r\n Of course, brahmacharya is much more, but also very difficult for most. Ev=\r\nen physical celibacy is a good enough austerity. Physical celibacy over an =\r\nextended period of time increases the efficacy of other austerities such as=\r\n fasting, mouna vrata, meditation and homam.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Narasimha\n =\r\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Do a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n  Do Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n  Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net\n  Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n  Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-- \n   \n  --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sjrath@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n  &gt;\n  &gt; om paramesthi gurave namah\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Dear Narasimha\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Just a=\r\ndded a few thoughts and questions since we are on the topic of spirituality=\r\n, which is not my forte.

It=\r\n is funny that I should be typing this email on an Ekadashi day, when many =\r\nVaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I=\r\n write on dvadasi when so many vasihnava also fast and keep great austeriti=\r\nes. J Any difference?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the que=\r\nstion raised. 2nd bhava is\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if =\r\nwe fast on the day of UL in\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu w=\r\nho provides the food for us.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to exp=\r\nress my disagreement.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult t=\r\no Vishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or s=\r\npeech (mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or spe=\r\nech is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is=\r\n not an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though Bra=\r\nhma was very angry that his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed cel=\r\nibate. So He created others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remained ce=\r\nlibate? Why should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is it a=\r\nn insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet significati=\r\non of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation process...which is wrong=\r\n Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna or=\r\n 7th which is....you know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th house as=\r\n it is necessary for procreation. It is only the link of this with the Brah=\r\nma graha that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people are a=\r\ns eligible for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on the fo=\r\nllowing of dharma and ashrama.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Various gods bestow various things =\r\non us, some at the gross physical level and some at the subtle spiritual le=\r\nvel. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things, we make progress at =\r\nthe subtle level.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire=\r\n (and subtle internal energy associated with it) is used for digesting it a=\r\nnd for generating physical energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy=\r\n is unused and available for other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As=\r\n a result, one can better digest mantras and spiritual food available all a=\r\nround one.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fas=\r\nting is far more effective than at other times. The conservation of energy =\r\notherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more effective mantr=\r\na meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to max=\r\nimize the effect of the mantra.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with=\r\n this. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On day=\r\ns when one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn=\r\n and churn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is =\r\nmany many times better than complete fasting.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be =\r\nhonest, I have not heard this about 2nd lord and\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic =\r\npoint is that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day=\r\n. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are b=\r\nringing the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spous=\r\ne may come into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Why does a rash=\r\ni carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi???? Why does ras=\r\nhi represent vaara or fire?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were cre=\r\nated by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Adity=\r\na...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; After all, Rudra r=\r\nules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and=\r\n one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the=\r\n karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represented=\r\n by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of wate=\r\nr (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say th=\r\nat fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the =\r\nfire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta=\r\n&quot;!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi=\r\n Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the moth=\r\ner Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha=\r\n are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the =\r\ntithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Ser=\r\niously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts is quite illo=\r\ngical.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very defi=\r\nnition of gandanta =E2=80=93 the interface between fire and water. Put a bu=\r\nrning match in a glass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=E2=\r\n=80=99s in the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda betwee=\r\nn Kanya and Tula.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Now one more thing: Marriage is a yoga between t=\r\nwo souls and why not suggest fasting on the yoga day of the UL lord?\n  &gt; \n =\r\n &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What! What a brilliant suggestion...why don=E2=80=99t you=\r\n start it?  \n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Now suppose instead of 11th house if=\r\n Mercury goes to 12th house or 4 \n  &gt; &gt; house then you cannot choose Dwadas=\r\nhi or Chaturthi for the same \n  &gt; &gt; because these thithis are ruled by Merc=\r\nury only and fasting on these \n  &gt; &gt; tithis will create serious doshas.\n  &gt;=\r\n \n  &gt; Picking tithi based on house (12th house - Dwadashi, 4th house - Chat=\r\nurthi) is illogical as there are 12 houses only and more tithis.\n  &gt; I have=\r\n realized one thing over the years - If something is not structurally sound=\r\n, it is most likely false knowledge.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] J No comments\n=\r\n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmost c=\r\nonfidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna=\r\n vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a particu=\r\nlar mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that pra=\r\nctice for a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a spe=\r\ncific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If brahmacha=\r\nrya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it!\n  =\r\n&gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you seem to be say=\r\ning that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not much releva=\r\nnce. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually beneficial. For exam=\r\nple, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and should choose=\r\n any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and =\r\nstart fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (ma=\r\nybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say=\r\n), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, s=\r\no I agree that what you say is right.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; If you keep such a vrata sin=\r\ncerely, you will make positive progress towards achieving your purpose and =\r\ndefinitely not go backwards, irrespective of what is said by technical calc=\r\nulations based on our half-baked Jyotish knowledge.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; * * *\n  &gt; \n  &gt;=\r\n My friends, use the Jyotish knowledge available, but do realize that it is=\r\n imperfect and corrupted. Why is only the UL lord important? So many planet=\r\ns may have so many kinds of influence on UL in a chart. And UL is one of se=\r\nveral factors showing marriage. There may be various influences in a chart =\r\nshowing marriage. Is our thumb rule of using UL lord&#39;s weekday missing some=\r\n important factors? Quite possible!\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That is a very =\r\nnasty statement. Once again you have used adjectives (*imperfect, corrupted=\r\n*) which is not becoming of you. Why must you use nasty statements? Can=E2=\r\n=80=99t you say things nicely? \n  &gt; \n  &gt; Three years back you said you are =\r\nleaving jyotish....then again you told me two years back and again recently=\r\n that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getting very evident that *jyotish=\r\n is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =E2=80=93 individuals=\r\n embody it in different levels of their understanding and intelligence. \n  =\r\n&gt; \n  &gt; If you have the time to listen to the Jaimini Lectures at http://soh=\r\namsa.com/js/ do so as it will show you the depths of this knowledge you can=\r\nnot imagine exists in jyotish. The derivation of the chnhandas and what not=\r\n all. Thumb rules are meant for beginners. The day you decided to give up j=\r\nyotish, you got stuck in the thumb rules but then its ok with me. I always =\r\nwished you the best in whatever you do.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; But, despite some arbitrar=\r\niness and imperfection, if a thumb rule allows you to pick an austerity wit=\r\nh confidence and create the mental feeling that you are doing the best poss=\r\nible thing for your situation, it is good. After all, what is critical is t=\r\no do *some* austerity to burn the blocking karma, with a positive frame of =\r\nmind about what you are doing.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] No Narasimha, very h=\r\nappy marriages can happen, without austerities as well.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; But, if en=\r\ndless theorization and complicated technicalities evolving from the thumb r=\r\nule are creating doubts and confusion in the minds of people as they consid=\r\ner an austerity, that is useless and totally missing the point.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; So=\r\nme people tend to resort to heavy theorization based on very shaky grounds.=\r\n I suggest going back to the basics, thinking clearly and keeping things si=\r\nmple.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Human brains work differently in seeking the =\r\ntruth and means to remedy the errors. Life is too complicated to keep every=\r\nthing simple. For example, a heavily cursed Venus can block everything and =\r\nUL fast may not be able to solve the problem. Now would you say that heavy =\r\nthoerization and complication is happening and we should ignore the other f=\r\nactors completely?\n  &gt; \n  &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But,=\r\n austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER=\r\n do you any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekd=\r\nay or tithi without too many calculations.\n  &gt; \n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmach=\r\narya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive=\r\n and this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nisheka. Bra=\r\nhmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from =\r\nphysical union as Brahmacharya.
