(Day by Day w=\r\nith Bhagavan, 2nd January, 1946,\nafternoon)\n\nRenouncing the ego\n\nOnly those=\r\n who have renounced the ego-mind have truly renounced. What have\nall the ot=\r\nhers, who may have given up other things, really renounced?\n\nBy becoming th=\r\ne source of all desires, the ego is the doorway to the sorrow\nof samsara. T=\r\nhe extremely heroic and discriminating person first attains\nthrough dispass=\r\nion the total renunciation of desires that arise in the form\nof =E2=80=98I =\r\nwant=E2=80=99. Subsequently, through the Selfward enquiry =E2=80=98Who am I=\r\n?=E2=80=99, he\nrenounces that ego, leaving no trace of it, and attains the =\r\nbliss of peace,\nfree from anxieties. This is the supreme benefit of dharma.=\r\n\n\n\nRenouncing desires\n\nQuestion: What is the best way of dealing with desir=\r\nes, with a view to\ngetting rid of them =E2=80=93 satisfying them or suppres=\r\nsing them?\n\nBhagavan: If a desire can be got rid of by satisfying it, there=\r\n will be no\nharm in satisfying such a desire. But desires generally are not=\r\n eradicated\nby satisfaction. Trying to root them out that way is like pouri=\r\nng spirits to\nquench fire. At the same time, the proper remedy is not forci=\r\nble\nsuppression, since such repression is bound to react sooner or later in=\r\nto\nforceful surging up with undesirable consequences. The proper way to get=\r\n rid\nof a desire is to find out, =E2=80=98Who gets the desire? What is its =\r\nsource?=E2=80=99 When\nthis is found, the desire is rooted out and it will n=\r\never again emerge or\ngrow. Small desires such as the desire to eat, drink a=\r\nnd sleep and attend to\ncalls of nature, though these may also be classed am=\r\nong desires, you can\nsafely satisfy. They will not implant vasanas in your =\r\nmind, necessitating\nfurther birth. Those activities are just necessary to c=\r\narry on life and are\nnot likely to develop or leave behind vasanas or tende=\r\nncies. As a general\nrule, therefore, there is no harm in satisfying a desir=\r\ne where the\nsatisfaction will not lead to further desires by creating vasan=\r\nas in the\nmind. (Day by Day with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)\n\nQuestion: How=\r\n am I to deal with my passions? Am I to check them or satisfy\nthem? If I fo=\r\nllow Bhagavan=E2=80=99s method and ask, =E2=80=98To whom are these passions=\r\n?=E2=80=99\nthey do not seem to die but grow stronger.\n\nBhagavan: Satisfying=\r\n desires and thereby trying to root them out is like\ntrying to quench fire =\r\nby pouring kerosene oil over it. The only way is to\nfind the root of desire=\r\n and thus remove it.(Day by Day with Bhagavan, 2nd\nJanuary, 1946)\n\nQuestion=\r\n: How can they [desires] be rendered weaker?\n\nBhagavan: By knowledge. You k=\r\nnow that you are not the mind. The desires are\nin the mind. Such knowledge =\r\nhelps one to control them.\n\nQuestion: But they are not controlled in our pr=\r\nactical lives.\n\nBhagavan: Every time you attempt satisfaction of a desire t=\r\nhe knowledge\ncomes that it is better to desist. What is your true nature? H=\r\now can you\never forget it? Waking, dream and sleep are mere phases of the m=\r\nind. They\nare not of the Self. You are the witness of these states. Your tr=\r\nue nature\nis found in sleep. (Day by Day with Bhagavan, 12th April, 1946)\n\n=\r\nBhagavan: There is room for kama [desire] so long as there is an object\napa=\r\nrt from the subject, i.e., duality. There can be no desire if there is no\no=\r\nbject. The state of no-desire is moksha. There is no duality in sleep and\na=\r\nlso no desire. Whereas there is duality in the waking state and desire also=\r\n\nis there. Because of duality a desire arises from the acquisition of the\no=\r\nbject. That is the outgoing mind, which is the basis of duality and of\ndesi=\r\nre. If one knows that bliss is none other than the Self the mind becomes\nin=\r\nward turned. If the Self is gained all the desires are fulfilled.(Talks\nwit=\r\nh Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 502)\n\n\nRenunciation of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 =\r\nand =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99\n\n\n=E2=80=98Internal renunciation=E2=80=99 is ren=\r\nunciation of the ego whereas =E2=80=98external\nrenunciation=E2=80=99 is giv=\r\ning up possessions. Together they are known as giving up\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99. It is the former that results in enlightenm=\r\nent.\n\nIf you attain perfect mastery of internal renunciation, external\nrenu=\r\nnciation will have no importance. (Padamalai, p. 170, v. 102)\n\nBhagavan som=\r\netimes illustrated the superiority of inner over outer\nrenunciation by tell=\r\ning the story of King Sikhidhvaja who unnecessarily gave\nup his kingdom and=\r\n retired to the forest to seek enlightenment:\n\nHe [the king] had vairagya [=\r\nnon-attachment] even while ruling his kingdom\nand could have realised the S=\r\nelf if he had only pushed his vairagya to the\npoint of killing the ego. He =\r\ndid not do it but came to the forest, had a\ntimetable of tapas and yet did =\r\nnot improve even after eighteen years of\ntapas. He had made himself a victi=\r\nm of his own creation. Chudala [his\nenlightened wife] advised him to give u=\r\np the ego and realise the Self, which\nhe did and was liberated.\n\nIt is clea=\r\nr from Chudala=E2=80=99s story that vairagya accompanied by ego is of no\nva=\r\nlue, whereas all possessions in the absence of ego do not matter. (Talks\nwi=\r\nth Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 404)\n\nAbandon your mind unconditionally at=\r\n the feet of him [Siva] who shares his\nform with the Lady [Uma]. Then, as t=\r\nhe =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 that investigates the false dies\naway, along with [t=\r\nhe concept of] =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, the powerful Supreme Self will\nunfol=\r\nd fully and flourish eternally. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, vv. 484, 487)\n\n\nRenoun=\r\ncing the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea\n\nQuestion: Why cannot the Sel=\r\nf be perceived directly?\n\nBhagavan: Only the Self is said to be directly pe=\r\nrceived [pratyaksha].\nNothing else is said to be pratyaksha. Although we ar=\r\ne having this\npratyaksha, the thought =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=80=99 is v=\r\neiling it. If we give up this\nthought, the Atma, which is always within the=\r\n direct experience of everyone,\nwill shine forth. (Living by the Words of B=\r\nhagavan, 2nd ed., pp. 218-19)\n\nHere is a sequence of verses from Guru Vacha=\r\nka Kovai that covers this\nimportant aspect of renunciation:\n\n34\n\nThe world =\r\nthat associates with us as an appearance of names and forms is as\ntransient=\r\n as a lightning flash. The faltering understanding =E2=80=98I am the body=\r\n=E2=80=99\nis the deceptive device that makes us desire the world as if it w=\r\nere real,\n[thereby] entrapping us instantaneously in the powerful snare of =\r\nbondage.\n\n\n846\n\nBe aware that the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 ego is tr=\r\nuly the one unique cause of all\nthe sorrows of samsara. Therefore, make gen=\r\nuine, firm and steady efforts to\ndestroy that ego, and desist from making a=\r\nny other kind of effort.\n\n\nRenouncing the =E2=80=98I am the doer=E2=80=99 i=\r\ndea\n\nAccording to Bhagavan, it is not actions themselves that should be giv=\r\nen up,\nbut the inner feeling that one is doing them:\n\nIf total cessation fr=\r\nom activity is alone the determining criterion for\njnana, then even the ina=\r\nbility to act because of leprosy will be a sure\nindication of jnana! You sh=\r\nould know that the state of jnana is the exalted\nstate of remaining without=\r\n any sense of responsibility in the heart, having\nrenounced both the attrac=\r\ntion to, and the revulsion from, the performance of\nactions. (Guru Vachaka =\r\nKovai, verse 1160)\n\nUnless one=E2=80=99s connection with individuality is d=\r\nestroyed at its root, one\nwill not become a true jnani, free of the sense o=\r\nf doership [kartrutva].\nEven if one attains a supreme and eminent state of =\r\ntapas that can be\nmarvelled at, one is still only a sadhaka who is qualifie=\r\nd to realise the\ntruth. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, v. 122)\n\nDeeds [karma] are not=\r\n your enemy, only the sense of doership [kartrutva] is.\nTherefore, live you=\r\nr life, having completely renounced that enemy.\n(Padamalai p. 171, vv. 106,=\r\n 107)\n\nA mind that has dissolved in the state of God, and ceased to exist, =\r\nwill not\nbe aware of any activity that needs to be performed because when t=\r\nhe ego,\nwhich has the idea that it is the performer of actions, has been co=\r\nmpletely\ndestroyed, the idea that something needs to be accomplished ends.\n=\r\n\nPrarabdha, like a whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins the mind that=\r\n\nhas shrunk through the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea. However, it c=\r\nannot stir, even\nslightly, the limitation-free mind that shines as the extr=\r\nemely clear space\nof being-consciousness when that ego-impurity [the =E2=80=\r\n=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea] is\ndestroyed by self-enquiry. (Guru Vachaka=\r\n Kovai, vv. 703, 698)\n\nSankalpa [thought] creates the world. The peace atta=\r\nined on the destruction\nof sankalpas is the [permanent] destruction of the =\r\nworld. (Padamalai, p.\n264, v. 6)\n\nThe world is seen distinctly only in the =\r\nwaking and dream states in which\nsankalpas [thoughts] have emerged. Is it e=\r\nver seen during sleep, where\nsankalpas do not emerge even slightly? Sankalp=\r\nas alone are the material\nsubstance of the world. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, v. 2=\r\n9)\n\nInstead of ruining yourself by clinging, as your refuge, to the utterly=\r\n\nfalse world that appears as a conjuring trick, it is wisdom to renounce it=\r\n\nin the mind and remain still, forgetting it and remaining detached from it=\r\n,\nlike the ripe tamarind fruit that, despite remaining inside its pod, stay=\r\ns\nseparate from it. (Guru Vachaka Kovai, verse 825)\n\nQuestion: Should not a=\r\n man renounce everything in order that he might get\nliberation?\n\nBhagavan: =\r\nEven better than the man who thinks =E2=80=98I have renounced everything=E2=\r\n=80=99\nis the one who does his duty but does not think =E2=80=98I do this=\r\n=E2=80=99 or =E2=80=98I am the\ndoer=E2=80=99. Even a sannyasi who thinks =\r\n=E2=80=98I am a sannyasi=E2=80=99 cannot be a true\nsannyasi, whereas a hous=\r\neholder who does not think =E2=80=98I am a householder=E2=80=99 is\ntruly a =\r\nsannyasi. (Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi, talk no. 530)\n\nKnow that not reg=\r\narding oneself erroneously as being limited to the body and\ntrapped in fami=\r\nly bonds is a far superior renunciation to the state wherein\none thinks rep=\r\neatedly within one=E2=80=99s mind: =E2=80=98I have truly extricated myself =\r\nby\nrenouncing all the ties of this world.=E2=80=99 (Guru Vachaka Kovai, ver=\r\nse 840)\n\nMuruganar made the following comments on this Guru Vachaka Kovai v=\r\nerse:\n\nThinking, =E2=80=98I am a person who has renounced=E2=80=99 is only =\r\nmental imagination. The\nstate of truth transcends such imagination. Only th=\r\ne state of remaining\nstill, which is the natural state, is true sannyasa, t=\r\nhe nature of\nliberation. It is not thinking repeatedly, =E2=80=98I am someo=\r\nne who has renounced\nsamsara=E2=80=99. Therefore, not thinking is a far sup=\r\nerior renunciation to\nthinking. Like the thought, =E2=80=98I am caught in b=\r\nondage=E2=80=99, the thought, =E2=80=98I am one\nwho is free from bondage=E2=\r\n=80=99 indicates the delusion of regarding yourself as\nbeing limited to the=\r\n body. When that delusion is destroyed, along with it,\nboth of these though=\r\nts will cease. Unless the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 belief is\npresent=\r\n to some extent, there can be no possibility of having the thought,\n=E2=80=\r\n=98I have renounced=E2=80=99.\n\n\nSource: http://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot=\r\n.com/2008/10/renunciation.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13bc887dc990480a2f30c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nBhagavan taught that true renunciation was giving up interest in and attach=\r\nment to anything that is not the Self:=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold&quot;&gt;Giving up the non-Self is renunciation.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Inhering in =\r\nthe Self is jnana or Self-realisation.

It is the former that results in enli=\r\nghtenment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If you attain perfect mastery of internal renunc=\r\niation, external renunciation will have no importance. (Padamalai, p. 170, =\r\nv. 102)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan sometimes illustrated the superiority of inner over=\r\n outer renunciation by telling the story of King Sikhidhvaja who unnecessar=\r\nily gave up his kingdom and retired to the forest to seek enlightenment:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He [the king] had vairagya [non-attachment] even while ruling his ki=\r\nngdom and could have realised the Self if he had only pushed his vairagya t=\r\no the point of killing the ego. He did not do it but came to the forest, ha=\r\nd a timetable of tapas and yet did not improve even after eighteen years of=\r\n tapas. He had made himself a victim of his own creation. Chudala [his enli=\r\nghtened wife] advised him to give up the ego and realise the Self, which he=\r\n did and was liberated.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is clear from Chudala=E2=80=99s story t=\r\nhat vairagya accompanied by ego is of no value, whereas all possessions in =\r\nthe absence of ego do not matter.

Nothing else is said to be pratyaksha. Alth=\r\nough we are having this pratyaksha, the thought =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=\r\n=80=99 is veiling it. If we give up this thought, the Atma, which is always=\r\n within the direct experience of everyone, will shine forth. (Living by the=\r\n Words of Bhagavan, 2nd ed., pp. 218-19)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Here is a sequence of ver=\r\nses from Guru Vachaka Kovai that covers this important aspect of renunciati=\r\non:=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;34&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world that associates with us as an appearan=\r\nce of names and forms is as transient as a lightning flash. The faltering u=\r\nnderstanding =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 is the deceptive device that m=\r\nakes us desire the world as if it were real, [thereby] entrapping us instan=\r\ntaneously in the powerful snare of bondage.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;846&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Be aware that the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99=\r\n ego is truly the one unique cause of all the sorrows of samsara.

You should know that the state of jnana is the exalted state of remain=\r\ning without any sense of responsibility in the heart, having renounced both=\r\n the attraction to, and the revulsion from, the performance of actions. (Gu=\r\nru Vachaka Kovai, verse 1160)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Unless one=E2=80=99s connecti=\r\non with individuality is destroyed at its root, one will not become a true =\r\njnani, free of the sense of doership [kartrutva].

(Guru Vachaka Kovai, v. 1=\r\n22)=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Deeds [karma] are not your enemy, only the sense of doer=\r\nship [kartrutva] is. Therefore, live your life, having completely renounced=\r\n that enemy. (Padamalai p. 171, vv. 106, 107)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A mind that has dissol=\r\nved in the state of God, and ceased to exist, will not be aware of any acti=\r\nvity that needs to be performed because when the ego, which has the idea th=\r\nat it is the performer of actions, has been completely destroyed, the idea =\r\nthat something needs to be accomplished ends.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nstyle:italic&quot;&gt;Prarabdha, like a whirlwind, relentlessly agitates and spins =\r\nthe mind that has shrunk through the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea. =\r\nHowever, it cannot stir, even slightly, the limitation-free mind that shine=\r\ns as the extremely clear space of being-consciousness when that ego-impurit=\r\ny [the =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea] is destroyed by self-enquiry. =\r\n(Guru Vachaka Kovai, vv. 703, 698)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;Sankalpa [thought] creates the world. The peace attained on the de=\r\nstruction of sankalpas is the [permanent] destruction of the world. (Padama=\r\nlai, p. 264, v. 6)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world is seen distinctly only in the waking a=\r\nnd dream states in which sankalpas [thoughts] have emerged.

(Guru Vachaka =\r\nKovai, verse 825)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Question: Should not a man renounce every=\r\nthing in order that he might get liberation?=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan: Even be=\r\ntter than the man who thinks =E2=80=98I have renounced everything=E2=80=99 =\r\nis the one who does his duty but does not think =E2=80=98I do this=E2=80=99=\r\n or =E2=80=98I am the doer=E2=80=99.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;=\r\n&gt;Even a sannyasi who thinks =E2=80=98I am a sannyasi=E2=80=99 cannot be a t=\r\nrue sannyasi, whereas a householder who does not think =E2=80=98I am a hous=\r\neholder=E2=80=99 is truly a sannyasi.

The state of truth transcends such=\r\n imagination. Only the state of remaining still, which is the natural state=\r\n, is true sannyasa, the nature of liberation. It is not thinking repeatedly=\r\n, =E2=80=98I am someone who has renounced samsara=E2=80=99. Therefore, not =\r\nthinking is a far superior renunciation to thinking. Like the thought, =E2=\r\n=80=98I am caught in bondage=E2=80=99, the thought, =E2=80=98I am one who i=\r\ns free from bondage=E2=80=99 indicates the delusion of regarding yourself a=\r\ns being limited to the body. When that delusion is destroyed, along with it=\r\n, both of these thoughts will cease.
