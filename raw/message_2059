He did not know much about some of the ten incarnatio=\r\nns. He described what he saw and I told him who was who and a little about =\r\nthem. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a=\r\n white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come ye=\r\nt.\n\n* * *\n\nThis boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I=\r\n was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was=\r\n abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n\nI asked what h=\r\ne was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not=\r\n already happened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen l=\r\nater when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was gett=\r\ning at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n\nHe said=\r\n, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be=\r\n overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is us=\r\nually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he wa=\r\ns onto something today. But he could not express himself.\n\nI helped him, &quot;d=\r\no you mean to say that future has already happened at some level, but will =\r\nreveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been =\r\nshot and become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. Bu=\r\nt people seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front =\r\nof them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n\nHe exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That=\r\n is what I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will ha=\r\nppen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future co=\r\nmes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n\nThough he did not mention it, I kne=\r\nw why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the=\r\n horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was=\r\n probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand thing=\r\ns, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody w=\r\nho had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and came=\r\n to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n\nTime seems lin=\r\near at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of conss=\r\nciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning w=\r\nhen one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n\n* * *\n\nThe s=\r\name boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra o=\r\nf Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditati=\r\nng after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was qui=\r\nte different from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my m=\r\nind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed=\r\n in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave=\r\n&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n\nI had experienced the same kind of intens=\r\ne energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was m=\r\neditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in In=\r\ndia. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate insid=\r\ne the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main =\r\nKaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in t=\r\nhe past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no o=\r\nther time did I feel that intense shakti.\n\nInterestingly, after we finished=\r\n meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different h=\r\nomas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I=\r\n don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n\n* * *\n=\r\n\nThis boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter than what =\r\nI give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a powerfu=\r\nl energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is the most=\r\n important thing.\n\nRituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual=\r\n better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one ha=\r\ns to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n\nKeep performing your chosen s=\r\npiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you engage i=\r\nn external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and=\r\n purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can re=\r\nsist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal enemi=\r\nes like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego=\r\n - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all =\r\nproblems.\n\n* * *\n\nOvercoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challengin=\r\ng, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including=\r\n your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s pro=\r\nperty and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these properties of =\r\ngod. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is =\r\nmine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s properties, =\r\nbut without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.\n\nRealize=\r\n that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of=\r\n them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entru=\r\nsted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does not waste time worr=\r\nying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be=\r\n taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one poss=\r\nesses and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s=\r\n control.\n\nDeveloping the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s =\r\nproperties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without getting cau=\r\nght and overcome ego.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFre=\r\ne Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      ICC World=\r\n Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!

This enables one to do the best job with what one possesse=\r\ns and not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s con=\r\ntrol.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;=\r\ns properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life without getting c=\r\naught and overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas=\r\n Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spiritual=\r\nity: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jag=\r\nannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; =\r\nICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.y=\r\nahoo.com/tagline_cricket_3/*http://cricket.yahoo.com&quot;&gt; YAHOO!
