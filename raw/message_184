And you people have\nhelped me a lot to find out the right path at man=\r\ny times but now i\nfeel a bit lost again. \n\nAs it can be seen from my chart =\r\ndetails what brought me here( and to\nspiritual path) like many others. I st=\r\nill remember the thread where\nNarasimha Ji said that there is no need to fe=\r\nar of Sani and now i have\nrealised what he meant.\n\nI have learned a little =\r\nbit of astrology from this thread and from\nother  sources but with that i c=\r\nan not really make any decisions of\nthe path i need to follow. As i have se=\r\nen that there are many\nenlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group =\r\nso if\nsomeone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and guide me i\nw=\r\nill be very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n\nBirth Date- 17/03/=\r\n1979\nBirth Time- 12:45 PM\nBirth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n\nAnother th=\r\ning is that till now i have been reading some\nScriptures/Spiritual writings=\r\n from here and there and doing some\nmeditation and chanting of Mahamantra. =\r\nI have really seen and\nexperienced the effect of all this but all this was =\r\nrandom and\nunplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my spiri=\r\ntual\nprogress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of reading more to=\r\n\nget some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from where to\nget t=\r\nhe books. \n\nSecond thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a re=\r\ngular\nbasis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the homa kunda=\r\nm\nwhich i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone tell me\nwhat =\r\nelse can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.\n\nAlthough there a=\r\nre so many other things i want to ask but if someone\ncan help me with only =\r\nthese i would be very thankful to him and i will\npray to Lord for him.\n\nTha=\r\nnks in advance\nSanjeev\n\n\n"}}
