Can \nanyone please let me know where =\r\nI can get information about this \ncelebration- scriptural references would =\r\nbe much appreciated.\n\nThe reason I ask for this is because I have noticed s=\r\nome nonsense \nthings on the internet, specifically with one group saying Vi=\r\nshnu and \nBrahma were quarelling about who is Supreme and Shiva showed them=\r\n all \nthat he is supreme, then another group saying that Shiva and Brahma \n=\r\nwere quarelling and Vishnu showed them he is supreme.\n\nIn my opinion, I don=\r\nt believe these stories as they seem to divide \nHindus in their belief. Fro=\r\nm my own reading of Brihad Bhagavadamrita, \nthe transcendental loving relat=\r\nionship between Lord Vishnu and Lord \nShiva is described- and there is no p=\r\netty quarelling and no \ncompetition! \n\nAny help would be much appreciated!\n=\r\n\nJaya Sita Raama\nBivash\n\n\n"}}
