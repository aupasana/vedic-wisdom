Most people talking about=\r\n \n\nKundalini have not experienced Kundalini itself in higher chakras.\n\n\n\nKu=\r\nndalini shakti is one&#39;s self-awareness. Shakti meeting Shiva is a \n\nmetapho=\r\nr for individual self-awareness (shakti) merging in cosmic self \n\n(Shiva). =\r\nA vaishnava may also view it as a Gopi meeting Krishna.\n\n\n\n*        *      =\r\n  *\n\n\n\nShakti will not rise unless one&#39;s awareness of physical body disappe=\r\nars. \n\nThe instruction of some teachers to focus on a particular chakra or =\r\na \n\nparticular body part to force Kundalini to rise is not wise. As long as=\r\n \n\nyou think &quot;I am the body. Inside this body, there is a chakra or a body =\r\n\n\npart.

In other words, your \n\nKundali=\r\nni is stuck in the mooladhara chakra corresponding to the \n\nphysical realm.=\r\n\n\n\n\nWanting Kundalini to rise to X or Y chakra is unproductive. It never \n\n=\r\nhappens that way. Whenever I had expected or anticipated something, \n\nnothi=\r\nng happened. Things happened spontaneously only when my mind was \n\nnearly e=\r\nmpty and the focus on mantra/god became so intense that it \n\nfilled my mind=\r\n. In fact, when I first experienced a Kundalini rise, I \n\ndid not even know=\r\n much about Kundalini and chakras and considered all \n\nthose concepts as di=\r\nrty Tantrik ideas that I wanted to do have nothing \n\nto do with. Only after=\r\n experiencing did I understand what it was \n\nintellectually. Thus, intellec=\r\ntual analysis of Kundalini and chakras and \n\ntrying to manipulate them is u=\r\nnnecessary and, in fact, \n\ncounter-productive.

The key is to immerse the mind so deeply =\r\nin &lt;br&gt;\nthe mantra/deity that you forget everything else.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd then=\r\n patience. By being in a hurry that your Kundalini should rise, &lt;br&gt;\nyou wi=\r\nll only ensure that Kundalini remains in Mooladhara forever. As I &lt;br&gt;\nsaid=\r\n, stop thinking in terms of shakti and chakras, if shakti were to &lt;br&gt;\nreal=\r\nly rise.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n-------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofo=\r\nllow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitte=\r\nr ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for answering=\r\n my questions. Some of them have been silly&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; trivial questions, and=\r\n yet, you never tire of answering them. I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; grateful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; In some of your mails, you have written about the flow of shakti&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; through the ida and pingala nadis, and how pranayama and mantra are&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; linked to them. Is it a better to choose activities which &#39;acti=\r\nvate&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the same nadi throughout? For example, if the pradhana h=\r\noma mantra&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; activates the ida nadi, is it better to &#39;activate&#=\r\n39; the same nadi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; through pranayama, and also choose a mantra with=\r\n works through the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; same nadi during meditation?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIf you have some experience with them, can you share the nadi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; affi=\r\nliation for some common mantras like mahaganapati (shreem hriim&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; kl=\r\neem ...), shiva panchakshari, and &#39;om namo narayanaya&#39;. Do longer&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; selections like chandi path also have an affiliation with one of th=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nadis?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thank you again.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-167206779-1308887474=:49996--\r\n\n"}}
