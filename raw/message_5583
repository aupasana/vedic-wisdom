People often only take the external im=\r\nagery and concentrate a lot of attention on the peel of the orange rather t=\r\nhan the fruit within.\n\nCow&#39;s ghee is praised in Ayurveda as one which can i=\r\nncrease both the material that forms the spleen ,bones and nervous system.P=\r\nregnant women are often told to take a lot of ghee for good formation of th=\r\ne foetus in the womb.Also it is a very good practise to use Ghee instead of=\r\n Oil while cooking even though modern nutrition experts will scare people i=\r\nnto beleiving it will increase harmful cholestrol.\n\nCow&#39;s ghee when lit in =\r\na lamp or in a homa releases many organic compounds and vapours which are q=\r\nuite beneficial to the human body. Also Cow&#39;s ghee is one of the most sattv=\r\nic substances that can be found. IIT -BHU has a published paper on the chem=\r\nical compounds formed during a homa and the temperature study. You could go=\r\nogle for it on the net. \n\nLighting such a substance would never displease M=\r\nother Lakshmi or any other god for that matter.\n\nDoing any ritual should in=\r\nspire one to change oneself internally as well. Just external rituals will =\r\nnot take anybody much further.\n\nNarasimha ji&#39;s message can be found in the =\r\narchives where he summarized the meaning of lighting three wicks in the lam=\r\np ( Ida,Pingala ,Sushumna ) and I think you can happily offer a ghee lamp w=\r\nith the same attitude.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, vinayak tandle &lt;vinayakmechie@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Gurujans=\r\n,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; On TV someone said that Cow&#39;s Ghee represents Laxmi & one should =\r\nnot light a Lamp of it daily in House as it will burn away the wealth of th=\r\ne person.
