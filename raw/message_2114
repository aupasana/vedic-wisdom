I am\n&gt; reprodu=\r\ncing extract from Narasimha&#39;s message regarding Sanskrit grammar.\n&gt; One imp=\r\nortant thing which has come to my mind is that, because it is\n&gt; Visarga, in=\r\n Sanskrit scripts, it is denoted by : and NOT by  &#39;Ha&#39; akshar\n&gt; written in =\r\ndevanagari. that shows that there is some important\n&gt; difference in pronunc=\r\niation and the sound should not be made explicitly\n&gt; as Ha but one should l=\r\net go the air while pronouncing it.  it is\n&gt; different thing that apparentl=\r\ny it sounds like Ha.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is =\r\na visarga (written in\n&gt; Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;)=\r\n. Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;.\n&gt; You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to let air go from y=\r\nou lungs in a quick exhalation.\n&gt; Pronunciation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is very clos=\r\ne to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again,\n&gt; this is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supposed to be=\r\n one syllable. A lot of people, especially south\n&gt; Indians, make\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it &quot;=\r\nnaha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is\n&gt; added to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is\n&gt; pron=\r\nounced\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words,\n&gt; res=\r\npectively\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you prono=\r\nunce it\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds iden=\r\ntical in the\n&gt; 3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; words.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also need confirmation abou=\r\nt Vighneshwara whom we worship as remover\n&gt; of obstacles being &gt;the creator=\r\n of obstacles as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; First time i thought about Vigneshwara in line =\r\nwith what you mentioned.\n&gt; if we split the word which are joined then it is=\r\n Vigna + Ishwara =3D God\n&gt; of Obstacle. it can very well mean that the God =\r\nwho controls obstacles.\n&gt; now if we derive meaning that Ganapati (Vigneshwa=\r\nra) is the controller\n&gt; of Obstacles then what you mentioned seems quite co=\r\nrrect because the one\n&gt; who controls obstacle has the power to put forth th=\r\ne obstacle as well as\n&gt; remove it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, is there some signif=\r\nicance of the trunk turned to the\n&gt; right as opposed to the left &gt;or the mi=\r\nddle?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not know WHY but It is a popular opinion in Maharashtra and=\r\n Gujarat\n&gt; (may be in the other places as well) that Murti or picture of Ga=\r\nnapati\n&gt; having Right Sided trunk are very active (Live) and hence they sho=\r\nuld be\n&gt; handled with extreme care. i mean, the idol or picture should neve=\r\nr\n&gt; remain without Pujan etc... Generally people are afraid of keeping such=\r\n\n&gt; a idol in their homes because they feel that if they are no able to\n&gt; pr=\r\noperly worship the idol then some kind of misfortune will befall on\n&gt; them.=\r\n Other thing is that, there is also belief that if the idol is\n&gt; properly p=\r\nropitiated then it can give great fortune.\n&gt; \n&gt; it is not out of place to m=\r\nention here that about a year back somebody\n&gt; gave me a Ganapati idol havin=\r\ng Right side trunk. i kept it in my small\n&gt; puja place. i think i hardly ev=\r\ner worship the idol but when i started\n&gt; Homam i used to keep the idol in t=\r\nhe homam. although i knew the above\n&gt; belief, i was never afraid of misfort=\r\nune. afterwards i came to Mumbai\n&gt; for vacation and i bought another idol o=\r\nf metal. now i had (still have)\n&gt; 2 idols and i used to keep only metal ido=\r\nl (with left side trunk) but i\n&gt; had some kind of guilt feeling that i am n=\r\not able to keep the earlier\n&gt; one idol so i decided to give the metal idol =\r\nto one of my colleagues who\n&gt; was going to shift to a new house. i gave the=\r\nm the idol but they were\n&gt; little hesitant and gave me back. i asked my Gur=\r\nu about it and he asked\n&gt; to keep both the idols in the Homam and i started=\r\n doing that. now during\n&gt; my Homam, there are both Ganapati present, one wi=\r\nth Right side trunk and\n&gt; one with left side. one who is ready to punish an=\r\nd the one who just let\n&gt; go like visarga :).\n&gt; \n&gt; but truly speaking, my fe=\r\nar for such things have almost gone. No\n&gt; trepidation by whatever beliefs. =\r\nWhether it is Ganapati of Right sided\n&gt; trunk or mistakes in rituals or wro=\r\nng pronunciation of veda mantra or\n&gt; such other things.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I have no answers for the rest of the things you asked.\n&gt; \n&gt; sorry if i&#39;ve=\r\n deviated.\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks, Utpalji fo=\r\nr pointing out the correction in &quot;Ganapataye&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is not &quot;Nama:&quot; equiv=\r\nalent of NamaH?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I also need confirmation about Vighneshwara whom we=\r\n worship as remover\n&gt; of obstacles being the creator of obstacles as well.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Afterall was he not the vighna in is father&#39;s path as a result of\n&gt;=\r\n which he lost his head?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Furthermore, is there some significance of=\r\n the trunk turned to the\n&gt; right as opposed to the left or the middle?\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Any meaning attached to what Ganapati holds in his hands and in the\n&gt; t=\r\nrunk?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; What is the meaning of &quot;Gana&quot;?...is it the elements or the en=\r\nergies\n&gt; that underlie creation?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Or is it the Ganas in Shiva&#39;s reti=\r\nnue?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Who are the ganas who accompany Shiva?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i saw some vide=\r\nos of ganapati &quot;drinking&quot; milk and was very impressed!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards and =\r\nbest wishes\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal=\r\n pathak&quot; vedic_pathak@\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one correction for the Mantra i=\r\nn your message.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The correct is &quot;Gam Ganapataye Nama:&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;\n&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; namaste narasimha ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does the s=\r\name apply to &quot;gam&quot;? yesterday while discussing the\n&gt; mantra &quot;Om\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gam=\r\n Ganapatiye Namah&quot; with a friend, she told me that &quot;gam&quot; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pronoun=\r\nced as &quot;gong&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
