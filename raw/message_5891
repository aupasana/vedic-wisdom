Then why not follow the=\r\n path of Love?=E2=80=9D\n\n=E2=80=9CWho said you couldn=E2=80=99t follow it? =\r\nYou can do so. But when you talk of love,\nthere is duality, is there not =\r\n=E2=80=94 the person who loves and the entity called\nGod who is loved? The =\r\nindividual is not separate from God. Hence love means\none has love towards =\r\none=E2=80=99s own Self.\n\nFor this, i.e., loving one=E2=80=99s own Self, exa=\r\nmples have been given in the\nVasudeva\nMananam, stage by stage. Man loves mo=\r\nney most; but he loves his son more\nthan money; his own body more than the =\r\nson; his indriyas (the organs of the\nbody) more than the body; the eye most=\r\n among the organs; life more than the\neye; and the self (atma) more than li=\r\nfe.\n\nThis is exemplified thus: If the son does something untoward and the\ng=\r\novernment decides to punish him for it, the parents offer money and even\nbr=\r\nibes to set him free. Hence the love towards the son is more than money.\n\nI=\r\nf, however, the government does not accept money but say that they will let=\r\n\noff the son if the father agrees to undergo the punishment himself instead=\r\n,\nthen the father\nwill say, =E2=80=98Do whatever you like with the boy; I h=\r\nave nothing to do with\nhim=E2=80=99.\n\nHence the father loves his own body m=\r\nore than his son. If a man does\nsomething for which the powers that be say =\r\nthat his eyes must be plucked\nout, he tries to save\nhis eyes by agreeing to=\r\n bodily torture; so bodily torture is preferred to\nloss of an organ.\n\nIf, h=\r\nowever, they decide to take his life by beheading him, he would be\nprepared=\r\n to lose his eyes or any other organ rather than lose his life; so\nlife (pr=\r\nana) is loved more than the organs.\n\nIn the same manner,a person who desire=\r\ns to have Atma-Anandam (bliss of the\nSelf)\nwould be prepared to lose his li=\r\nfe even, if necessary; so the Self is loved\nmore than life.\n\nHence the idea=\r\n of a person in loving God, is only with a view to being happy\nhimself. He =\r\nis, however, the embodiment of happiness and that happiness is\nGod. Who els=\r\ne is to be loved? Love itself is God,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.\n\n=E2=80=9CTha=\r\nt is why I am asking you whether God could be worshipped through the\npath o=\r\nf love?=E2=80=9D said the questioner.\n\n=E2=80=9CThat is exactly what I have=\r\n been saying. Love itself is the actual form of\nGod. If by saying, =E2=80=\r\n=98I do not love this; I do not love that=E2=80=99, you reject all\nthings, =\r\nthat which remains is Swarupa, i.e., the innate Self. That is pure\nbliss. C=\r\nall it pure\nbliss, God, atma or what you will. That is devotion; that is re=\r\nalization and\nthat is everything,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan.\n\n=E2=80=9CThe mea=\r\nning of what you say now is that we should reject all outside things\nwhich =\r\nare bad, and also all those which are good, and love God alone.\n\nIs it poss=\r\nible for anyone to reject everything, saying this is no good, that\nis no go=\r\nod,unless one experiences them?=E2=80=9D said some other.\n\n=E2=80=9CThat is=\r\n true. To reject the bad, you must love the good.In due course that\ngood al=\r\nso will appear to be an obstacle and will be rejected. Hence, you\nmust nece=\r\nssarily first love what is good. That means you must first love and\nthen re=\r\nject the thing you love.\n\nIf you thus reject everything, what remains is th=\r\ne Self alone. That is real\nlove. One who knows the secret of that love find=\r\ns the world itself full of\nuniversal love,=E2=80=9D said Bhagavan and resum=\r\ned silence.\n\nSource: Letters from Sri Ramanasramam VOLUMES I, II & Letters =\r\nfrom and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasramam By SURI NAGAMMA Translated by D.=\r\n S.
