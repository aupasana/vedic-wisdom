Wisdom- vedic or otherwise is about pursuit of the truth and n=\r\not ideology. If one considers the Veda as the sum of all knowledge, as Vidy=\r\na- then it is wrong to spend time and effort on defining it. \n\nThe word &#39;su=\r\npernatural&#39; in this context is also not an Indian or Vedic concept. In the =\r\nIndian view, everything is Prakriti- the only thing other than Prakriti is =\r\nShiva. Shiva and Prakriti are essentially two aspects of the same reality- =\r\nso where does &#39;supernatural&#39; come in to being ? Can we who are part of Prak=\r\nriti even consider anything outside prakriti ?\n\nIt is dangerous and un-prod=\r\nuctive to get into definitions- would Vedas be the Vedas of the Vedanta or =\r\nthe Vedas as defined by the Gaudiya vaishnava ? Though theoretically the sa=\r\nme, their interpretations are very different. \n\nThese questions may or may =\r\nnot help the querier take to spirituality and wisdom- but adding on additio=\r\nnal layers of definition and boxes to fit things into certainly will not he=\r\nlp. \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Puneet Banga &lt;puneetbanga15@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda may have tested his disciples through inventi=\r\non of ghosts\n&gt; so as to test which one of them is interested in authentic s=\r\npirituality and\n&gt; which one in these kinda stuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Real authentic Vedic=\r\n spirituality has no place for supernatural\n&gt; \n&gt; On Mon, Apr 4, 2011 at 8:0=\r\n9 PM, chaudhuri.krishnendu &lt;\n&gt; krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen Swami Vivekananda experienced some supernatural events in a village\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n through a man of some Chetty caste a scientific and vedantic constitution\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; like him commented a quote of Shakespeare after narrating the incident\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; through a letter to Maharaja Ajit Singh of Khetri.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Verily, ther=\r\ne are more things on heaven and earth Horatio than your\n&gt; &gt; philosophy ever=\r\n dreamt of=E2=80&quot;Shakespeare\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;prm7782&quot; &lt;prm7782@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Bhagawataas,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) I have heard tales of few hanuman devotees turning into ape.
