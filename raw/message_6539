The oyst=\r\ner floats about on the surface of the sea with its  shell wide open, for a =\r\nlittle drop of the Swati-rain(rain falling when the star Swati or Arcturus =\r\nis in the ascendant).As soon as it gets a rain drop,it dives down to the oc=\r\nean-bed and there forms a fine pearl.Like the oyster,you too should be up a=\r\nnd doing and then dive deep into the ocean of meditation.        \n    You h=\r\nave no self-reliance.Personal exertion is an indispensable    factor for su=\r\nccess in the spiritual life.Do something for a period     of atleast four y=\r\nears.Then if you do not make any tangible progress, \ncome and take me to ta=\r\nsk. \n \n\n\n\n"}}
