Here is a\nsimple description of what&#39;s involved.\n\nFirst, approach the house with auspicious items, and enter it with a lit\nfire (eg. lamp). This fire is then established in the house. Next, a big\npot of water is filled with water, and a vastu homam is performed. After\nthe homam, the house is sprinkled inside and out with the water from the\npot.\n\nIn South India, after entering the house, the first thing that is done is\nto boil some milk on the stove. Some people specifically ensure that the\nmilk boils over and a little falls out of the pot. One of the books I\nconsulted has a nice prescription -- &quot;anyasmAt pachanAt pUrvam gRhamadhye\ncarum pacet&quot;. Before any normal cooking happens in the house, first cook\nthe &#39;caru&#39; in the homa fire, and offer it to the fire. In olden days, there\nwas no stove, and all cooking was also done on a fire. Some people had a\nseparate fire for cooking and homam. Others had a single fire in which they\ncooked and did homam. As part of the griha pravesha homa, they cooked\nsomething first in the homa fire (same as cooking fire), and offered some\nof it into the fire. It is entirely possible that this became simplified\nand the tradition of cooking the caru and offering it into the fire turned\ninto heating some milk on the stove and then letting it spill on top of the\nstove !\n\nHere is a simple procedure that tries to retain the spirit of the &quot;rules&quot;.\nEnter the house with a lamp. Put it where you want to do your regular\nhomam, and establish a kalasha nearby. As part of your naivedya, keep some\nmilk in a small pot as close to the homa kunda as possible (so that it can\nabsorb the heat and get &quot;cooked&quot;). Do your regular homa. If you know how,\noffer some ahutis with the mantras for vatoshpati. When you do the\nnaivedya, offer a little of the milk into the fire (if and only if your\nfire is big enough so that it won&#39;t get extinguished). After the homam is\nover, take the water and sprinkle it all over the house. Drink the milk as\nthe prasadam.\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\r\n--089e0112c51c75e28e04e4ccfc81\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;namaste,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; how to per=\r\nform a simple purification of landed property?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A couple of traditions prescribe how to do the &quot;griha prav=\r\nesha&quot;.
