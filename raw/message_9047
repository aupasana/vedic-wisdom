It is just A SMALL STEP in =\r\novercoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n=C2=A0\nLet me give an analogy. O=\r\nne wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n body-mind comp=\r\nlex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over t=\r\nime and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally =\r\ngoes and stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of b=\r\nody experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it c=\r\nomes with risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. =\r\nSimilarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any o=\r\nut of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s w=\r\nords to Lord Rama.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, one does not get something without want=\r\ning it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desire=\r\nd a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a =\r\nresult, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironicall=\r\ny may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.\n=C2=A0\nAs you do sadha=\r\nna, try not to fancy too many specific desires. Nature has a delay mechanis=\r\nm in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give =\r\nyou right now, arising from YOUR\n OWN previous actions). So Nature sometime=\r\ns gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want somethin=\r\ng else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be =\r\nborn as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealt=\r\nh and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very h=\r\nealthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another \ncase, one may deep=\r\nly desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \nas a tiger or a dog a=\r\nnd act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \nexperience. Basically, =\r\npeople keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; someth=\r\ning they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one dee=\r\nply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s=\r\n previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one may be born=\r\n in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (if there is e=\r\nnough karmik force behind it).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n *\n=C2=A0\nKundalini rise=\r\n is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of a=\r\nttitude and detachment.\n=C2=A0\nOnce I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap.=\r\n I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently.=\r\n I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would=\r\n kill it!\n=C2=A0\nWe are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called =\r\nthis body-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow deat=\r\nh!\n=C2=A0\nIf our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex=\r\n) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a=\r\n complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this bo=\r\ndy-mind complex, without being scared?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nKundal=\r\nini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better tha=\r\nn Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still =\r\nleft in one&#39;s system.\n=C2=A0\nWhen one transcends one problematic notion abo=\r\nut who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in =\r\nconsciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes t=\r\nhe notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind c=\r\nomplex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a great lead=\r\ner, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if one pers=\r\non had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world, he ma=\r\ny fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world now. Wh=\r\nen one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such notion,=\r\n it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and yet rem=\r\nain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n=C2=A0\nAn awakened Kundalini in a sys=\r\ntem with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong=\r\n notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe best approach I recommend is to NOT think i=\r\nn terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n weakness=\r\nes and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that d=\r\netachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Dis=\r\ngust is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n\nDon&#39;t worry about \nwhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about=\r\n whether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondag=\r\nes (ashta pashas) or \nnot. If your ability to resist them is increasing, yo=\r\nu are making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still=\r\n making progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-a=\r\nwareness) \nwill automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Sel=\r\nf).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne word on surrendering to a personal de=\r\nity. Though true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They sim=\r\nply do business with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this i=\r\ns the plain and bare fact.\n=C2=A0\n&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please =\r\ngive it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and plea=\r\nse protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you w=\r\nant and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desire=\r\ns, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fasci=\r\nnation for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord=\r\n throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s p=\r\nrasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with =\r\nfascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and during) Death.\n=C2=A0\nIf=\r\n one without true surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experie=\r\nnces a Kundalini rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a pers=\r\nonal god. It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. =\r\nIt is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk g=\r\nlued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was s=\r\ncared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s protec=\r\ntion! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger tha=\r\nt one should run away from!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nWhether through th=\r\ne path of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize t=\r\nhat all this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you=\r\n have and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime.=\r\n Only detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, =\r\ndislikes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. H=\r\neavy conditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundal=\r\nini (self-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n=C2=A0\nThe real k=\r\ney is how light your conditioning is.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------=\r\n--\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n-----=\r\n---\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Leela Sastry &lt;leela=\r\n.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;=C2=A0YES=C2=A0 SIR=C2=A0 , perf=\r\nectly correct=C2=A0=C2=A0 ,=C2=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagathi=C2=A0 =\r\nmakes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdl=\r\nes .=C2=A0=C2=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity =\r\nand manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who pl=\r\nay havoc with the=C2=A0 psyche .=C2=A0 Once we are under the protection of=\r\n=C2=A0 a mahadevatha ,all the other=C2=A0 disturbances will definitely=C2=\r\n=A0 be wiped off .

Const=\r\nant efforts of purification of the various elements that compose the human =\r\nmind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into more detachment,=\r\n more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lust, greed etc =\r\netc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, one has to now =\r\nself identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of a far more in=\r\ntense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey. 3 - A good g=\r\nuru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really does - it ca=\r\nn also open up the mind and body to various other things and entities, some=\r\n of which are not postive in nature while some of them are useless, and giv=\r\nen half a chance can make use of the individual for its own ends. They take=\r\n hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and miss-utilizes the s=\r\name. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n vital. 4 - While someda=\r\ny or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalini Shakti aweken=\r\ning and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are because of this. The =\r\nhuman psychology as understood by west today is puerile and insufficient to=\r\n deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes that the aura of a=\r\nn individual, which protects us from various subtle influences and helps us=\r\n to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reason=\r\ns, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. That can allow fr=\r\nee assess of various entities inside the mind and they have chances of caus=\r\ning serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and various possiblitie=\r\ns are there, it is not possible to list down every option. Moreover, even i=\r\nf such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have the right knowledge=\r\n to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, are often doing n=\r\nothing more than an intelligent guess work.\n Sometimes it will have results=\r\n, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting point is a soun=\r\nd mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - Mens sana in co=\r\nrpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyant=\r\nE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nFrom: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of=\r\n kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I a=\r\nm doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of =\r\nsomeone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kun=\r\ndalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surge=\r\ns of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of=\r\n kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. =\r\nWe have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests=\r\n normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many peopl=\r\ne we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or=\r\n unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and =\r\nresearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these pati=\r\nents are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatme=\r\nnts for deranged kundalini,\n we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to fo=\r\nrcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeli=\r\nng that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill =\r\nherself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. =\r\nShe feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. =\r\nI wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was=\r\n to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve th=\r\ne suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to=\r\n bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, =\r\nand for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really i=\r\ns pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in thi=\r\ns situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. =\r\nIt is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kunda=\r\nlini rising bit to\n God&#39;s will.

One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (t=\r\nhis\n body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first construc=\r\nt the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, i=\r\nf one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construction (a=\r\nnalogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achieve=\r\nment? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and one lo=\r\nses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self-realiz=\r\nation without any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Mah=\r\narshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, one does not g=\r\net something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. O=\r\nne may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have=\r\n put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be =\r\nunprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this lif=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific\n desi=\r\nres. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of cons=\r\ntraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR\n OWN previ=\r\nous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no=\r\n longer want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great=\r\n wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next li=\r\nfe. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the li=\r\nfe after that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money=\r\n. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;In another=\r\n \ncase, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \na=\r\ns a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \nexp=\r\nerience. Basically, people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362=\r\n067846619_141&quot;&gt;keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking=\r\n&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundali=\r\nni, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kunda=\r\nlini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, o=\r\nne may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify =\r\n(if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one is w=\r\nell-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Once I saw a=\r\n chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly=\r\n and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain slow deat=\r\nh and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We are like that chi=\r\npmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scared of =\r\nbeing rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If our ideas about wh=\r\no we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and if we are t=\r\nhis &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realization of that a=\r\nt some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, without being =\r\nscared?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise after most =\r\nundesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than\n Kundalini rise fo=\r\nrced when some really undesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s syste=\r\nm.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one transcends one problematic notion about who one is=\r\n and what one needs, another notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness=\r\n may spring to the surface and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I =\r\nam the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that o=\r\nne&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_13=\r\n62067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;userContent&quot;&gt;e.g. a great doctor, a great l=\r\neader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;/span&gt;). As an extreme example, i=\r\nf one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the wo=\r\nrld, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the wor=\r\nld now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any su=\r\nch notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress a=\r\nnd yet remain in ignorance and get stuck\n badly.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An awakened K=\r\nundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s wea=\r\nknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritu=\r\nal problems.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui=\r\n_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_158&quot;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think =\r\nin terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n weaknes=\r\nses and improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that =\r\ndetachment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Di=\r\nsgust is the other side of coin of attachment.&lt;/span&gt; It is a negative atta=\r\nchment.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.33=\r\n33px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;=\r\nfont-style:normal;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_155&quot;&gt;D&lt;spa=\r\nn id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;on&#39;t worry about \nwheth=\r\ner your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to\n resist=\r\n 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \nnot. If y=\r\nour ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN IF =\r\nyour Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you comp=\r\nletely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \nwill automatically a=\r\nscend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;y=\r\niv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_57&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_13=\r\n62067846619_58&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:aria=\r\nl, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:nor=\r\nmal;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Thou=\r\ngh true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do bu=\r\nsiness with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the pla=\r\nin and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I want X, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yu=\r\ni_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_13620678=\r\n46619_141&quot;&gt;I will pray to you and &lt;/span&gt;please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scare=\r\nd of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please protect\n me&quot; - all this =\r\nis just a business deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it=\r\n. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations=\r\n. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities o=\r\nf Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether=\r\n it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gra=\r\ntefully. True surrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, =\r\neven in the face of (and during) Death.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one without true su=\r\nrrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini ris=\r\ne, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not =\r\nthat god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about prot=\r\necting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; =\r\nexample above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, on=\r\ne&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s\n protection! God&#39;s protect=\r\nion may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one should run aw=\r\nay from!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_136206784=\r\n6619_141&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_141&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Whether through the path of wisdom or surrender, =\r\ndevelop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this is temporary and c=\r\nan be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and keep doing your best,=\r\n but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachment and a very lig=\r\nht mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc) can protect one a=\r\ns one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditioning and impuritie=\r\ns in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awareness) and stop H=\r\ner from meeting True Self.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The real key is how light your cond=\r\nitioning is.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Best\n regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_59&quot; id=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_60&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-s=\r\nize:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:t=\r\nransparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui=\r\n_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_165&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_13620=\r\n67846619_62&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_65&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;margin-top:5=\r\npx;padding-left:5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_1=\r\n68&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_69&quot; style=3D&quot;font-famil=\r\ny:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui=\r\n_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_167&quot;\n class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_13620678466=\r\n19_70&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-si=\r\nze:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1=\r\n&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Leela Sastry &lt;=\r\nleela.sastry@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n Thursday, Febr=\r\nuary 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div =\r\nid=3D&quot;yiv859889683&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv859889683ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div=\r\n class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_79&quot; style=3D&quot;color:#000;ba=\r\nckground-color:#fff;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;fon=\r\nt-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadev=\r\natha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;Al=\r\nl the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow =\r\nthe other entities to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the&=\r\nnbsp; psyche .&nbsp; Once we are under the protection of&nbsp; a mahadevath=\r\na ,all the other&nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various=\r\n elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this=\r\n translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, c=\r\nontrol of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini a=\r\nwakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater=\r\n force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes =\r\ncare of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - I=\r\nF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to variou=\r\ns other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature while =\r\nsome of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use\n of the\n ind=\r\nividual\n for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=\r\nr and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=\r\ns even more vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an ex=\r\nperience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of p=\r\nsychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west t=\r\noday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also po=\r\nssible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from var=\r\nious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can g=\r\net &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifest=\r\nyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the=\r\n mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are v=\r\nery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list =\r\ndown every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly\n done, v=\r\nery few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who cla=\r\nim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess w=\r\nork. Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ach=\r\nieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient G=\r\nreeks used to say - &lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv859889683st&quot;&gt;Mens sana in corpore san=\r\no.&lt;/span&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv859889683MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv8=\r\n59889683Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:rgb(153,153,153);&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv859889683Apple-style-span&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT=\r\n-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_=\r\n3_2_0_2_134243527249950 yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_92&quot;&gt;awaktam =\r\nwyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY=\r\n:Verdana;COLOR:navy;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_2_0_2_13424=\r\n3506227946 yiv859889683yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_17=\r\n_1362045432997_73 yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_93&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwya=\r\nyamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_95&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;FONT-SI=\r\nZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv859889683yui_3_7_2_19_1362067846619_96&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTO=\r\nM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER=\r\n-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv859889683hr&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &l=\r\nt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:=\r\nbold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndro=\r\nme&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv859889683&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;d=\r\niv id=3D&quot;yiv859889683ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people =\r\nof kundalini syndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I=\r\n am doing a psychiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care o=\r\nf someone who seems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their k=\r\nundalini since childhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and sur=\r\nges of energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard =\r\nof kundalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation=\r\n. We have not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tes=\r\nts normal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many peo=\r\nple we call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, =\r\nor unwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest an=\r\nd research into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these pa=\r\ntients are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treat=\r\nments\n for deranged kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to =\r\nforcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my fee=\r\nling that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kil=\r\nl herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad=\r\n. She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from=\r\n. I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical one w=\r\nas to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve =\r\nthe suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength =\r\nto bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her=\r\n, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really=\r\n is pitiable. And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in t=\r\nhis situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest=\r\n. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your\n instrument&quot; and leave the ku=\r\nndalini rising bit to God&#39;s will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; =\r\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---770455430-874971292-1362106383=:20980--\r\n\n"}}
