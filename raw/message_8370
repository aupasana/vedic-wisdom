The hate has to consume you,lets sa=\r\ny you hate Vishnu so much that all day long you are lost in chanting &quot;vishn=\r\nu ki bhen ki.....&quot; , but it has to be all day long, have to be with a passi=\r\non that consumes your entire existence. You have to have so much anger ever=\r\ny time you hear Vishnu&#39;s name, you go into a murderous rage.\n\nIt happened w=\r\nith a certain Mr Hiranyakasipu, and guess what???\nThe lord himself came.\n\nO=\r\nh the blessing!!!!!\nHe died in mere maalik&#39;s lap, what would I not give giv=\r\ne to have that....... What a fine death. The ripping up of the intestines i=\r\nn most photos you see holds a very different meaning than most people inter=\r\npret it as.\n\nHell due to his hatred, bhagwaan had to himself come to take h=\r\nim. Whether he came to teach Mr Sipu&#39;s (nick name) a lesson or not, it stil=\r\nl must have been a fine darshan. Point is the lord comming.\n\nHell due to Ra=\r\navan&#39;s madness, the lord in his form of the incharge of preservation and th=\r\ne form incharge of destruction had to go to collect him. Not many understan=\r\nd Ravan, he is infact far beyond us to understand. His penance was so inten=\r\nse, that, khair chuck it, whats the point, it will lead to more misinterpre=\r\ntation.\n\nThe esoteric meaning of the  story of Mr Hiranyakasipu is mentione=\r\nd in a book, I think people who have read the book will know which one it i=\r\ns. Its the 2nd part of a trilogy that I consider to be on and above par wit=\r\nh any religious/spiritual text out there, provided you understand ts true m=\r\neaning, which takes a lot of effort than merely reading the books.\n\nAnyways=\r\n, So does that mean you keep on abusing god???\nNope I am not advocating tha=\r\nt BUT\nYou can if you wish to, but do it so, that with your rage you destroy=\r\n &quot;yourself&quot;, which is the point of any sadhana ,any ritual anyways. But no =\r\n- one barring a few are intense enough these days to do that, and the inten=\r\nse ones are too much in love and don&#39;t have a reason to consider this.\n\nPoi=\r\nnt of Mr Utpal&#39;s story is something else all together,\nits with dedication =\r\nand discipline that man reached over to the temple to hit god, no matter wh=\r\nat came he still went to hurl his choicest abuses, the devotee didn&#39;t go to=\r\n worship on that stormy day. The abuser&#39;s devotion to abuse is much higher =\r\nthan that of the devotee&#39;s worship.\n\nThought the devotee is dear to god, th=\r\ne abuser&#39;s devotion to abuse brought the lord down from his abode. Same dev=\r\notion Meera has that for Lord Krishna. Where will Krishna hide, if somebody=\r\n has that kind of devotion.\n\nIts called the &quot;paagal kutta&quot; way. You know ho=\r\nw paagal kutte are?? If they catch hold of your pyjama, no matter you burst=\r\n its head open with a stick it will not let go without tearing you pant off=\r\n, kuch bhi karlo nahin chhore ga. After all pagal hain If you become a paga=\r\nl kutta for god, no matter if god destroys &quot;your&quot; money, &quot;your&quot; family, &quot;yo=\r\nur&quot; everything and yet you still hang on, you, my son will be made.\n\nBecome=\r\n a paagal kutta either with anger or love, same thing, point is to not let =\r\ngo.\n\nBete, try to understand the madness behind that man&#39;s (Story) anger, d=\r\nevelop that madness tab toh baat hai nahin toh lage raho bhagwaan ki photo =\r\nko laat maarne, paer hi tutega aur kuch nahin hoga.\nHe could have chosen no=\r\nt to go because of the storm, like the devotee. The devotee chose his own c=\r\nomfort, ignored his lord&#39;s comfort, but the abuser, hell no. He went alrigh=\r\nt.\n\nI&#39;ll tell you one story more story, interpret it the way you wish to , =\r\nI don&#39;t care.\nThere was a man in Benaras, one day right before his daily ho=\r\nmam, when he was cutting gola naariyal for the homam, the knife slit throug=\r\nh his entire palm, and severed one nerve. It was a pool of blood.Hell there=\r\n was so much blood,his sister freaked out, but that man was thinking of off=\r\nering it to his mother. What the fuck, you must be thinking?? In his pain h=\r\ne was thinking of his mother who is known to accept blood.\nWhat next, he go=\r\nt into a ritual to offer that blood, then went to the nursery home to get s=\r\ntitches, and when he got back he did his homam, with one hand totally in ba=\r\nndage and paining like a bitch.\n\nMentally he told god ,&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; kya aapko kya l=\r\naga aisle hi chor doonga????, nahin kakaji, aise nahin, hum bhi aashiq sadi=\r\nyon puraane, chaen tu maane ya na maane &quot;&quot;&quot;\n\nBut then that&#39;s why the world =\r\ncalls him insane.\n\nNobody is a fool in spending time to love god, understan=\r\nd the point of the story, and not get lost in the words.\n\n&quot;&quot;\nAbsolute stupi=\r\ndity,please don&#39;t preach any further leave it for the wise they know better=\r\n. &quot;&quot;&quot;\nGet us a wise person on this board please. We(members) already have M=\r\nr Rao, Mr nandy,and a couple more, we&#39;ll enjoy more company, please get us =\r\nmore.\nAnyways, Utpal is far more wiser than many of us(members) combined.\nN=\r\now utpal will come in and say &quot;no, no, no&quot;, but that was the whole story to=\r\n begin with , ha!!\n\nUn Paagal kuton ki jai ho jo bhagwaan ke pyjama phaarne=\r\n mein lage huein hain!!!\nla ilaha illa allah!!!\n\nNamaste,\nnobody\n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;xabc955&quot; &lt;xabc955@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr. Utpal \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; What bakwaas ?

It becomes a play, a play of that only thos=\r\ne two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little point about =\r\nlove these days, One day a man who is in love with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sun, was doi=\r\nng homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open field wi=\r\nth no shade, in a temperature of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was swea=\r\nting profusely as expected. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat=\r\n coming into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in s=\r\nhame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summ=\r\ners, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body =\r\nis trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for hi=\r\nm in the winters calling him, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in su=\r\nmmers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see=\r\n his face, is this my fucking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his l=\r\nove, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man=\r\n was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because=\r\n after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;s=\r\nhine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing so=\r\nngs of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love=\r\n, its mere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still giv=\r\nes gives and gives, after all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesi=\r\ns, which leads to oxygen which leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is =\r\ngod&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which l=\r\neads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns fo=\r\nr us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet=\r\n what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nbirths combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outside of all this wors=\r\nhip business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These day=\r\ns, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automat=\r\nically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\ne man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll t=\r\nell you another story, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nlove with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I mysel=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our =\r\nmother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her fro=\r\nm god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule=\r\n????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad=\r\n ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mu=\r\njhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is fa=\r\nr more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are sure to get the one you\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yea=\r\nh right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for=\r\n love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protec=\r\nt her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, beca=\r\nuse I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, a=\r\nnd when did i become big enough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh t=\r\noh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so in=\r\ntense, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deser=\r\nve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You =\r\n, my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ngirl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims =\r\nto have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He su=\r\nrrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it shou=\r\nld be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass war=\r\nming it up and saying what do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do,=\r\n kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they a=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in be=\r\ntween.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a d=\r\nisprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the=\r\n surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one =\r\nand the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest,=\r\n ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A d=\r\nog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that=\r\n is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chi=\r\ncken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his ma=\r\nster doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Beca=\r\nuse doggy wants master, food is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate do=\r\nggy with us , and master with god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are ne=\r\nver happy with what the master brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting bu=\r\ntter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame w=\r\naale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo har=\r\ni bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we=\r\n subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no =\r\nno, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If yo=\r\nu only want him, why are you so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\ne are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we =\r\nread\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere th=\r\nere, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is mental masturbation, its an illusion just li=\r\nke porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk o=\r\nn the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salut=\r\ne you.

It becomes a play, a play of that only those two lovers can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nunderstand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little point about love these days, One day =\r\na man who is in love with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday af=\r\nternoon, in Hyderabad, in an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a tempera=\r\nture of 47 degree centigrades and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expecte=\r\nd. He was getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Su=\r\nddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you a=\r\nre comfortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and ask=\r\ned himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go aw=\r\nay this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself =\r\ndown with sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling =\r\nhim, coming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wi=\r\nsh to drive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fuc=\r\nking love??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;w=\r\nah pitaji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologi=\r\nzed profusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he =\r\nis the sun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no=\r\n matter what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a=\r\n joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, ye=\r\nt in summers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and sin=\r\nce that orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after=\r\n all because of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen =\r\nwhich leads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Wit=\r\nhout him, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no =\r\nmba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he lov=\r\nes us, true love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, w=\r\ne don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI am talking about people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n there are quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl =\r\nand she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for=\r\n that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a =\r\nwhore!!!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, th=\r\nere is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl.=\r\n The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is obli=\r\nvious to his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don=\r\n&#39;t ask me why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He =\r\nis ridiculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked h=\r\nim if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he s=\r\nlapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother w=\r\nill decide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata=\r\n-oon ki mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n chahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; quite a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that =\r\nwho told you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nYou love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nslap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can a=\r\nsk from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for=\r\n her. The moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be del=\r\nivered, but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big =\r\nenough to know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, =\r\nwho jaane.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself s=\r\nhould come and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather =\r\nprefer that she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, b=\r\necause if I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually h=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how =\r\ncan then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhe=\r\nnge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial.=\r\n That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying wha=\r\nt do I need to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ap=\r\ne baap ki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you d=\r\no your duty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the res=\r\nults are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you act=\r\nually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couns=\r\nelor, believe you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n in a jhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this plane=\r\nt, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail of=\r\nf by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He=\r\n doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food.=\r\n His master brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still=\r\n the tail is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, f=\r\nood is an afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master =\r\nwith god, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the m=\r\naster brings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala l=\r\neke aaya paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nah=\r\nin kar rahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the =\r\nfood, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I=\r\n only want him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are =\r\nyou so shit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, alway=\r\ns SUBCONSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji brings =\r\nus that bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, =\r\nbut we rarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thoug=\r\nht. Tails of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the gr=\r\neat dogs, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. Th=\r\nat is mental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Sir, if you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.
