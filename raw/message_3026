It is a state of=\r\n intense mental concentration on something.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Kalpa means create or=\r\n perceive (the word kalpana is from the same root). Vikalpa means existence=\r\n of variety. Savikalpa means &quot;with vikalpa&quot;. Savikalpa samadhi is a state o=\r\nf intense concentration of the mind, while creational variety or objectific=\r\nation still exists in the mind. One perceives that there is an &quot;I&quot; and ther=\r\ne are &quot;other&quot; objects (e.g. deities, demons, people etc). But one is able t=\r\no focus the mind intensely on one object (e.g. a deity) and able to achieve=\r\n oneness with that object. Even reaching savikalpa samadhi is a tremendous =\r\nthing and many great yogis also cannot go beyond savikalpa samadhi.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; In nirvikalpa samadhi, the creational variety and objectification ceases=\r\n (nirvikalpa=3Dnir+vikalpa, nir=3Ddevoid of). Mind reaches a state where th=\r\nere is no perception of I and &quot;other&quot; objects. One&#39;s consciousness is absor=\r\nbed in supreme consciousness (Brahman or Aatman), without any perception of=\r\n a variety of objects. This state is reached by very very few yogis.\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is a state where the mind is *simultaneously* perceiving=\r\n a variety of objects *and* absorbed in the supreme consciousness!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When one is normally perceiving a variety o=\r\nbjects, one&#39;s mind is absorbed in an *individualized* consciousness that is=\r\n colored with the conditioning of that individual&#39;s experiences over variou=\r\ns lives. When one sees a beautiful person, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoug=\r\nhts (depending on the experiences, values and desires accumulated from many=\r\n lives). When somebody is praising one, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts=\r\n. When somebody is criticizing one, one&#39;s mind may get certain thoughts. An=\r\nd so on. One&#39;s mind has likes, dislikes, attractions, repulsions etc, based=\r\n on the accumulated experiences, values and desires of that individualized =\r\nconsciousness.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In sahaja samadhi, one has no individualized consc=\r\niousness and one&#39;s mind is absorbed in the infinite supreme consciousness t=\r\nhat is not colored by the experiences and conditioning of a single individu=\r\nal. One is actively living in the material world; one&#39;s mind is perceiving =\r\nvarious objects of various attributes through jnanendriyas; and, one&#39;s mind=\r\n is engaging in various actions in the material world though karmendriyas. =\r\nYet, one has no individualized conditioning or I-ness.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Very very =\r\nvery few beings, mostly re-incarnations of rishis and gods, can reach that =\r\nstate. For most others, that state is not really a possibility.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I gave an analogy earlier to explain various a=\r\nspects of consciousness, using parts of a computer.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ahamkaara (I-=\r\nness) - CPU\n&gt; &gt; chitta (conditioning) - DRAM\n&gt; &gt; buddhi - ALU or logic copr=\r\nocessor\n&gt; &gt; manas - I/O controller\n&gt; &gt; jnanendriyas - input channels\n&gt; &gt; ka=\r\nrmendriyas - output channels\n&gt; &gt; praanas - on-board power supply\n&gt; &gt; deha (=\r\nbody) - mechanical parts, chassis etc\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Normally, CPU is running a =\r\ncomplex program where a lot of input channels and output channels are activ=\r\ne. DRAM has a lot of stored data and CPU is refreshing it frequently. ALU i=\r\ns running several algorithms based on stored data and a lot of I/O data get=\r\ns stored/retrieved from DRAM all the time. This is analogous to a person&#39;s =\r\nnormal state.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi is like a state where the comput=\r\ner is in a power standby. On-board power supply is hardly supplying any pow=\r\ner, all input and output channels are turned off, I/O controller is turned =\r\noff and ALU is not running any algorithms. If a computer goes into power st=\r\nandy and exits it quickly, it will resume what it was doing before. Similar=\r\nly, a person reaching nirvikalpa samadhi and leaving it quickly will resume=\r\n previous activities. If a computer stays in the power standby for too long=\r\n, it will be turned off and its state may be lost, i.e. it cannot resume. I=\r\nf one stays in nirvikalpa samadhi for too long, one will simply merge in Br=\r\nahman and cannot resume previous activities.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Sahaja samadhi is ak=\r\nin to a computer running a bare minimum program that accesses a program run=\r\nning on a central super computer on a network. CPU, ALU, memory etc are run=\r\nning on a central super computer and our individual computer&#39;s CPU simply h=\r\nas a small routine that accesses the results of the algorithm running on th=\r\ne super computer and controls the local I/O controller accordingly. There i=\r\nsn&#39;t much data stored locally and there is no algorithm running locally. On=\r\ne&#39;s praanas are supplying power, one&#39;s jnanendriyas are getting inputs and =\r\none&#39;s karmendriyas are engaging in actions, one&#39;s manas is controlling this=\r\n Input/Ouput activity and ahamkara (CPU) is controlling all this by running=\r\n a small program that accesses a super computer that is monitoring all the =\r\ncomputers of the world and deciding what this computer should do.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; As I said, very very very few beings can rea=\r\nch sahaja samadhi and it is beyond the reach of even the greatest yogis. As=\r\n I said, most yogis cannot even reach nirvikalpa samadhi. Some reach nirvik=\r\nalpa samadhi, come back to regular consciousness after a while and start to=\r\n accumulate conditioning again (chitta, i.e. DRAM). The CPU is running some=\r\n program or the other, however small, and accumulating more data in DRAM an=\r\nd building up an algorithm in ALU. Minimization of I-ness is possible, but =\r\nelimination of I-ness while embodied is very difficult! If any limited I-ne=\r\nss is left and any conditioning (I am this, I need this, I like this etc) i=\r\ns left, then it is NOT sahaja samadhi. Sahaja samadhi is a lack of limited =\r\nindividual I-ness and connecting the supreme universal I-ness directly to o=\r\nne&#39;s mind and body.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I cannot make judgments on individual claims,=\r\n as it is none of my business. I will take on individuals only when they in=\r\nterfere with my dharma and my sense of dharma dictates that I should take t=\r\nhem on.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But the bottomline is that sahaja samadhi state is no jok=\r\ne and only yogis of an absolutely tremendous caliber reach it. Those who re=\r\nach this state are like the god - supreme cosmic being - himself.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Let me give another analogy. This life is li=\r\nke a long dream. Saviklapa samadhi is like wakig up *within* the dream. Nir=\r\nvikalpa samadhi is like waking up from the dream. Sahaja samadhi is like be=\r\ning in the dream and yet being awake.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This may confuse people, bu=\r\nt this analogy shows how complex and difficult sahaja samadhi is. The previ=\r\nous computer analogy highlights how things work in a sahaja samadhi, but do=\r\nes not show why and how difficult it is.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; What is sahaja samadhi and how is it different from nirvikalpa samadhi?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Ravishankar is=\r\n a fully Enlightened Master living in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sahaj Samadhi all times.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
