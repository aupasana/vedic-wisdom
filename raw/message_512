If you look at the nights before Vijaya Dasami, then \nthere are ten nights instead of nine this year. This happens \nsometimes.\n \nIf you live on US east coast, then Chaturthi comes \ntwices on Thursday and Friday (Oct 2 & 3). It lasted the entire Thursday and \nextended into Friday. Panchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was on Sunday \n(Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on Wednesday (Oct 9). Dasami \nis on Thursday (Oct 10).\n \nIf one&#39;s parents did not do a proper &quot;anna \npraasana&quot; ritual (the ritual of first feeding of solid food to a baby) to one, \nshould one consider oneself not entitled to eat any solid food? Not doing a \nmantra because of no initiation is basically like that.\n \nGetting initiation is good, especially if the one \ninitiating has some level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neither necessary \nnor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana.\n \nIf you see my homam document, I gave an analogy for \nthis. A millionaire may open a bank account in his son&#39;s name with a starting \nbalance of a million dollars. This is akin to a good guru initiating a sishya in \na mantra. Sishya starts off by getting some of guru&#39;s attainment. But the son \nmay waste those million dollars and end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya \nmay fall and not achieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to give \nmoney and may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions of \ndollars with own effort. This is akin to a person doing sadhana with a \nmantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.\n \nSome people hold the view that mantras cannot be \nchanted without a proper &quot;initiation&quot; . This view is especially prevalent in some \nsections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with that \nview.\n \nIf you know the mantra (!), just chant it. What \nwould an initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given some of \nhis attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if you work \nhard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taught you the right nyasas to be done before the \nmantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. Moreover, what most people \ndo today for nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally \nmeans placement. You place various sounds in various body parts (like the tips \nof various fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some \nsignals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placement&quot; is actually supposed to be an \ninternal act and it creates an ideal environment for the repetition of mantra. \nDue to the external actions, what is supposed to occur internally does not occur \nin most. So the sounds end up not getting properly placed in the body. In other \nwords, what I am trying to say is that most people do not know how to &quot;place&quot; \nvarious &quot;sounds&quot; in various body parts. They merely perform meaningless \nritualistic actions. So, if you do not know nyasas, you are not really missing \nmuch compared to others who were initiated.\n \nIn my humble opinion, the most important \nqualification is to have devotion and sense of surrender to Her.
