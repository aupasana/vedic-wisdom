The management may have put limits on\nl=\r\nength of stays in the ashram, but anyone could live outside the ashram and\n=\r\ndaily come and visit the Maharshi. The women devotees did that. Since no\nwo=\r\nmen were allowed in the ashram at night, they all had to leave after the\nev=\r\nening meals.\n\nOne day about 7 P.M., when it had already turned dark, an ind=\r\niscreet\nincident between a man and woman occurred. When Bhagavan came to kn=\r\now of it,\nhe said that the woman devotees should be fed their evening meal =\r\nby 6:30\nP.M. and then sent home.\n\nIn Bhagavan&#39;s Hall\n\nOnce T. M. P. Mahadev=\r\nan had just returned from a trip to the West. He\ndelivered lectures whereve=\r\nr he went and a number of those lectures were\nabout Bhagavan and his teachi=\r\nngs. A few of the resident devotees wanted to\nhear an example of how he lec=\r\ntured on Bhagavan. He offered to give one right\nthen and there. But before =\r\nhe could do this, permission had to be taken from\nthe office. Without undue=\r\n delay it was given. T. M. P. Mahadevan then gave a\nlecture. Except for thi=\r\ns lecture I don&#39;t ever remember anyone giving a\nlecture in the hall, althou=\r\ngh there were those whose very questions were the\nequivalent of a lecture. =\r\nUsually, such visitors wanted to show off their\nknowledge.\n\nThere was one D=\r\naivarata, a devotee of Bhagavan who had been living in the\nnorth for some y=\r\nears and who had just returned to the ashram for a visit\nafter a long absen=\r\nce. Among other things, he was known for his enthusiastic\nkirtan and dancin=\r\ng. He used to do it in earlier years before the Maharshi\nand while doing pr=\r\nadakshina of Arunachala. Some of the devotees expressed a\ndesire to see him=\r\n perform. It was arranged in the dining hall. Bhagavan sat\nwhere he usually=\r\n did at mealtime and we all sat in rows. Daivarata began\nsinging and dancin=\r\ng up and down the rows with great enthusiasm. He also sang\nGanapati Muni&#39;s =\r\n&quot;Chatvarimsat&quot; in his own melody, dancing with the tune.\n\nThe attendants us=\r\ned to spread various sheets over Bhagavan&#39;s couch, changing\nthem frequently=\r\n. Occasionally they would place a tiger&#39;s skin on the couch\nand Bhagavan wo=\r\nuld sit on that too, just like it was any other sheet. Once I\nwas sitting n=\r\near the end of Bhagavan&#39;s couch facing him. That day a tiger&#39;s\nskin had bee=\r\nn spread on the sofa and the head of the tiger was hanging over\nthe armrest=\r\n and, seemingly, staring straight at me.\n\nChadwick was also sitting in the =\r\nhall at the west end. He would usually\nfollow a punctual schedule and at ex=\r\nactly 7 P.M. he rose to leave. On his\nway out he walked up behind me and wh=\r\nispered in my ear, &quot;Do you see? There\nis Chinnaswami, the ashram tiger, sta=\r\nring straight at you.&quot; We both chuckled\nat the joke. When Chadwick went out=\r\n, Bhagavan asked me what Chadwick had\nsaid to me. When I repeated it, Bhaga=\r\nvan enjoyed the humor and we both\nlaughed.\n\nGandhians and Service\n\nOn one o=\r\nccasion, a prominent leader for the advancement of the lower classes\ncame o=\r\nn a visit. She asked Bhagavan a number of questions concerning her\nwork and=\r\n ideals. Bhagavan simply listened and remained silent. The lady\nleft. Short=\r\nly after her visit, an article written by this lady was found in\na Madras n=\r\newspaper. She wrote that she had discussed all her plans with\nBhagavan and =\r\nhe agreed with them. When Bhagavan saw this, he commented, &quot;What\ncan I do? =\r\nEven if I am silent, such statements are printed in the\nnewspapers.&quot;\n\nAdi S=\r\nhankaracharya writes that karma yoga is useful for purifying the mind.\nBut =\r\nthe purified mind has to be harnessed to some technique of spiritual\npracti=\r\nce. Only then will the sadhana be effective. Bhagavan has said that\nonly a =\r\ntrue jnani can be a true karma yogi. It is not that doing good works\nand gi=\r\nving to others is wrong. But only a jnani knows that there are no\nothers; t=\r\nhere is only the Self. Who is to give to whom?\n\nBhagavan&#39;s whole life was s=\r\nimply an offering to the world. Everything he did\nwas for others only. The =\r\nscriptures say that a jnani has no will of his own\nand whatever he does is =\r\nprompted by Ishwara, or God.Bhagavan knew that\nsocial service could tempora=\r\nrily relieve suffering to some extent. He also\nknew that the same person wh=\r\no was helped, would some day come to grief\nagain, not only later in this li=\r\nfe but in life after life. To remove all\nsuffering, to completely extinguis=\r\nh the cause of all suffering, the Maharshi\nwas born. He wanted to liberate =\r\nus from the mistaken belief that we are this\nfrail body, mind and ego. To d=\r\no this he gave the method of Self-Enquiry,\nshowed us how to practice it and=\r\n effectively aided seekers by his powerful\npresence and grace.\n\nBut even wi=\r\nth all that he taught us, there were many who came to him, stayed\nfor some =\r\ntime and then went astray. Such was the case with the pious\nattendant of Bh=\r\nagavan, Madhava.\n\nHe worked in the ashram for about ten years, mostly servi=\r\nng Bhagavan as a\npersonal attendant. At one point he seemed to have become =\r\nrestless, or\nperhaps he felt that he required rest somewhere away from the =\r\nashram. At\nthis juncture, he came to me one day and asked if I could help h=\r\nim with the\ntravel fare to Yogi Ramaih&#39;s ashram in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nUp to t=\r\nhis point Madhava was considered a model devotee. Everyone praised\nhis virt=\r\nues of steadiness, devotion and service to Bhagavan. So I was a\nlittle surp=\r\nrised when he told me he desired to leave the ashram. I asked him\nwhat Bhag=\r\navan and Chinnaswami said about his plans. He told me that they\nboth approv=\r\ned of them. Later I discovered it was not so. Bhagavan had\nrecommended that=\r\n he simply cease working for some time, take his meals in\nthe ashram and re=\r\nst, free from all responsibilities. Apparently he did not\nheed Bhagavan&#39;s a=\r\ndvice and as a result had to suffer.\n\nMadhava left the ashram as planned, b=\r\nut returned after a short time. His job\nas one of Bhagavan&#39;s attendants had=\r\n already been given to someone else.\nConsequently, he had nothing to do whe=\r\nn he returned and I would often see\nhim sitting in Bhagavan&#39;s hall. His res=\r\ntlessness persisted and it wasn&#39;t\nlong before he left the ashram again. Whe=\r\nn he returned a second time he was\nwearing ochre robes, which means he must=\r\n have been initiated into sannyas by\nsome swami during his travels. Yet he =\r\nwas still unsettled and he went away\nagain. Then, all of a sudden, we heard=\r\n he had died in Kumbhakonam under\nstrange circumstances.\n\nIt is not altoget=\r\nher uncommon for aspirants to deviate from the prescribed\npath after coming=\r\n to Bhagavan. It is only those who persist to the end with\ntheir spiritual =\r\npractice, devotion and faith that succeed. Of course,\nBhagavan&#39;s helping ha=\r\nnd is always there for those sincere sadhakas who\nstrive and reach out for =\r\nit.\n\nOnce the Sarvadhikari asked me to set my alarm so I could wake up at 2=\r\n A.M.\nIt was discovered that Bhagavan was rising at this time every night a=\r\nnd\nwalking to the latrine near the goshala. The attendants were sleeping ri=\r\nght\nthrough this and, of course, Bhagavan probably took special care not to=\r\n\ndisturb their sleep when he rose. When the Sarvadhikari discovered what wa=\r\ns\nhappening he became concerned that if Bhagavan should fall, or some other=\r\n\nmishap should occur, there would be no one to help him.\n\nSo at 2. A.M. I a=\r\nwoke and walked over and stood near Bhagavan, who was then\nreclining on the=\r\n couch outside on the verandah. When Bhagavan saw me\nstanding there he quie=\r\ntly slipped off the couch and walked to the latrine\nwith the aid of a flash=\r\nlight. I followed. No words passed between us. There\nis no doubt that Bhaga=\r\nvan understood why I was there and who requested me to\ncome at this hour of=\r\n night, yet everything transpired in silence.\n\nOn such occasions, when sile=\r\nnce prevailed, we would assume that Bhagavan\napproved or was pleased. When =\r\nhe was displeased, we could easily know, for\nhe did not hesitate to correct=\r\n us. In this way, we were always on our guard\nand alert to his will.\n\nOne d=\r\nay I received a letter from my family informing me that they were\ntraveling=\r\n to Thirupati. They requested me to leave the ashram and meet them\nthere. W=\r\nhen Bhagavan was returning from his walk and was near the well, I\nmentioned=\r\n the details of this letter to him. He made no reply. Now, how\ncould I just=\r\n leave? Normally he would indicate his approval of the plan by\nasking quest=\r\nions or commenting, and in some manner make it clear to me that\nit was all =\r\nright to go ahead. In this instance he said nothing and just kept\nwalking.\n=\r\n\nThe very next day I received another letter from my family informing me th=\r\nat\nthe trip was cancelled. How can we explain this? Is it a siddhi, a mirac=\r\nle,\nor what? Everything happened naturally in Bhagavan&#39;s presence, and he w=\r\nas\nalways so unassuming.\n\nIT WAS IN FEBRUARY of 1949 that a small growth wa=\r\ns noticed just below the\nelbow on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s left arm. When it was =\r\nfirst noticed it looked similar to\nthe size, color and shape of a black gra=\r\nm (pigeon pea).\n\nThe Maharshi was vigilantly watched and attended to twenty=\r\n-four hours a day.\nTherefore, any irregularity in his health was closely sc=\r\nrutinized by his\ncadre of devoted attendants. But how and why the tumor beg=\r\nan where it did\ncannot be established with any certainty.\n\nWhen it was firs=\r\nt noticed by the attendants, Dr. Shankar Rao, a retired\ndistrict surgeon wh=\r\no was then serving as the ashram doctor, was summoned to\nexamine it. Dr. Sr=\r\ninivasa Rao, another devotee living near the ashram, was\nalso called. After=\r\n consultation these two doctors decided that surgical\nremoval of the small =\r\ngrowth should be performed. Without much fanfare, and\nwithout the use of an=\r\n anesthetic, the growth was removed. Perhaps everyone\nthought that this min=\r\nor nuisance was now eliminated. The doctors did not\nrealize then that they =\r\nwere tampering with a fatal type of cancer called\nsarcoma.\n\nIn March of 194=\r\n9, the wound from the surgery seemed to be healing\nsatisfactorily when anot=\r\nher growth, a little higher up the arm, appeared.\nDr. Raghavachari, an emin=\r\nent surgeon from Madras, came to the ashram with\nall his instruments and re=\r\nmoved the new growth on March 27. A local\nanesthetic was used. About a mont=\r\nh after this surgery, when the doctors\nrealized that the tumor was sarcoma =\r\ncancer, radium treatments began. Also,\nin May, herbs prescribed by an ayurv=\r\nedic physician were applied to the\nwound. During all these treatments Bhaga=\r\nvan=E2=80=99s health was slowly\ndeteriorating.\n\nBhagavan moved into the New=\r\n Hall, which is connected to the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple.\nWhat is now calle=\r\nd the Nirvana Room had been built near the New Hall for\nBhagavan to rest be=\r\ntween darshan periods. A bathroom was also built onto the\nNirvana Room, all=\r\neviating the strain he experienced by walking all the way\nto the latrine ne=\r\nar the goshala. After his final surgery in December of\n1949, the Nirvana Ro=\r\nom became his full-time residence.\n\nAs time passed, Bhagavan was becoming i=\r\nncreasingly weaker. Sometimes after\ngetting up from the couch he would shak=\r\ne violently and everyone feared he\nwould fall. At such alarming times, Bhag=\r\navan would make a light comment,\nsuch as, &quot;Oh! Look at me. I am dancing.&quot; I=\r\nn this manner, he would soothe the\nanguish of his devotees. Never would he =\r\ntake his illness or weakness\nseriously, even though most of us did.\n\nOnce t=\r\nhe doctors were about to cut some tissues from the tumor so that\ntesting co=\r\nuld be done on them. When they were about to inject a local\nanesthetic to d=\r\null the pain, Bhagavan refused itand told the doctors to\nsimply cut and tak=\r\ne what they wanted. The doctors protested, explaining to\nBhagavan that the =\r\npain would be severe without the use of the injection. But\nBhagavan again r=\r\nefused and told them just to do it. They cut into the tumor\nand Bhagavan wi=\r\nnced in pain. The doctors said, Bhagavan, we told you it\nwould be painful.\n=\r\n\nBhagavan replied, &quot;Yes, the body experienced pain. But am I the body?&quot;\n\nTh=\r\nere was a large team of physicians attending to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s needs du=\r\nring\nthis surgery and throughout his illness. When so many specialists came=\r\n to\ncertain conclusions about his illness and took up procedures, surgical =\r\nor\notherwise, to cure him, Bhagavan normally went along with the treatment.=\r\n But\nwhen the tumor appeared again after the third surgery, and the doctors=\r\n\nconcluded that only by amputating the entire arm would there be any hope o=\r\nf\na cure, Bhagavan flatly rejected the option.\n\nOn the evening of December =\r\n19th, I was one among a group of devotees\nstanding north of the Nirvana Roo=\r\nm waiting to hear news about Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\ncondition. The fourth and f=\r\ninal operation had been executed on that day,\nonce again in the dispensary.=\r\n\n\nDoraiswamy Iyer, who had been influential in bringing together prominent\n=\r\nphysicians for the two major surgeries on Bhagavan, came to where we were\ns=\r\ntanding and informed us about his condition. &quot;Whether or not the surgery\nwa=\r\ns successful, can be determined only after three months,&quot; he said.\nBhagavan=\r\n remained in the dispensary for eighteen days recovering from the\noperation=\r\n. Then around midnight, he shifted to the Nirvana Room.\n\nWhen Bhagavan was =\r\nin the last stages of his illness he insisted on giving\ndarshan twice a day=\r\n. A reclining chair was placed in the small passage in\nfront of the Nirvana=\r\n Room. He would repose there facing west towards the\nverandah of the Mother=\r\n=E2=80=99s Temple, and the devotees would sit or stand on the\nverandah sile=\r\nntly looking at him, or sit meditating with closed eyes. Those\ndevotees who=\r\n were permitted to have a bedside meeting with him would come\naround from e=\r\nast of the Nirvana Room and enter. At this time, because of the\nseverity of=\r\n his illness, the Sarvadhikari rarely gave permission for\nseparate meetings=\r\n with Bhagavan.\n\nIn February of 1950, a new cancerous growth appeared. Many=\r\n devotees began to\nlose all hope that his life would be spared. On the othe=\r\nr hand, there were\nothers that resolutely declared that Bhagavan would neve=\r\nr die from this\ndisease, as if it was inadmissible that a sage like Bhagava=\r\nn could succumb\nto a common mortal affliction.\n\nOne day I received a messag=\r\ne from the office that I should accompany the\ndoctors to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s=\r\n room when they go again to clean his wound and change\nhis bandages. I do n=\r\not know why I was asked to do this. Perhaps Bhagavan\ndidn=E2=80=99t see me =\r\nat darshan time and inquired about me, or possibly for some\nother reason th=\r\ne Sarvadhikari felt I should go to Bhagavan in his room.\n\nWhen I walked int=\r\no the Nirvana Room Bhagavan simply rested his benevolent\ngaze on me and sai=\r\nd nothing. Then he slowly stretched out his left arm and\nthe doctors began =\r\ntheir work. The bandage was drenched with blood; the wound\nwas large and pi=\r\ntiful to look at; the pain must have been extreme. Bhagavan\ncalmly turned h=\r\nis head to the side and the doctors went about their\nbusiness. I was amazed=\r\n to observe his total detachment. It seemed to me that\nhe looked on this pa=\r\ninful affair as if it was happening to a body other than\nhis own. I can nev=\r\ner forget that sight. Bhagavan always told us that he was\nnot the body. Dur=\r\ning his last days, in the midst of tremendous suffering, he\ndemonstrated it=\r\n.\n\nBhagavan=E2=80=99s tumor had grown to the size of a cauliflower, blood w=\r\nas oozing\nbetween the buds and his whole arm was blackened. A doctor friend=\r\n, who was\nexperienced in all aspects relating to this type of cancer, told =\r\nme that the\npain associated with it at this stage of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s ill=\r\nness would be similar\nto the suffering experienced if a fully-loaded lorry =\r\nran over your arm.\n\nDoctors also decided that Bhagavan should be allowed to=\r\n eat whatever food he\ndesired. Throughout the course of his treatments, eac=\r\nh discipline of\nmedicine he was under had certain dietary restrictions. Oft=\r\nen Bhagavan was\nrequired to consume items he would not ordinarily eat, or p=\r\nrefer to eat. But\nin spite of the doctors=E2=80=99 decision about his diet,=\r\n Bhagavan was not allowed\nto eat the iddlies and chilly powder he requested=\r\n during the last month of\nhis life.\n\nOut of all the doctors attending on Bh=\r\nagavan, it was only the allopathic\ndoctors that didn=E2=80=99t boast they c=\r\nould cure Bhagavan. The doctors from other\ndisciplines would confidently an=\r\nnounce that Bhagavan could be cured. Of\ncourse, during the final stages of =\r\nhis illness, when all hope was lost,\nthere was little boasting. All the dif=\r\nferent systems of medicine, all the\nbest doctors and surgeons and all of th=\r\ne latest medical treatments and\ntechnologies failed.Throughout it all, Bhag=\r\navan remained what he always was:\na spectator in this world drama, ever rev=\r\neling in the Self.\n\nOn April 14th, a bulletin was released to the news serv=\r\nice from the office,\nstating that Bhagavan was no longer giving darshan.By =\r\nbroadcasting this\ninformation the management thought the pressing throng of=\r\n devotees would\ndisperse. When this news reached Bhagavan, he immediately o=\r\nrdered the\nSarvadhikari to withdraw the bulletin. In no way would he discon=\r\ntinue giving\ndarshan. Even on this last day, when Bhagavan was in the throe=\r\ns of death, he\ninsisted on giving darshan as usual between the hours of 5 a=\r\nnd 6 p.m. He\ndemanded that the devotees should not be prevented from seeing=\r\n him.\n\nAfter the Mahasamadhi\n\nON APRIL 16, the day after Bhagavan=E2=80=99s=\r\n body was buried, I gathered all my\nbelongings and left on the noon train f=\r\nor Madras. At that time, I didn=E2=80=99t\nknow when, or if, I would be retu=\r\nrning to the ashram. Many prominent\ndevotees also began leaving Tiruvannama=\r\nlai. Everybody was selling off their\nproperties, the ashram=E2=80=99s incom=\r\ne dramatically fell and the Mauni, Srinivasa\nRao, was scheming to seize con=\r\ntrol of the ashram; even before Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\ndemise he was scheming.\n=\r\n\nAfter one year, I again returned to the ashram to attend Bhagavan=E2=80=99=\r\ns aradhana\ncelebration. The ashram was struggling to stay afloat financiall=\r\ny.

The women devotees did that.=\r\n=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Since no women were allowed in the a=\r\nshram at night, they all had to leave after the evening meals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;One day about 7 P.M., when it had alr=\r\neady turned dark, an indiscreet incident between a man and woman occurred. =\r\nWhen Bhagavan came to know of it, he said that the woman devotees should be=\r\n fed their evening meal by 6:30 P.M. and then sent home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In Bhagavan&#39;s Hall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Once T. M. P. Mahadevan had just returned from a=\r\n trip to the West. He delivered lectures wherever he went and a number of t=\r\nhose lectures were about Bhagavan and his teachings. A few of the resident =\r\ndevotees wanted to hear an example of how he lectured on Bhagavan. He offer=\r\ned to give one right then and there. But before he could do this, permissio=\r\nn had to be taken from the office. Without undue delay it was given. T. M. =\r\nP. Mahadevan then gave a lecture. Except for this lecture I don&#39;t ever =\r\nremember anyone giving a lecture in the hall, although there were those who=\r\nse very questions were the equivalent of a lecture. Usually, such visitors =\r\nwanted to show off their knowledge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-sty=\r\nle:italic&quot;&gt;There was one Daivarata, a devotee of Bhagavan who had been livi=\r\nng in the north for some years and who had just returned to the ashram for =\r\na visit after a long absence. Among other things, he was known for his enth=\r\nusiastic kirtan and dancing. He used to do it in earlier years before the M=\r\naharshi and while doing pradakshina of Arunachala. Some of the devotees exp=\r\nressed a desire to see him perform. It was arranged in the dining hall. Bha=\r\ngavan sat where he usually did at mealtime and we all sat in rows. Daivarat=\r\na began singing and dancing up and down the rows with great enthusiasm. He =\r\nalso sang Ganapati Muni&#39;s &quot;Chatvarimsat&quot; in his own melody, d=\r\nancing with the tune.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The attendants used to spread various=\r\n sheets over Bhagavan&#39;s couch, changing them frequently. Occasionally t=\r\nhey would place a tiger&#39;s skin on the couch and Bhagavan would sit on t=\r\nhat too, just like it was any other sheet. Once I was sitting near the end =\r\nof Bhagavan&#39;s couch facing him. That day a tiger&#39;s skin had been sp=\r\nread on the sofa and the head of the tiger was hanging over the armrest and=\r\n, seemingly, staring straight at me.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ita=\r\nlic&quot;&gt;Chadwick was also sitting in the hall at the west end. He would usuall=\r\ny follow a punctual schedule and at exactly 7 P.M. he rose to leave. On his=\r\n way out he walked up behind me and whispered in my ear, &quot;Do you see? =\r\nThere is Chinnaswami, the ashram tiger, staring straight at you.&quot; We b=\r\noth chuckled at the joke. When Chadwick went out, Bhagavan asked me what Ch=\r\nadwick had said to me. When I repeated it, Bhagavan enjoyed the humor and w=\r\ne both laughed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Gandhians =\r\nand Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On one occasion, a prominent leader for the advan=\r\ncement of the lower classes came on a visit. She asked Bhagavan a number of=\r\n questions concerning her work and ideals. Bhagavan simply listened and rem=\r\nained silent. The lady left. Shortly after her visit, an article written by=\r\n this lady was found in a Madras newspaper. She wrote that she had discusse=\r\nd all her plans with Bhagavan and he agreed with them. When Bhagavan saw th=\r\nis, he commented,=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;&quot;What can I d=\r\no? Even if I am silent, such statements are printed in the newspapers.&quot=\r\n;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Adi Shankaracharya writes that karma yoga is useful for p=\r\nurifying the mind. But the purified mind has to be harnessed to some techni=\r\nque of spiritual practice. Only then will the sadhana be effective. Bhagava=\r\nn has said that only a true jnani can be a true karma yogi. It is not that =\r\ndoing good works and giving to others is wrong. But only a jnani knows that=\r\n there are no others; there is only the Self. Who is to give to whom?&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan&#39;s whole life was simply an offering to the world. Everythi=\r\nng he did was for others only. The scriptures say that a jnani has no will =\r\nof his own and whatever he does is prompted by Ishwara, or God.&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan knew that social service could temporarily r=\r\nelieve suffering to some extent. He also knew that the same person who was =\r\nhelped, would some day come to grief again, not only later in this life but=\r\n in life after life. To remove all suffering, to completely extinguish the =\r\ncause of all suffering, the Maharshi was born. He wanted to liberate us fro=\r\nm the mistaken belief that we are this frail body, mind and ego.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0To do this he gave the method of Self-Enquiry, showed us how to practice=\r\n it and effectively aided seekers by his powerful presence and grace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;But even with all that he taught us, t=\r\nhere were many who came to him, stayed for some time and then went astray.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;=C2=A0Such was the case with the pious attendant of Bhagavan,=C2=A0&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Madhava&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style:italic&quot;&gt;He worked in the ashram for about ten years, mostly serving =\r\nBhagavan as a personal attendant. At one point he seemed to have become res=\r\ntless, or perhaps he felt that he required rest somewhere away from the ash=\r\nram. At this juncture, he came to me one day and asked if I could help him =\r\nwith the travel fare to Yogi Ramaih&#39;s ashram in Andhra Pradesh.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Up to this point Madhava was considered a model devotee. Everyone praised=\r\n his virtues of steadiness, devotion and service to Bhagavan. So I was a li=\r\nttle surprised when he told me he desired to leave the ashram. I asked him =\r\nwhat Bhagavan and Chinnaswami said about his plans. He told me that they bo=\r\nth approved of them. Later I discovered it was not so. Bhagavan had recomme=\r\nnded that he simply cease working for some time, take his meals in the ashr=\r\nam and rest, free from all responsibilities. Apparently he did not heed Bha=\r\ngavan&#39;s advice and as a result had to suffer.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Madhava left the=\r\n ashram as planned, but returned after a short time. His job as one of Bhag=\r\navan&#39;s attendants had already been given to someone else. Consequently,=\r\n he had nothing to do when he returned and I would often see him sitting in=\r\n Bhagavan&#39;s hall. His restlessness persisted and it wasn&#39;t long bef=\r\nore he left the ashram again. When he returned a second time he was wearing=\r\n ochre robes, which means he must have been initiated into sannyas by some =\r\nswami during his travels. Yet he was still unsettled and he went away again=\r\n. Then, all of a sudden, we heard he had died in Kumbhakonam under strange =\r\ncircumstances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is not altogether uncommon for aspirants =\r\nto deviate from the prescribed path after coming to Bhagavan. It is only th=\r\nose who persist to the end with their spiritual practice, devotion and fait=\r\nh that succeed. Of course, Bhagavan&#39;s helping hand is always there for =\r\nthose sincere sadhakas who strive and reach out for it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once the Sarvadhikari asked me to set my alarm so I =\r\ncould wake up at 2 A.M. It was discovered that Bhagavan was rising at this =\r\ntime every night and walking to the latrine near the goshala.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;T=\r\nhe attendants were sleeping right through this and, of course, Bhagavan pro=\r\nbably took special care not to disturb their sleep when he rose.=C2=A0&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When the Sarvadhikari discovered what was happe=\r\nning he became concerned that if Bhagavan should fall, or some other mishap=\r\n should occur, there would be no one to help him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;So at 2. A.M. I awoke and walked over and stood nea=\r\nr Bhagavan, who was then reclining on the couch outside on the verandah. Wh=\r\nen Bhagavan saw me standing there he quietly slipped off the couch and walk=\r\ned to the latrine with the aid of a flashlight. I followed. No words passed=\r\n between us. There is no doubt that Bhagavan understood why I was there and=\r\n who requested me to come at this hour of night, yet everything transpired =\r\nin silence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On such occasions, when silence prevailed, we w=\r\nould assume that Bhagavan approved or was pleased. When he was displeased, =\r\nwe could easily know, for he did not hesitate to correct us. In this way, w=\r\ne were always on our guard and alert to his will.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One day I receiv=\r\ned a letter from my family informing me that they were traveling to Thirupa=\r\nti. They requested me to leave the ashram and meet them there. When Bhagava=\r\nn was returning from his walk and was near the well, I mentioned the detail=\r\ns of this letter to him. He made no reply. Now, how could I just leave?&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=C2=A0Normally he would indicate his approval =\r\nof the plan by asking questions or commenting, and in some manner make it c=\r\nlear to me that it was all right to go ahead.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0In this instance =\r\nhe said nothing and just kept walking.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The very next day I receive=\r\nd another letter from my family informing me that the trip was cancelled. H=\r\now can we explain this? Is it a siddhi, a miracle, or what? Everything happ=\r\nened naturally in Bhagavan&#39;s presence, and he was always so unassuming.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;IT WAS IN FEBRUARY of 1949 that =\r\na small growth was noticed just below the elbow on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s left =\r\narm. When it was first noticed it looked similar to the size, color and sha=\r\npe of a black gram (pigeon pea).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Maharshi was vigilantl=\r\ny watched and attended to twenty-four hours a day. Therefore, any irregular=\r\nity in his health was closely scrutinized by his cadre of devoted attendant=\r\ns. But how and why the tumor began where it did cannot be established with =\r\nany certainty.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When it was first noticed by the attendants, Dr. Sh=\r\nankar Rao, a retired district surgeon who was then serving as the ashram do=\r\nctor, was summoned to examine it. Dr. Srinivasa Rao, another devotee living=\r\n near the ashram, was also called. After consultation these two doctors dec=\r\nided that surgical removal of the small growth should be performed. Without=\r\n much fanfare, and without the use of an anesthetic, the growth was removed=\r\n. Perhaps everyone thought that this minor nuisance was now eliminated. The=\r\n doctors did not realize then that they were tampering with a fatal type of=\r\n cancer called sarcoma.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In March of 1949, the wound from the surge=\r\nry seemed to be healing satisfactorily when another growth, a little higher=\r\n up the arm, appeared. Dr. Raghavachari, an eminent surgeon from Madras, ca=\r\nme to the ashram with all his instruments and removed the new growth on Mar=\r\nch 27. A local anesthetic was used. About a month after this surgery, when =\r\nthe doctors realized that the tumor was sarcoma cancer, radium treatments b=\r\negan. Also, in May, herbs prescribed by an ayurvedic physician were applied=\r\n to the wound. During all these treatments Bhagavan=E2=80=99s health was sl=\r\nowly deteriorating.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Bhagavan mov=\r\ned into the New Hall, which is connected to the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple. Wh=\r\nat is now called the Nirvana Room had been built near the New Hall for Bhag=\r\navan to rest between darshan periods. A bathroom was also built onto the Ni=\r\nrvana Room, alleviating the strain he experienced by walking all the way to=\r\n the latrine near the goshala. After his final surgery in December of 1949,=\r\n the Nirvana Room became his full-time residence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;As time passed, Bhagavan was becoming increasingly =\r\nweaker. Sometimes after getting up from the couch he would shake violently =\r\nand everyone feared he would fall. At such alarming times, Bhagavan would m=\r\nake a light comment, such as, &quot;Oh! Look at me. I am dancing.&quot;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;=C2=A0In this manner, he would soothe the anguish of his devotees. Never=\r\n would he take his illness or weakness seriously, even though most of us di=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once the doctors were about to cut some tissues from the tumor =\r\nso that testing could be done on them.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;When they were about to inject a local anesthetic to dull the pain, Bhaga=\r\nvan refused it&lt;/span&gt;and told the doctors to simply cut and take what they =\r\nwanted. The doctors protested, explaining to Bhagavan that the pain would b=\r\ne severe without the use of the injection. But Bhagavan again refused and t=\r\nold them just to do it. They cut into the tumor and Bhagavan winced in pain=\r\n. The doctors said, Bhagavan, we told you it would be painful.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan replied, &quot;Yes, the body experie=\r\nnced pain. But am I the body?&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a large team of=\r\n physicians attending to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s needs during this surgery and t=\r\nhroughout his illness. When so many specialists came to certain conclusions=\r\n about his illness and took up procedures, surgical or otherwise, to cure h=\r\nim, Bhagavan normally went along with the treatment. But when the tumor app=\r\neared again after the third surgery, and the doctors concluded that only by=\r\n amputating the entire arm would there be any hope of a cure, Bhagavan flat=\r\nly rejected the option.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On the evening of December 19th, I was one=\r\n among a group of devotees standing north of the Nirvana Room waiting to he=\r\nar news about Bhagavan=E2=80=99s condition. The fourth and final operation =\r\nhad been executed on that day, once again in the dispensary.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Dorai=\r\nswamy Iyer, who had been influential in bringing together prominent physici=\r\nans for the two major surgeries on Bhagavan, came to where we were standing=\r\n and informed us about his condition. &quot;Whether or not the surgery was =\r\nsuccessful, can be determined only after three months,&quot; he said. Bhaga=\r\nvan remained in the dispensary for eighteen days recovering from the operat=\r\nion. Then around midnight, he shifted to the Nirvana Room.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When Bhagavan was in the last stages of his illne=\r\nss he insisted on giving darshan twice a day.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0A reclining chair=\r\n was placed in the small passage in front of the Nirvana Room. He would rep=\r\nose there facing west towards the verandah of the Mother=E2=80=99s Temple, =\r\nand the devotees would sit or stand on the verandah silently looking at him=\r\n, or sit meditating with closed eyes. Those devotees who were permitted to =\r\nhave a bedside meeting with him would come around from east of the Nirvana =\r\nRoom and enter.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;At this time, because=\r\n of the severity of his illness, the Sarvadhikari rarely gave permission fo=\r\nr separate meetings with Bhagavan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In February of 1950, a n=\r\new cancerous growth appeared. Many devotees began to lose all hope that his=\r\n life would be spared. On the other hand, there were others that resolutely=\r\n declared that Bhagavan would never die from this disease, as if it was ina=\r\ndmissible that a sage like Bhagavan could succumb to a common mortal afflic=\r\ntion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One day I received a message from the office that I should a=\r\nccompany the doctors to Bhagavan=E2=80=99s room when they go again to clean=\r\n his wound and change his bandages. I do not know why I was asked to do thi=\r\ns. Perhaps Bhagavan didn=E2=80=99t see me at darshan time and inquired abou=\r\nt me, or possibly for some other reason the Sarvadhikari felt I should go t=\r\no Bhagavan in his room.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When I walked into the Nirvana Room Bhagav=\r\nan simply rested his benevolent gaze on me and said nothing. Then he slowly=\r\n stretched out his left arm and the doctors began their work. The bandage w=\r\nas drenched with blood; the wound was large and pitiful to look at; the pai=\r\nn must have been extreme.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan ca=\r\nlmly turned his head to the side and the doctors went about their business.=\r\n I was amazed to observe his total detachment.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It seemed to me that he looked on this painful affair as i=\r\nf it was happening to a body other than his own. I can never forget that si=\r\nght. Bhagavan always told us that he was not the body.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0During h=\r\nis last days, in the midst of tremendous suffering, he demonstrated it.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan=E2=80=99s tumor had grown t=\r\no the size of a cauliflower, blood was oozing between the buds and his whol=\r\ne arm was blackened. A doctor friend, who was experienced in all aspects re=\r\nlating to this type of cancer, told me that the pain associated with it at =\r\nthis stage of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s illness would be similar to the suffering =\r\nexperienced if a fully-loaded lorry ran over your arm.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Doctors also decided that Bhagavan should be a=\r\nllowed to eat whatever food he desired.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Throughout the course o=\r\nf his treatments, each discipline of medicine he was under had certain diet=\r\nary restrictions. Often Bhagavan was required to consume items he would not=\r\n ordinarily eat, or prefer to eat.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bu=\r\nt in spite of the doctors=E2=80=99 decision about his diet, Bhagavan was no=\r\nt allowed to eat the iddlies and chilly powder he requested during the last=\r\n month of his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Out of all the doctors attending on Bha=\r\ngavan, it was only the allopathic doctors that didn=E2=80=99t boast they co=\r\nuld cure Bhagavan. The doctors from other disciplines would confidently ann=\r\nounce that Bhagavan could be cured. Of course, during the final stages of h=\r\nis illness, when all hope was lost, there was little boasting. All the diff=\r\nerent systems of medicine, all the best doctors and surgeons and all of the=\r\n latest medical treatments and technologies failed.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;Throughout it all, Bhagavan remained what he always was: a spectat=\r\nor in this world drama, ever reveling in the Self.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;On April 14th, a bulletin was released to the news=\r\n service from the office, stating that Bhagavan was no longer giving darsha=\r\nn.&lt;/span&gt;By broadcasting this information the management thought the pressi=\r\nng throng of devotees would disperse.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;When this news reached Bhagavan, he immediately ordered the Sarvadhikari t=\r\no withdraw the bulletin.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0In no way would he discontinue giving =\r\ndarshan. Even on this last day, when Bhagavan was in the throes of death, h=\r\ne insisted on giving darshan as usual between the hours of 5 and 6 p.m. He =\r\ndemanded that the devotees should not be prevented from seeing him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;After the Mahasamadhi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ON A=\r\nPRIL 16, the day after Bhagavan=E2=80=99s body was buried, I gathered all m=\r\ny belongings and left on the noon train for Madras.
