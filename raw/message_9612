For there are various classes and kinds and types of enti=\r\nties which can possess an individual and some of them can be downright nast=\r\ny.\n\nUpayas are many. As so many different people have advised, these all sa=\r\ndhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually=\r\n work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, the=\r\nre is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/=\r\nbeing(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for the same is. =\r\nBy link it means one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what ac=\r\ntion allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something a=\r\ns simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or causally en=\r\ntering into their territory and being susceptible to such possession by cer=\r\ntain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities ar=\r\ne deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be th=\r\ne source, there is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling su=\r\nch a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the\n amount=\r\n of shakti that those trying to help are able to generate in order to remov=\r\ne the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent =\r\nnature, then unless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/=\r\nshe may come to serious harm.\n\nThese things like removing possession are sp=\r\necializations. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless =\r\none knows well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common=\r\n sense would do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and on=\r\ne must know well how to handle the same too. Again if a spirit is removed b=\r\ny force before the time till which, based on previous karma, it was suppose=\r\nd to be in possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic =\r\nchain which will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person w=\r\nho tried to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n\n[Reminds me of a=\r\n particular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism.=\r\n But before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about=\r\n the spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in po=\r\nssession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim.=\r\n Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the b=\r\nody of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Ne=\r\nver trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases wher=\r\ne the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]\n\nBest t=\r\nhing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how to deal with spirit pos=\r\nsession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possible, a=\r\nsk family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava=\r\n, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better=\r\n) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. Which =\r\nmeans, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the de=\r\ngree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadh=\r\nana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to =\r\nthe very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot,=\r\n and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle =\r\nit on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. \n\nBest of luck and may God hel=\r\np the family.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\nI have a hundred lives b=\r\nefore me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with he=\r\nart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n\n\n=\r\n________________________________\n From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@yaho=\r\no.ca&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSe=\r\nnt: Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra=\r\n for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nThank you Nithin, I=\r\n will convey this to the parents.

I&#39;m very sensitive to different energ=\r\nies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather e=\r\nvil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because o=\r\nf a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I started=\r\n focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified =\r\nstate breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some steps near th=\r\ne bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This d=\r\noesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and=\r\n I can move my body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place distu=\r\nrbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying at that place and ever=\r\nybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On the la=\r\nst night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to sleep and this =\r\nwas the only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Upon coming back ho=\r\nme from that place I started waking up at home, feeling some strong presenc=\r\ne - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before=\r\n here though); Once the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear an=\r\nd I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me f=\r\nrom all kinds of astral beings at night?

And pray as hard as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Best of luck and may God help the family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarsh=\r\ni&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york,\n times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new r=\r\noman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(15=\r\n3, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_13424352724=\r\n9950&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethe=\r\nreal, /&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunt=\r\ner through them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, n=\r\new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri Aurobindo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_13=\r\n4243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;=\r\n/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, =\r\nmonaco, monospace, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size:\n 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;=\r\nltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@yahoo.=\r\nca&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM&lt;=\r\nbr&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/d=\r\niv&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv3351699368&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n3351699368ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=\r\n=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Tha=\r\nnk you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could he=\r\nar strange noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very s=\r\nensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether s=\r\nomething divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place di=\r\ndn&#39;t feel good to me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10=\r\n days and every night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody star=\r\ning at me - I could see them but once I started focusing on them, they vani=\r\nshed. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One=\r\n day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached =\r\nfor my flashlight to see nothing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t s=\r\neem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can m=\r\nove my body.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that=\r\n place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people staying at that pl=\r\nace and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place=\r\n before going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep prop=\r\nerly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I st=\r\narted waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short =\r\nbeings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the=\r\n sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefull=\r\ny.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from=\r\n all kinds of astral beings at night? Something that I can chant before goi=\r\nng to sleep. This has been bothering me for some time now and it interferes=\r\n with my life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;\n                    =\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\n                                &lt;/tbody&gt;\n            =\r\n                &lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;=\r\n/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;\n                           =\r\n         &lt;/tr&gt;\n                                &lt;/tbody&gt;\n                   =\r\n         &lt;/table&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n       =\r\n     &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;=\r\n/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--701135548-1575393200-1376121693=:33469--\r\n\n"}}
