Let me give an analogy.\n=C2=A0\nThink of your favorite deity =\r\nas the master and yourself as a servant. A servant simply serves the master=\r\n. Similarly, all the sadhana you do and your other activities are your way =\r\nto serve your master.\n=C2=A0\nA rich landlord may be very wealthy and have m=\r\nany big checks everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail o=\r\nthers. Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank an=\r\nd do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in this world=\r\n and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. Tha=\r\nt is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and various rishis keep co=\r\nming back to earth every now and then. The supreme god of this world operat=\r\nes through various physical persons present on earth.\n=C2=A0\nWe do homam an=\r\nd other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and try to help others, because=\r\n that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant carries master&#39;s papers to the bank,=\r\n we do such work for god.\n=C2=A0\nDoing what is applauded by others as good =\r\nwork tends to promote ego and we need to guard against it. A servant carryi=\r\nng a million dollar check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a s=\r\nervant carrying a $100 check to the bank and=C2=A0cashing it. Both are mere=\r\nly doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just *instru=\r\nments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. Similarly, one who does =\r\nwhat are considered great deeds in this world and one who does what are con=\r\nsidered meagre deeds in this world are both servants of god helping god exe=\r\ncute god&#39;s agenda in this world. Neither really owns anything. One may cons=\r\nider oneself superior to the other because his/her deeds are considered sup=\r\nerior by the world, but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who consider=\r\ns himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something less valua=\r\nble.\n=C2=A0\nIf this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates one=\r\n&#39;s attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what situations =\r\nhis previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy and blissful in plea=\r\nsure and pain, in praise and criticism and in=C2=A0light and darkness.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nHave the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a job you=\r\n are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own nothing. You are d=\r\noing it for god.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast=\r\n. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n\n----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \nFrom: rajarshi nandy \nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n=\r\nSent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Rega=\r\nrding Maha Ganapati Homam\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\nDear Narasimhaji\n=C2=A0\nReading your r=\r\nesponse another question came into my mind.

Can a homam\n&gt; kundam made by arranging=\r\n red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a\n&gt; copper one?\n\nYes, you ca=\r\nn do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is actually better than doing it=\r\n in closed space. But realize that a rain can cause problems. Keep an umbre=\r\nlla around to protect the fire if it rains while you are doing homam. It is=\r\n not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n\nYes, y=\r\nou can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand at the bottom. Use a sq=\r\nuare shaped huma kunda.\n\n&gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio=\r\n file, should one repeat the\n&gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n\nOne =\r\ncan repeat mentally while listening attentively (not casually). Actually, e=\r\nven listening to mantras with all the attention focused is as powerful as s=\r\naying mantras.\n\nSuppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of some =\r\nmundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus =\r\nand thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing fo=\r\nr person X and yet person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra me=\r\nans &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One can say a mantra or listen to a mant=\r\nra, to be protected. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind =\r\nfocused on the mantra.\n\nHowever, there is a difference between meditation a=\r\nnd homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is =\r\nsubmitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some external =\r\nsound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just=\r\n listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n\n&gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam=\r\n? Any Other conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; should be followed apart from having =\r\nvegeterain food?\n\nYes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) ha=\r\ns been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n\nOne should =\r\nfollow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru s=\r\nets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only v=\r\negetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another ru=\r\nle I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.=\r\n\n\nBy the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do homam for spiritua=\r\nl progress, I am willing to take responsibility and allow them to do it. Su=\r\nch a person can think of me or my guru as guru and perform homam. I am will=\r\ning to take on any karma incurred in the process until the person crosses s=\r\nome minimum threshhold of purity through homam and other spiritual practice=\r\ns. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it d=\r\noes not matter after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purit=\r\ny. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this u=\r\np and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n\nAs long as one desir=\r\nes no specific material benefits (and ready to receive whatever god gives) =\r\nand does homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to help, even if it mea=\r\nns some suffering for me.\n\n&gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day=\r\n would be fine?\n\nFor Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. =\r\nBut any day is fine really.\n\n* * *\n\nMentioning rain and rooftop homam remin=\r\nded me of my India trip.\n\nWhen I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru M=\r\nanish traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended=\r\n up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). Before=\r\n the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come o=\r\nnly in June/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delh=\r\ni in mid-May.. We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex we were=\r\n in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily=\r\n in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n\nTo my surprise, it=\r\n did rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it s=\r\nuddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small t=\r\nowel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the=\r\n two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth co=\r\nver on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and then =\r\npacked everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, bu=\r\nt we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In =\r\nfact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west =\r\nof India. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in t=\r\nhat place and prepared to move on.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home..co=\r\nmcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath..org\n--------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- Phanikumar V=\r\nelaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested i=\r\nn doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have few questions\n&gt; regarding it.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) ?

Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kundam mad=\r\ne by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used instead of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; copp=\r\ner one?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open is act=\r\nually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain can cau=\r\nse problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it rains while =\r\nyou are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the =\r\nmiddle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks =\r\nand sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2)While=\r\n performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; mantras mentally along with the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One can repeat mentally wh=\r\nile listening attentively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantr=\r\nas with all the attention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSuppose person X\n is chanting a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter =\r\nin the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of=\r\n the mantra and its deity. Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and =\r\nyet person Y may benefit from the mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that p=\r\nrotects the mind&quot;... One can say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be prot=\r\nected. The key is control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the=\r\n mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, there is a difference between meditation and homam=\r\n. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and it is submitte=\r\nd in the external fire as well in a homam. So making some external sound (e=\r\nven if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to silent chanting or just listeni=\r\nng. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homa=\r\nm? Any Other conditions/niyamas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; should be followed apart from =\r\nhaving vegeterain food?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread=\r\n ceremony)\n has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s guru. Whateve=\r\nr rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At the minimum, o=\r\nne should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and take a bath befo=\r\nre homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2=\r\n hours before homam.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By the way, if one without a sacred thread want=\r\ns to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility a=\r\nnd allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as guru an=\r\nd perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the process =\r\nuntil the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through homam an=\r\nd other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mantropades=\r\na or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the person cro=\r\nsses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa =\r\nby\n guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold of pu=\r\nrity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As long as one desires no specific material benefits (and read=\r\ny to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I a=\r\nm willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 4)An=\r\ny good date to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For Mahaga=\r\nnapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my In=\r\ndia trip.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish tra=\r\nveled together to several places (on a specific project). We ended up doing=\r\n homam in the morning in several places (wherever we were). Before the trip=\r\n, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As monsoons come only in Ju=\r\nne/July in India, I did not take it seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-=\r\nMay... We proceeded to the rooftop of the apartment complex we were in,\n to=\r\n do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in thi=\r\ns city after our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To my surprise, it =\r\ndid rain as soon as our homas finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it su=\r\nddenly started raining with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small to=\r\nwel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the =\r\ntwo small homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth cov=\r\ner on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and then p=\r\nacked everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra later that day, but=\r\n we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few days in New Delhi. In f=\r\nact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered the north, east and west o=\r\nf India. It rained in every place we went to, as we finished our task in th=\r\nat place and prepared to move on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home...comcast. net&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www..vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www..srijagannat=\r\nh.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath..org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--=\r\n-- Phanikumar\n Velaga &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:itsverysimple%40gmail.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Namasthe,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam da=\r\nily, and have few questions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; regarding it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1)Can Ho=\r\nmam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-floors) ?
