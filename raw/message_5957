I hope all=\r\n the newbies to the group will make a note of this suggestion.  Though we a=\r\nll read PVRji&#39;s guidelines at the onset, out of excitement to make spiritua=\r\nl progress we take a nose dive into performing homams and we tend to overlo=\r\nok few such suggestions.  \n\nFor the well being of the newbies of this group=\r\n, I&#39;m quoting Rajarshi ji&#39;s previous explanation below.\n\n&quot;Whatever you put =\r\nin the fire as ahuti is nothing but your own karmas from your kareen sharir=\r\n. So when you put a purnahuti, it is also some karma from your kareen share=\r\ner. Now what you do when you give it in fire, is bring it out from your kar=\r\neen sharir and dispose it off. This could be a karma which you were suppose=\r\nd to experience at a later date. If you burn it to ash, it means the karma =\r\nis over. But if it does not burn to ash, it means you have brought the karm=\r\na out of your karan sharir and now it is on your being! Basically, it is li=\r\nke acclerating a future karma into the present time, if the punahuti is not=\r\n burnt sufficiently.\n \nSo next time when you give a purnahuti, if it does n=\r\not burn completely, don&#39;t throw it away. Next day when you start the homa, =\r\nplace that unburnt piece in the kunda before you light the fire so that thi=\r\ns time it gets completely burnt.&quot; \n\nWishing everyone all that is desirable,=\r\n\n-Sunitha\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; I ment this coconut: http://goo.gl/U7vzW\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Not the green colored ones :http://goo.gl/2LMio\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; If you are doi=\r\nng only with dry copras, then burning a full water-filled coconut is very, =\r\nvery difficult.

If that can be given in the =\r\nfire, nothing like it! Let me elaborate a bit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; more on the last porti=\r\non of the below mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Normally we do a homa in a homa kunda wh=\r\nich is placed on the floor. The gap - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; physical distance - between th=\r\ne person doing the homa and the kunda is not too \n&gt; &gt; &gt; big. In such circum=\r\nstances it is good to be a little cautious while giving a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; full cocon=\r\nut. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0If someone has a fire pit dug, or the homa-k=\r\nunda base is resonably=C2=A0below the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; surface level where one is sit=\r\nting, that is ideal for giving a coconut in fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0I used=\r\n to give a whole coconut (sometimes 2 coconuts)=C2=A0in my normal homa kund=\r\na \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (16 inchx 16 inch). The coconut would take at least one and half h=\r\nours to burn \n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly. I would use that time to meditate, while pour=\r\ning ghee on the coconut \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at frequent intervals. But the coconut will =\r\nat one point spurt hot water. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Normally it will spray and=C2=A0diffus=\r\ne the fire,=C2=A0so keep enough ghee and camphor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready!=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes however=C2=A0the water may=C2=A0get=C2=A0sprayed=C2=A0on t=\r\nhe body of the person. That is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; why it is best if there is some reaso=\r\nnable gap between the person and the homa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kunda, like in a fire pit.=\r\n Prefer large coconuts than smaller ones. Large ones \n&gt; &gt; &gt; are easier to c=\r\nontrol in fire. Smaller coconuts are more unpredictable. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; On a different note, I have had a few occassions when coconuts have burs=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; uncomfortably in the kunda spraying water on me. Once my face got =\r\nscalded such \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that I could not shave for a few weeks. However, the in=\r\nteresting thing is that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bursting of a coconut and water getting =\r\nsprayed maybe uncomfortable and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; painful, BUT invariable it=C2=A0subl=\r\nimates some major karma that is coming. It is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; NEVER a radom act. I h=\r\nave learnt through experience. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And coconut will produc=\r\ne a lot of smoke too. That is another factor to be taken \n&gt; &gt; &gt; into accoun=\r\nt. However, all said and done, it is the best offering one can make \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nin fire. The effects are simply=C2=A0amazing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you really wa=\r\nnt to take your homa experience to the next level, try full \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coconuts=\r\n. And if you have a firepit dug, then nothing like it...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ______________________________=\r\n__\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Sun, 13 March, 2011 9:04:24 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Offering whole fresh coconut in homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Depending on the materials offered in homam, the effect on on=\r\ne&#39;s subtle \n&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness changes. One of the nice substances that on=\r\ne can offer in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam fire is a whole fresh coconut. Though dry cocon=\r\nut (copra) can also \n&gt; &gt; &gt; be offered, normal fresh whole coconut with wate=\r\nr in it is a fantastic \n&gt; &gt; &gt; material. Traditionally this is what was offe=\r\nred as poornaahuti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (symbolic of head, i.e. ego).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, t=\r\nhose who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should =\r\nignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire =\r\nis practical only for those who do homam with a big fire using logs \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nof wood. You want to offer something only if you can fully burn it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If a fresh coconut is offered in fire, it will take a while to burn \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; completely, because it has layers (fiber, shell, white stuff and wate=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc, just like our own ego-consciousness!). If one offers it in th=\r\ne end \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of homam, it will be a challenge to make it burn fully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One idea is to offer it in the beginning instead of the end, and giv=\r\ne it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to burn, as one goes through homam. I, for example, offer =\r\na fresh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coconut in my daily homam at the end of offerings to Ganapat=\r\nhi at the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and offer Chandip=\r\nath in fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with various offerings. During the course, the fresh coc=\r\nonut burns fully \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having offere=\r\nd a whole fresh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; coconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell yo=\r\nu that it is a very \n&gt; &gt; &gt; good idea (if and only if it is practical in you=\r\nr case).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot =\r\nwater can gush at \n&gt; &gt; &gt; you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a =\r\nlittle understanding \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the dynamics, one should not do this if one =\r\nis worried about the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; inhury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nwitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
