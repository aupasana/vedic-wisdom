Suddenly the sun aske=\r\nd him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down with sweat.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, coming out to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him awa=\r\ny, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to=\r\n all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pitaji&quot; ,the man=\r\n said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized profusely, the =\r\nsun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man=\r\n only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; The =\r\ntemperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we hat=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all because of him=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which leads to all =\r\nof us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this plan=\r\net won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no =\r\nplay.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true love it=\r\n&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t give one sh=\r\nit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about =\r\npeople outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite a =\r\nfew.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t res=\r\npond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that man. Just bec=\r\nause she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! Wha=\r\nt love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is a boy I know=\r\n of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The girl has never=\r\n spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existe=\r\nnce, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i=\r\n know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridiculously dev=\r\noted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if you so love h=\r\ner why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told =\r\nme you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daug=\r\nhter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh c=\r\nhahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiye, apni bhen=\r\n maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of pe=\r\nople I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that y=\r\nou are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You love then claim=\r\n that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You =\r\npeople love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered, but then\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough to know what=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather =\r\nmy love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should come and tell=\r\n me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (go=\r\nd) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because if I have he=\r\nr, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top =\r\nit all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he=\r\n say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I need to do,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri ka=\r\nri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your duty, even i=\r\nf the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results are &quot;good&quot;, th=\r\ney are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to sur=\r\nrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you m=\r\ne. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be =\r\nit in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of =\r\nthe greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alwa=\r\nys maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wagging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;t ask the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His master brings,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the tail is waggin=\r\ng,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is an afterthou=\r\nght.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with god, and what =\r\ndo we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master brings, becau=\r\nse we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aaya paneer.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar rahe, bhai k=\r\nar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We actu=\r\nally don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhen we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only want him,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so shit pissed =\r\noff at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCONSCIOUSLY tr=\r\nying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that bitch, that=\r\n chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we rarely do wa=\r\nnt the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tails of great =\r\ndogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the great dogs, and prete=\r\nnd that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is mental mastur=\r\nbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, if you become=\r\n dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oye hoye sir=\r\n, the ethereal world will salute you.

For T=\r\nhe Mother Durga, hatred is a boon IMHO.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So dont worry and keep=\r\n going....blame her, damn her, yell at her as much as you can and keep doin=\r\ng...you are surely blessed if you really start hating her.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I h=\r\nave a very humerous short story in this regard which has a deep meaning.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; there was a person in a village who used to go to a Temple every=\r\n morning without fail to praise the Lord and then go to his field for work.=\r\n in the same village there was another person who disliked and hated God so=\r\n much that he also used to visit the temple Lord every day morning without =\r\nfail, to just yell at lord, abuse the deity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One night, there =\r\nwas a thunderstorm with very hevay rain and in the morning, there was waist=\r\n deep water around temple and it was still raining heavily. The gentle man =\r\nwho liked God thought that It is very heavy rain and i can skip my visit to=\r\n the temple and he didn&#39;t go to temple on that morning. He made peace with =\r\nhis mind. The other person though could not stop himself. He went ahead, cr=\r\nossed the pool of waist deep water very pain-stakingly, with great efforts =\r\nreached the temple and did his job of abusing the deity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The l=\r\nord became very pleased with him and gave him Darshana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna ji, this is actually not pointed at you.

He w=\r\nas getting irritated with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming into his eyes. Suddenly =\r\nthe sun asked him, bete do you want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comf=\r\nortable???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked hims=\r\nelf,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this=\r\n very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool itself down wi=\r\nth sweat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him in the winters calling him, co=\r\nming out to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe etc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to d=\r\nrive him away, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking lo=\r\nve??? And to all that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah pita=\r\nji&quot; ,the man said.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The man was humbled, and apologized pro=\r\nfusely, the sun forgave him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the =\r\nsun, the man only could say back\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter=\r\n what.&quot; The temperature went up to 48.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was a joke.)=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all sing songs of loving the sun, yet in su=\r\nmmers we hate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that=\r\n orb is so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all be=\r\ncause of him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to oxygen which l=\r\neads to all of us\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god&#39;s foremost proof. Without hi=\r\nm, this planet won&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s ,=\r\n no gdp, no play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, =\r\ntrue love it&#39;s called.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most of us do, we don&#39;t=\r\n give one shit for him for all our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; births combined.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am ta=\r\nlking about people outside of all this worship business. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there =\r\nare quite a few.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a man loves a girl and she=\r\n doesn&#39;t respond favorably,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically she is a whore for that m=\r\nan. Just because she didn&#39;t give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!=\r\n!! Wah!! What love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another story, there is =\r\na boy I know of in Delhi, he is in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love with a certain girl. The gi=\r\nrl has never spoken with him, rarely met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious t=\r\no his existence, and he is lost in god to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask =\r\nme why/how i know these characters, I myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is ridi=\r\nculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked him if y=\r\nou so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped =\r\nme. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rule????? My\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will dec=\r\nide her daughter - in- law, meri kya aukaad ki main ink\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki=\r\n mujhe yeh chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chahiy=\r\ne, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite=\r\n a lot of people I have met.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who tol=\r\nd you that you are sure to get the one you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You lov=\r\ne then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get. I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from=\r\n God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. T=\r\nhe moment\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered,=\r\n but then\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i become big enough =\r\nto know whats\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh toh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaa=\r\nne.  Rather my love\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be so intense, that god herself should c=\r\nome and tell me &quot;you, my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer =\r\nthat she (god) tells me first\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, because =\r\nif I have her, i already have that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who is eventually her.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he claims to have surrendered, how can the=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anything to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If=\r\n you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That d=\r\noesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying what do I =\r\nneed to do,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun bhai bhagwaan ne ape baap =\r\nki naukri kari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your =\r\nduty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s, the results ar=\r\ne &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you actually m=\r\nanage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a disprin or a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, b=\r\nelieve you me. Its a blissful life post the surrender, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a j=\r\nhuggi or be it in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to grace this planet, has\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog. A dog will break his tail off by wa=\r\ngging\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he sees his master, that is devotion and love. He doesn&#39;=\r\nt ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master , to bring him chicken, or mutton, or food. His ma=\r\nster brings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy, his master doesn&#39;t bring, still the ta=\r\nil is wagging,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doggy is happy. Because doggy wants master, food is =\r\nan afterthought.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Equate doggy with us , and master with go=\r\nd, and what do we do?????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are never happy with what the master b=\r\nrings, because we were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; expecting butter chicken, who saala leke aay=\r\na paneer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Haanji madame waale hero, phir chant nahin kar =\r\nrahe, bhai kar lo, kar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lo, Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; We actually don&#39;t want the master , we subconsciously want the food, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then we claim to others , oh no no, I never want food , I only w=\r\nant him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yeah right!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you only want him, why are you so =\r\nshit pissed off at the paneer????\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are selfish dogs, always SUBCO=\r\nNSCIOUSLY trying to form strategies so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that masterji brings us that=\r\n bitch, that chicken, that mutton, that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blanket, that milk, but we =\r\nrarely do want the master. Our tail doesn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wag at his thought. Tai=\r\nls of great dogs do, and what do we do, we read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about the great dog=\r\ns, and pretend that we too are somewhere there, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nope. That is m=\r\nental masturbation, its an illusion just like porn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sir, i=\r\nf you become dog&#39;s dog, and then you walk on the left handed path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\noye hoye sir, the ethereal world will salute you.

It becomes a=\r\n play, a play of that only those two lovers can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; und=\r\nerstand.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A little point ab=\r\nout love these days, One day a man who is in love with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; the sun, was doing homam on , a sunday afternoon, in Hyderabad, in an&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; open field with no shade, in a temperature of 47 deg=\r\nree centigrades and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was sweating profusely as expec=\r\nted. He was getting irritated with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sweat coming=\r\n into his eyes. Suddenly the sun asked him, bete do you want&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; me to hide so that you are comfortable???&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The man looked down in shame upon himself and asked himself,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; we all can&#39;t stand him in summers, I want him to  go away this v=\r\nery&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moment, just because my body is trying to cool =\r\nitself down with sweat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All of us look out for him =\r\nin the winters calling him, coming out to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sunbathe =\r\netc, yet in summers we abuse him, we wish to drive him away, we&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t wish to see his face, is this my fucking love??? And to =\r\nall that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at his love, he wants to hide, &quot;wah p=\r\nitaji&quot; ,the man said.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nman was humbled, and apologized profusely, the sun forgave him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; because after all, you know, he is the sun, the man only could =\r\nsay back&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;shine on, I love &quot;you&quot;, no matter what.&quot; =\r\nThe temperature went up to 48.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (That last line was =\r\na joke.)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In winters we all=\r\n sing songs of loving the sun, yet in summers we hate&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; him, that is not love, its mere usage, and since that orb is so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; magnanimous he still gives gives and gives, after all becau=\r\nse of him&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is photosynthesis, which leads to o=\r\nxygen which leads to all of us&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breathing, he is god=\r\n&#39;s foremost proof. Without him, this planet won&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nxist, which leads to no economies, no mba&#39;s , no gdp, no play.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Hell, he burns for us, just because he loves us, true love it&#39;s=\r\n called.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yet what do most =\r\nof us do, we don&#39;t give one shit for him for all our&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; births combined.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am talking about people outsid=\r\ne of all this worship business. And&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there are quite=\r\n a few.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These days, if a m=\r\nan loves a girl and she doesn&#39;t respond favorably,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nautomatically she is a whore for that man. Just because she didn&#39;t give&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the man her body, she is a whore!!!! Wah!! What love.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;ll tell you another stor=\r\ny, there is a boy I know of in Delhi, he is in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love=\r\n with a certain girl. The girl has never spoken with him, rarely met&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him, infact is oblivious to his existence, and he is lost=\r\n in god to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually care( Don&#39;t ask me why/how i kn=\r\now these characters, I myself&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know) He is rid=\r\niculously devoted to his chosen form of our mother,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I asked him if you so love her why don&#39;t you ask of her from god.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, he slapped me. He told me you forgot Gorakhnath&#39;s rul=\r\ne????? My&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mother will decide her daughter - in- law=\r\n, meri kya aukaad ki main ink&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bata-oon ki mujhe yeh=\r\n chahiye ya mujhe who chahiye, mujhe peel meri maa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nchahiye, apni bhen maraaye duniya, this guy is far more insane than&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite a lot of people I have met.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then he went on, that who told you that you are su=\r\nre to get the one you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; love????&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; You love then claim that somebody to be yours, yeah right, another&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slap!!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You people love, to get.=\r\n I love for love&#39;s sake. All I can ask from God&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is =\r\nto look out for her, protect her, but dare I ask for her. The moment&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I ask, i am screwed, because I know it will be delivered,=\r\n but then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what&#39;s the fun in that, and when did i be=\r\ncome big enough to know whats&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best for me???? yeh t=\r\noh meri maa ka kaam hai, who jaane.  Rather my love&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n should be so intense, that god herself should come and tell me &quot;you, my&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; son, deserve her.&quot;, and I&#39;d rather prefer that she (g=\r\nod) tells me first&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;You , my son, deserve me.&quot;, bec=\r\nause if I have her, i already have that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girl, who i=\r\ns eventually her.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To top it all he says since he cl=\r\naims to have surrendered, how can then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he say anyth=\r\ning to his god? He surrendered, bhagwaan dekhenge. If you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; have surrendered, then it should be total, not partial. That doesn&#39;t=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean you sit on your ass warming it up and saying =\r\nwhat do I need to do,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything god will do, kyun =\r\nbhai bhagwaan ne ape baap ki naukri kari&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hui hai??&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Surrender is you do your d=\r\nuty, even if the results are &quot;bad&quot;, they are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god&#39;s,=\r\n the results are &quot;good&quot;, they are god&#39;s, who are you in between.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; If you actually manage to surrender, you won&#39;t ever need a di=\r\nsprin or a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; counselor, believe you me. Its a blissfu=\r\nl life post the surrender, be it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a jhuggi or be =\r\nit in 25000 sq feet house, one and the same thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One of the greatest men, the greatest, ever to gra=\r\nce this planet, has&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always maintained be god&#39;s dog.=\r\n A dog will break his tail off by wagging&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when he s=\r\nees his master, that is devotion and love.
