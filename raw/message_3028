The practice of Narada&#39;s Bhakti is better\nadapted to this Yuga. One should repeat the Holy Name of the Lord and chant\nHis praises and with earnest and sincere heart, pray to Him, saying: &quot;O\nLord, grant me Thy divine Wisdom, Thy divine Love. Do Thou open my eyes and\nmake me realize Thee.&quot;\n\nWhen Karma Yoga is so difficult to practice, one should pray to the Lord in\nthis manner: &quot;O Lord! Do Thou reduce our Karma to a minimum, and the little\nwork that we daily perform, may we do it with non-attachment by Thy grace. O\nLord! Do not let our desire for work increase in number and bind us to\nworldliness.&quot; [Is work the aim of life?]\n\nDevotee: People of the West (in England and America) always say, &quot;Work,\nwork, work.&quot; Is not work (Karma) then the end and aim of life?\n\n\nRamakrishna: The end and aim of life is the attainment of God. Work (Karma)\nis nothing but the first chapter of life; how can it be its end and aim? But\nwork,without seeking the result, is a means, not the end. No one, however,\ncan avoid work (Karma).\n\nEvery mental action is a Karma. &quot;I am thinking,&quot; &quot;I meditate,&quot; &quot;I feel,&quot;\neach of these is a Karma. The more one attains to true devotion the less\nbecomes one&#39;s worldly work. The pleasures of the world do not satisfy such a\nsoul. They lose their charm. How can one who has tasted the Sherbet made\nwith pure crystallized sugar be pleased with the taste of a drink made with\nmolasses or treacle?\n\nOn one occasion a Karma Yogi (Sambhu) said to me: &quot;May Thy blessing be that\nmy wealth be spent in building hospitals and dispensaries, in making roads,\nin sinking wells for travelers, in establishing schools, colleges, and in\nother good works.&quot; Whereupon I replied: &quot;Sambhu, all these works are good\nwhen they are performed with non-attachment. But that is very difficult. In\nany case you should always keep in mind that the end and aim of your human\nexistence is the attainment of God and not hospitals and dispensaries.
