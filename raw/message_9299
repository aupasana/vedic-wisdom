It means a completel=\r\ny divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be more than one poornavataras.=\r\n They are not necessarily &quot;equal&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;To give a simplisitc analog=\r\ny, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount of copper. If one jewll=\r\nery is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it contains all the gold in the\n&gt;  =\r\nworld. It only means it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the four po=\r\nornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not contain jivams=\r\na. It does not mean they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;In fact, the very notion that any one form c=\r\nan be &quot;the most complete or perfect avatara&quot; or &quot;one that personifies entir=\r\ne divinity of Supreme Being&quot; or &quot;one equal to Supreme Being&quot; is unacceptabl=\r\ne and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY form of Supreme B=\r\neing is like a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like the sky contai=\r\nning all possible clouds.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Supreme Being is endowed with infini=\r\nte qualities. Any form contains a finite number of those qualities. So no f=\r\norm can be &quot;equal to&quot; Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in that regard.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;If one form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and others are\n&gt;  not,=\r\n you can conclude that that form is &quot;the best&quot;. If neither form is &quot;equal t=\r\no&quot; supreme being, how can you really compare the different qualities of two=\r\n forms?\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Anyway, this renders your =\r\n(3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Krishna alone or not i=\r\ns irrelevant, for, in either case, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; cannot mean &quot;a personi=\r\nfication of the entirety of supreme being&quot;. Before you wonder whether it re=\r\nfers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; actua=\r\nlly means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verses that follow! If no=\r\n form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is a &quot;subset&quot; of supreme b=\r\neing (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot;???\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Regarding (4), Parasara\n&gt;  identifi=\r\ned 4 avataras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the source of=\r\n divinity in each of them. He only gave objective information and did not g=\r\nive any subjective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently did.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;I have not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before=\r\n and after, I can comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be =\r\nunder some subjective context. I don&#39;t know the context of Suta&#39;s statement=\r\n you allude to.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Though any comparison is subjective, I will be=\r\n surprised if someone considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as th=\r\ne &quot;best&quot; avataras. But, I will not be surprised if different people conside=\r\nr Rama and Krishna as the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the lumin=\r\naries and show soul and mind, which clearly have a primary significance com=\r\npared to other aspects of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to b=\r\ne seen as the best by different people. However, what Suta\n&gt;  apparently sa=\r\nid can only be a subjective view under some context.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Regarding (2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has=\r\n 16 phases (representing 16 tithis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but S=\r\nun has only one phase - he is always full and bright!\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Just lik=\r\ne Moon, mind has many moods, even a perfected one. A perfected mind goes th=\r\nrough those moods with full awareness of underlying reality, whereas an imp=\r\nerfect mind experiences them under delusion. But it is the nature of Moon/m=\r\nind to have variations. Sun/soul OTOH has no such variations.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nKrishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run away from battlefield another day =\r\n(e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles oneday and play clever tricks anothe=\r\nr day. There is a lot more variety to his personality than Rama&#39;s. Now, doe=\r\ns that make him better or worse than Rama? Well, that is\n&gt;  a *subjective* =\r\nmatter.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Regarding (1): Parasara sa=\r\nid that paramatmamsa is present in several beings such a planets, Brahma, S=\r\nhiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the world appearance in conscious=\r\nness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they stand for different qualit=\r\nies of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. So Vishnu&#39;s avataras are a=\r\nssociated with grahas. But Pararsara said that avataras can descend from th=\r\ne paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwin=\r\ns, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre understanding what various de=\r\nities stand for, what forces play a role in creating, sustaining and destro=\r\nying the world appearance in consciousness. People talk too much about Veda=\r\nnta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any understanding of Veda. When it co=\r\nmes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of\n&gt;  superficial stories and not=\r\n in terms of how it maps to what happens in consciousness.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Moh=\r\nini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Narayana were incarnation=\r\ns of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don&#39;t know about Dhanvantar=\r\ni and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incarnation of Shiva + V=\r\nishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serpent Adi Sesha (like=\r\n Lakshmana).\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;We need to go deeper into what they all stand for=\r\n esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of consciousness, =\r\nto understand this more. Hopefully another day..\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Adwaitins who are skeptical about notions taught by Parasara=\r\n (paramatmamsa, jivatmamsa, different sources of paramtmamsa etc) should re=\r\nalize one thing. Though all is Brahman, all did not come from Brahman in on=\r\ne step. It all evolved in many steps\n&gt;  and correspondingly there are some =\r\nsteps in the process of liberation!\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;If a character in my dream=\r\n tonight overcomes its conditioning in the dream, it will simply merge back=\r\n into my mind and not into Brahman yet.

All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supreme=\r\n Being in SB.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;2. What is your opinion about the general stated ide=\r\na that only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;3. That t=\r\nhe SB mentions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous s=\r\nloka where it says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one int=\r\nerpretation, and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentat=\r\nors, and they were no less in their spiritual merit\n&gt;  or intellectual prow=\r\ness have taken that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Av=\r\nataras. The verse itself does not mention that it is with respect to the pr=\r\nevious verse, or with respect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which l=\r\nists all Avataras. So it boils down to interpretation based on individual c=\r\nonditioning. It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc al=\r\nl shared a similar conditioning which made them read that verse to mean tha=\r\nt only Krshna is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;4. Apparently in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis o=\r\nf Naimisharanya that Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all. So, how do we =\r\nresolve this apparent conflict between what Rishi Parashara states and what=\r\n this Purana states?

SB list gives the avataras of Supreme Being (&quot;Purusha=\r\n&quot; as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are specifically of Vishnu, who is the &quot;su=\r\nstaining principle&quot; of Purusha. Dattatreya is an avatara of Brahma, Vishnu =\r\nand Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustaining and destructive principles of=\r\n Purusha combined together. That is why he is not among Dasavataras. That d=\r\noes not make him any less or more. His purpose/functionality is simply diff=\r\nerent from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, or Venkateswara.

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel free to disagr=\r\nee :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially us=\r\ned=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyo=\r\nnd what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence from the Va=\r\nishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=C2=\r\n=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity between t=\r\nerms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita =\r\nand a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishn=\r\nava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri =\r\nChaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest know=\r\nn non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuanc=\r\nes on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna a=\r\ns the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no less a meas=\r\nure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and t=\r\nhe SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n&gt;  like the Gaudiya Vaishn=\r\navas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and declar=\r\ned Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Nar=\r\nayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately li=\r\nnked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna,=\r\n not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatever the case =\r\nmaybe, each school had its own set of established saints and scholars to vo=\r\nuch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, a=\r\ns you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Av=\r\natar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after=\r\n the Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatar=\r\na=C2=A0because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those ti=\r\nmes, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way bey=\r\nond=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until th=\r\ne next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and befo=\r\nre Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world at large =\r\nremained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this ligh=\r\nt Krshna is the Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be=\r\n invarible accompanied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes wi=\r\nth his coterie of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the=\r\n Avatara to the general masses - who will then create new scriptures and Ka=\r\nlki will be looked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutio=\r\nnary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these se=\r\nt of Avatara, from the whole list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured =\r\nthe popular imagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His=\r\n spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in =\r\nthe list of 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis=\r\n used to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalin=\r\ni Yoga also came from them, which was basically exploring=C2=A0cronological=\r\nly all these nine chakras one after the other by flooding them with Chit-Sh=\r\nakti.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha co=\r\nuld very well=C2=A0represent the essential nature of each chakra. All these=\r\n make me more sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not t=\r\nen. In which case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddh=\r\na, as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali=\r\n Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not a=\r\ngree to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but =\r\nit cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the sha=\r\nrpest and most logical of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and logic=\r\nal mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed hi=\r\nmself to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later ca=\r\nme 3000 years ago, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=C2=\r\n=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the world is no less than that of the=C2=\r\n=A0Buddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had=\r\n it not been for the invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha=\r\n was truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not =\r\nhave been able to absorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus ma=\r\nke it lose its grip on India. Buddhism\n&gt;  barely exists in land of its birt=\r\nh.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All this taken together, make me more and more convin=\r\nced that there are 9 evolutionary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A little bit about Rama=\r\n and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-service. There are =\r\nincidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, educative and u=\r\nplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocean. Rama knew ve=\r\nry well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used his Divine Astr=\r\nas and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat in silent supp=\r\nlication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army safe passage. When=\r\n all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated, and it was ab=\r\nsolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons =\r\nto get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful warrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well=\r\n how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, not letting that sense of power perv=\r\nert his mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. This kind of self-=\r\ncontrol is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by anyone who feels,=\r\n ever so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or influence in\n&gt;  th=\r\nis world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. Not even Ravana=\r\n, by the end of the war at least. He was the very personification of Satwa.=\r\n In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he has learnt all his life t=\r\nhat one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what Rama did, and =\r\nnot what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemently. If one reads entire K=\r\nrshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Ma=\r\nthura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gita, one=\r\n will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=\r\n=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all through his life at every =\r\ninstance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all circumstances of life=\r\n, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes me wonder, was this a m=\r\nan or was this a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is as if th=\r\nere is a part of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and silentl=\r\ny watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single persona=\r\nl stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for him to =\r\nstart a war against\n&gt;  Ravana. But Krshna had zero=C2=A0personal stake in t=\r\nhe Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon he =\r\nwent off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himself into t=\r\nhe politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse the=\r\n world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the Rama=\r\nyana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0Balarama in his next i=\r\nncarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshna. There are so many o=\r\nccassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all these ki=\r\nngs, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their village in Vrndavana. K=\r\nrshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand everything.=\r\n But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect detacheme=\r\nnt from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong accusati=\r\nons by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even counting =\r\nthe miracles he perfromed as a Divine\n&gt;  Child. So I worship Krshna, becaus=\r\ne I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single sadhaka or saint or =\r\nordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected detac=\r\nhment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or activel=\r\ny performing a larger dharma.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I started appreciating Swa=\r\nmi Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara. That was=\r\n the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle of a circus-=\r\nstoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers and on the =\r\nother bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=A0right upto t=\r\nhe=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of that affected him =\r\nto any great degree.

Though 9 main avataras of Vishnu came from parama=\r\ntmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras also descended on earth due t=\r\no various other combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas of the same 9=\r\n grahas!

If people at the beginning of Satya yuga are established in Self alwa=\r\nys and the only issue is that a small attachment may develop now and then, =\r\ndisturbing that state of being established in Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!)=\r\n, then the aspect of consciousness that is relevant is &quot;spirit of detachmen=\r\nt&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to bei=\r\nng established in Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser, being established =\r\nin Self became less natural and more effort was needed. So the &quot;spirit of p=\r\natience, persistence and\n&gt;  hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became relevant and an avat=\r\nara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the =\r\ndark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;t=\r\n &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous an=\r\nd incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mercury) becam=\r\ne relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to expla=\r\nin being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational m=\r\ninds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousness.

It=C2=A0deals with th=\r\ne idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It a=\r\nlso=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in i=\r\nts list of 22.

I=\r\nnfact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vi=\r\nbhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation o=\r\nf conception.

Etc..\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;First,=\r\n he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he d=\r\noes not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept i=\r\ns possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theoriz=\r\ne.&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does no=\r\nt focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avat=\r\naras, then these link to grahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, =\r\nindividually or in combination, will represent all Avataras, or for that ma=\r\ntter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we=\r\n take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be=\r\n? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmi=\r\nsing, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the ear=\r\nth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he=\r\n does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the=\r\n last Avatara comes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at this =\r\nmain Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some=\r\n traditions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The concept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from =\r\nthe Gita.

In fact, Parasara, father of Vyas=\r\na, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poorn=\r\navataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some amoun=\r\nt of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates\n&gt;  jivatmamsa).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there a=\r\nre in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods=\r\n etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 the=\r\nn proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himsel=\r\nf.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Ra=\r\nma is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, d=\r\nemigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that bo=\r\nth Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us a=\r\nsk a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is =\r\n&quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;W=\r\nhile SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.=\r\n3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the=\r\n\n&gt;  nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the quali=\r\nties of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clou=\r\nds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them=\r\n, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is th=\r\ne meaning of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? =\r\nI am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancie=\r\ns and conditioning..\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of paramat=\r\nma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter=\r\n portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Grea=\r\nt avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras=\r\n descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Kris=\r\nhna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are =\r\nentirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After =\r\nall, &quot;entire\n&gt;  divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no clo=\r\nud can contain the entire sky.

Logical mind\n&gt;  and its spirit of comprehensio=\r\nn are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not =\r\ncapable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond compr=\r\nehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to=\r\n comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has =\r\na great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was=\r\n/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s l=\r\ninking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely =\r\nsure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it=\r\n&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring =\r\nsome as\n&gt;  I\n&gt;  showed!.)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottomline as far as I a=\r\nm concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent esot=\r\neric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spiri=\r\nt of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spir=\r\nit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a hig=\r\nhly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically i=\r\ns how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in th=\r\nem.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw l=\r\nopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one an=\r\nd other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supr=\r\neme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone may think =\r\nthat Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior\n&gt;  to Tara and like Kali more. But, so=\r\nme learned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scr=\r\niptures even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the diff=\r\nerence between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. Pe=\r\nople seeing some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, mere=\r\nly projecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama.=\r\n Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect repres=\r\nented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not reall=\r\ny that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different, t=\r\nhough the specifics of their stories may be different.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is superior t=\r\no Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a pe=\r\nrson. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and =\r\npushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than changing the =\r\nminds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will have to g=\r\no through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages =\r\nof evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality.

Let me write down as I see it, i=\r\nn point by point manner.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Puran=\r\na, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Av=\r\natara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-=\r\nnarayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana=\r\n goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th =\r\nCanto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of t=\r\nhe Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are=\r\n/have been accorded special mention and significance across various Hindu s=\r\npiritual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, =\r\nnamely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physica=\r\nl presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kal=\r\ni started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these a=\r\nre scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3=\r\n. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, V=\r\naraha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. Th=\r\nere is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these main a=\r\nvatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphib=\r\nian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (fir=\r\nst human life form who immediately takes possession of this earth represent=\r\ned by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving arou=\r\nnd with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara =\r\nof Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated in=\r\nto another world, but is a progressive realization of the various manifesta=\r\ntion and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its developm=\r\nent through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution =\r\ngo hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on\n&gt;  earth.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the p=\r\narable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one wors=\r\nhips say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of th=\r\ne soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can=\r\n lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of =\r\nVishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive=\r\n spiritual dynamos.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, n=\r\naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of=\r\n evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of muc=\r\nh easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mi=\r\nnd. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the an=\r\nimal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force fo=\r\nr a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there ca=\r\nn be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature a=\r\nnd will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Rama=\r\nyana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did=\r\n have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelle=\r\nd by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the =\r\nend of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, t=\r\nhat he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n&gt;  was the Dharma to do so, =\r\nand to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when h=\r\ne lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly =\r\nto the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as=\r\n a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to=\r\n it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminat=\r\ned into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, =\r\nsuch that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn th=\r\ne Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, O=\r\nTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=\r\n=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=\r\nachment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =\r\nthat mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=\r\n Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,\n&gt;  his village-folks who so =\r\nloved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave th=\r\ne shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head int=\r\no an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, the=\r\nn he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back=\r\n once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, wh=\r\nen the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he oblig=\r\ned. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of K=\r\nrshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to=\r\n everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupal=\r\na abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smili=\r\nng and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Sh=\r\nishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly =\r\naccused Krshna of being a revolutionist\n&gt;  and charlatan, Krshna did not ki=\r\nll him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magic=\r\nian, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly=\r\n of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he w=\r\nas back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there o=\r\nne instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equ=\r\nivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what other=\r\ns say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he =\r\nhad the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy.=\r\n That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karm=\r\na-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the a=\r\nction nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the =\r\nbattle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apa=\r\nrt Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n&gt;  to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or=\r\n getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, =\r\nknew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the dest=\r\nruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational=\r\n thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to =\r\nthe Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the=\r\n Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the =\r\nAdhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a diff=\r\nerent picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attackin=\r\ng Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demo=\r\nlishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the=\r\n Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama=\r\n is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great cha=\r\nracteristics of satwa, chief\n&gt;  of which is self-control, as well as the oc=\r\ncasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least=\r\n until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a tru=\r\ne saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna=\r\n was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women,=\r\n deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trac=\r\ne of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying si=\r\ntuations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not s=\r\nee him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one =\r\nhe advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly de=\r\nnying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what eithe=\r\nr Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation of =\r\nthis world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at cruc=\r\nial stages of\n&gt;  evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on masse=\r\ns is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathru=\r\nsta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the sche=\r\nme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most l=\r\nogical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do =\r\nnot consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holis=\r\ntic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of =\r\nlife. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy=\r\n, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and r=\r\nealization. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 =\r\nchakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human b=\r\nody and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is =\r\nmy belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to th=\r\ne full\n&gt;  power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 graha=\r\ns, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to exp=\r\nlore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna=\r\n is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who repr=\r\nesent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the seq=\r\nuence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically re=\r\npresent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my beli=\r\nef - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted=\r\n corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga=\r\n] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalk=\r\ni, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the st=\r\nainless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atma=\r\nh .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete\n&gt;=\r\n  purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint o=\r\nf his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world =\r\nand fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various=\r\n points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won=\r\n&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be=\r\n the only one capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions =\r\nthat beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It i=\r\ns perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now=\r\n that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamaj=\r\nAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Narasim=\r\nha P.V.R.
