Dattatreya said that the Atma alone was his Gu=\r\nru and yet he had learned wisdom from twenty-four individuals and that they=\r\n were therefore his Gurus.\n\nDattatreya then mentioned the names of his twen=\r\nty-four Gurus and spoke of the wisdom that he had learnt from each.\n\nDattat=\r\nreya said: &quot;The names of my twenty-four teachers are:\n1. Earth\n2. Water\n3. =\r\nAir\n4. Fire\n5. Sky\n6. Moon\n7. Sun\n8. Pigeon\n9. Python\n10. Ocean\n11. Moth\n12=\r\n. Honey-gatherer\n13. Bee\n14. Elephant\n15. Deer\n16. Fish\n17. Dancing girl Pi=\r\nngala\n18. Raven\n19. Child\n20. Maiden\n21. Serpent\n22. Arrow-maker\n23. Spider=\r\n\n24. Beetle\n\n1. I have learnt patience and doing good to others from the ea=\r\nrth, for it endures every injury that man commits on its surface and yet it=\r\n does him good by producing crops, trees, etc.\n\n2. From water I have learnt=\r\n the quality of purity. Just as the pure water cleanses others, so also the=\r\n sage, who is pure and free from selfishness, lust, egoism, anger, greed, e=\r\ntc., purifies all those who come in contact with him.\n\n3. The air is always=\r\n moving through various objects, but it never gets attached to anyone of th=\r\nem; so I have learnt from the air to be without attachment, though I move w=\r\nith many people in- this world.\n\n4. Just as fire burns bright, so also the =\r\nsage should be glowing with the splendour of his knowledge and Tapas.\n\n5. T=\r\nhe air, the stars, the clouds, etc., are all contained in the sky, but the =\r\nsky does not come in contact with any of them. I have learnt from the sky t=\r\nhat the Atma is all-pervading and yet it has no contact with any object.\n\n6=\r\n. The moon is in itself always complete, but appears to decrease or increas=\r\ne, on account of the varying shadow of the earth upon the moon. I have lear=\r\nnt from this that the Atma is always perfect and changeless and that it is =\r\nonly the Upadhis or limiting adjuncts that cast shadows upon it.\n\n7. Just a=\r\ns the sun, reflected in various pots of water, appears as so many different=\r\n reflections, so also, Brahman appears different because of the Upadhis (bo=\r\ndies) caused by its reflection through the mind. This is the lesson I have =\r\nlearnt from the sun.\n\n8. I once saw a pair of pigeons with their young bird=\r\ns. A fowler spread a net and caught the young birds. The mother pigeon was =\r\nvery much attached to her children. She did not care to live, so she fell i=\r\nnto the net and was caught. The male pigeon was attached to the female pige=\r\non, so he also fell into the net and was caught. From this I learnt that at=\r\ntachment was the cause of bondage.\n\n9. The python does not move about for i=\r\nts food. It remains contented with whatever it gets and lies in one place. =\r\nFrom this I have learnt to be unmindful of food and to be contented with wh=\r\natever I get to eat (Ajahara Vritti).\n\n10. Just as the ocean remains unmove=\r\nd even though hundreds of rivers fall into it, so also, the wise man should=\r\n remain unmoved among all sorts of temptations, difficulties and troubles. =\r\nThis is the lesson I have learnt from the ocean.\n\n11. Just as the moth, bei=\r\nng enamoured of the brilliance of the fire, falls into it and is burnt up, =\r\nso also, a passionate man who falls in love with a beautiful girl comes to =\r\ngrief. To control the sense of sight and to fix the mind on the Self is the=\r\n lesson I have learnt from the moth.\n\n12. Just as black bee sucks the honey=\r\n from different flowers and does not suck it from only one flower, so also =\r\nI take only a little food from one house and a little from another house an=\r\nd thus appease my hunger (Madhukari Bhiksha or Madhukari Vritti). I am not =\r\na burden on the householder.\n\n13. Bees collect honey with great trouble, bu=\r\nt a hunter comes and takes the honey easily. Even so, people hoard up wealt=\r\nh and other things with great difficulty, but they have to leave them all a=\r\nt once and depart when the Lord of Death takes hold of them. From this I ha=\r\nve learnt the lesson that it is useless to hoard things.\n\n14. The male elep=\r\nhant, blinded by lust, falls into a pit covered over with grass, even at th=\r\ne sight of a paper-made female elephant. It gets caught, enchained and tort=\r\nured by the goad. Even so, passionate men fall in the traps of women and co=\r\nme to grief. Therefore, one should destroy lust. This is the lesson I have =\r\nlearnt from the elephant.\n\n15. The deer is enticed and trapped by the hunte=\r\nr through its love of music. Even so, a man is attracted by the music of wo=\r\nmen of loose character and brought to destruction. One should never listen =\r\nto lewd songs. This is the lesson I have learnt from the deer.\n\n16. Just as=\r\n a fish that is covetous of food falls an easy victim to the bait, so also,=\r\n the man who is greedy of food, who allows his sense of taste to overpower =\r\nhim, loses his independence and easily gets ruined. The greed for food must=\r\n therefore be destroyed. It is the lesson that I have learnt from the fish.=\r\n\n\n17. There was a dancing girl named Pingala in the town of Videha. She was=\r\n tired of looking out for customers one night. She became hopeless. Then sh=\r\ne decided to remain content with what she had and then she had sound sleep.=\r\n I have learnt from that fallen woman the lesson that the abandonment of ho=\r\npe leads to contentment.\n\n18. A raven picked up a piece of flesh. It was pu=\r\nrsued and beaten by other birds. It dropped the piece of flesh and attained=\r\n peace and rest. From this I have learnt the lesson that a man in the world=\r\n undergoes all sorts of troubles and miseries when he runs after sensual pl=\r\neasures and that he becomes as happy as the bird when he abandons the sensu=\r\nal pleasures.\n\n19. The child who sucks milk is free from all cares, worries=\r\n and anxieties, and is always cheerful. I have learnt the virtue of cheerfu=\r\nlness from the child.\n\n20. The parents of a young girl had gone in search o=\r\nf a proper bridegroom for her. The girl was alone in the house. During the =\r\nabsence of the parents, a party of people came to the house to see her on a=\r\n similar mission. She received the party herself. She went inside to husk t=\r\nhe paddy. While she was husking, the glass bangles on both hands made a tre=\r\nmendous jingling noise. The wise girl reflected thus: &quot;The party will detec=\r\nt, by the noise of the bangles, that I am husking the paddy myself and that=\r\n my family is too poor to engage others to get the work done. Let me break =\r\nall my bangles except two on each hand&quot;. Accordingly, she broke all the ban=\r\ngles except two on each hand. Even those two bangles created much noise. Sh=\r\ne broke one more bangle in each hand. There was no further noise though she=\r\n continued husking. I have learnt from the girl=EF=BF=BDs experience the fo=\r\nllowing:=EF=BF=BDLiving among many would create discord, disturbance, dispu=\r\nte and quarrel. Even among two persons, there might be unnecessary words or=\r\n strife. The ascetic or the Sannyasin should remain alone in solitude.\n\n21.=\r\n A serpent does not build its hole. It dwells in the holes dug out by other=\r\ns. Even so, an ascetic or a Sannyasin should not build a home for himself H=\r\ne should live in the caves and temples built by others. This is the lesson =\r\nthat I have learnt from the snake.\n\n22. The mind of an arrow-maker was once=\r\n wholly engrossed in sharpening and straightening an arrow. While he was th=\r\nus engaged, a king passed before his shop with his whole retinue. After som=\r\ne time, a man came to the artisan and asked him whether the king had passed=\r\n by his shop. The artisan replied that he had not noticed anything. The fac=\r\nt was that the artisan=EF=BF=BDs mind had been so solely absorbed in his wo=\r\nrk that he had not known the king=EF=BF=BDs passing before his shop. I have=\r\n learnt from the artisan the quality of intense concentration of mind.\n\n23.=\r\n The spider pours out of its mouth long threads and weaves them into cobweb=\r\ns. It gets itself entangled in the net of its own making. Even so, man make=\r\ns a net of his own ideas and gets entangled in it. The wise man should ther=\r\nefore abandon all worldly thoughts and think of Brahman only. This is the l=\r\nesson I have learnt from the spider.\n\n24. The Bhringi or the beetle catches=\r\n hold of a worm, puts it in its nest and gives it a sting. The poor worm, a=\r\nlways fearing the return of the beetle and the sting, and thinking constant=\r\nly of the beetle, becomes a beetle itself. Whatever form a man constantly t=\r\nhinks of, he attains in course of time. As a man thinks, so he becomes. I h=\r\nave learnt from the beetle and the worm to turn myself into Atma by contemp=\r\nlating constantly on It and thus to give up all attachment to the body and =\r\nattain Moksha or liberation&quot;.\n\nKing Yadu was highly impressed by the teachi=\r\nngs of Dattatreya. He abandoned the world and practised constant meditation=\r\n on the Self.\n\nDattatreya was absolutely free from intolerance or prejudice=\r\n of any kind. He learnt wisdom from whatever source it came. All seekers af=\r\nter wisdom should follow the example of Dattatreya.\n\n\n"}}
