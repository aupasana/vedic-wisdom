I have been stronly advised against too much l=\r\nogical reason - which I keep doing - and yet the mind keeps poppings querie=\r\ns. But make sure you do not get trapped only in theoritical questions. Do s=\r\nadhana, do meditation. That is of more importance.\n=C2=A0\n1. On the page 45=\r\n it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara =\r\nwith his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this =\r\nbizarre behavior and why should=C2=A0the priest who slapped him=C2=A0die, b=\r\necause in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least!=C2=\r\n=A0Since you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing thi=\r\nngs, I hope=C2=A0to find and answer here. \n=C2=A0\nThere are two ways of=C2=\r\n=A0looking at this. There is no compelling reason except for the love of Go=\r\nd. If you love God THAT strongly, you can offer anything to Him/Her. But mo=\r\nst of us are not Trilanga Swami and would better off not trying something l=\r\nike this. Trilanga Swami did this probably also to break orthodoxy and show=\r\n people that even this kind of a stage can be achieved by a human being. IN=\r\n Bengal there was a sadhaka named Bamakshepa who had done something similar=\r\n. He had offered his own urine as Ganges water to Ma Tara. The priests of c=\r\nourse went mad at this and locked him up and beat him, untill the queen of =\r\nthat area got a dream where Ma Tara told her that she will leave the place =\r\nfor good unless the people stop harassing Her son (Bama). \n=C2=A0\nThis is n=\r\not something that is done often and by everything. Ramakrishan, when he say=\r\n Trilanga Swami, said it was as if Vishwanath himself who was sitting. Fina=\r\nlly the only measure of purity is inside the mind. Nothing is impure if you=\r\nr mind is perfectly pure.\n=C2=A0\nIf you have read the 3 books of Aghora you=\r\n will come across an example about a few aghoris who were Chandi sadhakas, =\r\nwho were refused entry into a village and so a=C2=A0famine struck the villa=\r\nge=C2=A0killing people. When a man of very, very, very high calibre has era=\r\nsed his Karana Shareera through Sadhana, then the person become one with th=\r\ne Universe or his/her choice form of deity. In such a doing harm to that pe=\r\nrson - slapping Trilanga Swami - will bring the force of the deity or unive=\r\nrse to act again the offender. As Vimalananda says, if a tiger were to come=\r\n infornt of you, will you misbehave with it or treat it with respect? And w=\r\nhy will=C2=A0you treat it with caution and respect, because it&#39;s energy is =\r\ndifferent from your energy. =C2=A0Same way, a man like Trilanga Swami is no=\r\nt just an ordinary man but=C2=A0the power of the UNiverse itself. If he is =\r\ndoing something - however obnoxious it may seem - the universe has agood re=\r\nason for the same. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIn quite a few places, Vimalananda=C2=A0e=\r\nquates changing the=C2=A0loyalty from diety to diety=C2=A0as akin to prosti=\r\ntution, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi S=\r\nankara compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja compo=\r\nsed in=C2=A0the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata a=\r\ns well.=C2=A0So are so many great composers / poets. \n=C2=A0\nLoving differe=\r\nnt deities, and doing sadhana on one specific deity to attain self realizat=\r\nion are different. Ramakrishna too gives an example. A woman in a household=\r\n is courteous and nice to her father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law,=\r\n sister-in-law etc etc, but the relation she shares with her husband is uni=\r\nque and cannot be replaced.=C2=A0Same way, love all deities and respect all=\r\n paths, but if one has to progress it has to be through one deity. That is =\r\nwhat Vimalanada means. Trying to divide ones love/intensity equal among all=\r\n deities and all paths, in my humble opinion, is a recipie for definite lac=\r\nk of progress.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n&quot;Between me and You, ther=\r\ne is only me.\nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n--- On Wed, 3=\r\n/3/10, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj=\r\n_um@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora books..)\nT=\r\no: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Wednesday, 3 March, 2010, 9:28 AM\n\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Narasimhagaru, \n=C2=A0\nExcellent answers on each threa=\r\nd and mother showed her divine grace through you that I am able to find ans=\r\nwers to many questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n=C2=A0\nAnywa=\r\ny, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in the f=\r\nirst book of Aghora are as follows: \n=C2=A0\n1.

Look at your belongings (spouse, chi=\r\nldren, job, house, cars, wealth, name, fame, and even body) as the property=\r\n of god. Imagine that you are a temporary caretaker, just as a servant may =\r\nbe living in a rich person&#39;s house as the caretaker as that person stays aw=\r\nay. Think of all that is in your hands as the sacred property of your maste=\r\nr and take care like a committed servant. A servant takes the best care of =\r\nhis master&#39;s property, but does not get attached. Do not be attached anythi=\r\nng and yet take the best possible care. If something goes wrong, do not wor=\r\nry too much and tell yourself that the master will take care of it when he =\r\ngets a chance to look at it. Think for a moment how a servant taking care o=\r\nf the properties of a master living away thinks and behaves.\n\nIf one can at=\r\ntain the spirit and mental state of the servant in this analogy, one&#39;s life=\r\n will be made.\n\n* * *\n\nRead what Manish wrote below:\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you take Tim=\r\ne out of the equation (because a deity has a different time space frame whi=\r\nch runs in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waitin=\r\ng with patience, then where will God go?

Only very advanced sadhakas will be able =\r\nto identify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rnas / karmic debts and know how/where/why they are to be=\r\n paid off. The rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of us have to follow dharma, which includes stand=\r\ning up for what is right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and righteous and not being defeatist or fat=\r\nalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the wrongs of the K=\r\nauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to take up=\r\n the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of karm=\r\na are too intricate and complex and delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unles=\r\ns one has reached certain very very high levels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainme=\r\nnt, and even then, it will only be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is=\r\n unlimited (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; know=\r\ns best how to dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji =\r\nand others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arj=\r\nun was a great sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He di=\r\nd so much sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day =\r\nand night. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the =\r\nrarest of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the batt=\r\nle, because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows h=\r\now to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can y=\r\nou worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, =\r\nArjun was beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something=\r\n crazy happened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was p=\r\nresent even before, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this w=\r\nas Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun ha=\r\nve treated him as a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; playing=\r\n tricks on Him, but the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and re=\r\nplaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effec=\r\ntively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the e=\r\nnd of the battle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; person who had=\r\n been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kept aliv=\r\ne at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pand=\r\nava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at the beginning o=\r\nf the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of the b=\r\nattlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would return to=\r\n krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being =\r\nspilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He=\r\n had God incarnate at His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate.=\r\n For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; blood=\r\n and pus (I left my thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; y=\r\nears ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a lawy=\r\ner.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; freely admitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a comp=\r\nlete\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fool and knew nothing at all.

Dharma (duty)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (liberation) are two different purushar=\r\nthas and not one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfilling dharma is helpful for liberation, but =\r\nnot sufficient.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to doing dharma, one needs to o=\r\nvercome ego (I-ness) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense of doership=\r\n goes down, the speed at which new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurred goes down. D=\r\nharma becomes clearer. For liberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to lower ego and t=\r\nhe sense of doership and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back debts) with=\r\nout attachment and doership.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail quoted by Hemanth cla=\r\nrifies some key concepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and understanding carefu=\r\nlly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Sof=\r\ntware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicast rologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo=\r\n.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@ ...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard that Muslims used to behead meditating sages head wh=\r\nen they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma is to kill othe=\r\nr religious people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims attact bad karma or sin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@. ..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even I think one has to f=\r\nollow Dharma.

Krishna clearly says in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow some=\r\none\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Following the path of dha=\r\nrma basically means engaging in the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action/duty. Right acti=\r\non varies from person to person, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from place=\r\n to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which=\r\n in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, who you affected in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified w=\r\nith, what debts you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tende=\r\nncies you accumulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on=\r\n one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a perso=\r\nn to spread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, t=\r\nhat becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tende=\r\nncies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritua=\r\nl of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on=\r\ne&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to =\r\nmake a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes =\r\none&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a=\r\n being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time=\r\n of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; el=\r\nders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nweight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some we=\r\night.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civili=\r\nzation destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga =\r\nand set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it=\r\n was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as=\r\n one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had b=\r\neen Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dh=\r\narma was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was bor=\r\nn to renounce material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing a=\r\nnd live the simple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embr=\r\nace a simple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. Whe=\r\nn he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said=\r\n), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one de=\r\ncide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted=\r\n Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not s=\r\nomeone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the c=\r\noncept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was=\r\n a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a =\r\nmaharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerfu=\r\nl king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically =\r\nvarna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tel=\r\nls you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. More=\r\nover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each per=\r\nson has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is=\r\n is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *kn=\r\now* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we=\r\n get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgme=\r\nnt combining discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what=\r\n is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More tha=\r\nn following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nactions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should e=\r\nngage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on=\r\n what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as litt=\r\nle attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible=\r\n. When the action is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication throu=\r\ngh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciou=\r\nsness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work shar=\r\nper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feed=\r\nback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly a=\r\nnd follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomlin=\r\ne is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action =\r\nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned m=\r\nen. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special plac=\r\ne is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders t=\r\no a spiritual master, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the maste=\r\nr to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna wh=\r\no clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was=\r\n confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the wor=\r\nld and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One wh=\r\no is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judg=\r\nment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevate=\r\nd soul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a=\r\n guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to p=\r\nerson,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, t=\r\nhere are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. =\r\nBut, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma b=\r\ny increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understandi=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound t=\r\no persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;=\r\nbanerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agr=\r\nee with Dinesh.

Mr. FL is=\r\n under great pressure due to that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act =\r\nHe can-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain und=\r\ner stress,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to ma=\r\nny Internal and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external activities concerning that issue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; In this case, He strongly i=\r\ndentifies with the Money, act of Giving\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then expecting it back, Rep=\r\nenting etc...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; OR\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 2]=\r\n Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; implemen=\r\ntation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwas a Rina which needed to be paid back and practically starts training the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind with that knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the=\r\n attitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friend=\r\ns that he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But =\r\nin his mind he thinks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it was a rina from some past life which =\r\nwas fulfilled. He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were Money of Mother and she wil=\r\nl take care. If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she will do it or if they=\r\n were to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then they will not come=\r\n back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Sec=\r\nond Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be=\r\n able to break free from this particular chain. He may have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; success=\r\nfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the first Approa=\r\nch, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Money and its =\r\nownership and hence all the actions done due to that, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He may hav=\r\ne created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settled on a later\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; date=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However I am not =\r\nsure for what I have written.

This=\r\n friend may get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the book and stop distracting you, or=\r\n he may continue to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distract you and make it worse by being right n=\r\next to you through the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading.

The idea is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is =\r\nnot bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Chand=\r\nipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother f=\r\nought, which explain how one can fight and overcome various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknes=\r\nses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nregular basis will promote the fighting spirit within one that fights these=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight/overcome it at the same time.

It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrib=\r\nle&quot;. One of the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=83? Aghora=\r\n (aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and se=\r\nes all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the =\r\nthinking of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of =\r\nimpermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama n=\r\naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead body to the funeral. It mean=\r\ns &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an ill=\r\nusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just =\r\na temporary illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is=\r\n: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when s=\r\nomeone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\ne have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful=\r\n and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.=\r\n This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so =\r\nbeautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the m=\r\nind not dwell on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to fe=\r\nel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. The=\r\nse abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the m=\r\nind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama=\r\n naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *impermanent manifest=\r\nations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifying them =\r\nas pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with a=\r\nttraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permane=\r\nnt. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we p=\r\nerceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practically. If feces=\r\n and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanent re=\r\nality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat fruit bu=\r\nt not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3=83? Bu=\r\nt, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiv=\r\ning Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermane=\r\nnt manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;)=\r\n while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the =\r\nmind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; wit=\r\nh certain properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will=\r\n be thinking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin =\r\nalso has the same notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eatin=\r\ng food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;.=\r\n Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be full=\r\ny absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinj=\r\nal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus o=\r\nn the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themsel=\r\nves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thoug=\r\nht and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme situati=\r\non where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. That can in=\r\n fact work as an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In =\r\nthe case of a person who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self =\r\nand I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food=\r\n, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating =\r\nis not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, =\r\nif\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of fece=\r\ns, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in=\r\n a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an incentive in succeeding q=\r\nuickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eve=\r\nryone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose som=\r\neone is doing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet havin=\r\ng a weakness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or gett=\r\ning sexual thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana and that is causing gu=\r\nilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and =\r\nkeep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula =\r\nfor overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still co=\r\nme and distract one. Even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there=\r\n is no guarantee that the fascination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return t=\r\no bite one after that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some mi=\r\nnds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the=\r\n root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keepin=\r\ng sadhana and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activities (one pure and the oth=\r\ner impure), he may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one without such distinctions =\r\nof pure vs impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits naked with his partner si=\r\ntting naked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In the beginning, t=\r\nhis may titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana =\r\nis being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like tha=\r\nt for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. H=\r\ne may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no l=\r\nonger feel titillation. The association in his mind between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nakedne=\r\nss and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the he=\r\nad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may not lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana=\r\n, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending=\r\n so much time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the att=\r\nraction and thrill mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be b=\r\nroken down. Overall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination and weakness for sex =\r\nmay be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break do=\r\nwn some of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these structures by engaging in certain practices that u=\r\nndermine those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not reall=\r\ny. It is also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible that the person keeps on engaging in the pra=\r\nctice merely for sex\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and thinks of sex everytime he sits for medita=\r\ntion (instead of thinking of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meditation everytime he sees naked par=\r\ntner), if one was not serious/sincere/\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83?=\r\n =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83? Bottomli=\r\nne is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on and sets=\r\n up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; push=\r\n the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83?=\r\n =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =\r\n=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83? Like Manish said in a mai=\r\nl earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a=\r\n practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in one&#39;s thought pr=\r\nocess, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is certain=\r\nly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dangerousl=\r\ny, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understa=\r\nnding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C3=83? Aghora stands\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some peopl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates =\r\nhow one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure ver=\r\ny unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; paths and explains the basic reality.

But wha=\r\nt I am trying to understand=C3=83? is that how to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worship both form=\r\ns simultaneously. For=C3=83? instance, Sri Muththuswamy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Diskshitar,=\r\n was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Music =\r\nalong with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Vidyopasaka.

In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two =\r\nsadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting =\r\nthe time between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is=\r\n better to dig 10 metres\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in one place rather than dig one metre in =\r\nten places, if one wants to find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; One possibility is to do a homam and then =\r\nmeditate at the end after\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poornaahuti with various mantras one is a=\r\nttached to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeable abo=\r\nut Sri Vidya. However, from the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little I have been exposed to, Sree=\r\n chakra is a symblic representation of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the layers of duality surrou=\r\nnding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; layer of duality an=\r\nd realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ha=\r\nve a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can=\r\n face\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the strictness).
