Hi=\r\ns \n\nintuition told him to tell her a few things. He told her a few things \n=\r\n\nthat would happen in the next few months. He told her she MUST do a fire \n=\r\n\nritual regularly to overcome some serious problems in her life. He also \n\n=\r\ngave her his email address. She told me later that she thought he was \n\n&quot;in=\r\nsane&quot; to talk to a stranger like that. Later, when some specific \n\nthings h=\r\nappened as told by Manish, some to the day, she developed trust \n\nin Manish=\r\n (Manish told me he was just acting on his intuition withought \n\nknowing wh=\r\ny). She emailed him and later talked to him. Manish \n\nre-iterated to her th=\r\nat she MUST do fire ritual to overcome current and \n\nfuture problems and he=\r\n put her in touch with me.\n\n\n\nI gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but=\r\n it was Greek and Latin to \n\nher. She is a practicing Christian and does no=\r\nt know much about \n\nHinduism. She was totally lost in in the manual and cou=\r\nld not put it to \n\nuse, though she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spe=\r\nnt an hour on \n\nphone with her and explained a simple procedure that she co=\r\nuld relate \n\nto, remember and do. She did homam a few times and found it to=\r\n have a \n\nsoothing and calming influence, though she was very nervous, afra=\r\nid and \n\ntense when she started out. Another friend of her, also a practici=\r\nng \n\nChristian with open-mindedness to other practices, was also interested=\r\n \n\nin trying fire ritual and asked for info. This made me think of writing =\r\n\n\na manual suitable for a group currenly left out.\n\n\n\n*        *        *\n\n=\r\n\n\nCoincidentally, Manish, I and a few other friends had a discussion a \n\nmo=\r\nnth back about non-Hindus performing fire ritual. Though some sincere \n\nand=\r\n learned friends had reservations, I opined: &quot;If one cannot relate to \n\na S=\r\nanskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin or Greek or Arabic chant, I \n\nsee=\r\n no problem in offering that to god. I do not really think Agni will \n\nsay =\r\n&quot;I do not know that god and cannot carry the offering to that god&quot;. \n\nI do =\r\nnot see gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu gods and see all of them \n\nas pers=\r\nonifications of various natures and qualities inherent to us. I \n\nreckon th=\r\nat Agni is capable of translating. Thus, I am not averse to \n\nenabling non-=\r\nHindus to do a fire ritual by essentially retaining the \n\nbasic homam struc=\r\nture, but replacing the main mantra of pradhaana homam \n\nsection with a non=\r\n-Sanskrit sacred chant.&quot;\n\n\n\nI had copied Sri Robert Svoboda (author of Agho=\r\nra series on Vimalananda) \n\non that discussion. He put his view on record i=\r\nn a private email: &quot;Just \n\nfor the record, my view is very similar to yours=\r\n =E2=80=93 the important thing \n\nis to create a relationship with fire, and=\r\n via the fire, with Brahman, \n\nNirguna or Saguna =E2=80=93 Saguna being muc=\r\nh easier.
