There are plenty of simultaneous things that can ha=\r\nppen. Kundalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini awaken=\r\ning may not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a person sudden=\r\nly experience some other nice things too. The mind is of a very subtle natu=\r\nre. The astral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities of all kinds.=\r\n If by some chance the link to this world opens up, willingly or unwillingl=\r\ny, it can cause quite a bit of problems for both mature as well as immature=\r\n people. In the sense, those who are not aware of these can get affected by=\r\n them easily, even those who do sadhana can also get affected by a plethora=\r\n of false experiences and misplaced priorities. As such a diagnosis like th=\r\nis simply cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of this forum (unle=\r\nss I am grossly mistaken).\n\nDoing a homa with the desire that someone gets =\r\ncured maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences. Some p=\r\nart of the person&#39;s karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You must have=\r\n enuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it. It is never advisable t=\r\no enter into the cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must also wea=\r\nr all necessary protections.=C2=A0 The first rule is curing such kind of ps=\r\nycho-spiritual maladies is to find out what causes the effect, and if the p=\r\nerson is trying to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how much of t=\r\nhe effect will come to the person and how easily s/he can handle it. All th=\r\nis is complex and not easy at all.

But how is a doctor to tell apar=\r\nt kundalini rises from non-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include si=\r\nmilar experiences, such as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others canno=\r\nt experience- in other words, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these=\r\n hallucinations or the result of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnost=\r\nic test. \n\nHowever most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-=\r\nseeking &#39;fake&#39; patients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... th=\r\neir stories tend to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hea=\r\nr voices in my head&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. \n\nAbout vata, most=\r\n of our patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usu=\r\nally unable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derang=\r\nement. We try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The =\r\nuse of Cannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this d=\r\noes no good for vata.\n\nThe Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do s=\r\nome on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any =\r\npatient. \n\nCan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the kundalin=\r\ni patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; and will ad=\r\nvise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this will not h=\r\narm them, though I doubt it will help.\n\nAdvice and thoughts from all member=\r\ns would be much appreciated.\n\nOm Dum Durgayai Namaha\n\nAparna\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

See all the saints. You=\r\n are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they a=\r\nll lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). However t=\r\nhe internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so complet=\r\nely that some great ones were completely unaware of their external problems=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sle=\r\nep.I sometimes=C2=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the ai=\r\nr by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s su=\r\nrrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the m=\r\nother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.\n&gt; &gt;The problem with adults is that th=\r\ney have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Mother t=\r\nakes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.\n&gt; &gt;That re=\r\nsults in the problem that &quot;real=C2=A0surges&quot; of energy may=C2=A0result=C2=\r\n=A0in mental havoc.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundali=\r\nni rise are brought up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the =\r\nAir element which is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in these=\r\n people.\n&gt; &gt;Some=C2=A0of the=C2=A0people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be =\r\npeople who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in the=\r\nir lives and think that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get som=\r\ne esteem in the eye of the general public.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the specific =\r\nproblem:In general, for any doctor, the separation of the true from the fal=\r\nse claims must precede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini=\r\n rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food=\r\n habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;To finish Vata, =\r\nall=C2=A0that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control =\r\nof Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body t=\r\no totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult =\r\nreal cases may be useful.\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small=C2=A0Homas to MahaGanapat=\r\ni and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should really im=\r\nprove matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.\n&gt; &gt;The whole proces=\r\ns may be chalked out over one-two years.\n&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just ps=\r\nychotherapy may be sufficient.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai=\r\n Shree Rama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao  wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatric problems may=\r\n expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may not be on=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously r=\r\nising through various nadis without one having gone through proper preparat=\r\nion in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and development of det=\r\nachment) CAN create havoc!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundalini may =\r\nspontaneously rise in a layman with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas=\r\n may not experience it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an ac=\r\nhievement. It is just A SMALL\n&gt;  STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited i=\r\ndentity.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from on=\r\ne&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace (r=\r\nealized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into it whe=\r\nn it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the pa=\r\nlace still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to K=\r\nundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The for=\r\nmer approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progr=\r\ness towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. =\r\nThese are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wanting it and putt=\r\ning sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desired a Kundalini r=\r\nise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a result, one may=\r\n be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironically may not even =\r\nwant it!) when it comes in this life.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try=\r\n not to fancy too many specific\n&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in=\r\n granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you =\r\nright now, arising from YOUR\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes =\r\ngives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something =\r\nelse. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be bo=\r\nrn as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth =\r\nand pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very hea=\r\nlthy, but not have any knowledge or money. In another \n&gt; case, one may deep=\r\nly desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn \n&gt; as a tiger or a dog=\r\n and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \n&gt; experience. Basical=\r\nly, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; so=\r\nmething they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini=\r\n, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given by a rising Kundali=\r\nni and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it in THIS life, one=\r\n may be born in next life with this specific desire destined to fructify (i=\r\nf there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;  =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary or painful, if one=\r\n is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Once =\r\nI saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free it and it panicked s=\r\no badly and started to shake violently. I went to save it from a certain sl=\r\now death and it was scared that I would kill it!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like=\r\n that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and s=\r\ncared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If our ide=\r\nas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) are incorrect and =\r\nif we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a complete realizatio=\r\nn of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-mind complex, wit=\r\nhout being scared?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini =\r\nrise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than\n&gt; =\r\n Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is still l=\r\neft in one&#39;s system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When one transcends one problematic not=\r\nion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay buried dee=\r\nper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. If one over=\r\ncomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in one&#39;s body=\r\n-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (e.g. a great doctor, a gre=\r\nat leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). As an extreme example, if o=\r\nne person had a hidden deep desire to be a great soul who rescues the world=\r\n, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y who will rescue the world =\r\nnow. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!) deeply clings to any such =\r\nnotion, it can cause havoc. The person may show some signs of progress and =\r\nyet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kun=\r\ndalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weakn=\r\nesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual=\r\n problems.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach =\r\nI recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sad=\r\nhana, overcome your\n&gt;  weaknesses and improve your detachment over time. Ag=\r\nain, I want to emphasize that detachment is not disgust or distaste for lif=\r\ne/things/people around you. Disgust is the other side of coin of attachment=\r\n. It is a negative attachment.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \n&gt; whe=\r\nther your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are able to resis=\r\nt 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) or \n&gt; not. I=\r\nf your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making progress. EVEN =\r\nIF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progress. When you c=\r\nompletely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \n&gt; will automatica=\r\nlly ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Thoug=\r\nh true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do bus=\r\niness with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plai=\r\nn and bare fact.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I will pray to you and please gi=\r\nve it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will pray to you and please=\r\n protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. There is something you wan=\r\nt and you ask god for it. True surrender has no place for agendas, desires,=\r\n demands or expectations. True surrender is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascina=\r\ntion for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is accepting anything Lord t=\r\nhrows one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s pra=\r\nsad and accepting it gratefully.

It is not that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said b=\r\nelow. It is not about protecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chip=\r\nmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it=\r\n was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s\n=\r\n&gt;  protection!

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that co=\r\nmpose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into =\r\nmore detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, =\r\nlust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens,=\r\n one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion =\r\nof a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journ=\r\ney. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it rea=\r\nlly does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things an=\r\nd entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are =\r\nuseless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its own=\r\n ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and mis=\r\ns-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more\n&gt;  vital=\r\n. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kunda=\r\nlini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are bec=\r\nause of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile a=\r\nnd insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes =\r\nthat the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influ=\r\nences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due=\r\n to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc.=\r\n That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they ha=\r\nve chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and v=\r\narious possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option=\r\n. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few can have t=\r\nhe right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so,=\r\n are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work.\n&gt;  Sometimes =\r\nit will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the star=\r\nting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to s=\r\nay - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAw=\r\nyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 2013 1:50 PM=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome based on my re=\r\ncent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry job at presen=\r\nt, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to think she has=\r\n had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood. This has i=\r\nnvolved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body. She is no=\r\nt of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her symptoms star=\r\nted and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able to find anyt=\r\nhing physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might be that this=\r\n is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill describe th=\r\nemselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous kundalini aw=\r\nakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topic in mainst=\r\nream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-understood by we=\r\nstern medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n&gt;  kundalini, we =\r\nstruggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kundalini. My e=\r\nxperience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini should not be =\r\nforcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times because the suf=\r\nfering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will consume her, a=\r\nnd it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solution there c=\r\nould be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divine Mother, w=\r\nho manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this woman- and e=\r\nither cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I request that t=\r\nhe good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like her (whom we=\r\n may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let us be carefu=\r\nl in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps t=\r\nhis is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let=\r\n me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n&gt;  rising bit to God&#39;s will=\r\n.

There are plenty of simultaneous things that can happen. Kun=\r\ndalini is only one phenomenon of the whole lot. A kundalini awakening may n=\r\not even make you see or hear anything, it may make a person suddenly experi=\r\nence some other nice things too. The mind is of a very subtle nature. The a=\r\nstral world is a plethora of endless subtle entities of all kinds.

As such a diagnosis like this\n simpl=\r\ny cannot be done over net, and rarely by people of this forum (unless I am =\r\ngrossly mistaken).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing a homa with the desire that someone gets cu=\r\nred maybe good. However, it can also have unintended consequences. Some par=\r\nt of the person&#39;s karma will come to you today or tomorrow. You must have e=\r\nnuf spiritual backup to know how to deal with it. It is never advisable to =\r\nenter into the cricket field merely with a bat in hand, one must also wear =\r\nall necessary protections.&nbsp; The first rule is curing such kind of psyc=\r\nho-spiritual maladies is to find out what causes the effect, and if the per=\r\nson is trying to remedy interferes with the karmic process, how much of the=\r\n effect will come to the person and how easily s/he can handle it. All this=\r\n is complex and not easy at all. It is like a specialization. &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D=\r\n&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;\n style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam m=\r\nanyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_13424350622=\r\n7946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_7_2_17_1362201335998_73&quot; style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||=\r\n[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-seri=\r\nf; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york,=\r\n times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 2 March 2013 3:5=\r\n3 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Re: Fw: Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1717=\r\n846025&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n=\r\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1717846025ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;That was a=\r\nn interesting read. But how is a doctor to tell apart kundalini rises from =\r\nnon-kundalini psychosis? Features of both include similar experiences, such=\r\n as seeing/hearing/smelling things that others cannot experience- in other =\r\nwords, what doctors call &quot;hallucinations&quot;. Are these hallucinations or the =\r\nresult of kundalini derangement- we have no diagnostic test. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowe=\r\nver most doctors are pretty good at detecting the attention-seeking &#39;fake&#39; =\r\npatients with pseudo-hallucinations, pseudo-psychoses.... their stories ten=\r\nd to be pretty shoddy, and different from the genuine &quot;I hear voices in my =\r\nhead&quot; schizophrenic or kundalini patient. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAbout vata, most of our=\r\n patients have severe problems with sleep and appetite. They are usually un=\r\nable to sleep, umable to eat (poor appetite)... definite vata derangement. =\r\nWe try and help with this with medication and lifestyle advice. The use of =\r\nCannabis and other drugs is also notoriously common- I&#39;m sure this does no =\r\ngood for vata.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe Ganapati homam idea sounds good, and I will do =\r\nsome on her behalf as (for obvious reasons), I cannot recommend this to any=\r\n patient. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nCan anti-psychotic medication be helpful/harmful in the=\r\n kundalini patient? Most doctors label kundalini problems as &quot;psychosis&quot; an=\r\nd will advise anti-psychotics e.g. Quetiapine/Olanzapine etc. I hope this w=\r\nill not harm them, though I doubt it will help.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAdvice and thought=\r\ns from all members would be much appreciated.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOm Dum Durgayai Nama=\r\nha&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ve=\r\ndic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom=\r\n%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this energy coul=\r\nd kill you. in actual fact, that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill th=\r\ne limited you&quot;,&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;However,&nbs=\r\np;the hold of the I ness on everything is so tremendous that its difficult =\r\nto let go enough that you can allow this Shakti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Western educated&nbsp;doctors =\r\nwho see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because they are condi=\r\ntioned to think in words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the presence of God=\r\n completely anyway.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This,&nbsp;combined with the fact that for&nbs=\r\np;most people, Kundalini is not wanted because these people&nbsp;want the o=\r\nbjects which God can give, not God Herself, means that the scope for misund=\r\nerstanding is tremendous.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Everybody wants happiness but most a=\r\nre unable to realise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. Y=\r\nou are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they=\r\n all lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external observer). However=\r\n the internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills that saint so compl=\r\netely that some great ones were completely unaware of their external proble=\r\nms.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external =\r\nworld to sleep.I sometimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thro=\r\nwn in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because t=\r\nhe baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything w=\r\nithout the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The problem =\r\nwith adults is that they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego =\r\nto the Divine Mother takes time and is not a painless process unlike that o=\r\nf the baby.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges=\r\n&quot; of energy may&nbsp;result&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise are bro=\r\nught up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air element whi=\r\nch is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in these people.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be peopl=\r\ne who may feel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their li=\r\nves and think that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get some est=\r\neem in the eye of the general public.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Coming to the spec=\r\nific problem:In general, for any doctor, the separation of the true from th=\r\ne false claims must precede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kund=\r\nalini rise needs niyama to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in=\r\n food habits, sleeping habits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;T=\r\no finish Vata, all&nbsp;that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs=\r\n used. Control of Apana is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oil=\r\ns to the body to totally calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro bast=\r\ni in difficult real cases may be useful.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Then institute small&=\r\nnbsp;Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be performed by the patie=\r\nnt. That should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Mulad=\r\nhara.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two years.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  S=\r\nTEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s smal=\r\nl dilapidated house (this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  body-mind complex) to a huge palace (re=\r\nalized Self) may first construct the palace over time and move into it when=\r\n it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes and stays in the pal=\r\nace still under construction (analogy for out of body experiences due to Ku=\r\nndalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The form=\r\ner approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progre=\r\nss towards complete Self-realization without any out of body experiences. T=\r\nhese are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not get something wit=\r\nhout wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deep=\r\nly desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effo=\r\nrt. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and =\r\nironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many sp=\r\necific&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  desires. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your des=\r\nires (because of constraints on what Nature can give you right now, arising=\r\n from YOUR&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  OWN previous actions). So Nature sometimes gives you w=\r\nhat you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want something else. For e=\r\nxample, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a ric=\r\nh but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy that wealth and pray wh=\r\nole life for health. In the life after that, one may be very healthy, but n=\r\not have any knowledge or money. In another &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; case, one may deeply d=\r\nesire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; as a tiger or a =\r\ndog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; experienc=\r\ne. Basically, people keep going in circles through various lives, always &quot;s=\r\neeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;Anyway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body =\r\nexperience given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain =\r\none from having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this spe=\r\ncific desire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind i=\r\nt).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  *&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily scary=\r\n or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachment.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mo=\r\nuse trap. I went to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake v=\r\niolently. I went to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared tha=\r\nt I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;We are like tha=\r\nt chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this body-mind complex and scare=\r\nd of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind compl=\r\nex) are incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t=\r\n a complete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this =\r\nbody-mind complex, without being scared?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Kundalini ri=\r\nse after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far better than&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;  Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditioning is st=\r\nill left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;When one=\r\n transcends one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, ano=\r\nther notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surfa=\r\nce and torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may =\r\nbe another notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on=\r\n to (e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint et=\r\nc). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a g=\r\nreat soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X =\r\nor Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundali=\r\nni!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may s=\r\nhow some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system=\r\n with undesirable conditioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong no=\r\ntions heavily and cause serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Ku=\r\nndalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  weaknesses a=\r\nnd improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detac=\r\nhment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust=\r\n is the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; whether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are ab=\r\nle to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pashas) o=\r\nr &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are maki=\r\nng progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making pr=\r\nogress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self=\r\n).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Thou=\r\ngh true surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do bu=\r\nsiness with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the pla=\r\nin and bare fact.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;I want X, I wil=\r\nl pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I =\r\nwill pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a business deal.=\r\n There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no =\r\nplace for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losi=\r\nng oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender i=\r\ns accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or hi=\r\nghly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender =\r\nis thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and=\r\n during) Death.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one without tru=\r\ne surrender and with many desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini=\r\n rise, one may still be trapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is =\r\nnot that god does not want to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about =\r\nprotecting or endangering. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse tr=\r\nap&quot; example above, I was trying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly=\r\n, one&#39;s conditioning makes one *run away* from God&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  protection! =\r\nGod&#39;s protection may seem to a conditioned mind like grave danger that one =\r\nshould run away from!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Whether through the path of wis=\r\ndom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all this =\r\nis temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have and kee=\r\np doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only detachm=\r\nent and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislikes etc)=\r\n can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy conditio=\r\nning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (self-awa=\r\nreness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;The real key is how light your conditioning is.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;=\r\na rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org=\r\n/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; From: L=\r\neela Sastry &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wi=\r\nsdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&quot; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&nbsp;YES&nbsp; SIR&nbsp; , perfectly correct&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp;but=\r\n intense bhakthi and saranagathi&nbsp; makes the ishtadevatha to stand by t=\r\nhe sadhaka and remove most of the hurdles .&nbsp;&nbsp;All the so called dh=\r\nyanamargas with out any personal deity and manthra allow the other entities=\r\n to enter in to the inner planes who play havoc with the&nbsp; psyche .&nbs=\r\np; Once we are under the protection of&nbsp; a mahadevatha ,all the other&n=\r\nbsp; disturbances will definitely&nbsp; be wiped off .

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that =\r\ncompose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates int=\r\no more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger=\r\n, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happen=\r\ns, one has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotio=\r\nn of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the jou=\r\nrney. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it r=\r\neally does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things =\r\nand entities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them ar=\r\ne useless, and given half a chance can make use of the individual for its o=\r\nwn ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and m=\r\niss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi\n becomes even more&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;  vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experienc=\r\ne of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psycholo=\r\ngy are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is=\r\n puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible =\r\nsometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from various su=\r\nbtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;rup=\r\ntured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, t=\r\nrauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind a=\r\nnd they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very com=\r\nplex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down ev=\r\nery option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, very few =\r\ncan have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they =\r\ncan do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess\n work.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;  Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be =\r\nachieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancien=\r\nt Greeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAw=\r\nyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To:=\r\n &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, 28 February 20=\r\n13 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndr=\r\nome&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome bas=\r\ned on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry jo=\r\nb at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to th=\r\nink she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhood.=\r\n This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the body=\r\n. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her sy=\r\nmptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able t=\r\no find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might b=\r\ne that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally ill =\r\ndescribe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous k=\r\nundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this topi=\r\nc in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-under=\r\nstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for\n deranged&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;  kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken =\r\nthe kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kunda=\r\nlini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at ti=\r\nmes because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it =\r\nwill consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered wh=\r\nat solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to t=\r\nhe Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering o=\r\nf this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. M=\r\nay I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for other=\r\ns like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. A=\r\nnd let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation o=\r\nurselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps=\r\n safest to say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the\n kundalini&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;  rising bit to God&#39;s will.
