Venkateswara Sarma and Smt. Sala SRI VENKATESWARA SARMA, a native of\nKe=\r\nelapasalai Village, Ramnad Dt., is an old devotee of Sri Bhagavan,who\nalong=\r\n with his wife, Smt. Sala, equally devoted to Sri Bhagavan, lived in\nSri Ra=\r\nmana Nagar. Both are closely related to Sri Bhagavan.\n\nFor over a decade he=\r\n studied the Kavya (poetical literature in Sanskrit)\ngaining mastery in the=\r\n same and also became an adept in the science of\nastrology by training he h=\r\nad for years at Vidyalaya in Kerala. In his early\ndays while staying at Kan=\r\ndanur,\nhe had a remarkable experience.\n\nHe saw the portrait of Sri Bhagavan=\r\n in his majestic standing posture with a\npenetrating look which not merely =\r\nseemed but was really felt as directed\nonly to him and which thrilled his w=\r\nhole being. This experience provoked a\ngreat urge to have Sri Bhagavan=E2=\r\n=80=99s darshan immediately.\n\nHe started the very next day and arrived at T=\r\niruvannamalai,his luggage\nconsisting of a panchangam (almanac) in one hand =\r\nand an umbrella in the\nother. That was in 1920. He climbed up the hill to S=\r\nkandashram, and\nrecognising Sri Bhagavan who was seated then under a nelli =\r\ntree he hastened\nto prostrate at his feet, spontaneously reciting in a stat=\r\ne of ecstatic\ninspiration the first sloka of Sri Dakshinamurthi Ashtakam.\n\n=\r\n=E2=80=9CLook, look at the visitor who has come =E2=80=94 Subbu=E2=80=99s s=\r\non, is it not?=E2=80=9D So\nexclaimed\nSri Bhagavan, turning to his mother wh=\r\no was there.\n\nThe mother gave him a hearty welcome and made him feel at hom=\r\ne.Delighted by\nthe stay with Sri Bhagavan that night, he was guided to perf=\r\norm\ngiripradakshina (circumambulation of Holy Arunachala) next day.\n\nHe exp=\r\nressed an ardent desire to stay with Sri Bhagavan for good and pleaded\nthat=\r\n he did not want to marry but wished to remain with him and serve him\nand d=\r\no pujas. The mother would have none of it, he had duties to perform,\nshe re=\r\nminded him and an uncle=E2=80=99s daughter awaited marriage with him.\n\nHe w=\r\nas then 22 years old.Sri Bhagavan consoled him, =E2=80=9CWhat does it matte=\r\nr if\nyou do puja or get married or whether you are here or elsewhere?=E2=80=\r\n=9D And so he\nleft! Since then Sri Sarma was coming to Sri Bhagavan from ti=\r\nme to time,\noften staying for a month or two and benefitting by Sri Bhagava=\r\nn=E2=80=99s\nutterances and his silent influence with devotion and piety.\n\nT=\r\nhough a successful astrologer by profession, especially in the branch of\npr=\r\nasna (astrological forecasting on the basis of the exact time of the\nclient=\r\n=E2=80=99s question), Sri Venkateswara Sarma felt the futility of leading a=\r\n\nbread-earning life and hence came to Sri Ramanasramam in 1939, along with\n=\r\nhis wife, and lived with Sri Bhagavan=E2=80=99s sister=E2=80=99s family.\n\nI=\r\nn 1946 they took up abode at Adi Annamalai, four miles away from the Ashram=\r\n\non the circumambulation path, after duly informing Sri Bhagavan.They went\n=\r\nround the hill daily and sometimes twice a day and thus had darshan of Sri\n=\r\nBhagavan on the way.\n\nSri Sarma compiled a short history of Sri Bhagavan=E2=\r\n=80=99s life consisting of 120\nslokas in Sanskrit, known as Ramana Charitam=\r\nrutasaram, which Sri Bhagavan\ngraciously perused and corrected.\n\nHe also co=\r\nmposed songs in Tamil and presented them to Sri Bhagavan, who used\nto corre=\r\nct them only sparingly. Such corrections were not only grammatical\nin conte=\r\nnt but also vitally enriched them with spiritual depth.\n\nFor instance, in t=\r\nhe following verse: =E2=80=9CThose who are caught in the mouth of\na great t=\r\niger are certain to die in this world;but all those, caught in the\nglance (=\r\ndrishti) of the great tiger adorning the slopes of Arunachala, known\nas gre=\r\nat Ramana,get merged with natural ease in the eternal\nhappiness,discarding =\r\nfear of even the Lord of Death,=E2=80=9D Sri Bhagavan put in\nthe word with =\r\nnatural ease =E2=80=98(iyal) in the place of daily=E2=80=99\n(nidham) of Sri=\r\n Sarma=E2=80=99s!\n\nSince 1948, he settled with his wife and only son in Tir=\r\nuvannamalai town.\nThe son passed away four years later.Both parents feel th=\r\ney survived that\nshock only by Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Grace.\n\nThey continued to=\r\n render service at the Shrines of Sri Bhagavan and the\nMother, assisting in=\r\n the daily routine =E2=80=94 perhaps as a fulfilment of his\nformer sankalpa=\r\n (desire) to do puja to Sri Bhagavan!
