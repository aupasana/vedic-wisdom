This seems to be the case for many of us or Most of us. We i=\r\nnvoke the deity in the Fire and Idol but then the prsence is forgotten.\n\n* =\r\nSame goes for reusing of Water for Abhisheka. it gives that we didn&#39;t care =\r\nmuch for Shiva.\n\nBut It is your own good heart which immediately realised t=\r\nhe error and provocated the thought of doubt. it was such a strong feeling =\r\nthat you wrote to the list. that shows your concern about the whole issue.\n=\r\n\nIn my opinion, both the points mentioned needs to be avoided hence forth. =\r\nThough i feel Shiva is easy going and Bhole Baba who is reputed for not tak=\r\ning offense for such trivial issues.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana Rao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnr=\r\nao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; While I was doing homam, my son (7 years) joined me for =\r\ndoing puja to his Siva lingam (he puts water with a spoon while chanting mr=\r\nityunjaya mantram. He had taken a small bowl and put the siva lingam in it.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I invited Sadasiva into Fire and the siva linga. So far so good.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Very soon the bowl was full and my son was loosing focus and I thought sin=\r\nce pouring water is helping him stay focussed on the puja, I shall help him=\r\n before he gets distracted and goes away.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had taken the water he use=\r\nd already (and which filled the small bowl having the siva lingam) and pour=\r\ned that water into original container. Then the small bowl was empty again =\r\nand he continued.\n&gt; \n&gt; How ever my son asked me if it okay to use the water=\r\n that is already used. I told him, it is alright, as long as you are feelin=\r\ng you are doing the abhishekam to real God, water does not matter. It is yo=\r\nur feeling that matters.\n&gt; \n&gt; Easily said. But, after wards the question wa=\r\ns lingering:\n&gt; 1. While doing this, I have invariably moved the siva lingam=\r\n in to which I have invited Siva. Is this a sin (this is like asking some o=\r\nne to sit in a sofa and then dragging the sofa around while the person is s=\r\nitting in it)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. I used the water used for abhishekam again for abhish=\r\nekam. Is this okay?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
