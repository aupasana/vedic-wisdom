Kapalikas were followers of a particular Saiva sect =\r\n(the left-hand order) who always carried human skulls, wore them as garland=\r\ns around their necks and even ate and drank from these macabre vessels. Lor=\r\nd Siva himself is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famous temple in Mylapo=\r\nre in Chennai is worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is another story.\nThis Kapa=\r\nlika had been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara whom he viewed as a p=\r\notential threat to his faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a nearby cave=\r\n, made necessary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepared himself=\r\n to behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a trance.\nHowever, whe=\r\nn the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off his head Sa=\r\nnkara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned this murder=\r\nous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an &#39;avesa&#39; (po=\r\nssessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily, became the man-li=\r\non Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasimha mantra siddhi and, b=\r\necoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the villainous Kapalika and t=\r\nore him to pieces.\nSankara Vijaya, published by the Ramakrishna Math in Che=\r\nnnai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, scattering away the cloud=\r\ns with a slash of his mane, and literally flew into the cave, stunning all =\r\nbeholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha incarnation once again wh=\r\nen the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the Lord with his leonine c=\r\nlaws.\nAdi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars of a lion, awoke from his t=\r\nrance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada&#39;s body was smeared with the b=\r\nlood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed with divine splendour like =\r\na galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the awesome Lord Narasimha him=\r\nself and pacified him with soothing and overflowing devotion.\nOn another oc=\r\ncasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hands got burnt (the Amaruka episode) but he was cure=\r\nd by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famous hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi=\r\n Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as Lakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa =\r\nStotram&#39;). These hymns are so titled because each of these verses ends with=\r\n the same refrain &#39;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalambam&#39; (O Lord Naras=\r\nimha, please lend me your helping hand).\nIt is believed that fervent recita=\r\ntion of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two stotras Adi Sankara c=\r\nomposed on Him) will always help one smoothly get over difficulties with th=\r\ne Lord&#39;s helping hand.\nSalagrama, the sacred stone found only in the Kandak=\r\ni river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavites in their homes, is used in=\r\n the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This is said to be specially sacre=\r\nd to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have been given to Adi Sankara by Lo=\r\nrd Narasimha himself.\nR Srinivasan &quot;\n\n*This masterly introduction by
