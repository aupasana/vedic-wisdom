Especially the one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which is mode=\r\nled in the form of a bear, and claps its hands as soon as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is power=\r\ned on. Its hands hold two plates which strike each other ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the bear&#39;s=\r\n eyes light up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are rea=\r\ndy to go.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are oth=\r\ner types also, like\n&gt; &gt; &gt; when you put batteries in a car model, it suddenl=\r\ny starts operating, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; going bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which s=\r\ntarts repeating some cuddly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lines. It is loved by girls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Teacher : Yes, exactly.

You have been that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; claps, basically all the battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; terms they are called &quot;births&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : How may I ask?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : What is your name?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Chaman Sha=\r\nrma ( name changed due to security & other humorous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reasons)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Teacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as the bea=\r\nr (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that &quot;I am=\r\n Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; , i lik=\r\ne this girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hate =\r\nthat, I this, and I that&quot;, okay?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Go on.. * feeling a=\r\n bit ridiculous about himself*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : So when Chaman dies, =\r\nwhich is going to happen sooner than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later, do you know what happens =\r\nor what that means?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : I die, but in reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t =\r\ndie.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Very good, you have read that off of a book, ev=\r\ner realized it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Are you not afraid of death?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : N=\r\no, I am not afraid of death.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The lights turn off in the room, =\r\nthere is total darkness, for 5 minutes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there is no noise, but Chaman =\r\ngets terrified, and then a pair of deep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; red eyes appear in the dark, =\r\nand in the most ghastly voice ever asks Mr\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaman, &quot;why are you so af=\r\nraid? the basis of all fear is death, and only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lights have gone o=\r\nut, I haven&#39;t even started with you yet, if you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say you are not going=\r\n to die, then why so scared?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suddenly the lights turn back on=\r\n, the teacher is laughing his ass off,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with Chaman shivering.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : You said you were not afraid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : I neve=\r\nr meant it, like that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Then in what way did you mean=\r\n it? Take it as a lesson that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practical stuff in this spirituality bu=\r\nsiness is far greater than all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your books combined. You get lost whil=\r\ne reading, you think you are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different. To me you are no worse than t=\r\nhe thousand others I meet,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in-fact they are better off without the te=\r\nxts you have studied.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Agreed, but don&#39;t scare me lik=\r\ne that. Again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : I will, if you make such ridiculous c=\r\nlaims again. Anyways,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; where were we? The death of the teddy bear. Yes=\r\n. But mind you the teddy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remains, the outer shell remains, but teddy =\r\nis dead. The outer shell is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; either buried or burnt, in essence done a=\r\nway with, because it is of no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; use. Right?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Righ=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Wrong. Lets get back to the toy. Consider this, wh=\r\nen you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; remove the battery from the toy, what happens? The toy is lite=\r\nrally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useless, it can&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cry, it can&#39;t =\r\ndo shit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Chaman&#39;s =\r\nbody. You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never die, you are only the battery powering this personali=\r\nty which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leads to powering your body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: How can y=\r\nou even=85=85\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Lets consider that you are two batteri=\r\nes, two aa sized ones.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you plug the batteries into a car, sudden=\r\nly the car comes to life,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; without the battery the car is idle, but as=\r\n soon as I put the battery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in, the car goes=85=85.. beep beep honk ho=\r\nnk, move, I am a car.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : sits in silence knowing well t=\r\nhat interrupting now will be the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; biggest mistake ever.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\neacher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; lets say a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or acts mushy. And when I pull the battery out?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student=\r\n : Teddy is idle, literally useless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but go dee=\r\nper. It was the same battery that powered the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; car, it was the same ba=\r\nttery that powered the teddy bear, and it is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same battery that ca=\r\nn power any toy, correct?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Correct\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teach=\r\ner : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself to be the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ca=\r\nr. It believes &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm\n&gt; &gt; &gt; torqu=\r\ne, top speed 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nassengers seat, I am the king baby, look at how hot I am&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stud=\r\nent: Oh dear god=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Then I take out the battery fro=\r\nm the car. And PHAT it is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; useless piece of metal. And I plug the ba=\r\nttery into a teddy, suddenly it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; believes itself to be the teddy, it g=\r\noes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am mushy, I am soft, everybody =\r\nadores me, look how cuddly I am, I can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; even clap my hands &quot;, and when=\r\n I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is=85..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student=\r\n : Useless, and dead.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Thats a useless conclusion, it=\r\n is known by the world, not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realized. Every tom dick and harry knows =\r\nthat, Lets go deeper. The point\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is the battery confuses itself to be =\r\nthe teddy or the god damn car.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So the battery is the=\r\n soul?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s head* Who said that?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : You did.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : *another phatek on =\r\nthe head of the student* When did I say?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You read it in one of your f=\r\nancy articles and commentaries and satsangs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that people do, genius, a=\r\nnd you read it all too wrong, you read it and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thus think you &#39;know&#39;, =\r\nyou never practiced, fools you people are. Most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of the time you peopl=\r\ne are fed bullshit and you gobble it up like pigs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in mud. That remind=\r\ns me we haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  pizza in a long\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, lets order one=\r\n. LOL\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Sorry=85\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Don&#39;t be, you =\r\nare my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion on toys. T=\r\nhe confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confuse yourself to=\r\n be Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been\n&gt; &gt; &gt; plugged into a a=\r\n toy (read body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;confusion&quot;=\r\n aspect.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Then who am I?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : You a=\r\nre the ever lasting consciousness, the universal bliss,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the infinite,=\r\n the ever pervading light of the universe!!! Breathe in and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; out and f=\r\neel the bliss!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Yess!!! this is what I read, * breat=\r\nhes in and out deeply*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Smells huge amounts of odor*=85=85 What is th=\r\nat smell?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : I just farted, feels so blissful, did you =\r\nfeel your bliss too?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Ewwwww=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher=\r\n : Bhutni ke, do you think we guys are fools who have spent lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in =\r\nsearch of who we are, and you will know just by breathing in and out,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and thinking you are the ever lasting consciousness and all that???\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBefkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : But you only said that  &quot;=\r\nYou are the ever lasting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness, the universal bliss, the infi=\r\nnite, the ever pervading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; light of the universe!!! Breathe in and out =\r\nand feel the bliss!!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : It is called a test, and needl=\r\ness to say you have scored a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; compartment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Hey =\r\nram=85=85=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : So back to who you are, you are just l=\r\nike the battery who is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the source of that body and the personality an=\r\nd confuses itself to be &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am Chaman Sharma, age 20, resident of vas=\r\nant vihar, have a girlfriend,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am a male, love to party, own a mercede=\r\nz, worship a a little, interested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in god and whatever &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nStudent : So who am I?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : You are duracell=85..How do t=\r\nhey write post a mathematics\n&gt; &gt; &gt; solution=85=85=85Q.E.D or hence proved. =\r\nQED =3D  quite easily done.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Thats one more self iden=\r\ntification of being duracell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you=\r\n are talking.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: *Feels quite proud*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teache=\r\nr : And THAT is one more self identification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Hey Ra=\r\nm!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Ram Ram.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So I theoretical=\r\nly understand it , but how do I actually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tea=\r\ncher : You do Sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Sitting in a yogic pose and f=\r\nocusing on the lotus and all?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : I will fucking beat yo=\r\nu to your death if you repeat this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bullshit ever again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nStudent: Sorry=85\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : No need to be. That is what is mea=\r\nnt by Sadhana to most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : You shed some light on it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher: What=\r\n do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basically in =\r\nessence, and mark these all important words.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot; YOU trying to convince=\r\n yourself that &quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Births are spent on this my=\r\n boy, births not lives, it takes a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; effort to tell and convince=\r\n yourself that you are just not you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : and how do you =\r\ndo that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : By sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a =\r\nmantra. You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually yourself become the form of the mantra that yo=\r\nu chant, thus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realizing the deity( the big daddy battery)/ the specif=\r\nic form of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one (the source of all the Big and small batteries). A=\r\n mantra means man\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ki tarana, does it not?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So b=\r\ny sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this persona=\r\nlity?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go =\r\ndead, to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: I am beginning to understand=\r\n a little, can you explain where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; does a deity stand in this whole bat=\r\ntery concept?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : If you are the battery, the battery ha=\r\ns to have a source, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are not svayambhu that you exist on you own. =\r\nThe deity is like a huge\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power station in your comparison. It is almo=\r\nst infinite, but since it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a power station it is bound to have a bo=\r\nundary somewhere, but to you, aa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sized battery it is endless. Chaman&#39;=\r\ns source is his parents, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; chaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery) paren=\r\nt is the power station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Hmmm=85.. that&#39;s why she is =\r\nworshipped as ma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a =\r\ngirl who has realized that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he/she himself is the battery and then wen=\r\nt on to become one with a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power station and thus sees himself/herself=\r\n in everything because the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power station is the source of everything =\r\n, of all batteries. And since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he/she actually knows that all elements=\r\n too are currents and everything\n&gt; &gt; &gt; else too, he/she actually sees it as=\r\n that. And thus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say I fully well don&#39;t see a dif=\r\nference between me and this table, thus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am this table, thus If i wi=\r\nsh to make it fly, I can do it, because I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; am actually it. To you it i=\r\ns a table, to me it is just a current, who is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just &quot;me&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Student: Oooohhhhhhhh=85=85.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : He maybe sai baba to y=\r\nou, but thats how your eyes perceive him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to be as, an old man with fr=\r\nail clothing, belongs to shirdi etc etc, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inside he is far beyond =\r\nwhat you or I can comprehend. He first realized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he was a battery by d=\r\noing penance, thus killing himself in the process,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the he realized th=\r\nat the battery is as good as the power station because\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the current is=\r\n the same, so he became one with that, and then he went\n&gt; &gt; &gt; beyond and ca=\r\nme back to guide as he was chosen, just like many others\n&gt; &gt; &gt; are, like my=\r\n great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna and all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; others=85=85=85\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : And the source of the power station is?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nTeacher : The one- Satya shri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put into words\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; because he is infinite and the words are finite. It is purely on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d=\r\nefining him religious wars, riots between religions , and intellectual\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; discussions and debates on this thing called internet happen, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\ne/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people focus on that , and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n get lost, but focus on the power station (deity) and it will take you to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; big daddy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine an endless field of current in comparison of =\r\nthe power station ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an endless current which exists and all others ar=\r\ne a figment of it. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; power stations are a part of it, the current h=\r\nas taken the form of one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; concentrated zone.. But even this contains e=\r\nrror of speech, so chuck it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The ultimate is only realized when you a=\r\nre one with the power station so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lets focus there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Stude=\r\nnt : So the one has taken forms of different power stations to help\n&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe batteries who are spread out to help unite back with it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Te=\r\nacher : Brilliant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: So all our lives we debate/fight a=\r\nnd cut each other off to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; claim which power station (deity) is more po=\r\nwerful over the other and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; superior to all others, when in truth our e=\r\nyes perceive them(deities) to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; be different, when they are in essence =\r\none(Satya shri akaal) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; laughing back at us?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher :=\r\n ho ho ho=85.. Go on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : And we try to worship 10 diffe=\r\nrent ones and always think that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; we should worship as many to get maxi=\r\nmum benefit for our mistakingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confused identities of teddy , the ca=\r\nr and all other toys?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : *smokes slowly*=85 I am listen=\r\ning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in d=\r\nebates and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with pe=\r\nacock feathers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating o=\r\nn concepts which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they don&#39;t know a thing about?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher:=\r\n Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, she is basically you, she is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; battery.=\r\n the stupidest thing in the world is this concept of &quot;my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; kundalini&quot;, =\r\nerr=85. you are her you idiot, how is she yours? Anyways ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many make =\r\nthis error, but it is essential because other wise you can&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explain =\r\nthe concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you are her,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;you&quot;=\r\n will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshipping lets\n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nay a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gl=\r\nory . Whatever you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nimitations of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: So then how do re=\r\nalized souls stay in their bodies post their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realization?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Teacher: Intentional identification with the personality by permission\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; from the power station to fulfill some higher purpose of the power\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; station to guide more batteries to realize that they are not toys. But\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; they can leave in an instant, because they know realities that are much=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; higher than our world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : So what is moksha?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven&#39;t=\r\n merged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; back with a power station yourself first. You tell me when yo=\r\nu have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; merged back, how do you know what if feels like to be merged b=\r\nack? You\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself have become one with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t re=\r\nmain, even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the battery has dissolved, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You=\r\n wont remember\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it, because you are not there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : =\r\nI can&#39;t explain it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : We can&#39;t, It is like explaining =\r\nthe color red to a blind man.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You will say mars  is red or the red li=\r\nght is red, he will say I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; been blind from birth I don&#39;t know wha=\r\nt you are talking about. You will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say tomato, he will say fuck off.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher :=\r\n it can be to an extent, but it is one ridiculously convoluted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; topic.=\r\n To add to ti, one toy is a teddy bear, one toy is a car, one toy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is =\r\na helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind you battery is the same, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe car is very different form the toy, thus if you explain a high level\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; concept to both, both will understand differently and have a go at it\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; with debates and what not, which leads to more confusion. Better is bo=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; realize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that you are dura=\r\ncell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You are dur=\r\nacell.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on =\r\nthe road.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : What?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : You thought 4=\r\n times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: But I will be disgraced.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher=\r\n : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they will laugh at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaman,=\r\n who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this thousand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; times b=\r\nefore, so what??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : I hate you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : =\r\nI love you too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : You are serious on this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Teacher : Very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student: : This is why some of the higher one=\r\ns don&#39;t give a shit about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; roaming naked and doing wild stuff, just to=\r\n keep people away from them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Yes, but a lot of fraud=\r\ns copy and disgrace the higher ones.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Student : Fine, I will do=\r\n it. But you will handle my parent&#39;s reaction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Teacher : Done.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; After the student did the act, nobody seemed to recall the ac=\r\nt the next\n&gt; &gt; &gt; day, yet every one saw it that day, and seemed to make fac=\r\nes at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; student for an hour or so. How everybody forgot is a differ=\r\nent story\n&gt; &gt; &gt; altogether.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do sadhana, before your battery is=\r\n pulled out, replugged into another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; toy and yet again, your confusion=\r\n will prevail driving you to do things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that will push you further and=\r\n further down.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Shree Radheya!!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
