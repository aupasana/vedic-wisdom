With\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; virtue of knowledge gained from your previous posts, which essentially\n&gt; said\n&gt; &gt; that any sattvic material can be offered to gods in the homam fire, i\n&gt; took a\n&gt; &gt; piece of red cloth and red bangles for the purnahuti.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is the first time i participated/performed a homam and it was a\n&gt; great\n&gt; &gt; spritual experience. i felt that i gained a lot of positive energy from\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; homam. i strongly felt that my offerings reached mahalakshmi devi\n&gt; directly\n&gt; &gt; through the homakunda.

Thank you, sir.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, my mind is slighlty disturbed over a co-priest&#39;s action during\n&gt; &gt; homam.

Since\n&gt; then\n&gt; &gt; i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday by blowing candles too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wanted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that my &#39;fire\n&gt; &gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledge may not be\n&gt; relevant\n&gt; &gt; for the homam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; be well experienced in performing homams.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PLease comment something about this and enlighten us with your knowledge\n&gt; so\n&gt; &gt; that i will be careful from next time.
