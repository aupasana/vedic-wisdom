There are just 9 planets and 12 houses representing millions of thin=\r\ngs. For example, Ketu shows mistakes and the same Ketu shows spiritual prog=\r\nress and even moksha. The 12th house shows losses and the same 12th house s=\r\nhows moksha. When an astrologer looks at omens or planets influencing vario=\r\nus houses, he/she obviously uses his/her judgment and intuition to connect =\r\nthe dots. His/her subjective opinions will of course come into play.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nEven if a really good astrologer comes to know of the general area, he/she=\r\n need not be correct on all specifics. Please realize that he/she does not =\r\nhave a TV in which everything is &quot;shown&quot;. Excellent astrologers and even ex=\r\ncellent priests are not beyond biases and their own conditioning.\n=C2=A0\nIf=\r\n I get a sense that you are making some\n mistake, I may talk about some tec=\r\nhnicalities like counts, materials etc if that is what I am conditioned to =\r\nfocus on. I may talk about pronunciation if that is what I am conditioned t=\r\no focus on. I may talk about devotion if that is what I am conditioned to f=\r\nocus on.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe tussle between the &quot;letter&quot; & &quot;=\r\nspirit&quot; of scriptures will go on perennially. Those who stick to the &quot;lette=\r\nr&quot; may find irreconcilable contradictions between different religions, trad=\r\nitions and scriptures and may end up accepting one thing vs the other. Thos=\r\ne who understand the &quot;spirit&quot; can often reconcile everything.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nMixing a bit of ghee with every offering (and not just s=\r\nesame seeds) is auspicious. But, if it is cumbersome, there is nothing wron=\r\ng in\n offering materials individually, as long as SOME ghee is ALSO offered=\r\n in the homam separately. Of course, shastras actually talk about doing a h=\r\nomam in complete absence of ghee also.\n=C2=A0\nShastras are very flexible. S=\r\nhastras say ghee made of cow&#39;s milk is the best. Otherwise, ghee made of bu=\r\nffalo&#39;s milk is preferred. If not, ghee made of goat&#39;s milk is preferred. I=\r\nf not, sesame oil is preferred. A long list is given. In the worst case, ev=\r\nen mustard oil (which is not a saattwik substance) is mentioned!\n=C2=A0\nThe=\r\n bottomline is that making even inferior offerings is better than making no=\r\n offerings.\n=C2=A0\nAs for sesame seeds, they are not &quot;dry&quot; like some other =\r\nmaterials (wood, grains etc) and they contain plenty of sesame oil within t=\r\nhem. Many scriptures actually praise sesame seeds.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIn any case, my friends, the physical\n materials you offer are *exte=\r\nrnal symbols* or proxies and the real offering is made through mind.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nSuppose you give an exquisite gift to a friend, but with disinterest and w=\r\nrong attitude. Your friend may not like it. Suppose you give a humble gift,=\r\n but with a lot of love and caring. Your friend may appreciate it. Gods wil=\r\nl appreciate your love, devotion, sincerity and surrender more than tons of=\r\n ghee, sesame seeds etc.\n=C2=A0\nAs that surrender is weak within us, we are=\r\n taking help from external fire and making use of it to resonate with inner=\r\n fire and develop inner surrender. So we need to make reasonable external o=\r\nfferings to the external fire to keep it going and keep it *saattwik*. So I=\r\n will not say that you can throw anything. But, as long as you offer basica=\r\nlly saattwik materials and keep the fire going, you are all set. Instead of=\r\n getting too carried away with rules and technicalities, focus on your ment=\r\nal condition and\n feeling.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOnce I attended a =\r\nhomam conducted by a gentleman who is now the head of a nice temple-cum-ash=\r\nram. He announced before poornahuti &quot;this poornahuti contains 64 auspicious=\r\n and rare materials specially procured from India. You are so lucky to witn=\r\ness this poornahuti. You may not get such an opportunity again&quot;. THIS attit=\r\nude of pride or feeling special is a &quot;dosha&quot; if you ask me. Poornahuti is s=\r\nupposed to be &quot;complete surrender&quot; to deity and not an occasion to feel pro=\r\nud of what materials you are offering. If someone else offers just one copr=\r\na or even a raisin (kismis or dried grape) and really feels the sense of su=\r\nrrender to the deity and meditates with focus, it may be a *far superior* p=\r\noornaahuti.\n=C2=A0\nExternal also matters when our minds are so deeply tied =\r\nto it. But don&#39;t get overly caught in the external. Make the right\n tradeof=\r\nfs - do just enough at the external level and focus most energy on the inte=\r\nrnal side. That is MY humble advice.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe 10-to=\r\n-1 ratio rule is not universally followed by all.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has enough =\r\ntime to meditate with a mantra for 10 hours for every 1 hour of homam with =\r\nit, fine, go ahead and do it.\n=C2=A0\nIn the old days, people spent hours on=\r\n spiritual sadhana everyday and were quite pure. Times have changed. If one=\r\n has only 30-60 minutes everyday for spiritual sadhana, spending that time =\r\nin front of fire is the optimum way to use it.\n=C2=A0\nIf one wants to paint=\r\n a perfect picture on a special canvas to submit for an important event, on=\r\ne may want to first practice on normal paper and paint it on the special ca=\r\nnvas after becoming proficient. If one does not have that much time, it may=\r\n be better to just draw an\n imperfect picture on the special canvas and sub=\r\nmit it. Similarly, getting some practice with a mantra before offering it i=\r\nn the all-powerful Fire is a good idea. But, if one has limited time, one h=\r\nas to make wise tradeoffs.\n=C2=A0\nOne factor is that Fire amplifies results=\r\n. If someone who is basically quite pure makes offerings in Fire with a man=\r\ntra that he used in past lives, progress may come too quickly and it may be=\r\n unnerving. With japam, things may happen slower.\n=C2=A0\nBut that is unlike=\r\nly to happen to most people today anyway. Even if it does, it is debatable =\r\nwhether it is bad or good. My guess is that the 0.0001% to whom such a thin=\r\ng happens will figure out how to deal with it.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nAs I always say, I am not a missionary.

And your ahuti does not seem to be right.\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself:=\r\n Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix t=\r\nhat with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself=\r\n: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conduc=\r\ntor: Do you do\n required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti=\r\n with the same mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: What?=\r\n... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre=\r\n-defined set of japa?\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti r=\r\natio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via medita=\r\ntion, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashams=\r\nha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualifie=\r\nd to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt;\n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (base=\r\nd on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already fam=\r\niliar with that book series)\n&gt;\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies to anythi=\r\nng. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:1=\r\n00 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt;\n&gt; The conversation w=\r\nent onto several other\n things.

There are just 9 planets and 12 houses representing mil=\r\nlions of things. For example, Ketu shows mistakes and the same Ketu shows s=\r\npiritual progress and even moksha. The 12th house shows losses and the same=\r\n 12th house shows moksha. When an astrologer looks at omens or planets infl=\r\nuencing various houses, he/she obviously uses his/her judgment and intuitio=\r\nn to connect the dots. His/her subjective opinions will of course come into=\r\n play.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Even if a really good astrologer comes to know of the g=\r\neneral area, he/she need not be correct on all specifics. Please realize th=\r\nat he/she does not have a TV in which everything is &quot;shown&quot;. Excellent astr=\r\nologers and even excellent priests are not beyond biases and their own cond=\r\nitioning.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If I get\n a sense that you are making some\n mistake,=\r\n I may talk about some technicalities like counts, materials etc if that is=\r\n what I am conditioned to focus on. I may talk about pronunciation if that =\r\nis what I am conditioned to focus on. I may talk about devotion if that is =\r\nwhat I am conditioned to focus on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;The tussle between the &quot;letter&quot; &amp; &quot;spirit&quot; of scriptures will go on pe=\r\nrennially. Those who stick to the &quot;letter&quot; may find irreconcilable contradi=\r\nctions between different religions, traditions and scriptures and may end u=\r\np accepting one thing vs the other. Those who understand the &quot;spirit&quot; can o=\r\nften reconcile everything.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mixing =\r\na bit of ghee with every offering (and not just sesame seeds) is auspicious=\r\n. But, if it is cumbersome, there is nothing wrong in\n offering materials i=\r\nndividually, as long as SOME ghee is ALSO offered in the homam separately. =\r\nOf course, shastras actually talk about doing a homam in complete absence o=\r\nf ghee also.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Shastras are very flexible. Shastras say ghee mad=\r\ne of cow&#39;s milk is the best. Otherwise, ghee made of buffalo&#39;s milk is pref=\r\nerred. If not, ghee made of goat&#39;s milk is preferred. If not, sesame oil is=\r\n preferred. A long list is given. In the worst case, even mustard oil (whic=\r\nh is not a saattwik substance) is mentioned!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline is=\r\n that making even inferior offerings is better than making no offerings.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As for sesame seeds, they are not &quot;dry&quot; like some other material=\r\ns (wood, grains etc) and they contain plenty of sesame oil within them. Man=\r\ny scriptures actually praise sesame seeds.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;In any case, my friends, the physical\n materials you offer are *ex=\r\nternal symbols* or proxies and the real offering is made through mind.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;Suppose you give an exquisite gift to a friend, but with disintere=\r\nst and wrong attitude. Your friend may not like it. Suppose you give a humb=\r\nle gift, but with a lot of love and caring. Your friend may appreciate it. =\r\nGods will appreciate your love, devotion, sincerity and surrender more than=\r\n tons of ghee, sesame seeds etc.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As that surrender is weak wit=\r\nhin us, we are taking help from external fire and making use of it to reson=\r\nate with inner fire and develop inner surrender. So we need to make reasona=\r\nble external offerings to the external fire to keep it going and keep it *s=\r\naattwik*. So I will not say that you can throw anything. But, as long as yo=\r\nu offer basically saattwik materials and keep the fire going, you are all s=\r\net. Instead of getting too carried away with rules and technicalities, focu=\r\ns on your mental condition and\n feeling.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;Once I attended a homam conducted by a gentleman who is now the head=\r\n of a nice temple-cum-ashram. He announced before poornahuti &quot;this poornahu=\r\nti contains 64 auspicious and rare materials specially procured from India.=\r\n You are so lucky to witness this poornahuti. You may not get such an oppor=\r\ntunity again&quot;. THIS attitude of pride or feeling special is a &quot;dosha&quot; if yo=\r\nu ask me. Poornahuti is supposed to be &quot;complete surrender&quot; to deity and no=\r\nt an occasion to feel proud of what materials you are offering. If someone =\r\nelse offers just one copra or even a raisin (kismis or dried grape) and rea=\r\nlly feels the sense of surrender to the deity and meditates with focus, it =\r\nmay be a *far superior* poornaahuti.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;External also matters whe=\r\nn our minds are so deeply tied to it. But don&#39;t get overly caught in the ex=\r\nternal. Make the right\n tradeoffs - do just enough at the external level an=\r\nd focus most energy on the internal side. That is MY humble advice.&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The 10-to-1 ratio rule is not universally=\r\n followed by all.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one has enough time to meditate with a ma=\r\nntra for 10 hours for every 1 hour of homam with it, fine, go ahead and do =\r\nit.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the old days, people spent hours on spiritual sadhana e=\r\nveryday and were quite pure. Times have changed. If one has only 30-60 minu=\r\ntes everyday for spiritual sadhana, spending that time in front of fire is =\r\nthe optimum way to use it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one wants to paint a perfect pic=\r\nture on a special canvas to submit for an important event, one may want to =\r\nfirst practice on normal paper and paint it on the special canvas after bec=\r\noming proficient. If one does not have that much time, it may be better to =\r\njust draw an\n imperfect picture on the special canvas and submit it. Simila=\r\nrly, getting some practice with a mantra before offering it in the all-powe=\r\nrful Fire is a good idea. But, if one has limited time, one has to make wis=\r\ne tradeoffs.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One factor is that Fire amplifies results. If som=\r\neone who is basically quite pure makes offerings in Fire with a mantra that=\r\n he used in past lives, progress may come too quickly and it may be unnervi=\r\nng. With japam, things may happen slower.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;But that is unlikely=\r\n to happen to most people today anyway. Even if it does, it is debatable wh=\r\nether it is bad or good. My guess is that the 0.0001% to whom such a thing =\r\nhappens will figure out how to deal with it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As I always say, I am not a missionary. How many people do homam=\r\n and what rules they follow, do not concern me. I am just an enabler. I mer=\r\nely\n make some resources available. People are free to take it or leave it.=\r\n Also, people are free to follow any rules set by their gurus or elders or =\r\njust their inner voice. They need not pay heed to my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nIn the end, every soul has its path to traverse.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Happy Vijaya =\r\nDasami friends!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astr=\r\nology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;br&gt;----=\r\n----&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikanth&quot; =\r\n&lt;ashutosh.srikanth@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; My pranams to all.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than a year and half.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan so that it can be =\r\ndone as per shastra by others too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; I am using a conversation that i=\r\nn fact took place to bring out these relevant points.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Somet=\r\nime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am\n presentin=\r\ng below:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ash=\r\nTamangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called =\r\nas dosha.]&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... =\r\nHmm... let me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Ag=\r\nni karya at your home regularly.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actuall=\r\ny very surprised by this pointed question because I had not told anybody ab=\r\nout the havan I did at home)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: There are c=\r\nertain errors in the agni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry sam=\r\nith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to be right.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; My=\r\nself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor:=\r\n You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving it as =\r\nahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart =\r\nfrom that?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do\n required Japa befo=\r\nre giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use=\r\n for your regular japa?&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is =\r\nthere a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is sh=\r\natamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via meditation, one =\r\nbecomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. =\r\nfor every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualified to give =\r\n1 ahuti)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa (ba=\r\nsed on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is already f=\r\namiliar with that book series)&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; PrashNa conductor: No it app=\r\nlies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule=\r\n is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; The conversation went onto several other\n things. Subsequently I we=\r\nnt on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that man=\r\ntra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above m=\r\nentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress sin=\r\nce.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree wi=\r\nth me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody t=\r\no perform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;q=\r\nualification&quot; for the ahuti.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; Ashutosh&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---347748201-227504495-1351055881=:48469--\r\n\n"}}
