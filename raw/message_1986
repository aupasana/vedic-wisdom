In fact, gods can be invoked and worshipped in one&#39;s \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; breathing. Gods can be worshipped without any external invocation also,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as they have an indwelling presence always. However, external worshi=\r\np in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fire gives the best results and useful for progressing for most =\r\nsadhakas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the beginning.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kurukshetra is the land of Bhaga=\r\nvadGita and you are blessed to be from \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that sacred land. I and my gur=\r\nu spent a couple of days at Kurukshetra for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; shooting a documentary mo=\r\nvie on Krishna&#39;s historicity in May 2008. That \n&gt; &gt;&gt; whole region is filled=\r\n with some powerful and strange spiritual energy. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; We had a couple of =\r\nreally nice homams and meditation sessions in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kurukshetra. I loved th=\r\ne place.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Particularly, one Chandi homam we did in the night atop =\r\na small hill in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Kurukshetra (Karna ka teela) was very nice. An old yo=\r\ngi and his grandson \n&gt; &gt;&gt; lived there and did sadhana everyday. They belong=\r\ned to Naath pantha and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; were Gorakshaanaath (Gorakhnath) followers. Wh=\r\nen we were climbing the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; hill in the afternoon, Manish told me we prob=\r\nably had a rina there and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; might end up doing something there. When we=\r\n found these yogis, we talked \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to them for a while. Just when leaving,=\r\n Manish saw their havan kund where \n&gt; &gt;&gt; they do a havan everyday. Manish a=\r\nsked them it would be alright if we do \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Chandi homam in that havan kun=\r\nd that night. They welcomed us under the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; condition that we would not =\r\ncall any dark energies, as they were \n&gt; &gt;&gt; worshippers of Narayana. We told=\r\n them we would call Mahalakshmi in fire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and they consented. We went b=\r\nack later that night with all materials and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; did a Chandi homam. The p=\r\nlace had around 10 dogs. They were barking loud \n&gt; &gt;&gt; before, but they all =\r\ncame and sat around the homam once fire started. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Surprisingly, the do=\r\ngs just sat around the fire without any sounds or \n&gt; &gt;&gt; barking for a whole=\r\n 2 hours. It was Manish, I, that old naath panthaa \n&gt; &gt;&gt; yogi and a bunch o=\r\nf dogs that sat around the havan kund for 2 hours.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Until we invok=\r\ned the Mother, it was very silent except for our soft \n&gt; &gt;&gt; voices. But the=\r\n moment we invoked the Mother in fire, there were strange \n&gt; &gt;&gt; noises all =\r\naround us on the hill and in the valley. Suddenly, so many \n&gt; &gt;&gt; birds and =\r\nflies started making various noises. The effect of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; transitioning from=\r\n such silence to such an animated state all around us \n&gt; &gt;&gt; was quite stran=\r\nge and eerie. That animated state continued for a few \n&gt; &gt;&gt; minutes. Also, =\r\nwhen we offered bali at the end of homam, suddenly all the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; dogs got u=\r\np and started running together towards the southwestern \n&gt; &gt;&gt; direction whi=\r\nle jumping up now and then, as though they were chasing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; somebody.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; There was no electricity there. The ONLY light in the vicinity was h=\r\nomam \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fire. There were so many mosquitos all around us and biting us \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; continuously. We did not eat anything since noon and it was 10:30 pm w=\r\nhen \n&gt; &gt;&gt; we finished. Still, it was so nice. Like I said, there is somethi=\r\nng \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ethereal about the air of Kurukshetra.

Not so long \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pi=\r\ntri tarpana everyday, as a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; part of daily rituals. This is not without=\r\n reason.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           The th=\r\noughts of the minds around us do have a subtle impact on \n&gt; &gt;&gt; our mind. Wh=\r\nen too many depressed, sad or frustrated people are around \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you, it wi=\r\nll have a negative effect on you. Similarly, when some peaceful \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and b=\r\nlissful people or elevated souls are around you, it will have a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; posit=\r\nive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does have \n&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\nn impact on you.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           This is particularly true with respect=\r\n to the minds of people \n&gt; &gt;&gt; who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you=\r\n. When minds of such people \n&gt; &gt;&gt; are in great distress or great excitement=\r\n, it has an impact on your mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           If a deceased ancestor=\r\n to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some \n&gt; &gt;&gt; strong desires and unable t=\r\no progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his \n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts and desires wi=\r\nll have an impact on your mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Thus, we invest our men=\r\ntal energy praying for their relief. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; While offering balls of solid fo=\r\nod (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that the ancestor may get a=\r\nn appropriate body again to fulfil remaining \n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires. While leaving w=\r\nater in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires may be satisf=\r\nied and the ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; By praying for h=\r\nelping an ancestor, you are indirectly helping yourself, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; by removing =\r\na powerful negative influence on your mind and getting rid of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; some we=\r\naknesses.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of=\r\n pitri tarpana is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; out of fashion today. However, so many people will =\r\nbenefit tremendously \n&gt; &gt;&gt; if they do it atleast once every month if not da=\r\nily. Vimalananda says \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is onl=\r\ny one ritual he can \n&gt; &gt;&gt; perform.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used to perform =\r\na fire \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Rituals use exte=\r\nrnal \n&gt; &gt;&gt; symbols to induce internal changes. These two rituals are really=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; important and useful rituals.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           A small comparison=\r\n of homam and tarpana is reproduced from \n&gt; &gt;&gt; vedic-wisdom yahoogroup arch=\r\nives:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- -----\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           One w=\r\nord on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and the me=\r\ndium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medium \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is wa=\r\nter. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; wheth=\r\ner watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ho=\r\nroscope.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           In homam, devatas come in fire and burn your b=\r\nlocking karmas to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and fr=\r\nee you from vasanas \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically i=\r\nnherited from them. If \n&gt; &gt;&gt; you have genes from (and rina with) an ancesto=\r\nr who was lustful or angry \n&gt; &gt;&gt; or jealous and the consciousness of the de=\r\nceased ancestor is still having \n&gt; &gt;&gt; those thoughts, you will also suffer =\r\nfrom such thoughts due to the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; connection and may even commit some bad=\r\n karmas because of the weaknesses. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; You can free yourself from the rin=\r\na by working on giving a rebirth to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s =\r\nconsciousness is attached to a new body, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the thoughts and cravings of=\r\n that consciousness will not affect your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness in the same wa=\r\ny. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong \n&gt; &gt;&gt; source of bad karmas, while=\r\n homam burns off previously committed bad \n&gt; &gt;&gt; karmas. Both are very impor=\r\ntant sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Devatas are very =\r\nsubtle forms of consciousness. Their \n&gt; &gt;&gt; self-identification is to what i=\r\ns known as soul and represented by Sun. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; They work on your individual =\r\nsoul and free it from the karmas it carries. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Pitris are grosser forms=\r\n of consciousness with strong attachments and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires. Their self-ide=\r\nntification is with what is known as mind and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; represented by Moon. Yo=\r\nu may note that Sun and Moon are associated with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Devas and Pitris in =\r\nthe hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; natural media for=\r\n them respectively.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Devas and pitris have different way=\r\ns of working and influencing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; us and helping our spiritual progress. B=\r\nut both are relevant to all of us \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and have a role to play in our spir=\r\nitual evolution. Worshipping devas in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fire and satisfying pitris in w=\r\nater are very important.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- -----\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;           Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ \n&gt; &gt;&gt; tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.=\r\ncom/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro. home.comcast. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; net\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt;&gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           Sri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt;&gt; nath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           --=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------  \n&gt; &gt;&gt; -------=\r\n-- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           --- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com, Ramakrishnan=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; D=\r\near Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; Thanks for this valuable m=\r\nanual.

It is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; very detailed and =\r\npretty much anybody can follow it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; Those =\r\nwho regularly chant Vishnu sahasra naama stotram should \n&gt; &gt;&gt; be able to pe=\r\nrform a homam if they spend an extra 10 minutes, after a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; little pract=\r\nice. For those who are pressed for time and yet want to do a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam, a=\r\n super-short procedure involving one verse is also given.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; The manual is available in English language, with mantras =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; given in Sanskrit/Hindi, English, Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam script=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; In addition to this manual, manuals fo=\r\nr Mahaganapathi homam, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Chandi homam, Krishna homam, Shiva homam, Maha=\r\nlakshmi homam, Sani homam \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and Kuja homam are available. More will be =\r\ncoming later.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; Chanting Vishnu&#39;s 1000 name=\r\ns is very powerful in this age. It \n&gt; &gt;&gt; is the best antidote for many prob=\r\nlems, material and spiritual. Fire of a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; reasonable size augments the =\r\neffect. The philosophy of fire ritual is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; explained in the manual.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; This is a part of the effort to enable a com=\r\nmunity of \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhakas who worship various deities in fire, as per the co=\r\nmmand of the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; divine Mother to my spiritual master at Kalikambal templ=\r\ne in Chennai in \n&gt; &gt;&gt; March 2006.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;           &gt; Please =\r\ngo to the homam website below to download the manuals. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; It is hoped th=\r\nat spiritual sadhakas interested in homam will benefit from \n&gt; &gt;&gt; this and =\r\nalso help in increasing collective dharma in this world with \n&gt; &gt;&gt; their co=\r\nntribution.
