How I wish I had seen them =\r\nin the morning today. With Prabhu Ramakrishna&#39;s jayanti tithi running, toda=\r\ny is surely a blessed day for spiritual progress. Can the tarpana ritual be=\r\n performed in the evenings as well or does it have to be performed in the m=\r\nornings only? If yes, how late can it be performed? I normally return home =\r\nby 10 in the night. So, if possible, I would like to perform the tarpana to=\r\nnight and then perform my evening prayers and then have food. \n\nOne last cl=\r\narification, your last response to my query regarding black sesame seeds fo=\r\nr Pitris; so, one should put sesame seeds in the water already containing a=\r\nkshatas and give tarpana to Pitris with the water containing akshatas and s=\r\nesame seeds? Is that the correct understanding?\n\nBest regards,\nManish\n\n--- =\r\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNamaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.

It was 6 years \n&gt; back on the same lunar day that Manish and I=\r\n took sankalpa for a 7-day \n&gt; Shata Chandi homam in Chennai, where the seed=\r\n for homam movement was \n&gt; sowed.

However, I missed the A=\r\nmavasya day.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per the manual, this tarpana can be performed on an=\r\ny day, any \n&gt; week, any fortnight, and every month but there are some speci=\r\nal days as \n&gt; well. Is it fine to start from the coming Saturday/Sunday and=\r\n then \n&gt; perform it every fortnight?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In the manual, after the Rishi=\r\n tarpana section, one moves to Divya \n&gt; Manushya tarpana. Here, one is supp=\r\nosed to use the same water pot \n&gt; containing the akshatas as in the earlier=\r\n Rishi tarpana section?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. After the Divya Manushya tarpana, one moves=\r\n to the Divya Pitri and \n&gt; Pitri sections. Here, one is supposed to put som=\r\ne black sesame seeds to \n&gt; the water in the pot. Does this mean that one ad=\r\nds the black sesame \n&gt; seeds to the water already containing the akshatas i=\r\nn the water pot? So, \n&gt; one gives tarpana to Divya Pitris and Pitris with w=\r\nater containing \n&gt; akshatas and sesame seeds or water containing only sesam=\r\ne seeds?\n&gt; \n&gt; I eagerly await your replies to the above questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tha=\r\nnks and best regards,\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt;   &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n"}}
