Poor student! Not easy, the spirtual life.\n\nOn the topic of sleep, I tho=\r\nught I would try to practice the first of Swami Sivananada&#39;s 20 spiritual i=\r\nnstructions (which he says leads to liberation) on Sunday. i.e. wake up at =\r\n4 am, Brahmamuhurta (the idea being to meditate of course). I usually wake =\r\nat 6:30. My plan was to cut down sleep to 6 hours in the new year (I normal=\r\nly sleep 7-8 hrs).\n\nIt was a bit over ambitious, and I ended up with a migr=\r\naine that lasted 2 days (am prone to these, especially when sleep is poor).=\r\n Needless to say, meditation/japa was impossible, and my good intentions ba=\r\nckfired badly. \n\nSo I agree that one ought not oversleep. But one should ta=\r\nke great care while cutting down...basically do it gradually.\n\nMy policy is=\r\n now to get to bed early i.e. around 10 pm, so I naturally wake up at 4 am =\r\nfeeling fresh. I notice I wake early without needing an alarm when I go to =\r\nbed by 10. I tend to need about 7 hours sleep though.\n\nCelibacy is an inter=\r\nesting one. Especially, if you&#39;re into it and your other half isn&#39;t. Of cou=\r\nrse it isn&#39;t fair to impose celibacy on others so sexual restraint rather t=\r\nhan complete celibacy may be the best that some of us can aim for. \n\nAparna=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot;  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Story con=\r\ntinues from here\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/8597\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; And why waste time reading this without chanting any name of the lord.=\r\n\n&gt; Govind bolo hari gopal bolo/ om namah shivay/ Ram\n&gt; \n&gt; You can die any m=\r\noment, why not make use of time?\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------&#92;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Student : You know I have read a lot, comprehended a lot, I think I have=\r\n\n&gt; understood a lot, but yet I feel lost.

And you\n&gt; start walking towards it, and mind you walking=\r\n is hard, because you are\n&gt; bound by tight huge rubber bands from the back =\r\nof the airplane.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Okay.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : And off you go towards=\r\n the cockpit, and as soon as you walk\n&gt; like 20 steps, you encounter an ope=\r\nn exit, the one on the side. What\n&gt; will happen?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I will be s=\r\nucked out of the plane, due to the immense air\n&gt; pressure of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teach=\r\ner : And to add to that, you will re spawn at the back of the\n&gt; plane, and =\r\nyou are back to square one. Mind you even those 20 steps are\n&gt; hellishly di=\r\nfficult.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : And then start all over again?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Yep.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : no progress till the door closes?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Nope, every=\r\n time you will be sucked out, why waste all the\n&gt; effort? If you don&#39;t feel=\r\n like closing the door , why not make love with\n&gt; an air hostess and join t=\r\nhe mile high club?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : oho!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : The back of the plan=\r\ne is akin to your widely read mooldhara,\n&gt; and the cockpit is akin to your =\r\nmuch publicized sahasrara, the exit on\n&gt; the side is your gentile thus you =\r\nhave a choice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : What that might=A0 be?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Its you=\r\nr either your cock or the cockpit. LOL\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : You dirty old man.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Teacher : Gande video tum dekho, dirty old man main banoon, kya insaaf\n&gt;=\r\n hai.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : What are all those rubber bands for in that analogy?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Teacher : Your attachments, your conditioning, vaasnas, habits, etc.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Student : And since they are pulling me back, their akin to rubber\n&gt; ban=\r\nds.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Now you realized that? What a dodo.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student: So clo=\r\nsing the air door is important.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Yes, and top it off there wi=\r\nll be many times, when you are not\n&gt; processing straight to the cockpit, th=\r\ne forces format he back will be so\n&gt; strong, that you will be handgun not h=\r\ne economy class seats. And if you\n&gt; add an open exit to all these forces, w=\r\nhat will happen?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I&#39;ll be landing on my face in the lavatory.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Precisely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Ouch.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Precisely x =\r\n2\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Got it, but what when I am married?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Holy cr=\r\nap!! You are 21, what is the need to think, I mean you\n&gt; could die like tom=\r\norrow , you are atleast 5 years from marriage, and it\n&gt; is also quite possi=\r\nble that=A0 you remain unmarried.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : WHAT??? No but i want to g=\r\net married.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : What, &quot;what&quot;? We&#39;ll cross that bridge when we ge=\r\nt to it,=A0\n&gt; but for any married person, celibacy is equivalent to stickin=\r\ng to one\n&gt; partner, physically as well as mentally and if your partner dema=\r\nnds sex,\n&gt; it is your duty to fulfill it. What good is a man who can&#39;t be o=\r\nf any\n&gt; sexual use to his own wife? You can remain completely celibate in a=\r\n\n&gt; marriage during the time that you need to stay celibate. And you are 21,=\r\n\n&gt; you should be worried about a lot more things than marriage.\n&gt; \n&gt; P.S. A=\r\nnd if you are into all this god shod business, it is not necessary\n&gt; that y=\r\nour spouse be also into this, and by denying them this basic right\n&gt; ( Sex =\r\nshex and all that jazz ), you might be inducing them to curse you\n&gt; and god=\r\n , thus creating more karma&#39;s.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Eeekss=85 Okay. Why sleep?\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Teacher : You understood celibacy?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher =\r\n: Yay!!

I dema=\r\nnd an explanation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : You already know it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : You t=\r\nell, i don&#39;t know anything\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : You just told me with that meat e=\r\nxplanation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So i keep pouring it int he digestive fire and o=\r\nh well=85=85.\n&gt; crap.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Precisely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : that implies=\r\n you are not offering it into the digestive fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : And now we=\r\n move on to matters of serious contemplation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : You haven&#39;t an=\r\nswered me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Tell me about the first day the figure and fitnes=\r\ns gym.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : It was good, but days after it were hell.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teache=\r\nr : felt like a bulldozer rolled over you?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Pretty much, my m=\r\nuscles were hurting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : And how long did it take you to actuall=\r\ny build some visible\n&gt; muscle?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : a good 8 months, with gym 4 t=\r\no 5 days a week that too for 1 to\n&gt; two hours.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Same case wit=\r\nh god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : How?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : What was the dumbbell size you st=\r\narted out with?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : 4 kgs\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : And today?\n&gt; \n&gt; Student=\r\n : 15 kgs seems light.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Same case here, the more you practice=\r\n/perform , the better you\n&gt; will get. With god, no visible muscles will be =\r\nthere, and nobody will\n&gt; appreciate except the people who are much stronger=\r\n than you, but this\n&gt; desire to get recognized should also go away the more=\r\n you progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So this is like a gym?\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : yes, re=\r\npetition of a mantra is akin to reps in a set, the more\n&gt; you do, the close=\r\nr you are. Lets say a text like durga saptashati, which\n&gt; you have never re=\r\nad, you start reading, you will make a 1000 errors, but\n&gt; if you actually s=\r\ntart rectifying a couple of errors by marking the words\n&gt; down and making a=\r\nn effort to correct, after some time you will be able\n&gt; to recite it perfec=\r\ntly. lets you make 1000 errors, and lets you recite\n&gt; it 1000 times, each t=\r\nime focusing on 5 words, in 500 recitations I think\n&gt; you will be much bett=\r\ner than off than you started.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : So it is all effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teac=\r\nher : Knowledge without effort and without love is actually poison,\n&gt; and u=\r\nseless. Don&#39;t be scared of errors and take it as an excuse to run\n&gt; away an=\r\nd not do anything at all. You have to start out with a 4kg\n&gt; dumbbell only,=\r\ndon&#39;t compete with any one else or feel embarrassed that\n&gt; they can pick up=\r\n 20 kg ones and you can&#39;t. They must have given at least\n&gt; 2 years of regul=\r\nar EFFORT to be where they are.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Correct. Actually this gym e=\r\nxample makes it quite clear to me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Good. And don&#39;t you ever =\r\ndare to forget, what you are in this\n&gt; for and why you started out, to elim=\r\ninate yourself and only for god and\n&gt; god alone. no special hocus pocus pow=\r\ners, no siddhi, no showing off your\n&gt; knowledge crap, no progress no nothin=\r\ng, only god. The more homams, the\n&gt; more tarpans, the more chanting , you w=\r\nill do, the more time you will\n&gt; spend there, the better you will get. its =\r\npretty simple. But in the\n&gt; beginning errors will be there, ask for forgive=\r\nness and move on. If you\n&gt; try to pick up a 20 kg dumbbell in the beginning=\r\n obviously your hand\n&gt; will break.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Just like my back used to=\r\n ache severely even after 20 minutes\n&gt; of siting straight, but now it is mu=\r\nch better, i can sit still for\n&gt; around 2 hours without it ruining my attem=\r\npt at chanting.\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : And never ever think you are not going to fa=\r\nil. You wont be\n&gt; able to keep your celibacy straightaway, but lets say sta=\r\nrt out with 10\n&gt; days, then progressively increase it. You will fall down, =\r\nbut do get up,\n&gt; for the sake of god, get back up and start all over again.=\r\n Same with\n&gt; sleep, same with food. Inch by inch move towards the target an=\r\nd you will\n&gt; get there, nature&#39;s eternal promise. The more you will work ou=\r\nt in\n&gt; spiritual terms, the more you spiritual muscles will grow. and the\n&gt;=\r\n better you will look ;) the guys who are already good at the stuff,\n&gt; plea=\r\nse consider how much time and effort and has gone into their\n&gt; practice. An=\r\nd please stick to one thing, or one form , or method, excel\n&gt; at it, stop b=\r\neing a prostitute and develop a relationship with a form to\n&gt; go closer wit=\r\nh him/ her it. No 3 or 4 mantras, only one at a time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student : Practi=\r\nce and more practice it is then, but still I can have\n&gt; one drink, no?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Teacher : Till I don&#39;t allow, nope. But here is one for now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Student =\r\n:\n&gt; aapke waaste gunaah sahi\n&gt; hum piye to saab banti hai\n&gt; sau ( 100 ) gam=\r\non ko nichodne ke baad\n&gt; ek katra sharab banti hai\n&gt; \n&gt; Teacher : Oh teri b=\r\nhen ki, kya baat hai, I bow down to god, without whom\n&gt; those lines are imp=\r\nossible to come out. LOL , now give me back my glass,\n&gt; and go do homam. Go=\r\n.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
