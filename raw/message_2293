Is it y=\r\nour concern that today there are no Brahmins who live up to these stringent=\r\n rules?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Also, what is in your opinion about who is a Brahmin? is it=\r\n someone who took Birth in a caste called &quot;Brahmins&quot; and is your concern is=\r\n about them? \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I see some points to be good and some are non sense..=\r\ni know that these are not the lines written buy you but still..and also som=\r\ne of practises were dispelled long back from the society consdiering them a=\r\ns social evils ..so are you trying to re-establish them ? (say for example:=\r\n &quot;If a=A0 Brahmana disassociates himself from=A0 lower caste people and ass=\r\nociates only with higher caste people, he attains greatness.&quot;) \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; No =\r\noffense meant.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n\n\n"}}
