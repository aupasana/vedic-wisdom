Thanks for explaining.=C2=A0\n\nAs Narasimha mentioned, moksha a=\r\nnd bandha are irrevocably linked. The &#39;status&#39; of the world is right in the=\r\n middle of the two. We are all looking at this from different points of vie=\r\nw, based on our own conditioning.\n\nI can&#39;t pull myself out of the dream ana=\r\nlogy. All of us dream. We are creators of the dream world, and it is our co=\r\nnsciousness alone that forms the material for the dream world. Once created=\r\n, a portion of ourselves gets projected into the dream world, and we become=\r\n subject to our own maya. We interact with so many other created beings, an=\r\nd interact based on the rules of this dream world. Inside the dream world, =\r\nfor the duration of it&#39;s existence, everything appears true.=C2=A0\n\nThe wor=\r\nld that is created is based on the thoughts that went through our mind at t=\r\nhe moment we fell into deep sleep. At some point, once we have experienced =\r\nenough, we naturally wake up. We spend some time in the &quot;real world&quot;, and t=\r\nhen the cycle repeats.\n\nOur experiences inside our created dream world have=\r\n an impact on us when we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams=\r\n and reflect on them. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking st=\r\nate to some extent, and then back into the next dream experience.\n\nBy looki=\r\nng at every question from three points of time, we get three different answ=\r\ners.=C2=A0The dream world is real for it&#39;s duration, unreal between cycles =\r\nand is conditionally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is interactin=\r\ng with the world with no attachment from inside the world; realizing the ab=\r\nsolute unreality of the world from outside; and is both of these when looki=\r\nng across cycles.\n\nFrom all points of view, the thinning of the accumulated=\r\n conditioning (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key.\n\nsasneham,\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0a=\r\njit\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Jul 30, 2012 at 12:04 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dear Ajit,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;Even if the play goes on=\r\n, \ndifferent actors may play the part.&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Interesting. This did not cros=\r\ns my mind.

Or perhaps something \ndifferent altogether?&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I believe th=\r\nat &quot;Maya&quot; means a sort of limited perception due lack of complete informati=\r\non. It exists not just in the physical universe, but even in other non-phys=\r\nical states, though the degree maybe different. Is the average waking consc=\r\niousness real? Yes. Are higher/different states of awareness real? Yes. \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;Everything, from the physical world to non-physical realms exist and is an=\r\n extension of the Supreme. Maya is nothing more than whatever obstructs an =\r\nindividual&#39;s mind from realizing that inherent unity. From an individual (h=\r\numan entity) perspective, the point of maximum stillness is the Purusha, wh=\r\nat is called atmah/soul, and everything else, from points of lesser stillne=\r\nss to the external objective reality is Shakti. Extending this principle to=\r\n the Universe, the purely transcendental non-changing, non-negotiable reali=\r\nty can be called the &quot;atmah&quot; while everything else, semi-transcendental to =\r\nthe objective\n reality all around is Shakti. Thus in short, using scriptura=\r\nl terms, Nirguna Brahman is the state of mind of God, while the Universe(s)=\r\n/various realm(s) is the body of God. Both are irrevocable linked for all p=\r\nractical purposes.=C2=A0 Maya is whatever inhibits an individual cell (a hu=\r\nman being or animal or plant or anything) in the body of the God - that is =\r\nUniverse(s) - from realizing the greater picture. \n&gt;\n&gt;Am I making sense? -:=\r\n)\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabu=\r\nddhayah |\n&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_______=\r\n_________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Monday, 30 July 2012 5:50 PM\n&gt;Sub=\r\nject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Moksha\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When=\r\never a ring falls here,=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; a Hanumana follows it and we know=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n it is time for a Rama to leave his body.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Even if the play goe=\r\ns on, different actors may play the part.

No wonder such unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendo=\r\nus effort to change our own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inher=\r\nent biases and prejudices. That is what the=C2=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my =\r\nview. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally l=\r\nove everything. The greater number of entities one can love unconditionally=\r\n, that much little bit closer one can come to interacting with the truly in=\r\nfinite. And those few rare human beings who can love a whole universe uncon=\r\nditionally, are possibly the closest to this supreme and unknowable\n force.=\r\n In common language, we call them Rishis. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I like all forms of Deities=\r\n, for I find something beautiful in everyone of them. And I also like the O=\r\nne behind forms, which is so perfectly transcendental that it cannot be com=\r\nprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or =\r\nthe gap between the two breaths, or the millionth part of a single hair, or=\r\n the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well of stillness in the mind=\r\n at certain points in meditation. The only thing that stops me from getting=\r\n a better understanding the grandeur of=C2=A0 this formless entity are the =\r\nlimitations of my own mind and body, that I have acquired over millions of =\r\nbirths. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mind, to be bett=\r\ner able to appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I do not=\r\n believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the Universe itself gets=\r\n born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come back at every cycle, =\r\nwho am I to demand that I should not get born? Infact, when a person prover=\r\nbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to another plane in this=\r\n Universe and stay there for eons of time, since time anyway moves very, ve=\r\nry slowly in different realms. But then, if this force so wants, it can sen=\r\nd back any of the souls from any of the realms to any of the other realms t=\r\no serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in a certain higher realm a=\r\nnd in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the karmas - which never r=\r\neally die off - are=C2=A0 watered again by the environment of birth and the=\r\ny sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond one cycle of creation. =\r\nElse why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same enemies that they had =\r\nbeen fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata says\n so. I believ=\r\ne it. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;What then is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc?=\r\n I don&#39;t know. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequen=\r\ntially lessen our attachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundan=\r\ne problems. This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local mel=\r\nas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detached and enj=\r\noy the show! \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Best of luck and take good care of yourself! \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;-Regards \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAm=\r\nabuddhayah | \n&gt;&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n___________________________________\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihar=\r\ni@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;=C2=A0 &lt;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Saturday, 28 July 2012 7:30 PM \n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi Bhai, \n&gt;&gt;How are you? You have to complete the =\r\nstory. you have to tell what happened when X went to meet this man in templ=\r\ne.or anything else which happened. It is like somebody gone in kitchen to g=\r\net rest of meal and not come back. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;First I have to thank you for w=\r\nriting that story about Divine Mother Sri Chinnmastaji. I had developed a f=\r\near about Her but 3 times I got spiritual indications over the period of 2 =\r\nmonths that I should write my story. When you wrote back suddenly my fear a=\r\nbout Her melted away and I did immediate prayers to Her. Thanks. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;T=\r\nhe other thing is can I dare to say that I do not agree what is in this thr=\r\nead. Why does this so called spiritual man has to dump his failure on=C2=A0=\r\n religion. If people do not believe in religion or God or afterlife, it is =\r\ntheir problem. We are not all equal. We all do not come from same stock. We=\r\n are born with different conditions, go through different life experiences =\r\nand go where our fate or destiny takes us. This world is composed of 3 guna=\r\ns and there is always going to tension of different sort. Why=C2=A0 blame i=\r\nt on religion or God, why not on greed and desire to control others and lor=\r\nd over them using what ever mean. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;This story seems to like I used =\r\nto read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the story s=\r\no far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So =\r\nwhat?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;what does God me=\r\nan in this tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vrindavan or=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 Divine=C2=A0 Mother or=C2=A0 Self Realisation or Universal God or Je=\r\nwish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was a dhoni fire the=\r\nre? Or some other God ?? \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Sri Vrindavan has a rolling population. T=\r\nhey are not in confusion. Many people come there only for curiosity, many o=\r\nther come only for Darshan in the Temple and go back home happy. many other=\r\ns come with different desires. It is very wrong to expect from a person who=\r\n is in fifth grade to have knowledge of 15th grade. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Many times peo=\r\nple go to temple to pray and ask for certain things and if it does not happ=\r\nen they become very anti religion and anti God. So what?? It has nothing to=\r\n do with me or you or anybody else. It is their life. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I was very v=\r\nery very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many people were giving me lot of pain=\r\n.=C2=A0=C2=A0 I went=C2=A0 from Religious place to religious place, temple =\r\nto temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to worked. Then I took up rel=\r\nigious practise of doing mantra japa and other things which are in scriptur=\r\nes and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally religious discipline=\r\n according to our scriptures. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Do you drive a car? Did you pass you=\r\n exam first time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several exams to pa=\r\nss it. Many people pass their test first time and drive successfully. Does =\r\nit mean I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my failure??? .=\r\nMany people take up spiritual life and if they do not find success quickly =\r\nthey blame religion and God. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I also used to think that a real expe=\r\nrience of God would be very powerful thing. but there are other aspects to =\r\nit. If=C2=A0 someone is totally=C2=A0 dependent on Divine Mother and calls =\r\non Her day and night, but yet he is not ready for certain energy or his bod=\r\ny is not clean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mother would appe=\r\nar to him in very gentle way to comfort him and to console so that he remai=\r\nns on the path. She will appear right in front of him but he only sees the =\r\nGolden Aura and not what is middle of it because he is not yet ready. Whene=\r\nver I think of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and joy and wonderme=\r\nnt. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;You are a special person doing everyday intense haven to sprea=\r\nd the light.Many other people in this group are doing haven everyday to fil=\r\nl their life with light of Divine Beings. This is a complete religious meth=\r\nod which is also totally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed with p=\r\nseudo spiritual talk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alright in =\r\nyour everyday life because I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am ve=\r\nry wrong in=C2=A0 this. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Few days ago Olympic flame passed right ou=\r\ntside my road.I did not go out to see it. I kept holding to the Light which=\r\n comes out of Divine Mothers Feet hoping it will become permanent in my lif=\r\ne. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Good Luck and=C2=A0 Joy for you. \n&gt;&gt;LaxmiNarayan \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;___________________________________\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@=\r\nyahoo.co.in&gt; \n&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012, 11:04 \n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nTo those who=C2=A0 say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Dear Ajit, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I am in complete agreement with your thoughts.=\r\n=C2=A0 A spiritual man once said, &quot;Religion has been created to shield peop=\r\nle from God&quot;.=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;When I first heard this I was not convinced an=\r\nd thought it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally =\r\ntrue. Heavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect an=\r\n average person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and o=\r\nverwhelming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurrica=\r\nne in your average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans. \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 stay there for s=\r\nome=C2=A0 years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying th=\r\ne discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, come=\r\ns over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopp=\r\ned and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. The=\r\nn he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words =\r\nof God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talk=\r\ning of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So pl=\r\nease continue with your lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Every=\r\none became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, th=\r\ne man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and=\r\n started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looke=\r\nd at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in =\r\na\n while, but he has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too mu=\r\nch=C2=A0 ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt a=\r\nttracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As=\r\n he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X=\r\n in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X wa=\r\ns of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and mor=\r\ne over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was d=\r\nressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The man conti=\r\nnued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by p=\r\nrofession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since th=\r\nen.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? M=\r\nr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is so=\r\nurce of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ord=\r\ninary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all=C2=A0 the religio=\r\nus troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you hav=\r\ne so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadh=\r\nu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how i=\r\ns it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there=\r\n is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, me=\r\nrely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is no=\r\nt accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root\n of all this probl=\r\nem is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever=\r\n. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend.=\r\n At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with =\r\nsuper-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create=\r\n this form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire superna=\r\ntural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded=C2=A0 by others a=\r\ns a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the p=\r\nroblem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then str=\r\nessing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped=\r\n at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off t=\r\nhe chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly re=\r\nleasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a =\r\nyoung man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n confused by all these=\r\n show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a =\r\nlot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous y=\r\noung man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day havin=\r\ng nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly =\r\nrealized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spo=\r\nke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a=C2=A0 young girl =\r\ncame out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said t=\r\no X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrin=\r\ndavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if you j=\r\noin me. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bore=\r\nd and irritated. The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for the=\r\nir food while the young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down=\r\n on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, =\r\nhe abuses everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the h=\r\nospitality of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thoug=\r\nht crossed his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 s=\r\ntood up and with folded hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iye=\r\nngar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction t=\r\no the cot. He too turned round to see=C2=A0 what was going on. What he saw =\r\nmade his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar th=\r\nat was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his earl=\r\ny twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glo=\r\nw that lightened up\n the whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holdi=\r\nng lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a hum=\r\nan being any more but a god sitting in place of what was even five minutes =\r\nback only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;X did not know wha=\r\nt was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards him to stand up and =\r\ncome near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the cot =\r\nand the young man embraced him and X lost all consciousness. When he woke u=\r\np, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote location with trees and shrubs =\r\nall around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held his hand and took him inside th=\r\ne temple precincts.=C2=A0 There he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an o=\r\nld man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar=\r\n did not say a word, pointed out that meditating man to him and then took X=\r\n out of the temple. That is the man I was talking about, he said. You shoul=\r\nd meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an i=\r\ndea what God really means. After providing directions of how to reach that =\r\ndesolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again and immediately he felt he was l=\r\nosing awareness of place/time and lapsed into\n unconsciousness again. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;When X woke up, he was in the room in that house, lying on the floor=\r\n. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile=\r\n on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as directed. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Rega=\r\nrds \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mA=\r\nmabuddhayah | \n&gt;&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;___________________________________\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishna=\r\nn@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Monday, 23 July 2=\r\n012=C2=A0 8:13 AM \n&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they=\r\n don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 Dear Prasanth, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are =\r\nbeing more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in =\r\nGod look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and as=\r\nsumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion has=\r\n simply served to formalize these biases. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;While being mired in thi=\r\ns word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer can undo the =\r\nwhole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the day. And we lay th=\r\nis bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all the suffering in the =\r\nworld and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Ins=\r\ntead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of=\r\n fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us =\r\n&quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We l=\r\nook at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be =\r\nsuccessful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laug=\r\nhs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;For the most part, o=\r\nur bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti i=\r\ns particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in =\r\nworldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we =\r\nexpect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldl=\r\ny bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. W=\r\ne &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The best way to bring about new=\r\n waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert t=\r\nhem. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be hones=\r\nt with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served. =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If we see God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult t=\r\no define. It is difficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should=\r\n see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ =\r\nplace our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most =\r\nreligions ask us to accept them without question.

For some reason=\r\ns I had to spend nearly the whole day studying parts of Mahabharata and oth=\r\ner literature on Krishna - not exactly from a devotional perspective - but =\r\nrather for an objective understand of the man that was Krishna. And then I =\r\nrealized - actually it was like a epiphany, a sudden burst of clarity in\n t=\r\nhe mind - moksha is not about going to some other plane, or not taking rebi=\r\nrth (which too can happen), ETC. It is infact making our awareness free fro=\r\nm the chains which bind it, namely the 8 snares, and thus distort it. Had m=\r\noksha been something reserved for another world and another space and time,=\r\n then a being like Krishna would not have bothered to come down to earth an=\r\nd do the things He did, in the manner He did. What a Hero!

Thanks for explaining.&nbsp;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As Narasimha mentioned, moksha and bandha are irrevoc=\r\nably linked. The &#39;status&#39; of the world is right in the middle of the two. W=\r\ne are all looking at this from different points of view, based on our own c=\r\nonditioning.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can&#39;t pull myself out of the drea=\r\nm analogy. All of us dream. We are creators of the dream world, and it is o=\r\nur consciousness alone that forms the material for the dream world. Once cr=\r\neated, a portion of ourselves gets projected into the dream world, and we b=\r\necome subject to our own maya. We interact with so many other created being=\r\ns, and interact based on the rules of this dream world. Inside the dream wo=\r\nrld, for the duration of it&#39;s existence, everything appears true.&nbsp;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The world that is created is based on the thoughts =\r\nthat went through our mind at the moment we fell into deep sleep. At some p=\r\noint, once we have experienced enough, we naturally wake up. We spend some =\r\ntime in the &quot;real world&quot;, and then the cycle repeats.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our experiences inside our created dream world have an impact on us w=\r\nhen we wake up. From time to time, we remember our dreams and reflect on th=\r\nem. The experiences certainly carry on into our waking state to some extent=\r\n, and then back into the next dream experience.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nBy looking at every question from three points of time, we get three differ=\r\nent answers.&nbsp;The dream world is real for it&#39;s duration, unreal between=\r\n cycles and is conditionally real when looking across cycles. Freedom is in=\r\nteracting with the world with no attachment from inside the world; realizin=\r\ng the absolute unreality of the world from outside; and is both of these wh=\r\nen looking across cycles.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From all points of vie=\r\nw, the thinning of the accumulated conditioning (vAsanA-tAnavam) is the key=\r\n.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasneham,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n &nbsp;ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yiv776828023gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Mon, Jul 30, 2012 at 12:04 PM, rajarshi na=\r\nndy &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@=\r\nyahoo.co.in&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;rajar=\r\nshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;yiv77682802=\r\n3gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:1px #ccc solid;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:10pt;font-family:verdana, helveti=\r\nca, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Ajit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv7768280=\r\n23im&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;Even if the play goes on, \ndifferent actors m=\r\nay play the part.&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting. This did =\r\nnot cross my mind. Variety is the spice of life!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv776828023im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I\n am curious -- do you believe that the univer=\r\nse is maya (the way it it \ncommonly portrayed by advaitins), or do you beli=\r\neve that it is &quot;real&quot; \n(the way it is commonly portrayed by dvaitins)? Or p=\r\nerhaps something \ndifferent altogether?&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I believe that &quot;Ma=\r\nya&quot; means a sort of limited perception due lack of complete information. It=\r\n exists not just in the physical universe, but even in other non-physical s=\r\ntates, though the degree maybe different. Is the average waking consciousne=\r\nss real? Yes. Are higher/different states of awareness real? Yes. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Everything, from the physical world to non-physical realms exist and is an=\r\n extension of the Supreme. Maya is nothing more than whatever obstructs an =\r\nindividual&#39;s mind from realizing that inherent unity. From an individual (h=\r\numan entity) perspective, the point of maximum stillness is the Purusha, wh=\r\nat is called atmah/soul, and everything else, from points of lesser stillne=\r\nss to the external objective reality is Shakti. Extending this principle to=\r\n the Universe, the purely transcendental non-changing, non-negotiable reali=\r\nty can be called the &quot;atmah&quot; while everything else, semi-transcendental to =\r\nthe objective\n reality all around is Shakti. Thus in short, using scriptura=\r\nl terms, Nirguna Brahman is the state of mind of God, while the Universe(s)=\r\n/various realm(s) is the body of God. Both are irrevocable linked for all p=\r\nractical purposes.&nbsp; Maya is whatever inhibits an individual cell (a hu=\r\nman being or animal or plant or anything) in the body of the God - that is =\r\nUniverse(s) - from realizing the greater picture. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Am I making sen=\r\nse? -:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv776828023im&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv776828023MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimAp=\r\nannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt=\r\n;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New=\r\n Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam\n ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n\n &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n776828023im&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit K=\r\nrishnan &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:ajit.krishnan@...&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:ajit.krishnan@...&quot;&gt;ajit.krishnan@gma=\r\nil.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a=\r\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; Monday, 30 July 2012 5:50 PM&lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;S=\r\nubject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Moksha&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;yiv776828023h5&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&gt; Whenever a ring falls here,&nbsp;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size=\r\n:13px;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&gt; a Hanumana follows it and=\r\n we know&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sa=\r\nns-serif;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&gt; it is time f=\r\nor a Rama to leave his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even if the play goes on, different actors may play the p=\r\nart.

In this story, God means infinity. Now what is infinity? It canno=\r\nt be described, it cannot be named, it cannot be understood using the five =\r\nsense organs. Science does not understand infinity, art\n does not understan=\r\nd infinity, nothing or nobody&nbsp; understands infinity. It is a summation=\r\n of all that we know, all that we can&nbsp; imagine and all that is impossi=\r\nble for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that runs through ev=\r\nerything, from the most loveable to the most despicable , from the most hol=\r\ny to the most unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupidest piece of roc=\r\nk at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet in the farthest=\r\n solar system in the farthest universe. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00=\r\n0000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; =\r\nsize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Now =\r\nquestion is, can an average human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious and all perv=\r\nading force? Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one i=\r\nnteract with such a thing? One way is to consider\n everything, and I mean E=\r\nVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and t=\r\nhus learn to love the same unconditionally without expecting anything in re=\r\nturn. No wonder such unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous ef=\r\nfort to change our own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent b=\r\niases and prejudices. That is what the&nbsp; aim of sadhana is, in my view.=\r\n To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally love e=\r\nverything. The greater number of entities one can love unconditionally, tha=\r\nt much little bit closer one can come to interacting with the truly infinit=\r\ne. And those few rare human beings who can love a whole universe unconditio=\r\nnally, are possibly the closest to this supreme and unknowable force. In co=\r\nmmon language, we call them Rishis. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000=\r\n&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;I like all forms of\n Deities, for I f=\r\nind something beautiful in everyone of them. And I also like the One behind=\r\n forms, which is so perfectly transcendental that it cannot be comprehended=\r\n ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap b=\r\netween the two breaths, or the millionth part of a single hair, or the endl=\r\ness-ness of space, or the bottomless well of stillness in the mind at certa=\r\nin points in meditation. The only thing that stops me from getting a better=\r\n understanding the grandeur of&nbsp; this formless entity are the limitatio=\r\nns of my own mind and body, that I have acquired over millions of births. T=\r\nhat is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able t=\r\no appreciate this endless, nameless entity.

What =\r\nis Moksha? No rebirth? If the Universe itself gets born over and over and o=\r\nver, if Rama and Krshna come back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I=\r\n should not get born? Infact, when a person proverbially finishes off his/h=\r\ner karmas, they merely go to another plane in this Universe and stay there =\r\nfor eons of time, since time anyway moves very, very slowly in different re=\r\nalms. But then, if this force so wants, it can send back any of the souls f=\r\nrom any of the realms to any of the other realms to serve a certain functio=\r\nn. And if a soul stays in a certain higher realm and in forced to take rebi=\r\nrth again, the seeds of the karmas - which never really die off - are&nbsp;=\r\n watered again by the environment of birth and they sprout into saplings. A=\r\nnd this may go even beyond one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and=\r\n Arjuna fight the very same enemies that they had been fighting in the past=\r\n cycle of creation? Mahabharata says so. I\n believe it. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font =\r\ncolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; si=\r\nze=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;What then is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc?
