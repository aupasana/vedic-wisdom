Whe=\r\nn \nbreathing air in,\n&gt; &gt; the diaphragm should move down and the stomach sho=\r\nuld protrude \nout freely.\n&gt; &gt; When breathing in, the diaphragm should move =\r\nup and the stomach \nshould be\n&gt; &gt; drawn in. For some people, artificial and=\r\n constrained breathing \nover many\n&gt; &gt; years changes this natural breathing.=\r\n Place the palms on the \nstomach and\n&gt; &gt; then breathe in and out a few time=\r\ns and see if your breathing is \ncorrect. \n&gt; &gt; If\n&gt; &gt; it is not, first it mu=\r\nst be corrected.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (1) I suggest anuloma-viloma praanaayaama.  Keep t=\r\nhe lengths of \npooraka\n&gt; &gt; (breathing in phase), kumbhaka (holding phase) a=\r\nnd rechaka \n(breathing out\n&gt; &gt; phase) about the same. Though other ratios a=\r\nre suggested by \nsome, this is\n&gt; &gt; the best.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2) In fact, in the be=\r\nginning, it is better to just omit \nkumbhaka. Just do\n&gt; &gt; Pooraka-Rechaka, =\r\nPooraka-Rechaka. When you are ready, kumbhaka \nwill\n&gt; &gt; automatically come =\r\nby itself! Artificially induced kumbhaka can \nbe bad. It\n&gt; &gt; should be natu=\r\nral.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) Use a mantra (any) as a measure of time. Repeat the mantra=\r\n \nduring each\n&gt; &gt; pooraka and rechaka. There is a big difference between a =\r\ndry \npraanaayaama\n&gt; &gt; without a mantra and one with a mantra. Savitru Gayat=\r\nri is a \ngood mantra \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; use, but, if it is too long, use something=\r\n smaller.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (4) Do the pranayama for 5 minutes before dhyana and then=\r\n do \ndhyana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (5) During dhyana, keep your back straight (no slouchi=\r\nng). Keep \nhead also \n&gt; &gt; up\n&gt; &gt; and straight. Close the eyes. There is a b=\r\nig difference between \nmeditating\n&gt; &gt; with open eyes and closed eyes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; (6) Try not to move during dhyana. If you cannot avoid physical \nmovemen=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; extended periods, atleast try small periods. For example, st=\r\nay \nabsolutely\n&gt; &gt; still for 10 minutes, then move a little if needed, and =\r\nthen \nstay still\n&gt; &gt; again and so on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (7) The goal of all spiritual=\r\n sadhana is to efface ego (I-ness) \nand return\n&gt; &gt; to the source. Whether o=\r\nne does dhyana or homa or pranayama or \nany other\n&gt; &gt; practice, it should s=\r\nomehow or the other efface the I-ness. The \npractices\n&gt; &gt; help one overcome=\r\n ego, while the ego is an obstacle in the \npractices and\n&gt; &gt; overcoming the=\r\n ego makes the practices more effective. Thus, \nthere is a\n&gt; &gt; chicken-and-=\r\negg kind of problem here. You have to somehow get \nstarted and\n&gt; &gt; the mome=\r\nntum slowly builds.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Especially in the beginning, use as many tools =\r\nas possible to \nreduce ego.\n&gt; &gt; Even if pranayama and dhyana are your chose=\r\nn path, other tools \ncan be\n&gt; &gt; integrated.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (8) Cultivate the think=\r\ning that everything in this world is a \nproperty of\n&gt; &gt; Shiva and you are j=\r\nust a caretaker. Just as a servant takes good \ncare of a\n&gt; &gt; king&#39;s propert=\r\nies without forming an attachment, we should take \ncare of\n&gt; &gt; things entru=\r\nsted to us by Shiva. Our relations, our body, our \nname, our\n&gt; &gt; fame, our =\r\nhealth, our near and dear - all are Shiva&#39;s property \nonly. We \n&gt; &gt; own\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n absolutely NOTHING. We are just His servants and temporary \ncaretakers. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Just\n&gt; &gt; as a servant who takes care of one room in one palace can later=\r\n \nbe moved \n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; another room in another palace, our duty may later c=\r\nhange to \nanother body,\n&gt; &gt; another name, another fame, another set of rela=\r\ntions etc. A \nservant takes\n&gt; &gt; excellent care of his king&#39;s properties, bu=\r\nt does not think of \nthose \n&gt; &gt; things\n&gt; &gt; as his and doesn&#39;t get attached.=\r\n We should also be that way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One may wonder what this has to do wit=\r\nh pranayama and dhyana. \nBut such\n&gt; &gt; detachment and control over mind does=\r\n help.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pranayama literally means &quot;disciplining/restraining the pran=\r\nas&quot;. \nPranas \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; not just breathing or air. Prana means the life f=\r\norce. It \nincludes the \n&gt; &gt; mind\n&gt; &gt; and movement of thought in it. We cont=\r\nrol breathing so that our \nthoughts \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; controlled. But again, if =\r\nthoughts are not restrained, breathing \nis not\n&gt; &gt; fully restrained. This i=\r\ns also a chicken and egg kind of issue. \nThus, \n&gt; &gt; having\n&gt; &gt; the correct =\r\nmental attitude, control over mind and restraint \nover the\n&gt; &gt; movement of =\r\nthoughts helps in a more effective praanaayaama.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thus, having the c=\r\norrect attitude and cutting down on unnecessary\n&gt; &gt; attachments IS very con=\r\nducive to an effective praanaayaama and \nan \n&gt; &gt; effective\n&gt; &gt; dhyaana.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Now I have to go.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Homam manual and a=\r\nudio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): =\r\nhttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;b_jamnadas&quot;=\r\n &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, =\r\nJuly 05, 2007 10:28 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [sivacharya] Dhyana and dharana\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Respected Group Members,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I was going though Kirana Aga=\r\nma and in one of the chapters, the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; benefits of dhyana/dharana and pran=\r\nayam are described. Pranayam \nis a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; techique that I have been trying to=\r\n practice for some time after\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suffering from indigestion for some year=\r\ns now. The second \nresason\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was that I wanted to attain a level of conc=\r\nentration in my \nmantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jap. There has been occassions (very seldom th=\r\nough) when I \nattain a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; level of concentration higher than what I would=\r\n attain noramlly \nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I very much like this feeling.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I would=\r\n like to put some discipline in my appraoch to practice \npf\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pranayam, =\r\nreading books which illustrates different methods \nmakes me\n&gt; &gt;&gt; very confu=\r\nsed about the approach that best fits me. If there is \nany\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shiv bhakt =\r\nin this group who has attained a level of \nproficiency or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; knows someon=\r\ne who has attained proficiency in dhyana and \npranayam, I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; would very m=\r\nuch appreciate some direction. Right now my approach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; lacks any specifi=\r\nc direction and I am getting frustated. In this\n&gt; &gt;&gt; life, after I don;t kn=\r\now how many previous rebirths, I have \nshown\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interest in pranayam. I w=\r\nould like to make progress in this \narea.
